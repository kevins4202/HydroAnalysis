21000,as spatial seabed soil variations are stochastic and considerable it is important to predict the changes in the dynamic behavior of offshore structures for safety particularly if the natural frequency of a structure is significantly changed by the soil variations resonance can cause structural failure hereafter this probability is referred to as failure probability although several models have been proposed they require a long computational time to predict failure probabilities to overcome this limitation this work proposes a fast method for estimating the failure probability first since a very large computation memory is required to construct a finite element model for stochastic soil block wise matrix calculations and a dynamic memory allocation technique were adopted second conventional models require a large number of soil samples to calculate the failure probability which results in heavy computations a newly developed fast monte carlo fmc method is 5 8 times faster than the conventional method with high accuracy 99 41 this method was applied to offshore wind turbines and successfully predicted various structural characteristics a noteworthy prediction is that slender and long foundation is more robust to stochastic soil variations than thick and short foundation the fmc method can be used for preliminary design of offshore structures keywords monte carlo method offshore wind turbine soil modulus spatial variation random field natural frequency failure probability 1 introduction the reliability of offshore wind turbines owt is affected by mechanical properties of soil according to previous studies mulders et al 2020 zhao et al 2007 meng et al 2011 the interface between onshore structure and soil was considered as a fixed boundary because various construction processes to enhance the bearing capacity are available on onshore lands mohamed et al 2018 however this assumption is not valid for the owts the installation process is limited in sea because of the severe environmental and weather conditions moreover the stiffness of offshore soil is relatively less than that of onshore soil byun et al 2013 inci et al 2003 this suggest that the dynamic characteristics of owts strongly depend on soil properties and the interaction between the soil and the foundation mechanical properties of soil vary over space with high complexity for several reasons first soil properties have non uniform spatial distributions because each soil layer exhibits different properties lesny and wiemann 2005 second the properties are affected by the interaction between the soil particles specifically the strength and shear modulus of the soil increase with the compressive force caused by the surrounding soil particles oh et al 2018 geist et al 2001 likitlersuang et al 2013 soil particles at a specific depth are compressed by the collective weight of the other soil particles located between the seabed and the given depth thus soils in deep regions exhibit a larger strength and modulus of elasticity than soils in shallow regions third various types of soils are spread over space with high uncertainties schneider et al 1999 varathungarajan et al 2009 wei et al 2010 the increase in the soil modulus with depth and the variations in the properties over soil layers have been characterized varathungarajan et al 2009 and considered in previous studies nam et al 2019 bisoi and haldar 2014 the most commonly used methods that account for the soil structure interaction are the virtual spring model and the finite element method fem the spring model lesny and wiemann 2005 2006 taflanidis et al 2013 ashour and norris 2000 dash et al 2008 focuses on the interaction between the soil and the pile by introducing various virtual springs distributed on the surface of the structure details on this spring model is provided in supplementary material moreover the stiffness of the springs is designed to nonlinearly vary with the displacement of the structure this nonlinear dynamic behavior of the soil structure interaction is modeled with the p y curve for the lateral interaction on the lateral surface t z curve for the horizontal interaction on the lateral surface and q z curve for the horizontal interaction on the bottom surface various functions such as fractional polynomials bisoi and haldar 2014 and hyperbolic tangent functions lesny and wiemann 2006 were adopted to develop these empirical nonlinear curves as owts are long and exposed to huge thrust forces along their horizontal directions virtual springs for the lateral interaction on the lateral surface dominantly support the dynamic loads the fem is also commonly used to characterize the interaction between the soil and the owt structures haldar and babu 2008 haldar and basu 2013 li et al 2017 charlton and rouainia 2017 lai et al 2019 this method considers the soil domain as continuum elements several constitutive models such as the linear elastic nonlinear elastic and elasto plastic models can be used for the fem ti et al 2009 the force acting on the soil structure interface can be accurately calculated using the fem moreover the stress distribution over the soil can be calculated which cannot be obtained by the virtual spring model the virtual spring model and fem exhibit different strengths first the virtual spring model is simple and has fewer degrees of freedom thus it requires a relatively short computation time however for each site to be studied a corresponding empirical equation should be derived while the motion of the structure can be obtained using the spring model the spatial distribution of the stress in the soil cannot be predicted further as the spring model is only applicable to two dimensional 2d model this model is primarily applied to pile type foundations bisoi and haldar 2014 taflanidis et al 2013 lesny and wiemann 2006 however the fem can be applied to 2d and three dimensional 3d models this flexibility enables the fem to calculate the responses of various types of substructures such as monopiles multipiles tripod suction caissons and jackets haldar and babu 2008 haldar and basu 2013 li et al 2017 charlton and rouainia 2017 lai et al 2019 in addition fem directly utilizes soil modulus which can be easily measured via in situ experiments such as the cone penetration test standard penetration test and velocity of shear wave therefore when the design of a substructure is complex the fem is more effective than the spring model to study the dynamic behavior of the substructure the p y curves created with random variables can be used to study the effects of uncertain soil stiffness on the dynamics of offshore monopile structures low et al 2001 used depth dependent p y curves to predict the pile head deflection and bending moment after constructing the model via a deterministic approach they applied normally distributed shear strength to the p y curves to consider stochastic soil variations over space andersen et al 2012 created a p y curve in which the soil strength is accounted for in the force displacement relationship they then used a strength profile that stochastically varies with depth subsequently they predicted the probability of the natural frequency nf of a monopile owt the uncertainty of soil can also be indirectly considered haldar et al 2018 used the correlation of strain and strength that corresponds to 50 of the maximum stress in the compression test then they used that specific strain value to model stochastic variations finally they predicted the probability distribution for the nf of owts installed with the monopile although this stochastic approach has an advantage that its application is simple it is primarily used for monopiles to account for the spatially varying soil properties in the fem a random field which is a group of random variables spread over space is required random fields for soil variations can be constructed using various methods 1 the moving average method generates random fields by calculating local average for the product of a weighting function and white noise christakos 2012 because this average which is the summation over space has to be conducted at all nodes in the interested domain it is computationally very expensive 2 the discrete fourier transform method can be applied using the power spectral density of the stochastic variation frenton 1994 however the transform is realized via the integration that has to be conducted at every node 3 the fast fourier transform can mitigate this computational issue lang and potthoff 2011 however random fields produced by this method have symmetric covariance which results in a substantial error this problem can be addressed by generating random fields that are twice the interested domain size however this requires additional computations 4 karhunen lo√®ve expansion helps build random fields with the random noise eigenvalues and eigen functions of covariance functions zheng and dai 2017 extensive computations might be required if the analytical solution for the eigenvalue problem is unavailable 5 the turning bands method generates 2d or 3d random fields by combining 1d random vectors frenton 1994 this method can rapidly construct random fields when a small number of 1d random vectors are applied however if the number of 1d random vectors is insufficient straight line patterns will appear in the resulting random fields which are unrealistic patterns several random vectors remove this unrealistic random field but increase computation time 6 the local average subdivision method divides the domain into several cells in several stages griffiths and fenton 2004 in each dividing stage the random variables for cells are determined by considering local average variance spatial correlation etc while this is a computationally efficient method undesirable grid patterns can be added in the random fields 7 the covariance matrix decomposition uses a covariance matrix to consider the correlation between the nodes in a 3d soil domain a lower triangular matrix of the covariance matrix is then calculated via cholesky decomposition deodatis 1996 because of its simplicity and accuracy this method is widely used to study the interaction between soil and various offshore structures the fem equipped with covariance matrix and random fields was used to study various types of substructures including monopile spudcan and suction caissons haldar and basu 2013 constructed 2d random fields for soil domain with log normal autocovariance functions they then calculated the maximum allowable lateral load in the presence of the stochastic soil their model predicted that the maximal value of the allowable load obtained with the stochastic soil is smaller than that obtained with the deterministic soil li et al 2017 studied the bearing capacity of a spudcan foundation embedded in a clayey seabed with spatially varying shear strength charlton and rouainia 2017 the vertical horizontal and rotational capacities are predicted to be reduced owing to the uncertainty of the clay a similar analysis was also conducted using skirted foundations charlton and rouainia 2017 in which the failure envelope of the foundations increased with the intensity of the uncertainty note that the covariance matrix decomposition used in these studies requires a very large computational memory which is the limitation of this method among the previously mentioned models and techniques this work adopted the fem and covariance matrix decomposition approaches the fem is selected over the virtual spring model because the spring model cannot be applied to complex structures such as suction caissons the covariance matrix decomposition is selected because it is accurate and is efficient in generating several samples in particular once the lower triangular matrix is obtained via the cholesky decomposition which might be computationally expensive several random fields can be generated rapidly a very simple multiplication of the lower triangular matrix and a random matrix composed of random variables rapidly produces several random fields simultaneously in addition to utilizing the previous methods this study also developed a computational framework to rapidly predict the failure probability first a block wise matrix calculation and dynamic memory allocation technique were applied to resolve the problem related to the lack of computational memory for the cholesky decomposition second the fmc developed in this study significantly reduces the computation time required to estimate the failure probability this reduction can be achieved because the fmc requires a very small number of soil samples to estimate the failure probability compared to the conventional monte carlo method the predictions can be effectively used in the optimal design of owt structures with the consideration of seabed the structure design procedure can be accomplished by coarse and fine optimization in the coarse optimization stage the substructure type and dimensions are determined such that the failure probability does not exceed a threshold value e g 0 01 while minimizing their sizes to reduce manufacturing and transportation costs because changes in structure size would be considerable in this stage the cost reduction is noticeable in the subsequent fine optimization stage the structure dimension can be slightly modified until the failure probability is less than a more demanding threshold value e g 0 0001 or 0 001 note that because this work focuses on the coarse optimization stage the methodologies proposed in this work has to be modified when the fine optimization is necessary 2 model and methods this section is composed of several subsections to effectively describe the computational framework used to estimate the failure probability section 2 1 explains the method for generating a random field to consider the stochastic variation of soil section 2 2 describes the dimensions and specifications for the owt structure and its substructure section 2 3 presents design criteria of owt to avoid structural failure due to mechanical resonance section 2 4 describes how the probability distribution of nf can be obtained with the classical monte carlo method this section also provides detailed descriptions on the failure probability section 2 5 introduces the newly developed fmc to address the limitation of the classical monte carlo method the validation of this new method is also included in section 2 5 2 1 stochastic soil domain the stochastic soil shear strength s x y z in 3d space can be described as 1 s x y z s m x y z Œ≤ r x y z where z is the coordinate representing the depth of the seabed x and y are coordinates perpendicular to z as shown in fig 1 s m is the mean shear strength and Œ≤ is a stochastic intensity factor that represents the strength of the fluctuation and can be computed as the autocovariance of the soil shear strength r is a random field constructed with random variables with zero mean and a standard deviation of one hereafter r is referred to as the normalized random field the mean shear strength s m is affected by static pressures acting on soil particles thus the effects of soil weight and structure weight on the soil strength were considered first soil particles are compressed by static stress induced by the weight of the surrounding soil particles because soil particles are compressed by other soil particles above them the mean shear strength s m linearly increases with depth this increase with depth is fully described in our previous study nam et al 2019 changes in shear strength by the weight of the structures were also considered by applying the vertical force corresponding to the weight on the suction caissons note that the buoyancy forces acting on the submerged parts were also considered when calculating the vertical compression due to structure the modulus of the soil is assumed to be proportional to its shear strength details on this shear strength model are also described in our previous work nam et al 2019 mechanical properties of the soil used in this work are provided in table 1 a linear elastic constitutive model is adopted for the soil domain because the natural frequency of the owt can be derived from linear stiffness prendergast et al 2015 arany et al 2015 the random field r can be constructed with various methods lower triangular matrix of covariance matrix moving average of white noise field inverse fourier transform approach and turning bands method this study used the lower triangular matrix of the covariance matrix because this approach is able to resolve computational issues with block wise matrix calculation suppose the interested soil domain is modeled with n grid points the normalized random field r can be generated as follows first the spatial correlation between points can be defined with normalized autocovariance function œÅ the used autocovariance function is introduced later second normalized covariance matrix c is constructed based on autocovariance function œÅ where the size of matrix c is n lower triangular matrix l is obtained by performing the cholesky decomposition on the covariance matrix as c ll t then random vector w with a size of n 1 is generated where each element of w is an independent random variable with zero mean and a variance of one finally random field r can be obtained as r l w note that the covariance c of the random field is related to the random field as e rr t c where e represents the elementwise ensemble average operation thus the random variables in random field r have spatial correlation defined in c to perform monte carlo simulation a large number of soil samples i e random fields are required thus a large number of different w were generated and the corresponding random fields were constructed then a large number of stochastic soil domains can be created and used with owt structures the procedure described above can be easily applied to soil domains if the size of the soil domain is small however if the volume of the soil domain is large this method suffers from intensive computation specifically if the size of soil domain increases by a factor of q along the x y and z directions the number of nodes n in the soil domain increases by a factor of q 3 then the number of elements in covariance matrix c increases from nto q 3 n q 3 n consequently if the soil domain increases by a factor of q the required memory for the computation increases by a factor of q 6 which is a tremendous number of nodes this computational issue can be alleviated by decomposing the covariance matrix into several blocks then the lower triangular matrix can be obtained by using block wise cholesky decomposition chen et al 2013 for example c can be decomposed into nine blocks as 2 c c 11 c 12 c 13 c 21 c 22 c 23 c 31 c 32 c 33 l l t l 11 o o l 21 l 22 o l 31 l 32 l 33 l 11 t l 21 t l 31 t o l 22 t l 32 t o o l 33 t where c i j and l i j are not scalars but matrices o is a matrix filled with zeros then blocks l i j can be obtained as 3 l i j f ch c i i p 1 i 1 l i p l i p t if i j c i j p 1 i 1 l p i l p j t l j j t 1 otherwise where f ch a is a function that returns a lower triangular matrix of the input matrix a with cholesky decomposition details on the block wise cholesky decomposition are provided in supplementary material note that the ability of the block wise matrix calculation to save memory during computation can be acquired by applying a dynamic memory allocation technique especially this technique is effective when generating large and stochastically varying soil domains for example when calculating l 21 all blocks are removed from the memory space of a computing device except c 21 and l 11 which are required to calculate l 21 likewise when calculating l 22 all blocks are removed from the memory space except c 22 and l 21 this block wise calculation combined with dynamic memory allocation effectively reduces the required memory space therefore the method can be used when limited memory is available the stochastic variation of soil can be characterized with the autocovariance function various autocovariance functions baker and calle 2006 were suggested in previous studies exponential distribution oscillatory exponential distribution gaussian distribution oscillatory gaussian distribution and bilinear distribution this work introduced the gaussian autocovariance function because it has been widely used to consider the stochastic variations of soil properties tamara and soubra 2013 vrouwenvelder and calle 2003 ronold 1990 the gaussian autocovariance function œÅ g is defined as 4 œÅ g Œ¥ x Œ¥ y Œ¥ z exp Œ¥ x c x 2 Œ¥ y c y 2 Œ¥ z c z 2 where Œ¥x Œ¥y and Œ¥z are the distances between two points along x y and z and c x c y and c z are the characteristic lengths of correlations along x y and z thus a large characteristic length leads to a long spatial correlation fig 1 shows examples of a normalized random field in a cylindrical soil domain with a diameter of 60 m and depth of 30 m 2 2 fem of offshore wind turbine and soil two different types of substructures were considered in this study monopile mp and tripod suction caissons tsc they are widely used substructures at intermediate sea depths oh et al 2018 rotor nacelle assembly rna was considered with a lumped mass i e 105 kg and defined moments of inertia i e 106 kg m2 for the yaw and pitch motions and 107 kg m2 for the roll motion the assembly was located at the top of the tower as shown in fig 2 the tower substructure and suction caissons are manufactured with steel thus they are considered as a linear elastic model with a density of 7850 kg m3 young s modulus of 210 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 27 effects of damping in the connections i e tower rotor blades nacelle and substructure on the dynamic behavior of owts can be considered with an equivalent damping the value of the damping ratio 1 3 measured in owts damgaard and andersen 2012 was used in this study moreover the model considers the dynamic characteristics of the owts when the wind speeds are not significant in this case it can be assumed that the substructure motion is very small therefore the separation and sliding motions in the soil foundation interface can be considered negligible hence a bonded interface was used for the soil foundation interface in addition the added mass effect caused by the structure fluid interaction was incorporated into the structures at the mean sea level note that this added mass considerably affects the dynamic characteristics of the owt such as natural frequencies and mode shapes moll et al 2010 specifically the natural frequencies of the soil owt system were obtained using the fem software comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa table 2 describes the dimensions of the tower and two substructures to capture the soil spatial variation the mesh size of the soil domain must be constrained by the characteristic length of correlations i e c x c y and c z to determine proper constraints natural frequency values were obtained with different constraints and were compared first constraint is that the mesh length must be less than half of the characteristic length the second constraint is that the mesh length must be less than quarter of the characteristic length the difference in the natural frequencies for these constraints is very small i e less than 10 4 hz thus the first constraint is sufficient to consider the soil spatial variation and was used in this study a 3d interpolation function in comsol multiphysics was used to consider the soil modulus spatial variation in the fem first 3d grid point locations in the soil domain were determined next modulus values on individual points were calculated using a 3d random field then a matrix composed of the grid point locations and the corresponding local modulus were constructed and imported to comsol multiphysics the individual mesh modulus in the fem can be determined by the 3d interpolation function provided in comsol 2 3 design criteria one of the most critical design criteria of owt is that the natural frequencies of the overall system i e blades nacelle tower substructures and soil should be different from the rotational frequency of the blades to avoid resonance this design criterion has been studied with deterministic models thus the natural frequencies and the corresponding vibration modes were predicted in the absence of stochastic variations the stochastic intensity Œ≤ was determined to be 0 note that the stochastic soil domain with nonzero Œ≤ is considered in the following sections a modal analysis shows that major mode shapes of owts with tsc are the first bending mode for side to side motion and the first bending mode for fore aft motion as shown in fig 3 a the nfs of these two modes are slightly different because the moment of inertia of rna corresponding to the roll motion are different from the moment of inertia corresponding to the pitch motion however the difference is very small because the tower substructure and foundation have axial symmetric shapes and properties the subsequent modes are second bending modes note that major modes of owts with mp are the same as those of tsc the thrust force generated by the rotation of blades is a dominant load to the structures of owts therefore it should be separated from the natural frequencies of the system the magnitude of the thrust force has peaks at 1p and 3p frequencies in which 1p is the rotating frequency of the blades and 3p is the 3 fold rotating frequency nam et al 2019 andersen et al 2012 oh et al 2013 the rotating speed of the blades for a 3 mw wind turbine varies in the range of 8 6 18 4 rpm nam et al 2019 which is the range used in this study thus the 1p range and 3p range depicted in fig 2 b are the major exciting frequency ranges of the owt the determination of the nf of the wind turbine structure is very important to the reliability of megawatt class wind turbines because their first and second natural frequencies are close to the exciting frequency ranges owing to scales of structure it is difficult to manufacture megawatt class wind turbines such that its first nf is larger than 3p thus the first and second nfs have to be smaller than the 3p range and larger than the 1p range as shown in fig 3 b specifically because the safety margin of 10 is mainly used fischer 2006 the first nf of owts has to be between 0 337 and 0 387 hz 2 4 estimation of failure probability with monte carlo method whereas certain nf values are obtained in a deterministic model the stochastic model provides the probability distribution of nf in addition the probability of nf to enter the 1p range or 3p range represents the dynamic resonance probability this resonance can dramatically increase the structure oscillating motion because oscillating motions can cause structure failure e g fatigue or extremely large stress the prevention of this resonance is one of the most important criteria for the design of wind turbine structures andersen et al 2012 k√ºhn 2003 hu et al 2015 thus this resonance probability is defined as the failure probability in this study this subsection describes 1 the probability distribution of nf 2 the failure probability calculated from a conventional monte carlo method and 3 a disadvantage of the conventional method because of the stochastic variation of soil modulus over space the owts have different nfs over the samples of the soil domain to consider the effects of this variation on the system tsc with the diameter of 5 m and height of 3 m are used other dimensions are determined as the values in table 2 stochastic intensity factor Œ≤ of the soil domain is determined as 30 kpa and its characteristic lengths are the same with c x c y c z 5 m other soil properties are provided in table 1 the bars in fig 4 a represents the probability p f n1 of the first nf and the bars in fig 4 b represents the probability p f n2 of the second nf interestingly the probability distribution of nf is asymmetric as shown in fig 4 this statistical feature can be explained with a simplified model composed of springs as depicted in fig 5 a in which the interactions between soil particles are regarded as a combination of vertical and horizontal springs suppose the spring constants are normally distributed random variables when the springs are connected in parallel the equivalent stiffness is simply the summation of the individual stiffnesses because of this linear relation the equivalent stiffness of the parallel connection also follows the normal distribution however the equivalent stiffness of serially connected springs can be obtained as k eq s 1 k 1 k 1 k 1 where k denotes the stiffness of the individual springs note that k eq s is nonlinearly related with k due to the nonlinear relation of k and k eq s the distribution of k eq s is not necessarily the normal distribution to check the distribution of k eq s monte carlo simulations were performed with 10 000 different k eq s as shown in fig 5 b this result verified that the stiffness of the serial connection follows a right skewed distribution because the nf of owt depends on this stiffness the probability of nf is also distributed with a right skewed shape if the nf exists in the 1p range or 3p range the owt structure can suffer from resonance note again that the nf is much less than the 3p range because of the scale and material properties of the owts as shown in fig 4 thus the probability that nf enters the 3p range is negligible the failure probability was obtained with the conventional monte carlo approach as follows first a large number of samples of the soil domain are generated and the owt structures are combined with the soil domains then the nf of each fem model is calculated next the failure probability can be obtained by counting the number of samples in which nf is less than the upper bound of the 1p range specifically 1000 different soil domains were used to conduct conventional monte carlo simulations the reliability of the probability value obtained by monte carlo simulation can be evaluated by the coefficient of variation which can be calculated as 1 p f p f n where p f is the estimated failure probability value this sample number i e n 1000 leads to a coefficient of variation of 6 14 if the failure probability is 0 05 0 2 note that the calculated failure probabilities are in this range for most cases in this work the various substructures and soil domains were studied as shown in table 3 note that the characteristic length of correlation used in this work is ranged from 2 to 20 m which are similar to values measured in previous works baker and calle 2006 the problem of the conventional monte carlo method is that a large number of samples are required to estimate the failure probability the error in the failure probability is likely to be large if the number of samples is small to confirm this problem a normalized error is defined as p f p f n p f where p f n is the failure probability obtained with n samples p f is the probability estimated with 1000 samples note that this number of samples provides 10 coefficient of variation when the failure probability is close to or larger than 0 1 the error in the probability becomes small when n is close to 1 000 as shown in fig 6 the tendency of p f over the sample number might be different if the failure probability is very small however it is worth noting again that this work focuses on the coarse optimization where the failure probability is close to or larger than 0 1 if fine optimization is needed additional calculations can be done with more samples the results suggested that very large number i e 1000 of samples are required thereby requiring a huge amount of calculations to be performed to obtain a reliable value of p f if the conventional monte carlo method is used to obtain the optimal design of substructures this large number of samples can be a critical hurdle because various dimensions for the substructure should be investigated in the design stage 2 5 new estimation method of failure probability to address this computational issue this study proposes a new method i e fmc which can calculate the failure probability with a small number of samples the fundamental idea is as follows a small number of samples are sufficient to obtain the standard deviation œÉ nf of nf thus if the value of p f can be estimated with œÉ nf then the number of samples for the estimation of p f will be considerably reduced the idea described above is based on the following hypothesis first the required number of samples to obtain œÉ nf is smaller than the number to directly obtain p f second œÉ nf is correlated with p f the first hypothesis is reasonable because the failure caused by stochastic variations in soil is a very rare event as depicted in fig 4 c generally a large number of samples are needed to accurately capture the probability of rare events in contrast the standard deviation is less related to the rare event it represents how widely the probability is distributed thus an accurate value of œÉ nf can be obtained with a small number of samples fig 6 shows that the first hypothesis is valid specifically the error of œÉ nf is very small when n is approximately 200 whereas the error of p f becomes small when a very large number 1 000 of samples are used therefore an accurate value of œÉ nf can be obtained with relatively small number of samples the second hypothesis on the correlation of œÉ nf and p f was also investigated as œÉ nf increases the probability of nf is distributed more widely over frequency then the probability that nf will enter the 1p range increases thereby increasing the failure probability specifically fig 7 shows a strong correlation between œÉ nf and p f this relation can be approximated with a straight line r 2 0 8811 as shown in fig 7 a however a linear function is not sufficiently accurate to describe the correlation thus an exponential function was introduced as 5 p f a 1 exp a 2 œÉ nf a 3 in addition if this equation produces a negative value p f is determined as zero if this equation produces a value larger than one p f is assumed to be one by using least squares fitting the values of a 1 a 2 and a 3 were obtained as 0 3576 197 2 and 0 1980 respectively fig 7 b shows that this exponential curve has a higher accuracy r 2 0 9782 than that of the linear regression based on the above analysis œÉ nf can be used to accurately estimate the failure probability with a small number of samples there is a tradeoff between the accuracy and the computation time in estimating œÉ nf if œÉ nf is calculated with a large number of samples the accuracy of this estimation is high however heavy computation is required to perform fem calculations corresponding to the large samples on the other hand if a small number of samples are used the calculation burden is not significant but the error in the estimated probability can be large to enhance the performance of the fmc it is very important to determine a proper sample size that not only guarantees accuracy of the estimation but also minimizes the number of samples i e minimizes the computation time to determine the optimal sample size a new procedure was introduced as follows suppose œÉ nf n is a standard deviation calculated with n samples when the value of œÉ nf n is close to its true value œÉ nf tends to fluctuate over n with small amplitudes the fluctuation of œÉ nf n and their convergence were calculated using the values within a sliding window the size of the window was defined as n wd and the windowed computations start from n n wd as shown in fig 8 a if the value of œÉnf n in the sliding window satisfies a specific criterion to be described later the current sample number n is considered to be sufficient to obtain a reliable standard deviation value then œÉnf n is substituted into eq 5 to obtain the failure probability if œÉnf violates the criterion more samples are needed thus n is increased and more nfs are obtained the procedure is repeated until œÉnf satisfies the criteria the flowchart of this procedure is shown in fig 9 the criterion for the sample size is determined by the local changes in œÉ nf the i th local change Œ¥ œÉ nf i can be defined as œÉ nf i 1 œÉ nf i then average a œÉ of the local change i e the average over the sliding window with the size of n wd is defined as 6 a œÉ 1 n wd i n n wd 1 n Œ¥ œÉ nf i again when œÉ nf n is close to its true value it tends to fluctuate with small amplitude the absolute value in eq 6 was adopted to capture this fluctuation if a œÉ is less than tolerance Œµ the number of samples is assumed to be sufficiently large the number of samples at this moment is referred to as n e then the failure probability was estimated with eq 5 and œÉ nf n e to improve the accuracy of the method with less computation the value of n wd and Œµ were obtained as follows first metrics to characterize the accuracy and computational effort were defined next the changes in the metrics over n wd and Œµ were predicted then the optimal values of n wd and Œµ can be obtained with the consideration of both accuracy and computation the accuracy of the method is characterized with the mean value of the error in the failure probability Œ¥ p f the error p f n 1000 p f n n e was obtained for cases 1 7 then Œ¥ p f was obtained by averaging the errors corresponding to the seven cases the computational effort can be measured by the mean value n e for the number of used samples which was calculated by averaging the values of n e corresponding to cases 1 7 the changes in accuracy i e Œ¥ p f and the computational effort i e n e over the parameters were calculated as shown in fig 8 b and c as the next step the optimal values of n wd and Œµ were carefully obtained to maximize the performance of the fmc first an allowable error value was determined then possible sets of n wd and Œµ were obtained such that Œ¥ p f was equal to or less than the allowable error the value of the allowable error was selected as 1 note that this 1 could cause considerable error in some cases e g cases 1 and 2 however as previously mentioned the main purpose of this work is to develop a fast model for coarse optimization where a 1 error can be tolerated among the possible sets of n wd and Œµ an optimal set can be selected where the corresponding sample number n e is minimized in the possible sets this approach provides the minimal sample numbers while guaranteeing that the probability error is less than the allowable error by using the above approach the optimal values of n wd and Œµ were calculated as 53 and 10 4 respectively the corresponding value of Œ¥ p f was obtained as 0 96 for cases 1 7 the failure probabilities calculated with the optimal n wd and Œµ are shown in fig 8 d the number of samples n e was determined by the local changes in œÉnf in each case thus the value of n e is different over the cases as provided in fig 8 d note that these numbers are very small compared to 1 000 which is the number of samples used to directly obtain p f without using œÉ nf this suggests that the proposed fmc is able to reduce computation time significantly the parameter values i e a 1 3 n w and Œµ of the proposed method were validated with various structure dimensions and soil domains these structures and soils used for the validation were not used when determining the parameter values the proposed method estimated the probability with a small error i e average of 0 59 for the validation cases i e case 8 16 however it is worth noting that the availability of the parameters is guaranteed under a criterion if œÉ n f of a case is between 3 10 3 and 1 6 10 2 the parameter values can provide an accurate p f otherwise the accuracy of this method can be lowered if p f needs to be estimated for a very small or very large œÉ n f new parameter values should be calculated again with a wider range of œÉ n f these cases are summarized in table 4 note that anisotropic characteristic lengths were also studied because the characteristic length along the horizontal direction is greater than that along the vertical direction at various sites li et al 2016 the values measured in previous studies are summarized in table 5 the results for this validation set are presented in fig 10 which shows the high performance of the fmc method considering accuracy and computation time regardless of the characteristic lengths and substructures the fmc estimated the probability with a small error i e average of 0 59 the conventional method typically requires approximately 1000 samples to predict accurate failure probabilities but the fmc requires only 172 56 samples on average from the validation set note that this fast estimation method was empirically established 3 results and discussion the effects of stochastic variation on soil domains and the effects of substructural design on the failure probability of owts were investigated with the fmc note that several cases can be studied because the fmc can predict the failure probability much faster than the conventional method for appropriate comparison between cases the first nfs in the absence of stochastic variations are determined to be the same i e 0 35 hz for all cases by adjusting the thickness of the main substructure which is t s c for tsc and t m p for mp the effects of soil domain were studied by changing the stochastic intensity Œ≤ and the characteristic length of correlation c x c y and c z first the failure probability increases with stochastic intensity Œ≤ as shown in fig 11 a this feature is predicted because large stochastic intensity results in large variations of nf which leads to large failure probability fig 11 b shows that the failure probability also increases with the characteristic length of correlation note that the characteristic lengths are determined to be the same along the x y and z direction thus they are represented with one parameter c this effect of the characteristic length is caused by the scale of the length compared to the size of the substructure fig 12 shows the normalized random field of the soil modulus around the suction caisson when the characteristic length is small as presented in fig 12 b the soil modulus is small in some regions near the suction caisson meanwhile in other regions in the vicinity the soil modulus is large thus the effects of the variations in the soil modulus in the substructure are likely to cancel out each other when the characteristic length is large this cancellation is not likely to take place as shown in fig 12 c in fig 12 c1 and c2 a low soil modulus can be observed at almost every point near the substructure thus the nf is also relatively low however if the soil modulus is large as shown in fig 12 c3 the nf becomes relatively small thus the variation of nf and the failure probability are considerable if the characteristic length is large the model also predicted that the failure probability of mp is larger than that of tsc for all cases as shown in fig 10 whereas mp interacts with the soil in one region tsc interacts with the soil in three different regions because it has three suction caissons consequently the interface of tsc and the soil is more widely spread over space than that of mp and the soil as a result the effects of the variations in the soil modulus are likely to be mitigated when tsc is used thus the probability of nf for tsc is less distributed over the frequency which leads to a smaller failure probability than that of mp the failure probability is also influenced by the dimensions of the substructures the diameter and height of the suction caissons fig 13 shows the various effects of substructure dimensions on the failure probability in the results the parameters of soil domains remains the same as follows Œ≤ is 30 kpa and the characteristic lengths of correlation are determined to be c x c y c z 5 m first p f decreases over the height of the suction caisson as shown in fig 13 a the diameter of the suction is 5 m for all cases presented in fig 12 a in addition the failure probability is negligible if the height is larger than 7 m second p f decreases over the diameter of the suction caissons as shown in fig 13 b the height of the suction is 5 m for all cases presented in fig 13 b the failure probability is negligible if the height is larger than 7 m the trends shown in fig 13 a and b simply suggest that large suction caissons are more robust to the uncertainty of the soil than the smaller caissons are to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of the suction diameter and height these two dimensions were varied under a restriction the surface area of the suction caisson remains constant i e œÄ d sc h sc œÄ d sc 2 4 82 46 m2 then as the diameter increases the height of the suction caisson has to decrease to satisfy the constraint the failure probability non monotonically changes over the diameter of the suction as shown in fig 13 c this change is caused by 1 the ratio of the suction size to the characteristic length of the correlation and 2 different values of the diameter and height to maintain the specified surface area first when the diameter of the suction caisson is very large or very small one of the parameters i e d sc or h sc is larger than the characteristic length of soil correlation specifically when d sc is smaller than 3 5 m the h sc is longer than 5 m which is the characteristic length of soil correlation used in this case thus the effects of the fluctuation of the soil modulus are likely to be cancelled out over the height of the suction caisson likewise when d sc is larger than 5 m the effects of the fluctuation of the soil modulus are likely to be cancelled out over the horizontal direction then the variations in the nf is reduced and thus p f is smaller than that of the other suction with intermediate diameter i e 3 5 d sc 5 5 m moreover a long and slender suction has smaller p f than a short and thick one when d sc is 3 m and h sc is 8 m p f is small as shown in fig 12 c the failure probability is small because its height is longer than the characteristic length of soil when d sc is 6 m and h sc is 2 875 m p f is also small the probability is small because its diameter is longer than the characteristic length however the height i e 8 m of the first suction is larger than the diameter 6 m of the second suction therefore the suction with a small diameter and long height has a smaller failure probability than the other suction with a large diameter and short height this case study provides valuable information that is very useful in designing suction caissons one can simply argue that large suction caissons are always better than small suction caissons based on the results in fig 13 a and b however the optimization of the dimensions is more complicated because the cost and manufacturing factors needs to be considered together with failure probability for optimal design various design strategies can be constructed depending on manufacturing circumstances scenario 1 suppose the diameter of the suction caisson is determined as a specific length because of some restriction in manufacturing processes for example if the diameter is 5 m its optimal height is 7 m fig 13 a shows that the failure probability is negligible when h sc 7 m if the height is longer than 7 m the cost for manufacturing and installation will increase thus the length 7 m is the optimal height considering its small failure probability and the cost for material and installation scenario 2 suppose the height of the suction caisson should be 5 m under some manufacturing restrictions based on the results in fig 13 b the length 7 m is the optimal diameter for the same reason described in scenario 1 scenario 3 there is no restriction in the manufacturing process instead the cost for manufacturing is determined as a specific value the cost for manufacturing and installation is proportional to the size of the suction caissons because of the cup like shape of the suction caisson it can be assumed that the cost of suction caisson depends on its surface area thus the suction caisson needs to be designed such that its surface area has to be less than a specific value to satisfy the constraint of cost results presented in fig 13 c suggests that the long suction caisson with small diameter is preferable to the short caisson with large diameter when the characteristic length of soil is isotropic to maximize the reliability of suction caissons one needs to increase the length of the suction caisson as much as possible this increase in the length results in a reduction of its diameter to comply with the constraint in the surface area the limit of this reduction can be determined by the minimal diameter to satisfy other criteria such as installation capability and transportation efficiency 4 conclusion the stochastic nature of seabed soil is critical to the dynamic reliability of owts particularly changes in the nf due to a spatially fluctuating modulus can lead to significant vibration of the structure however these phenomena have not yet been fully understood because intensive computation is required to overcome this limitation this study proposed a new method capable of providing reliable results and alleviating computational effort this method is very useful especially when the owts installed contain complex substructures when the volume of the stochastic soil domain is large a very large number of nodes have to be considered this requires huge memory allocation and heavy matrix calculation in this study these challenges were resolved by introducing block wise matrix calculation and dynamic memory allocation specifically the covariance matrix was obtained by blocks and stored then cholesky decomposition was performed by block note that the number of blocks simultaneously allocated in the memory is very small thus this method is able to generate stochastic soil domains composed of a huge number of nodes with relatively small memory in this study the failure that can occur when the system nf exists in the exciting frequency range was investigated first a conventional monte carlo approach was applied to obtain this failure probability however this method requires a large number of samples thus the corresponding fem calculation is also heavy therefore the fmc was developed that indirectly estimates the probability using the standard deviation of the nf our model showed that the standard deviation is strongly correlated with the failure probability in addition the value of the standard deviation is sufficiently accurate even when a small number of samples are used therefore this fmc is able to provide reliable estimation of the failure probability with a small number of samples consequently the success of this proposed method makes it very useful in designing substructures of owts in areas that show considerable variations in soil properties such as exhibited at several offshore sites schneider et al 1999 varathungarajan et al 2009 wei et al 2010 baket and calle 2006 the reliability of owts is determined by the stochastic nature of the soil and size of the substructure the case study showed that owts are robust to the stochastic variation of soil when the size of the substructure is large however the size of the substructure is constrained by the cost of manufacturing transportation and installation thus to minimize cost the size of the substructure has to be optimized by considering the stochastic intensity and characteristic length of soil in a candidate site the cost of a substructure can be reduced more by adjusting the ratio of the dimensions e g ratio of the height to the diameter of the suction caisson it can be argued that the reliability of tsc can be simply determined by the surface area of the suction caisson however this study showed that this argument is incomplete even when the surface area remains the same the failure probability can change over the ratio of the height to the diameter of the suction caisson the results also suggest that the optimal ratio can be affected by the characteristic length of the soil variation other design variables regarded as constants in this study need to be considered in future study to obtain more robust substructures number of suction caissons or number of piles distance between suction caissons thickness of the main foundation and nonstationary variations of soil modulus to conduct an optimization procedure with these variables deliberate estimations of the cost of owt are also needed which are out of the scope of this study however the model developed here can perform those studies because of the significant reduction in computational effort achieved by the model the proposed method to estimate the failure probability can be applied to different fields the conventional monte carlo method which calculates the probability directly from a large number of samples has been widely used in various complex systems however when the probability of a rare event needs to be considered a very large number of samples and their corresponding computation effort will be a bottleneck for effective prediction to overcome this problem a statistical variable which is strongly correlated to the probability can be sought and exploited for example the statistical variable was a standard deviation in this study therefore if this statistical variable can be obtained with a few number of samples the probability of the rare event can be rapidly estimated by using its correlation with the statistical variable this approach can lead to a significant reduction in computation time which is necessary for efficient design optimization funding this research was supported by korea electric power

21000,as spatial seabed soil variations are stochastic and considerable it is important to predict the changes in the dynamic behavior of offshore structures for safety particularly if the natural frequency of a structure is significantly changed by the soil variations resonance can cause structural failure hereafter this probability is referred to as failure probability although several models have been proposed they require a long computational time to predict failure probabilities to overcome this limitation this work proposes a fast method for estimating the failure probability first since a very large computation memory is required to construct a finite element model for stochastic soil block wise matrix calculations and a dynamic memory allocation technique were adopted second conventional models require a large number of soil samples to calculate the failure probability which results in heavy computations a newly developed fast monte carlo fmc method is 5 8 times faster than the conventional method with high accuracy 99 41 this method was applied to offshore wind turbines and successfully predicted various structural characteristics a noteworthy prediction is that slender and long foundation is more robust to stochastic soil variations than thick and short foundation the fmc method can be used for preliminary design of offshore structures keywords monte carlo method offshore wind turbine soil modulus spatial variation random field natural frequency failure probability 1 introduction the reliability of offshore wind turbines owt is affected by mechanical properties of soil according to previous studies mulders et al 2020 zhao et al 2007 meng et al 2011 the interface between onshore structure and soil was considered as a fixed boundary because various construction processes to enhance the bearing capacity are available on onshore lands mohamed et al 2018 however this assumption is not valid for the owts the installation process is limited in sea because of the severe environmental and weather conditions moreover the stiffness of offshore soil is relatively less than that of onshore soil byun et al 2013 inci et al 2003 this suggest that the dynamic characteristics of owts strongly depend on soil properties and the interaction between the soil and the foundation mechanical properties of soil vary over space with high complexity for several reasons first soil properties have non uniform spatial distributions because each soil layer exhibits different properties lesny and wiemann 2005 second the properties are affected by the interaction between the soil particles specifically the strength and shear modulus of the soil increase with the compressive force caused by the surrounding soil particles oh et al 2018 geist et al 2001 likitlersuang et al 2013 soil particles at a specific depth are compressed by the collective weight of the other soil particles located between the seabed and the given depth thus soils in deep regions exhibit a larger strength and modulus of elasticity than soils in shallow regions third various types of soils are spread over space with high uncertainties schneider et al 1999 varathungarajan et al 2009 wei et al 2010 the increase in the soil modulus with depth and the variations in the properties over soil layers have been characterized varathungarajan et al 2009 and considered in previous studies nam et al 2019 bisoi and haldar 2014 the most commonly used methods that account for the soil structure interaction are the virtual spring model and the finite element method fem the spring model lesny and wiemann 2005 2006 taflanidis et al 2013 ashour and norris 2000 dash et al 2008 focuses on the interaction between the soil and the pile by introducing various virtual springs distributed on the surface of the structure details on this spring model is provided in supplementary material moreover the stiffness of the springs is designed to nonlinearly vary with the displacement of the structure this nonlinear dynamic behavior of the soil structure interaction is modeled with the p y curve for the lateral interaction on the lateral surface t z curve for the horizontal interaction on the lateral surface and q z curve for the horizontal interaction on the bottom surface various functions such as fractional polynomials bisoi and haldar 2014 and hyperbolic tangent functions lesny and wiemann 2006 were adopted to develop these empirical nonlinear curves as owts are long and exposed to huge thrust forces along their horizontal directions virtual springs for the lateral interaction on the lateral surface dominantly support the dynamic loads the fem is also commonly used to characterize the interaction between the soil and the owt structures haldar and babu 2008 haldar and basu 2013 li et al 2017 charlton and rouainia 2017 lai et al 2019 this method considers the soil domain as continuum elements several constitutive models such as the linear elastic nonlinear elastic and elasto plastic models can be used for the fem ti et al 2009 the force acting on the soil structure interface can be accurately calculated using the fem moreover the stress distribution over the soil can be calculated which cannot be obtained by the virtual spring model the virtual spring model and fem exhibit different strengths first the virtual spring model is simple and has fewer degrees of freedom thus it requires a relatively short computation time however for each site to be studied a corresponding empirical equation should be derived while the motion of the structure can be obtained using the spring model the spatial distribution of the stress in the soil cannot be predicted further as the spring model is only applicable to two dimensional 2d model this model is primarily applied to pile type foundations bisoi and haldar 2014 taflanidis et al 2013 lesny and wiemann 2006 however the fem can be applied to 2d and three dimensional 3d models this flexibility enables the fem to calculate the responses of various types of substructures such as monopiles multipiles tripod suction caissons and jackets haldar and babu 2008 haldar and basu 2013 li et al 2017 charlton and rouainia 2017 lai et al 2019 in addition fem directly utilizes soil modulus which can be easily measured via in situ experiments such as the cone penetration test standard penetration test and velocity of shear wave therefore when the design of a substructure is complex the fem is more effective than the spring model to study the dynamic behavior of the substructure the p y curves created with random variables can be used to study the effects of uncertain soil stiffness on the dynamics of offshore monopile structures low et al 2001 used depth dependent p y curves to predict the pile head deflection and bending moment after constructing the model via a deterministic approach they applied normally distributed shear strength to the p y curves to consider stochastic soil variations over space andersen et al 2012 created a p y curve in which the soil strength is accounted for in the force displacement relationship they then used a strength profile that stochastically varies with depth subsequently they predicted the probability of the natural frequency nf of a monopile owt the uncertainty of soil can also be indirectly considered haldar et al 2018 used the correlation of strain and strength that corresponds to 50 of the maximum stress in the compression test then they used that specific strain value to model stochastic variations finally they predicted the probability distribution for the nf of owts installed with the monopile although this stochastic approach has an advantage that its application is simple it is primarily used for monopiles to account for the spatially varying soil properties in the fem a random field which is a group of random variables spread over space is required random fields for soil variations can be constructed using various methods 1 the moving average method generates random fields by calculating local average for the product of a weighting function and white noise christakos 2012 because this average which is the summation over space has to be conducted at all nodes in the interested domain it is computationally very expensive 2 the discrete fourier transform method can be applied using the power spectral density of the stochastic variation frenton 1994 however the transform is realized via the integration that has to be conducted at every node 3 the fast fourier transform can mitigate this computational issue lang and potthoff 2011 however random fields produced by this method have symmetric covariance which results in a substantial error this problem can be addressed by generating random fields that are twice the interested domain size however this requires additional computations 4 karhunen lo√®ve expansion helps build random fields with the random noise eigenvalues and eigen functions of covariance functions zheng and dai 2017 extensive computations might be required if the analytical solution for the eigenvalue problem is unavailable 5 the turning bands method generates 2d or 3d random fields by combining 1d random vectors frenton 1994 this method can rapidly construct random fields when a small number of 1d random vectors are applied however if the number of 1d random vectors is insufficient straight line patterns will appear in the resulting random fields which are unrealistic patterns several random vectors remove this unrealistic random field but increase computation time 6 the local average subdivision method divides the domain into several cells in several stages griffiths and fenton 2004 in each dividing stage the random variables for cells are determined by considering local average variance spatial correlation etc while this is a computationally efficient method undesirable grid patterns can be added in the random fields 7 the covariance matrix decomposition uses a covariance matrix to consider the correlation between the nodes in a 3d soil domain a lower triangular matrix of the covariance matrix is then calculated via cholesky decomposition deodatis 1996 because of its simplicity and accuracy this method is widely used to study the interaction between soil and various offshore structures the fem equipped with covariance matrix and random fields was used to study various types of substructures including monopile spudcan and suction caissons haldar and basu 2013 constructed 2d random fields for soil domain with log normal autocovariance functions they then calculated the maximum allowable lateral load in the presence of the stochastic soil their model predicted that the maximal value of the allowable load obtained with the stochastic soil is smaller than that obtained with the deterministic soil li et al 2017 studied the bearing capacity of a spudcan foundation embedded in a clayey seabed with spatially varying shear strength charlton and rouainia 2017 the vertical horizontal and rotational capacities are predicted to be reduced owing to the uncertainty of the clay a similar analysis was also conducted using skirted foundations charlton and rouainia 2017 in which the failure envelope of the foundations increased with the intensity of the uncertainty note that the covariance matrix decomposition used in these studies requires a very large computational memory which is the limitation of this method among the previously mentioned models and techniques this work adopted the fem and covariance matrix decomposition approaches the fem is selected over the virtual spring model because the spring model cannot be applied to complex structures such as suction caissons the covariance matrix decomposition is selected because it is accurate and is efficient in generating several samples in particular once the lower triangular matrix is obtained via the cholesky decomposition which might be computationally expensive several random fields can be generated rapidly a very simple multiplication of the lower triangular matrix and a random matrix composed of random variables rapidly produces several random fields simultaneously in addition to utilizing the previous methods this study also developed a computational framework to rapidly predict the failure probability first a block wise matrix calculation and dynamic memory allocation technique were applied to resolve the problem related to the lack of computational memory for the cholesky decomposition second the fmc developed in this study significantly reduces the computation time required to estimate the failure probability this reduction can be achieved because the fmc requires a very small number of soil samples to estimate the failure probability compared to the conventional monte carlo method the predictions can be effectively used in the optimal design of owt structures with the consideration of seabed the structure design procedure can be accomplished by coarse and fine optimization in the coarse optimization stage the substructure type and dimensions are determined such that the failure probability does not exceed a threshold value e g 0 01 while minimizing their sizes to reduce manufacturing and transportation costs because changes in structure size would be considerable in this stage the cost reduction is noticeable in the subsequent fine optimization stage the structure dimension can be slightly modified until the failure probability is less than a more demanding threshold value e g 0 0001 or 0 001 note that because this work focuses on the coarse optimization stage the methodologies proposed in this work has to be modified when the fine optimization is necessary 2 model and methods this section is composed of several subsections to effectively describe the computational framework used to estimate the failure probability section 2 1 explains the method for generating a random field to consider the stochastic variation of soil section 2 2 describes the dimensions and specifications for the owt structure and its substructure section 2 3 presents design criteria of owt to avoid structural failure due to mechanical resonance section 2 4 describes how the probability distribution of nf can be obtained with the classical monte carlo method this section also provides detailed descriptions on the failure probability section 2 5 introduces the newly developed fmc to address the limitation of the classical monte carlo method the validation of this new method is also included in section 2 5 2 1 stochastic soil domain the stochastic soil shear strength s x y z in 3d space can be described as 1 s x y z s m x y z Œ≤ r x y z where z is the coordinate representing the depth of the seabed x and y are coordinates perpendicular to z as shown in fig 1 s m is the mean shear strength and Œ≤ is a stochastic intensity factor that represents the strength of the fluctuation and can be computed as the autocovariance of the soil shear strength r is a random field constructed with random variables with zero mean and a standard deviation of one hereafter r is referred to as the normalized random field the mean shear strength s m is affected by static pressures acting on soil particles thus the effects of soil weight and structure weight on the soil strength were considered first soil particles are compressed by static stress induced by the weight of the surrounding soil particles because soil particles are compressed by other soil particles above them the mean shear strength s m linearly increases with depth this increase with depth is fully described in our previous study nam et al 2019 changes in shear strength by the weight of the structures were also considered by applying the vertical force corresponding to the weight on the suction caissons note that the buoyancy forces acting on the submerged parts were also considered when calculating the vertical compression due to structure the modulus of the soil is assumed to be proportional to its shear strength details on this shear strength model are also described in our previous work nam et al 2019 mechanical properties of the soil used in this work are provided in table 1 a linear elastic constitutive model is adopted for the soil domain because the natural frequency of the owt can be derived from linear stiffness prendergast et al 2015 arany et al 2015 the random field r can be constructed with various methods lower triangular matrix of covariance matrix moving average of white noise field inverse fourier transform approach and turning bands method this study used the lower triangular matrix of the covariance matrix because this approach is able to resolve computational issues with block wise matrix calculation suppose the interested soil domain is modeled with n grid points the normalized random field r can be generated as follows first the spatial correlation between points can be defined with normalized autocovariance function œÅ the used autocovariance function is introduced later second normalized covariance matrix c is constructed based on autocovariance function œÅ where the size of matrix c is n lower triangular matrix l is obtained by performing the cholesky decomposition on the covariance matrix as c ll t then random vector w with a size of n 1 is generated where each element of w is an independent random variable with zero mean and a variance of one finally random field r can be obtained as r l w note that the covariance c of the random field is related to the random field as e rr t c where e represents the elementwise ensemble average operation thus the random variables in random field r have spatial correlation defined in c to perform monte carlo simulation a large number of soil samples i e random fields are required thus a large number of different w were generated and the corresponding random fields were constructed then a large number of stochastic soil domains can be created and used with owt structures the procedure described above can be easily applied to soil domains if the size of the soil domain is small however if the volume of the soil domain is large this method suffers from intensive computation specifically if the size of soil domain increases by a factor of q along the x y and z directions the number of nodes n in the soil domain increases by a factor of q 3 then the number of elements in covariance matrix c increases from nto q 3 n q 3 n consequently if the soil domain increases by a factor of q the required memory for the computation increases by a factor of q 6 which is a tremendous number of nodes this computational issue can be alleviated by decomposing the covariance matrix into several blocks then the lower triangular matrix can be obtained by using block wise cholesky decomposition chen et al 2013 for example c can be decomposed into nine blocks as 2 c c 11 c 12 c 13 c 21 c 22 c 23 c 31 c 32 c 33 l l t l 11 o o l 21 l 22 o l 31 l 32 l 33 l 11 t l 21 t l 31 t o l 22 t l 32 t o o l 33 t where c i j and l i j are not scalars but matrices o is a matrix filled with zeros then blocks l i j can be obtained as 3 l i j f ch c i i p 1 i 1 l i p l i p t if i j c i j p 1 i 1 l p i l p j t l j j t 1 otherwise where f ch a is a function that returns a lower triangular matrix of the input matrix a with cholesky decomposition details on the block wise cholesky decomposition are provided in supplementary material note that the ability of the block wise matrix calculation to save memory during computation can be acquired by applying a dynamic memory allocation technique especially this technique is effective when generating large and stochastically varying soil domains for example when calculating l 21 all blocks are removed from the memory space of a computing device except c 21 and l 11 which are required to calculate l 21 likewise when calculating l 22 all blocks are removed from the memory space except c 22 and l 21 this block wise calculation combined with dynamic memory allocation effectively reduces the required memory space therefore the method can be used when limited memory is available the stochastic variation of soil can be characterized with the autocovariance function various autocovariance functions baker and calle 2006 were suggested in previous studies exponential distribution oscillatory exponential distribution gaussian distribution oscillatory gaussian distribution and bilinear distribution this work introduced the gaussian autocovariance function because it has been widely used to consider the stochastic variations of soil properties tamara and soubra 2013 vrouwenvelder and calle 2003 ronold 1990 the gaussian autocovariance function œÅ g is defined as 4 œÅ g Œ¥ x Œ¥ y Œ¥ z exp Œ¥ x c x 2 Œ¥ y c y 2 Œ¥ z c z 2 where Œ¥x Œ¥y and Œ¥z are the distances between two points along x y and z and c x c y and c z are the characteristic lengths of correlations along x y and z thus a large characteristic length leads to a long spatial correlation fig 1 shows examples of a normalized random field in a cylindrical soil domain with a diameter of 60 m and depth of 30 m 2 2 fem of offshore wind turbine and soil two different types of substructures were considered in this study monopile mp and tripod suction caissons tsc they are widely used substructures at intermediate sea depths oh et al 2018 rotor nacelle assembly rna was considered with a lumped mass i e 105 kg and defined moments of inertia i e 106 kg m2 for the yaw and pitch motions and 107 kg m2 for the roll motion the assembly was located at the top of the tower as shown in fig 2 the tower substructure and suction caissons are manufactured with steel thus they are considered as a linear elastic model with a density of 7850 kg m3 young s modulus of 210 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 27 effects of damping in the connections i e tower rotor blades nacelle and substructure on the dynamic behavior of owts can be considered with an equivalent damping the value of the damping ratio 1 3 measured in owts damgaard and andersen 2012 was used in this study moreover the model considers the dynamic characteristics of the owts when the wind speeds are not significant in this case it can be assumed that the substructure motion is very small therefore the separation and sliding motions in the soil foundation interface can be considered negligible hence a bonded interface was used for the soil foundation interface in addition the added mass effect caused by the structure fluid interaction was incorporated into the structures at the mean sea level note that this added mass considerably affects the dynamic characteristics of the owt such as natural frequencies and mode shapes moll et al 2010 specifically the natural frequencies of the soil owt system were obtained using the fem software comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa table 2 describes the dimensions of the tower and two substructures to capture the soil spatial variation the mesh size of the soil domain must be constrained by the characteristic length of correlations i e c x c y and c z to determine proper constraints natural frequency values were obtained with different constraints and were compared first constraint is that the mesh length must be less than half of the characteristic length the second constraint is that the mesh length must be less than quarter of the characteristic length the difference in the natural frequencies for these constraints is very small i e less than 10 4 hz thus the first constraint is sufficient to consider the soil spatial variation and was used in this study a 3d interpolation function in comsol multiphysics was used to consider the soil modulus spatial variation in the fem first 3d grid point locations in the soil domain were determined next modulus values on individual points were calculated using a 3d random field then a matrix composed of the grid point locations and the corresponding local modulus were constructed and imported to comsol multiphysics the individual mesh modulus in the fem can be determined by the 3d interpolation function provided in comsol 2 3 design criteria one of the most critical design criteria of owt is that the natural frequencies of the overall system i e blades nacelle tower substructures and soil should be different from the rotational frequency of the blades to avoid resonance this design criterion has been studied with deterministic models thus the natural frequencies and the corresponding vibration modes were predicted in the absence of stochastic variations the stochastic intensity Œ≤ was determined to be 0 note that the stochastic soil domain with nonzero Œ≤ is considered in the following sections a modal analysis shows that major mode shapes of owts with tsc are the first bending mode for side to side motion and the first bending mode for fore aft motion as shown in fig 3 a the nfs of these two modes are slightly different because the moment of inertia of rna corresponding to the roll motion are different from the moment of inertia corresponding to the pitch motion however the difference is very small because the tower substructure and foundation have axial symmetric shapes and properties the subsequent modes are second bending modes note that major modes of owts with mp are the same as those of tsc the thrust force generated by the rotation of blades is a dominant load to the structures of owts therefore it should be separated from the natural frequencies of the system the magnitude of the thrust force has peaks at 1p and 3p frequencies in which 1p is the rotating frequency of the blades and 3p is the 3 fold rotating frequency nam et al 2019 andersen et al 2012 oh et al 2013 the rotating speed of the blades for a 3 mw wind turbine varies in the range of 8 6 18 4 rpm nam et al 2019 which is the range used in this study thus the 1p range and 3p range depicted in fig 2 b are the major exciting frequency ranges of the owt the determination of the nf of the wind turbine structure is very important to the reliability of megawatt class wind turbines because their first and second natural frequencies are close to the exciting frequency ranges owing to scales of structure it is difficult to manufacture megawatt class wind turbines such that its first nf is larger than 3p thus the first and second nfs have to be smaller than the 3p range and larger than the 1p range as shown in fig 3 b specifically because the safety margin of 10 is mainly used fischer 2006 the first nf of owts has to be between 0 337 and 0 387 hz 2 4 estimation of failure probability with monte carlo method whereas certain nf values are obtained in a deterministic model the stochastic model provides the probability distribution of nf in addition the probability of nf to enter the 1p range or 3p range represents the dynamic resonance probability this resonance can dramatically increase the structure oscillating motion because oscillating motions can cause structure failure e g fatigue or extremely large stress the prevention of this resonance is one of the most important criteria for the design of wind turbine structures andersen et al 2012 k√ºhn 2003 hu et al 2015 thus this resonance probability is defined as the failure probability in this study this subsection describes 1 the probability distribution of nf 2 the failure probability calculated from a conventional monte carlo method and 3 a disadvantage of the conventional method because of the stochastic variation of soil modulus over space the owts have different nfs over the samples of the soil domain to consider the effects of this variation on the system tsc with the diameter of 5 m and height of 3 m are used other dimensions are determined as the values in table 2 stochastic intensity factor Œ≤ of the soil domain is determined as 30 kpa and its characteristic lengths are the same with c x c y c z 5 m other soil properties are provided in table 1 the bars in fig 4 a represents the probability p f n1 of the first nf and the bars in fig 4 b represents the probability p f n2 of the second nf interestingly the probability distribution of nf is asymmetric as shown in fig 4 this statistical feature can be explained with a simplified model composed of springs as depicted in fig 5 a in which the interactions between soil particles are regarded as a combination of vertical and horizontal springs suppose the spring constants are normally distributed random variables when the springs are connected in parallel the equivalent stiffness is simply the summation of the individual stiffnesses because of this linear relation the equivalent stiffness of the parallel connection also follows the normal distribution however the equivalent stiffness of serially connected springs can be obtained as k eq s 1 k 1 k 1 k 1 where k denotes the stiffness of the individual springs note that k eq s is nonlinearly related with k due to the nonlinear relation of k and k eq s the distribution of k eq s is not necessarily the normal distribution to check the distribution of k eq s monte carlo simulations were performed with 10 000 different k eq s as shown in fig 5 b this result verified that the stiffness of the serial connection follows a right skewed distribution because the nf of owt depends on this stiffness the probability of nf is also distributed with a right skewed shape if the nf exists in the 1p range or 3p range the owt structure can suffer from resonance note again that the nf is much less than the 3p range because of the scale and material properties of the owts as shown in fig 4 thus the probability that nf enters the 3p range is negligible the failure probability was obtained with the conventional monte carlo approach as follows first a large number of samples of the soil domain are generated and the owt structures are combined with the soil domains then the nf of each fem model is calculated next the failure probability can be obtained by counting the number of samples in which nf is less than the upper bound of the 1p range specifically 1000 different soil domains were used to conduct conventional monte carlo simulations the reliability of the probability value obtained by monte carlo simulation can be evaluated by the coefficient of variation which can be calculated as 1 p f p f n where p f is the estimated failure probability value this sample number i e n 1000 leads to a coefficient of variation of 6 14 if the failure probability is 0 05 0 2 note that the calculated failure probabilities are in this range for most cases in this work the various substructures and soil domains were studied as shown in table 3 note that the characteristic length of correlation used in this work is ranged from 2 to 20 m which are similar to values measured in previous works baker and calle 2006 the problem of the conventional monte carlo method is that a large number of samples are required to estimate the failure probability the error in the failure probability is likely to be large if the number of samples is small to confirm this problem a normalized error is defined as p f p f n p f where p f n is the failure probability obtained with n samples p f is the probability estimated with 1000 samples note that this number of samples provides 10 coefficient of variation when the failure probability is close to or larger than 0 1 the error in the probability becomes small when n is close to 1 000 as shown in fig 6 the tendency of p f over the sample number might be different if the failure probability is very small however it is worth noting again that this work focuses on the coarse optimization where the failure probability is close to or larger than 0 1 if fine optimization is needed additional calculations can be done with more samples the results suggested that very large number i e 1000 of samples are required thereby requiring a huge amount of calculations to be performed to obtain a reliable value of p f if the conventional monte carlo method is used to obtain the optimal design of substructures this large number of samples can be a critical hurdle because various dimensions for the substructure should be investigated in the design stage 2 5 new estimation method of failure probability to address this computational issue this study proposes a new method i e fmc which can calculate the failure probability with a small number of samples the fundamental idea is as follows a small number of samples are sufficient to obtain the standard deviation œÉ nf of nf thus if the value of p f can be estimated with œÉ nf then the number of samples for the estimation of p f will be considerably reduced the idea described above is based on the following hypothesis first the required number of samples to obtain œÉ nf is smaller than the number to directly obtain p f second œÉ nf is correlated with p f the first hypothesis is reasonable because the failure caused by stochastic variations in soil is a very rare event as depicted in fig 4 c generally a large number of samples are needed to accurately capture the probability of rare events in contrast the standard deviation is less related to the rare event it represents how widely the probability is distributed thus an accurate value of œÉ nf can be obtained with a small number of samples fig 6 shows that the first hypothesis is valid specifically the error of œÉ nf is very small when n is approximately 200 whereas the error of p f becomes small when a very large number 1 000 of samples are used therefore an accurate value of œÉ nf can be obtained with relatively small number of samples the second hypothesis on the correlation of œÉ nf and p f was also investigated as œÉ nf increases the probability of nf is distributed more widely over frequency then the probability that nf will enter the 1p range increases thereby increasing the failure probability specifically fig 7 shows a strong correlation between œÉ nf and p f this relation can be approximated with a straight line r 2 0 8811 as shown in fig 7 a however a linear function is not sufficiently accurate to describe the correlation thus an exponential function was introduced as 5 p f a 1 exp a 2 œÉ nf a 3 in addition if this equation produces a negative value p f is determined as zero if this equation produces a value larger than one p f is assumed to be one by using least squares fitting the values of a 1 a 2 and a 3 were obtained as 0 3576 197 2 and 0 1980 respectively fig 7 b shows that this exponential curve has a higher accuracy r 2 0 9782 than that of the linear regression based on the above analysis œÉ nf can be used to accurately estimate the failure probability with a small number of samples there is a tradeoff between the accuracy and the computation time in estimating œÉ nf if œÉ nf is calculated with a large number of samples the accuracy of this estimation is high however heavy computation is required to perform fem calculations corresponding to the large samples on the other hand if a small number of samples are used the calculation burden is not significant but the error in the estimated probability can be large to enhance the performance of the fmc it is very important to determine a proper sample size that not only guarantees accuracy of the estimation but also minimizes the number of samples i e minimizes the computation time to determine the optimal sample size a new procedure was introduced as follows suppose œÉ nf n is a standard deviation calculated with n samples when the value of œÉ nf n is close to its true value œÉ nf tends to fluctuate over n with small amplitudes the fluctuation of œÉ nf n and their convergence were calculated using the values within a sliding window the size of the window was defined as n wd and the windowed computations start from n n wd as shown in fig 8 a if the value of œÉnf n in the sliding window satisfies a specific criterion to be described later the current sample number n is considered to be sufficient to obtain a reliable standard deviation value then œÉnf n is substituted into eq 5 to obtain the failure probability if œÉnf violates the criterion more samples are needed thus n is increased and more nfs are obtained the procedure is repeated until œÉnf satisfies the criteria the flowchart of this procedure is shown in fig 9 the criterion for the sample size is determined by the local changes in œÉ nf the i th local change Œ¥ œÉ nf i can be defined as œÉ nf i 1 œÉ nf i then average a œÉ of the local change i e the average over the sliding window with the size of n wd is defined as 6 a œÉ 1 n wd i n n wd 1 n Œ¥ œÉ nf i again when œÉ nf n is close to its true value it tends to fluctuate with small amplitude the absolute value in eq 6 was adopted to capture this fluctuation if a œÉ is less than tolerance Œµ the number of samples is assumed to be sufficiently large the number of samples at this moment is referred to as n e then the failure probability was estimated with eq 5 and œÉ nf n e to improve the accuracy of the method with less computation the value of n wd and Œµ were obtained as follows first metrics to characterize the accuracy and computational effort were defined next the changes in the metrics over n wd and Œµ were predicted then the optimal values of n wd and Œµ can be obtained with the consideration of both accuracy and computation the accuracy of the method is characterized with the mean value of the error in the failure probability Œ¥ p f the error p f n 1000 p f n n e was obtained for cases 1 7 then Œ¥ p f was obtained by averaging the errors corresponding to the seven cases the computational effort can be measured by the mean value n e for the number of used samples which was calculated by averaging the values of n e corresponding to cases 1 7 the changes in accuracy i e Œ¥ p f and the computational effort i e n e over the parameters were calculated as shown in fig 8 b and c as the next step the optimal values of n wd and Œµ were carefully obtained to maximize the performance of the fmc first an allowable error value was determined then possible sets of n wd and Œµ were obtained such that Œ¥ p f was equal to or less than the allowable error the value of the allowable error was selected as 1 note that this 1 could cause considerable error in some cases e g cases 1 and 2 however as previously mentioned the main purpose of this work is to develop a fast model for coarse optimization where a 1 error can be tolerated among the possible sets of n wd and Œµ an optimal set can be selected where the corresponding sample number n e is minimized in the possible sets this approach provides the minimal sample numbers while guaranteeing that the probability error is less than the allowable error by using the above approach the optimal values of n wd and Œµ were calculated as 53 and 10 4 respectively the corresponding value of Œ¥ p f was obtained as 0 96 for cases 1 7 the failure probabilities calculated with the optimal n wd and Œµ are shown in fig 8 d the number of samples n e was determined by the local changes in œÉnf in each case thus the value of n e is different over the cases as provided in fig 8 d note that these numbers are very small compared to 1 000 which is the number of samples used to directly obtain p f without using œÉ nf this suggests that the proposed fmc is able to reduce computation time significantly the parameter values i e a 1 3 n w and Œµ of the proposed method were validated with various structure dimensions and soil domains these structures and soils used for the validation were not used when determining the parameter values the proposed method estimated the probability with a small error i e average of 0 59 for the validation cases i e case 8 16 however it is worth noting that the availability of the parameters is guaranteed under a criterion if œÉ n f of a case is between 3 10 3 and 1 6 10 2 the parameter values can provide an accurate p f otherwise the accuracy of this method can be lowered if p f needs to be estimated for a very small or very large œÉ n f new parameter values should be calculated again with a wider range of œÉ n f these cases are summarized in table 4 note that anisotropic characteristic lengths were also studied because the characteristic length along the horizontal direction is greater than that along the vertical direction at various sites li et al 2016 the values measured in previous studies are summarized in table 5 the results for this validation set are presented in fig 10 which shows the high performance of the fmc method considering accuracy and computation time regardless of the characteristic lengths and substructures the fmc estimated the probability with a small error i e average of 0 59 the conventional method typically requires approximately 1000 samples to predict accurate failure probabilities but the fmc requires only 172 56 samples on average from the validation set note that this fast estimation method was empirically established 3 results and discussion the effects of stochastic variation on soil domains and the effects of substructural design on the failure probability of owts were investigated with the fmc note that several cases can be studied because the fmc can predict the failure probability much faster than the conventional method for appropriate comparison between cases the first nfs in the absence of stochastic variations are determined to be the same i e 0 35 hz for all cases by adjusting the thickness of the main substructure which is t s c for tsc and t m p for mp the effects of soil domain were studied by changing the stochastic intensity Œ≤ and the characteristic length of correlation c x c y and c z first the failure probability increases with stochastic intensity Œ≤ as shown in fig 11 a this feature is predicted because large stochastic intensity results in large variations of nf which leads to large failure probability fig 11 b shows that the failure probability also increases with the characteristic length of correlation note that the characteristic lengths are determined to be the same along the x y and z direction thus they are represented with one parameter c this effect of the characteristic length is caused by the scale of the length compared to the size of the substructure fig 12 shows the normalized random field of the soil modulus around the suction caisson when the characteristic length is small as presented in fig 12 b the soil modulus is small in some regions near the suction caisson meanwhile in other regions in the vicinity the soil modulus is large thus the effects of the variations in the soil modulus in the substructure are likely to cancel out each other when the characteristic length is large this cancellation is not likely to take place as shown in fig 12 c in fig 12 c1 and c2 a low soil modulus can be observed at almost every point near the substructure thus the nf is also relatively low however if the soil modulus is large as shown in fig 12 c3 the nf becomes relatively small thus the variation of nf and the failure probability are considerable if the characteristic length is large the model also predicted that the failure probability of mp is larger than that of tsc for all cases as shown in fig 10 whereas mp interacts with the soil in one region tsc interacts with the soil in three different regions because it has three suction caissons consequently the interface of tsc and the soil is more widely spread over space than that of mp and the soil as a result the effects of the variations in the soil modulus are likely to be mitigated when tsc is used thus the probability of nf for tsc is less distributed over the frequency which leads to a smaller failure probability than that of mp the failure probability is also influenced by the dimensions of the substructures the diameter and height of the suction caissons fig 13 shows the various effects of substructure dimensions on the failure probability in the results the parameters of soil domains remains the same as follows Œ≤ is 30 kpa and the characteristic lengths of correlation are determined to be c x c y c z 5 m first p f decreases over the height of the suction caisson as shown in fig 13 a the diameter of the suction is 5 m for all cases presented in fig 12 a in addition the failure probability is negligible if the height is larger than 7 m second p f decreases over the diameter of the suction caissons as shown in fig 13 b the height of the suction is 5 m for all cases presented in fig 13 b the failure probability is negligible if the height is larger than 7 m the trends shown in fig 13 a and b simply suggest that large suction caissons are more robust to the uncertainty of the soil than the smaller caissons are to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of the suction diameter and height these two dimensions were varied under a restriction the surface area of the suction caisson remains constant i e œÄ d sc h sc œÄ d sc 2 4 82 46 m2 then as the diameter increases the height of the suction caisson has to decrease to satisfy the constraint the failure probability non monotonically changes over the diameter of the suction as shown in fig 13 c this change is caused by 1 the ratio of the suction size to the characteristic length of the correlation and 2 different values of the diameter and height to maintain the specified surface area first when the diameter of the suction caisson is very large or very small one of the parameters i e d sc or h sc is larger than the characteristic length of soil correlation specifically when d sc is smaller than 3 5 m the h sc is longer than 5 m which is the characteristic length of soil correlation used in this case thus the effects of the fluctuation of the soil modulus are likely to be cancelled out over the height of the suction caisson likewise when d sc is larger than 5 m the effects of the fluctuation of the soil modulus are likely to be cancelled out over the horizontal direction then the variations in the nf is reduced and thus p f is smaller than that of the other suction with intermediate diameter i e 3 5 d sc 5 5 m moreover a long and slender suction has smaller p f than a short and thick one when d sc is 3 m and h sc is 8 m p f is small as shown in fig 12 c the failure probability is small because its height is longer than the characteristic length of soil when d sc is 6 m and h sc is 2 875 m p f is also small the probability is small because its diameter is longer than the characteristic length however the height i e 8 m of the first suction is larger than the diameter 6 m of the second suction therefore the suction with a small diameter and long height has a smaller failure probability than the other suction with a large diameter and short height this case study provides valuable information that is very useful in designing suction caissons one can simply argue that large suction caissons are always better than small suction caissons based on the results in fig 13 a and b however the optimization of the dimensions is more complicated because the cost and manufacturing factors needs to be considered together with failure probability for optimal design various design strategies can be constructed depending on manufacturing circumstances scenario 1 suppose the diameter of the suction caisson is determined as a specific length because of some restriction in manufacturing processes for example if the diameter is 5 m its optimal height is 7 m fig 13 a shows that the failure probability is negligible when h sc 7 m if the height is longer than 7 m the cost for manufacturing and installation will increase thus the length 7 m is the optimal height considering its small failure probability and the cost for material and installation scenario 2 suppose the height of the suction caisson should be 5 m under some manufacturing restrictions based on the results in fig 13 b the length 7 m is the optimal diameter for the same reason described in scenario 1 scenario 3 there is no restriction in the manufacturing process instead the cost for manufacturing is determined as a specific value the cost for manufacturing and installation is proportional to the size of the suction caissons because of the cup like shape of the suction caisson it can be assumed that the cost of suction caisson depends on its surface area thus the suction caisson needs to be designed such that its surface area has to be less than a specific value to satisfy the constraint of cost results presented in fig 13 c suggests that the long suction caisson with small diameter is preferable to the short caisson with large diameter when the characteristic length of soil is isotropic to maximize the reliability of suction caissons one needs to increase the length of the suction caisson as much as possible this increase in the length results in a reduction of its diameter to comply with the constraint in the surface area the limit of this reduction can be determined by the minimal diameter to satisfy other criteria such as installation capability and transportation efficiency 4 conclusion the stochastic nature of seabed soil is critical to the dynamic reliability of owts particularly changes in the nf due to a spatially fluctuating modulus can lead to significant vibration of the structure however these phenomena have not yet been fully understood because intensive computation is required to overcome this limitation this study proposed a new method capable of providing reliable results and alleviating computational effort this method is very useful especially when the owts installed contain complex substructures when the volume of the stochastic soil domain is large a very large number of nodes have to be considered this requires huge memory allocation and heavy matrix calculation in this study these challenges were resolved by introducing block wise matrix calculation and dynamic memory allocation specifically the covariance matrix was obtained by blocks and stored then cholesky decomposition was performed by block note that the number of blocks simultaneously allocated in the memory is very small thus this method is able to generate stochastic soil domains composed of a huge number of nodes with relatively small memory in this study the failure that can occur when the system nf exists in the exciting frequency range was investigated first a conventional monte carlo approach was applied to obtain this failure probability however this method requires a large number of samples thus the corresponding fem calculation is also heavy therefore the fmc was developed that indirectly estimates the probability using the standard deviation of the nf our model showed that the standard deviation is strongly correlated with the failure probability in addition the value of the standard deviation is sufficiently accurate even when a small number of samples are used therefore this fmc is able to provide reliable estimation of the failure probability with a small number of samples consequently the success of this proposed method makes it very useful in designing substructures of owts in areas that show considerable variations in soil properties such as exhibited at several offshore sites schneider et al 1999 varathungarajan et al 2009 wei et al 2010 baket and calle 2006 the reliability of owts is determined by the stochastic nature of the soil and size of the substructure the case study showed that owts are robust to the stochastic variation of soil when the size of the substructure is large however the size of the substructure is constrained by the cost of manufacturing transportation and installation thus to minimize cost the size of the substructure has to be optimized by considering the stochastic intensity and characteristic length of soil in a candidate site the cost of a substructure can be reduced more by adjusting the ratio of the dimensions e g ratio of the height to the diameter of the suction caisson it can be argued that the reliability of tsc can be simply determined by the surface area of the suction caisson however this study showed that this argument is incomplete even when the surface area remains the same the failure probability can change over the ratio of the height to the diameter of the suction caisson the results also suggest that the optimal ratio can be affected by the characteristic length of the soil variation other design variables regarded as constants in this study need to be considered in future study to obtain more robust substructures number of suction caissons or number of piles distance between suction caissons thickness of the main foundation and nonstationary variations of soil modulus to conduct an optimization procedure with these variables deliberate estimations of the cost of owt are also needed which are out of the scope of this study however the model developed here can perform those studies because of the significant reduction in computational effort achieved by the model the proposed method to estimate the failure probability can be applied to different fields the conventional monte carlo method which calculates the probability directly from a large number of samples has been widely used in various complex systems however when the probability of a rare event needs to be considered a very large number of samples and their corresponding computation effort will be a bottleneck for effective prediction to overcome this problem a statistical variable which is strongly correlated to the probability can be sought and exploited for example the statistical variable was a standard deviation in this study therefore if this statistical variable can be obtained with a few number of samples the probability of the rare event can be rapidly estimated by using its correlation with the statistical variable this approach can lead to a significant reduction in computation time which is necessary for efficient design optimization funding this research was supported by korea electric power

21001,an attempt has been made to predict the ice rubble field load on norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse by using cohesive element ce formulation two sub load events were selected to validate the numerical and material model used in simulation of interaction of the ice rubble field and lighthouse a literature review of simulation of rubble field structure interaction methods is also included in order to illustrate the knowledge gaps and highlight shortcomings of existing techniques a description of chosen ice rubble field load events and signal post processing is added a linear mohr coulomb material model was used for the bulk element for the cohesive element formulation a material model was chosen which is based on three irreversible mixed mode interaction with an arbitrary normalized traction separation law governed by a load curve the elastic modulus and fracture toughness for the ice rubble field were scaled using the ice rubble field porosity a parametric study was conducted and effects were documented the numerical model predicted similar values for maximum total force but average and standard deviation values of total force were higher than measured the observed load drops in measured force time histories were reproduced with reasonable accuracy in simulated force time histories keywords finite element analysis cohesive element method ice rubble structure interaction norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse 1 introduction the term ice rubble field can be used as generalised term for ice ridge fields where vast area of sea covered with ice blocks packed together the sea ice ridges are common ice feature in the arctic and subarctic sea which are the major load contributor on offshore and marine structures if icebergs are not present in that area the ice rubble is an integral part of ice ridges the ice rubble field is made up of piles of ice blocks and can be fully or partially consolidated the ice rubble field can be found in between colliding ice floes and can cover large areas the in situ testing gives opportunities to understanding the properties and failure of ice rubble in actual environmental conditions the ice rubble has always been considered as a granular material and can be described by the mohr coulomb criterion see iso19906 2010 therefore efforts have been devoted in the past to find reasonable values of the cohesion and the angle of internal friction see cornett and timco 1996 l√∏set and sayed 1993 timco et al 1992 sayed et al 1992 urroz and robert 1987 gale et al 1987 heinonen 2004 and liferov and bonnemaire 2005 literature reviews of test methods and analysis of results can be found in ettema and urroz 1989 timco and cornett 1999 kulyakhtin and h√∏yland 2014 and boroojerdi et al 2020 but numerical simulation methods have an advantage over laboratory and in situ testing of ice rubble as they offer a greater number of design parameters to be tested under controlled conditions therefore interest in developing numerical simulation methods is increasing additionally simulation methods help to increase the accuracy of the analytical methods used to estimate the design loads the numerical simulations enable us to separate and identify the contributions from various parameters controlling the ice rubble field structure interaction process the ice rubble field is anisotropic material the ice rubble field presents challenges in terms of constitutive modelling due to for example the simultaneous presence of freeze bonds and discrete nature of the ice blocks the failure behaviour of ice rubble often called the failure mode is important information for the estimating of ice loads the ice rubble failure is dominated by mixed mode failure and the rubble deformation process is controlled by several factors including compressive strength cohesive strength fracture toughness and the ice to ice friction thus a robust and reliable numerical method is required to predict realistic load levels created by unconsolidated or partially consolidated ice rubble the local pressure data can be linked to global ice load see bjerk√•s 2004 however fransson and lundqvist 2006 have proposed a statistical approach to determine the correlations of segmental loads the failure process is extremely sensitive to the initial conditions for example two different failure modes can be observed with and without the ice rubble present at the interaction zone see m√§√§tt√§nen and hoikkanen 1990 the failure process of ice rubble is also affected by the parent ice thickness rubble pile height ice blocks sizes the temperature salinity and the strain rate interacting structural properties such as its inclination width and stiffness also affects the failure process the numerical simulations can be used to study the ice rubble field loads on structures the challenges involved in the application of numerical methods in ice mechanics are well documented in bergan et al 2010 in the simulations of ice rubble field structure interactions it is necessary to consider a complicated process of fragmentation of ice formation and motion of ice blocks and interactions between the blocks as well as between the blocks and the structure the discrete element method dem has been used to simulation of fracture prone and discrete material such as ice rubble see evgin et al 1992a evgin et al 1992b hopkins 1997 and paavilainen et al 2011 in dem each ice block is modelled as separate non continuum element usually spherical the forces acting on each element are then computed from the initial properties and the relevant physical laws and contact models the combined fem dem approach was proposed to eliminate the rigidity issue of bulk element in the simulation of ice rubble structure interactions see polojarvi and tuhkuri 2009 paavilainen et al 2011 and polojarvi and tuhkuri 2013 in their approach dem was used to model the contact interactions and finite elements were used as constitutive relation which dictates the behaviour and the ice fracture therefore it is clear that without solving mesh entanglement problem conventional fem cannot be used to simulate ice rubble structure interaction in contrast wong and brown 2018 have proposed a model of the interaction between ice and conical bridge pier based on fem where ice sheet is modelled as linear elastic model and considers loads from ice rubble build up the recent development in mesh free formulation techniques of sph gives an accurate solution for large displacements that remain in continuum domain of lagrangian framework for application of sph formulation to simulate a behaviour of ice rubble in the punch through test see patil et al 2015 the same technique has been used to simulate behaviour of brash ice in an in situ test by patil et al 2020 a numerical technique called the cohesive zone model czm has been used for analysis of fracture in brittle and ductile materials see barenblatt 1962 and dugdale 1960 the implementation of the czm into numerical analysis has been termed the cohesive element method cem the cem requires the insertion of inter elements between bulk elements in the conventional finite element mesh upon reaching the threshold limit stress the inter elements cohesive elements fail and are removed from the calculation thus enabling the simulation of a crack in ice these newly formed finite element surfaces are then free to interact with each other the cem is based on the robust mathematical framework of conventional fem and is capable of explicitly simulating the fracture process zone fpz which is confined by finite element boundaries the cohesive element does not have any significant physical mass thus removing them does not violate any mass conservation law the cohesive elements describe the cohesive forces in the material when a fracture occurs the cohesive element method is not new when it comes to simulating interaction between level ice and structure see g√ºrtner 2009 konuk and yu 2010a konuk and yu 2010b daiyan and sand 2011 kuutti et al 2013 lu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the limitations and difficulties associated with the application of cohesive element method are highlighted by pang et al 2015 in this paper a numerical model is used to simulate the ice rubble field structure interaction process using cohesive element method cem the details of constitutive material models used for bulk elements and cohesive elements are given both material models are well described and implemented in the ls dyna finite element code a special purpose matlab 2019 script was written to post process the load event acquired measured data as well to create numerical model and post process the simulation results this numerical model is used in two separate parametric studies to investigate the effect of influential parameters such as cohesive strength angle of internal friction fracture toughness and exponential decay coefficient the numerical results are compared with the load event time series and the conclusions are drawn based on merit and drawbacks of the material model and numerical method 2 ice rubble field load event data full scale measurements of the ice loads at norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse were obtained in two measurement campaigns validation on low level ice forces on coastal structures loleif and measurements of structure in ice strice from 1999 to 2003 the ice forces acting on panels mounted on the lighthouse at water level and environmental variables such as ice thickness wind speeds air temperatures water stage etc were recorded and documented accelerometers tiltmeters and inclinometers were also used to determine the structural response under ice loading additionally continuous video recording from four different cameras was done for later interpretation of the data and analysis a detailed logging of ice condition observations and failure modes was conducted during the measurement periods the detailed description of the experimental setup at the norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse is given elsewhere see jochmann and schwarz 2000 haas and jochmann 2003 and bjerk√•s 2006 therefore only a brief introduction will be presented herein in this paper two load events were selected from strice 2002 measurement campaign data for further study the selected load events were further post processed to extract and visualise the valuable information the norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse was instrumented with 9 nine panels to measure the ice contact forces at the waterline the panels covered a span of 162 capturing ice loads from the north to the southeast the panel no 9 was oriented to the east and divided into 8 subpanels which permitted the detection of ice forces at different depths subpanels 9 1 and 9 2 make up the top row followed by subpanels 9 3 and 9 4 in the second row 9 5 and 9 6 in the third row and 9 7 and 9 8 in the bottom row in the actual measurement setup the original panel numbers were not in sequence to maintain the continuity and to avoid any confusion in later force analysis new panel numbers shown in squares were assigned see fig 1 a the ice conditions were monitored as well the waterline diameter of the lighthouse pier was 7 5 m and the height of base on which the lighthouse is 7 5 m see fig 1 b the measured force time data is used for further analysis and visualization of load events as follows 2 1 signal processing since the load panels were measuring the normal forces only the resultant force acting on the lighthouse was resolved from the individual total forces measured by the panels these forces were split into two components referring to a fixed n e coordinate system of the force measurement system one of the purposes of this study was to calibrate numerical and material model for these type of load events thus from the simulation point of view it was better to have a coordinate system which corresponded to the ice drift direction so further data processing was done to generate two force components in a x y coordinate system where the y axis was parallel to the ice drift direction in this way ice to structure friction contribution could be added later into force analysis see sand and fransson 2017 this was achieved as follows the panel forces were split into components referring to a x y coordinate system based on ice drift direction angle Œ∏ in this x y coordinate system x direction was normal to ice drift direction and y direction was parallel to ice drift direction the following equations were used to calculate the total resultant force the vector sum of the load panels normal to the drift direction p x and parallel to the drift direction p y were defined as 1 p x i 1 n p p x i p y i 1 n p p y i i 1 2 n p where n p 9 is the total number of active panels the contribution from each load panel to the vector sum p x and p y is 2 p x i p i cos Œ≤ cos Œ≤ sin Œ± i Œº sin Œ± i cos Œ± i p y i p i max 0 cos Œ± i Œº max 0 sin Œ± i where p i i 1 2 n p are the measured panel forces acting normal to the face of the panel and Œº is the ice to structure friction angles Œ± i are measured from the drift direction to centre of each panel as defined in fig 1 3 Œ± i œï Œ± 0 n i i 1 2 n p where n p 5 is the panel number normal to the drift direction Œ± 0 18 is panel coverage angle and œÜ is the angle measured from centre of panel n to the drift direction 4 œï Œ∏ n 1 2 Œ± 0 angles Œ≤ i are introduced to keep track on the sign of the contributing forces to the vector sum acting normal to the drift direction 5 Œ≤ 5 n p 3 n i Œ± 0 œï where n p 9 is the total is number of active panel and n 5 is the panel number normal to drift direction the total global ice load p t is calculated from the forces p x and p y acting in x direction and y direction 2 2 sub load events two load events were identified from the strice 2002 database for further analysis the load event 1 identified as 0603 0600 in the measurement database is from march 6 2002 database which starts at 07 24 00 and ends at 07 58 54 the load event 2 identified as 2103 0900 in the measurement database is from march 21 2002 which starts at 20 29 00 and ends at 21 03 00 the vector sum of the load panels in x y coordinate system is shown in fig 2 and fig 4 for load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 2103 0900 respectively for the simulation purposes a span of 120 s from force time history was selected for comparison the sub load event 1 0603 0600 is a span of 0 120 s and the sub load event 2 is a span of 60 180 s figs 3 and 4 gives the summary of ice force distribution on each individual panel for sub load event 1 and sub load event 2 respectively in case of load event 1 despite the ice drift was from 45 at 0 25 m s maximum force was recorded at panel 1 north this might be due to pre existing ice accumulation around the structure the water stage level recorded was 0 3 m which means local forces from thinner ice might be missing this confirms by looking at segmented load panel see fig 3b in case of load event 2 maximum force was recorded at panel 5 see fig 5 a the load event has avg ice thickness equals to 0 5 m the major environmental data recorded for these sub load events are shown in table 1 the summary of ice pressure acting on each individual panel for sub load event 1 0603 0600 and sub load event 2 2103 0900 is given in table 2 and table 3 respectively 3 constitutive relationships for the ice rubble field at freezing temperature varying degree of porosity and freeze bond strength or cohesive strength can exist across the depth of ice rubble field often ice rubble as a material has been characterized using properties from soil mechanics such as shear strength friction angle and cohesion the shear strength of the ice rubble has four components namely interlocking frictional contacts freeze bonding and failure of the ice blocks hopkins 1991 the interlocking and frictional resistance are macro level phenomena and affected by the shape and the size of the ice blocks whereas the breaking of the freeze bonds and failure of the ice blocks are considered as micro level phenomena controlled by tensile compressive and shear strength therefore both phenomena should be addressed adequately in the material model a study of repetto llamazares et al 2011 suggests that a mohr coulomb like failure model can be appropriate for the representation the freeze bond shear strength as a function of the normal confinement the mohr coulomb criterion can be used to estimate the strength of ice rubble see iso19906 2010 in the mohr coulomb yield criterion the ice rubble behaves as an elastic ideal plastic material for representative volume for bulk elements an isotropic elastic plastic material model was proposed by hilding et al 2012 and hilding et al 2011 wang et al 2018 has reported a decrease in the mean loads when using a linear softening plastic model compared to the perfect plastic model and concluded that contact forces decrease with cohesive softening of bulk elements however kulyakhtin and h√∏yland 2015 have shown that the mohr coulomb criterion cannot be used to define shear strength of ice rubble where high values of angle of internal friction involved despite these limitations a mohr coulomb yield criterion linear elastic and ideal plastic constitutive model can be utilized as bulk elements to simulate the microscopic failure at a macroscopic level in cem formulation in this study rubble field geometry was discretized with bulk elements connected to each other by cohesive elements a material model based on mohr coulomb criteria was used for bulk elements whereas mixed mode cohesive element formulation was used for cohesive elements see ls dyna 2017 the mohr coulomb criteria was used for solid elements only and intended to represent the ice blocks this criterion describes the dependence of shear stress œÑ on the normal stress œÉ n and is given as 6 œÑ max c œÉ n tan œÜ where c and œÜ are the cohesion and the angle of internal friction respectively which controls the fracture stress in mode i and mode ii respectively the compressive c x tensile t x and shear strength œÑ are given as follows 7 c x 2 c cos œÜ 1 sin œÜ t x 2 c cos œÜ 1 sin œÜ œÑ c in the parametric study the values of cohesion c and angle of internal friction œÜ were altered to determine their effect on load levels and failure pattern the mohr coulomb criterion considers effective shear strain as a deformation measurement which is also in accordance with the assumption of volume preservation 3 1 cohesive element formulation and constitutive relationships granular material such as ice rubble can be effectively analysed for its cracking behaviour by using the cohesive zone method it involves a gradual reduction of stress or strain in tension or shear loading during crack propagation in this method parameters describing the crack tip are used to the study of instability phenomena of cracked bodies these parameters include the strain energy release rate the fracture toughness and the crack tip opening displacement i e separation in the present research the tension softening is used to analyse the behaviour of ice rubble for the cohesive element a material model mat 186 based on three general irreversible mixed mode interaction cohesive formulations with arbitrary normalized traction separation law given by a load curve tslc was used to connect bulk elements see ls dyna 2017 this material model was chosen due to the flexibility it provides for the traction separation law the tabulated traction separation can be defined directly for both fracture modes i e i and ii see fig 6 a the interactions between fracture modes i and ii are considered and irreversible conditions are enforced through a damage formulation unloading reloading path pointing to from the origin the traction separation curve governs the deformation of cohesive elements subjected to tensile or shear stresses when the force or deformation reaches a critical value the cohesive element is deactivated or deleted resulting in crack formation and dissipation or release of the fracture energy g f a crack can grow via deformation and failure of neighbouring cohesive elements the traction separation behaviour of this model is mainly controlled by the energy release rate and peak traction the energy release rate g i c and peak traction t in normal direction defines mode i while the energy release rate g i i c and peak traction œÑ in tangential direction defines mode ii the maximum separation Œ¥ i f and Œ¥ i i f in mode i and mode ii are given respectively as 8 Œ¥ i f g i c a t s l c t Œ¥ i i f g i i c a t s l c œÑ where a t s l c is the total area of the normalized traction separation curve as shown in fig 6 b in the current research for mixed mode formulations of cohesive element the effective separation parameter tes and exponent of the mixed mode criteria xmu were set to 0 and 1 respectively the ultimate mixed mode displacement Œ¥ f i e total failure for this formulation of cohesive element is given as 9 Œ¥ f 1 Œ≤ 2 a t s l c t g i c x m u œÑ Œ≤ 2 g i i c x m u 1 x m u where Œ≤ Œ¥ i i Œ¥ i is the ratio of mode mixity in this model damage of the interface was considered i e irreversible conditions are enforced with loading or unloading paths coming from or going to the origin the total mixed mode relative displacement Œ¥m is defined as 10 Œ¥ m Œ¥ i 2 Œ¥ i i 2 where Œ¥ i Œ¥ 3 is the separation in normal direction i e mode i and 11 Œ¥ i i Œ¥ i 2 Œ¥ 2 2 is the separation in tangential direction i e mode ii to determine the shape of the traction separation curve tslc a three element setup was used the detailed description of calibration procedure was given in sand and fransson 2017 in this setup two bulk elements are joined together by a cohesive element then the bulk elements are subjected to uniaxial tensile loading i e pulling away from each other this causes the tensile softening of cohesive element as crack is assumed to occur between two elements the traction separation curve as shown in fig 6 b is based on damage formulation that accounts for strain softening the damaged traction t i d in mode i vary with the nominal traction t i in i direction i x y z as follows 12 t i d 1 d i t i the damage parameter d i increases from an initial value of zero to a maximum value of d max 0 99 moreover damage in the cohesive elements accumulates with traction t i in mode i in accordance with the following function 13 d i d max d 1 d 1 d exp c i t i t i where t i is the threshold value for damage in mode i in i th direction i x y z and d is a softening parameter set to 1 0 the mesh size sensitivity of these elements was controlled by maintaining constant fracture energy regardless of the element size this was achieved by including the equivalent element length l e q v cube root of the hexahedral element volume similarly the shape of the traction separation curve in mode ii can be obtained by assuming the same fracture toughness as in mode i i e k i c k i i c and threshold fracture stress œÑ the effective elastic modulus e eff for cohesive elements and is set equal to 5 6 e in this way a cohesive element stiffness will always be lower than for a bulk element the cohesive elements are act as a potential crack plane and deformation occurs according to a given traction separation curve when cohesive elements are subjected to tensile or shear stresses higher cohesive element stiffness can lead to numerical instability in explicit time stepping schemes in the mixed mode fracture where loading is both in normal and tangential directions a failure envelope type criterion that considers all stress and damage components can be utilized for more accurate fracture predictions 3 2 estimation and scaling of material properties in the rubble field structure interaction the value rubble porosity affects the magnitude of rubble load the rubble porosity Œ∑ r is not measured and value varies between 0 2 and 0 5 in various literature including h√∏yland 2000 assuming value of porosity close to 0 5 will underestimate the load as much of energy is absorbed by rubble itself whereas value close to 0 2 will results in higher load due to local crushing and shearing at the interaction zone for this analyses purpose ice rubble density œÅ r is assumed to be 700 kg m3 which gives porosity value of 0 24 the mechanical properties of ice rubble field are strongly dependent on the properties of the parent level ice sheet therefore it is likely to develop a relationship between properties of parent level ice sheet and ice rubble field fransson and stehn 1993 has shown the effect of porosity Œ∑ r on the elastic modulus and the fracture toughness of the warm ice using same the analogy as a preliminary approach properties of parent ice sheet were scaled by factor of 1 Œ∑ r to obtain properties of the ice rubble field the stiffness depends on the pressure rate in granular materials with high porosity such as the ice rubble field in this study following scaling was used to estimate the elastic modulus of the ice rubble field e r based on elastic modulus of ice e ice 14 e r e i c e 1 Œ∑ r mulmule and dempsey 1997 have studied mode i fracture of sea ice by using a fictitious crack model the behaviour of tslc is mainly controlled by fracture energy g i c for mode i failure and g i i c for mode ii failure fracture stress t for mode i failure and œÑ for mode ii failure and the shape of tslc the fracture energies g i c g i i c are defined as the energy release rate to create a unit crack and can be obtained from fracture mechanics tests for level ice based on in situ tests dempsey et al 1999 estimated fracture toughness for ice as between 0 170 m p a m for small ice specimen and 0 25 m p a m for large ice floes furthermore according to dempsey et al 2004 and dempsey et al 2012 the size independent fracture energy of first year ice is 15 j m2 and for multi year my ice the value is in the range of 23 47 j m2 however the uncertainty related to scale effect of test specimen is reported by timco and weeks 2010 in the simulations the fracture toughness varied between 0 100 and 0 250 m p a m it should also be noted that by using a relatively low value of fracture toughness the numerical model will become too brittle and too weak the critical fracture energy of the ice rubble field g r f can be expressed in terms of fracture toughness k i r c poison s ratio ŒΩ and elastic modulus e r as follows 15 g r f 1 ŒΩ 2 k i r c 2 e r similarly scaling of the fracture toughness for the ice rubble field based on its porosity can be done as follows 16 k i r c k i c 1 Œ∑ r so by using eqs 14 and 16 the fracture energy in eq 17 can be rewritten as follows 17 g r f 1 Œ∑ r g i c e f as the fragmentation of rubble field depends on complete dissipation of the fracture energy the fracture energy will be one important parameter that needs to be estimated as accurately as possible in the case of the rubble field the yield strength is very low compared to the level ice which means the failure of the ice rubble field mainly depends on the cohesive element properties a parametric study on the cohesive strength and fracture energy was performed to investigate the effects on load level failure mode and behaviour of ice rubble field the proposed scaling for properties of ice rubble field can be basis for further investigations in cem the tslc is used to define the relationship between traction t for mode i and œÑ for mode ii and separation Œ¥ as given in eq 8 the failure type ductile or brittle is mainly dependent on the shape of tslc two factors affect the shape of tsl namely the fracture stress and fracture energy the fracture stress is defined as the threshold stress to initiate a crack the three most common types of cohesive laws linear exponential and trapezoidal softening are commonly used in engineering practices to model the ductile type fracture a trapezoidal softening curve is used this type of curve has a softening behaviour with a significant plateau region after the peak to model brittle crack growth linear and exponential models are often used they give less fracture energy than the trapezoidal softening law as the area under the tslc represents the fracture energy per unit area i e the amount of energy dissipated when the crack was fully developed however based on experimental investigation of elastic plastic solids such as aluminium tvergaard and hutchinson 1992 and cornec et al 2003 have concluded that the effect of the tslc shape is insensitive to the resulting fracture behaviour as long as the fracture energy of the model is correct there are not any fixed and definitive criteria to select the shape of tslc as the cem is only an approximate mathematical representation of the physical fracture process modelling of the fracture process of ice rubble field is complicated due to high porosity and presence of cohesive bonds the tslc shape is affected by the change in fracture toughness of level ice k i c shear strength œÑ and angle of internal friction œÜ the tslc used in the parametric study associated with sub load event 2 are given in fig 7 to fig 9 the tslc with three different values of level ice fracture toughness used in scaling for mode i is given in fig 7 the tslc with two different values of fracture stress i e t i for mode i is given in fig 8 whereas the tslc for mode ii with three different values of fracture stress i e œÑ are given in fig 9 4 numerical modelling of ice rubble field interacting with the norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse the finite element method with lagrangian element formulation was chosen to simulate the lighthouse ice rubble field interaction load event the commercially available explicit finite element software ls dyna version r10 was used for modelling of ice rubble field and lighthouse the finite element model used to discretise the rubble field geometry had two different parts cohesive and non cohesive as shown in fig 10 b the cohesive elements were only used to discretise the middle part of ice rubble field termed as the cohesive part the cohesive part was supported by bulk elements with coarser mesh densities termed as non cohesive part this arrangement is useful in saving computational time as the number of nodes in the non action area are reduced also the purpose of the non cohesive part was to provide a confinement for the cohesive part the cohesive part was discretized with standard solid finite element e g hexahedral elements each individual solid element was connected to its neighbouring solid element using cohesive elements as finite thickness cohesive elements were found to perform better numerically than zero thickness elements see kuutti et al 2013 a very small thickness 10 4 mm is given to cohesive elements the shear strength of ice rubble is highly dependent on the boundary conditions see fransson and sandkvist 1985 ettema and urroz 1989 hopkins 1991 and timco and cornett 1999 therefore realistic boundary conditions are necessary to simulate load levels accurately the dimensions of ice rubble field used in simulations are shown in fig 10 b and are given in multiples of the diameter of structure d 7 5 m at water line the dimensions in x and y directions were kept five and six times the diameter of structure respectively the global axis system is shown in fig 10 the dimension in z direction was equal to the average thickness of the load event the outer nodes of ice rubble field were fixed in y and z direction the nodes at the edge of the opposite side of structure and side edges of ice rubble field geometry were fixed in x and y directions respectively the preliminary studies confirmed that the chosen dimensions of ice rubble field were not affecting the interaction process and load levels the lighthouse structure was modelled with 1 1 ratio using shell elements as per dimensions from strice 2002 database the bottom nodes at foundation of the lighthouse structures were fixed in all directions the general geometry and simplified finite element model used in the parametric analysis are shown in fig 10 the basic properties associated with ice rubble field are given in table 4 the elastic material model is used for lighthouse parts and the material properties used are given in table 5 furthermore ice rubble field was moved toward the structure with constant drift speed of the load event the model generation process was automated by using a special purpose matlab script the following assumptions were made in the finite element model 1 temperature variation in ice rubble is neglected i e ice rubble is assumed to have constant temperature 2 no spatial variation is considered in ice rubble i e ice rubble is assumed to have same material properties throughout 3 the volume of the ice element is conservative during the deformation 4 the strength of the rubble is uniform which means there is no spatial variation in the strength of the rubble field 5 thickness of the ice rubble field is equal to the average ice thickness of the load event the fully integrated solid hexahedral element formulation was used for a bulk element while 8 node cohesive element formulation elform 19 was chosen for a cohesive element the main drawback of hexahedral element type of mesh is zig zag crack pattern see wang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 lu et al 2014 konuk and yu 2010b in this type of mesh regardless of any mesh refinement a crack travel path is about 2 times longer than the intended crack path leading to an extra energy consumption the total error should be close to 1 2 the error can be reduced by using triangular shaped or tetrahedron mesh but with an increased computational time also it was reported by wang et al 2018 that the mean load increased with mesh refinement and convergence was not achieved in order to obtain realistic global horizontal loads lu et al 2014 suggested that mesh size preferably be twice the ice sheet thickness and has also shown that the fragmentation size is largely dependent on the element size a sufficiently small mesh size is required to simulate microcracks however computational time increases rapidly with smaller mesh size so it is impractical to use very small mesh size with cohesive elements to include the microcrack effect to address this issue some other techniques must be implemented for example an adaptive mesh refinement the crack pattern in ice rubble field and structure interaction is somewhat unknown and to keep the computational cost down hexahedral elements were used the mesh size was kept constant i e mesh sensitivity was not part of this study in this paper bulk element size for load event 1 0603 0600 was 200 200 and 190 in x y and z direction respectively and for load event 2 2103 0900 bulk element size was 200 200 and 125 in x y and z direction respectively in the numerical analysis the contact forces acting on the load panels were extracted by using force transducers note that the contact forces on the load panels were written in the global coordinate system and were transformed in direction normal and tangential to the load panels 4 1 hydrodynamic forces the buoyancy and drag forces of water are very important components in ice structure interaction simulation there are several methods available to include the buoyancy and drag into the numerical model for example the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale and cfd in which the water is represented as an explicit body in simulations but this explicit representation is very time consuming hence costly in the present study a cost effective way to include the buoyancy and the drag forces of water is presented by using a discrete mass spring dashpot system shown fig 11 the same method is used by sand and fransson 2017 to simulate level ice structure interaction with a lighthouse using cohesive element method a spring dashpot is connected to each node of the eight nodes of hexahedral element the buoyancy force f b i is a function of the displacement z t relative to waterline as shown in fig 11 b and c the buoyancy force on each fully submerged node of hexahedral bulk element of length l ex l ey and l ez in x y and z direction respectively was calculated as follows 18 f b i œÅ w g l e x l e y l e z 8 where f b i œÅ w and g are buoyancy force density of the water and gravitational acceleration l x l y and l z is the length of the hexahedral element in x y and z direction respectively the drag force f d i is defined by a basic viscous damping equation for an object moving with a vertical velocity v through a liquid 19 f d i 1 2 œÅ w v 2 c d l e x l e y 8 where c d is the drag coefficient and in all simulations the value of 1 05 was used which is equal to a drag coefficient of cube moving through a fluid then the total force f t i on each node for the discrete mass spring dashpot system in global z direction is given as 20 f t i f b i f d i œÅ r g l e x l e y l e z 8 where œÅ r is density of ice rubble 4 2 frictional forces when the force or deformation reaches a limit value the cohesive element is deactivated deleted from calculation once they are deleted free solid elements may interact with each other with pre defined contact condition in ls dyna the frictional coefficient Œº is assumed to be dependent on the relative velocity v rel of the surfaces in contact and calculated as follows 21 Œº Œº d Œº s Œº d e d c v r e l where Œº s Œº d and dc are the static dynamic and exponential decay coefficient of friction respectively the friction of saline ice was measured in a laboratory by kennedy et al 2000 and frederking and barker 2002 and in the field by sukhorukov and l√∏set 2013 the laboratory measurements by kennedy et al 2000 were done at low sliding velocities and with both saline and freshwater ice however the results of those experiments were for low sliding velocities only and do not indicate significant differences between the friction coefficients of saline and freshwater ice fortt and schulson 2007 suggested that peaked shape of friction curves versus sliding velocity was due to a change in sliding behaviour sukhorukov and l√∏set 2013 studied the friction of sea ice on sea ice performed in the barents sea and fjords at spitsbergen the presence of sea water in the sliding interface had very little effect on static and kinetic friction coefficients the measurement conducted in the field by sukhorukov and l√∏set 2013 give much higher friction coefficients than those obtained in the laboratory by kennedy et al 2000 this might be due to the fact that in the field the environment conditions are not easy to maintain and there might be additional processes like ploughing involved due to a higher roughness of the ice surface fransson et al 2011 showed that surface roughness speed and temperature play an important role in deciding the friction coefficient on ice surfaces similarly tikanm√§ki and sainio 2020 concluded that the surface roughness is the most influential parameter regarding the friction coefficient based on laboratory experiments the ice temperature was not measured for load events therefore an average of air temperature and water temperature values was used to estimate the ice temperature of ice for the sub load event for the sub load event 1 0603 0600 and for sub load event 2 2103 0900 the ice temperature t r was estimated to 6 c and 0 65 c respectively based on estimated ice temperature the decay coefficients were selected in such way that a fit was obtained to reported values of test data the static dynamic and decay friction coefficients used in simulations are given in table 6 modelled ice to ice friction coefficient vs values reported by others are shown in fig 12 two types of penalty contact formulations were defined an eroding single surface contact formulation was used for ice block to ice block contact due to failure of the ice sheet the ice block to ice block friction model mimics sea ice to sea ice friction as described in eq 21 for ice block to lighthouse contact an eroding surface to surface contact was used for this contact the static friction Œº s the dynamic Œº d and the decay d c coefficient were set to 0 1 0 05 and 0 02 respectively 4 3 damping when modelling ice structure interaction with cem the contact stiffness in the contact definition cannot be ignored see feng et al 2016 the kinetic energy of impacting ice sheet is converted into ice fragmentation which lead to bulk elements being expelled at high velocity this is a non physical phenomenon and results in predicting higher forces to obtain a stable model the viscous damping coefficient vdc was used in contact definition the vdc damps out unwanted oscillations normal to the contact segment the vdc should be an integer and expressed in percentage of critical damping the value of 20 recommended by ls dyna for impact simulation was applied in all performed simulations the lighthouse structure was modelled with the ratio of 1 1 and used material properties for steel concrete and sand consequently an appropriate damping force is needed to mimic the real world structural response to external forces such as collision with ice for the numerical lighthouse structure the damping frequency range deform method was chosen the user must input three parameters to define this damping for all numerical simulations 2 of the critical damping and the lowest f l o w and highest f h i g h frequencies were set to 2 5 hz and 200 hz respectively also the mass weighted damping was used to damp out the unrealistic motion of fragmented bulk elements as a preliminary approach the lowest eigenfrequency of the structure f l o w 2 5 h z was used in calculation of the damping coefficient as follows 22 d m a s s Œ∂ 4 œÄ f l o w the damping ratio Œ∂ was chosen to be 0 75 and 0 5 for sub load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 2103 0900 respectively 5 analysis of numerical simulation results the series of numerical simulations in the parametric study were conducted to identify and to quantify the influence of the parameters on simulation results the most important aspects of simulation results were the deformation of the ice rubble field failure pattern i e crack pattern the transportation of ice pieces from the crushed zone ice rubble formation process the piling of ice in front of the lighthouse the simulated force level and nature of force two parametric studies were performed one for each load event showing the effects of cohesion c angle of internal friction œÜ fracture toughness and friction decay coefficient in particular the measured force time history of two full scale sub load events were simulated using the cem the simulation time span was 60 s and was sufficient to capture the overall trend all the computations are done using double precision solver provide by ls dyna r10 0 with 8 cores cpus running in parallel on a server and supervised by a real time monitor the explicit time integration scheme was applied the mass scaling was applied to increase the stable time increment no significant increase of the mass of the model was observed due to the small thickness of the cohesive elements bulk elements experienced plasticity while being compacted in the failure region for sub load events 1 and 2 the data were sampled at frequency of 50 hz and 30 hz respectively the sampling frequency for all simulations was kept at 50 hz at the start of simulation t 0 the recorded force was zero as there was no contact between ice and lighthouse this differs from reality as a measured load event may begin with extra load on lighthouse due to unknown initial condition also the reported water level for load event 1 0603 0600 was above the load panels and initially ice was hitting only part of panels which makes the ice load highly sensitive to initial conditions consequently it is very difficult to mimic the initial conditions in simulations in simulation the initial condition is always zero loads or no contact while the measured load events always begin with load that has already built up on structure despite this limitation the simulation 1 1 was able to capture the dynamic nature for forces as well as ice accumulation behaviour the load event 2 has smaller average ice thickness than load event 1 0603 0600 which lead to lower panel loads in simulation 2 1 estimated material properties i e cohesion angle of internal friction and fracture toughness has yielded load peaks that match to the measured ones see fig 14 as the simulation progressed more and more ice came in contact with lighthouse which caused an increase in the force eventually reaching a stable level the load panels no 5 and 6 were showing highest force levels as they were aligned to the drift direction see fig 17 and fig 18 the frequent force drops can be seen in total panel force time figures figs 13 figs 14 and 19 25 the hexahedral elements used for bulk elements acted as small cantilever beams due to finite length and stiffness as deformation continued these small cantilever beams bended and buckled due to contact and friction the compressive crushing process was a cyclic process which causes these load drops the ice edge at the contact surface was moving either upwards or downwards during the loading and unloading phases the repeated vertical motion of the ice edge was caused by an imbalance in the counteracting forces that arise from the rubble pile formed above and below the ice sheet the ice rubble tends to form under the ice sheet near the crushed zone until it clears out two separate parametric studies were conducted for each sub load event in each simulation only one parameter was changed at a time thus enabling identification of the effect of that parameter both qualitatively and quantitatively input parameters of parametric studies for simulating the sub load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 2103 0900 are given in table 7 and table 8 respectively the comparison between measured and simulated global forces p t for sub load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 2103 0900 are presented in figs 13 and 14 respectively partially enlarged screenshots of the ice rubble field deformation in the front of the lighthouse for simulations 1 1 and 2 1 at t 2 12 20 37 50 and 60 s are shown in figs 15 and 16 respectively both simulations 1 1 and 2 1 captured the dynamic nature of the measured forces as well as the ice rubble formation process the detailed input to simulation 1 1 and 2 1 is given in table 9 the force drops near the end of simulation 1 1 see fig 13 which could be linked with clearing of rubble in front of lighthouse foundation in the simulation of sub load event 1 0603 0600 the lighthouse penetrated 15 m into the ice sheet at the end of the numerical analysis in simulation 2 1 the force drops were not as high as simulation 1 1 and the relatively narrow scatter of force was registered the occurrence of peaks and drops of the force can be associated with compressive failure contact friction and clearing of rubble in front of load panels initially the edge of the ice rubble field hits the structure which developed a local stress zone thus causing the ice to fail by crushing failure as the structure penetrated the ice rubble field ice load built up on several load panels and loose rubble started to form in front of the structure once the cohesive elements are deleted which further leads to further crushing failure the process of ice rubble formation starts as the simulation progressed ice rubble accumulated above and below water line the rate of ice rubble accumulation was different in the simulations of the two sub load events due to difference in ice drift speeds as a result at the end of 60 s the simulation 1 1 produces more ice rubble than simulation 2 1 the formation of crushing failure is a cyclic process and causes a cyclic loading response the continuous crushing failure of the ice sheet and clearing of ice rubble leads to the drops and rises of forces the vertical and horizontal motion of ice rubble was influenced by dynamic forces from friction and the ice rubble pile above and below the ice sheet the measured individual load event panel force data was also compared with numerical simulation 1 1 and 2 1 in figs 17 and 18 respectively at the start of the numerical analysis panel pressure normal to panels 5 and 6 increased rapidly this pressure fluctuation corresponds to the repetitive occurrence of the crushing failure the panel 1 was nearly inactive during the simulated time the measured panel load distribution was somewhat different from the performed numerical simulations the maximum panel pressure occurred on the panels facing the drift direction i e panel 5 and panel 6 while the panel pressure was considerably lower on the panels at the outer edge in case of simulation of load event 1 0603 0600 the actual measured load applied on the panel no 1 was significantly higher than the simulated it can be related to the unknown initial condition of the load event 5 1 effect of change in cohesion and internal angle of friction in the present material model for cohesive elements the threshold fracture stress in mode i and ii are based on relationships given in eq 7 which are functions of cohesion c and angle of internal friction œÜ it is assumed that the ice sheet representing the ice rubble field is elastic before reaching the threshold fracture stress after the first crack the ice rubble field is more prone to develop cracks in the vicinity of the initial crack once the crack is complete i e fracture energy is reached the ice rubble field behaves more like a viscous fluid when threshold fracture stress in mode i or mode ii decreases keeping same fracture energy the traction separation curve tends to exhibit ductile type fracture this results in narrow scatter of forces in the case of the decrease in the fracture stress in mode ii i e shear strength cracks go sideways as opposed to the case of decrease in fracture stress in mode i i e tensile strength the values used for cohesion and angle of internal friction were arbitrary and chosen to fit the peak load levels from load event a comparison of total panel forces of load event 1 0603 0600 and numerical simulation 1 1 and 1 2 is shown in fig 19 the decrease in cohesion from 67 kpa to 36 kpa 46 decrease resulted in a decrease of total panel forces by 27 for sub load event 1 0603 0600 fig 19 whereas the comparison of total panel forces of load event 2 2103 0900 to numerical simulation 2 1 and 2 2 is shown in fig 20 while increase in cohesion from 36 kpa to 67 kpa 86 increase mean forces increase by 124 as shown in fig 20 for sub load event 2 2103 0900 the angle of internal friction œÜ controls the tensile strength t and thus the fracture stress in mode i as the angle of internal friction œÜ is inversely proportional to tensile strength its decrease results in an increase of the tensile strength the effect of a change in the angle of internal friction on the total panel force for the sub load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 is shown in figs 21 and 22 three input values of 20 40 and 60 were used in simulation of sub load events 1 and 2 a wider scatter of forces is registered with increase in angle values in comparison the simulation 1 4 registered highest peak forces shown in fig 21 and the simulation 2 4 in fig 22 registered the highest peak forces whereas the lowest value of angle of internal friction i e 20 registered a narrow scatter of total forces 5 2 effect of change in fracture toughness the effects of changes in the fracture toughness on the numerical results compared with the load event were investigated the scaling of fracture toughness of level ice was done by using scaling formula presented in eq 16 the range for fracture toughness of level ice used was from 0 100 to 0 250 m p a m then the fracture energy was estimated based on eq 17 the comparison of different values of fracture toughness for level ice used in scaling in terms of total force time histories is shown in figs 23 and 24 the fracture toughness has a significant effect on the tslc the increase in fracture toughness keeping elastic modulus same the total fracture energy is also increased see eq 15 this means that the tslc will get a comparatively longer tail i e model will exhibit ductile behaviour in fig 23 simulation of load event 1 0603 0600 narrow scatters can be seen for num sim 1 6 k i c 0 250 whereas in fig 24 simulation of load event 2 2103 0900 higher force was registered for num sim 2 7 k i c 0 250 comparatively 5 3 effect of change in decay coefficient when cohesive elements are deleted bulk elements become separated from the parent ice sheet then the contact condition can be applied to implement the frictional forces the frictional coefficient was assumed to be dependent on the relative velocity v rel of the surfaces in contact see section 4 3 the input values used in parametric study for static Œº s dynamic Œº d and decay dc coefficients are shown in table 6 two sets of input values of exponential decay coefficients are used in parametric study number 2 associated with load event 2 2103 0900 by changing the decay coefficient d c the range of dynamic friction coefficient can be changed the values of decay coefficients used in set 1 and set 2 equals to 6 61 and 2 the effect of change of the decay coefficient was only investigated for sub load event 2 while for sub load event 1 0603 0600 the value was kept constant at 10 4 fig 25 shows the effect of two different values of decay coefficient on the modelled total force time history for the sub load event 2 2103 0900 in addition to the shortcomings of the hexahedral element mesh described in section 4 this type of mesh has also a larger contact surface area leading to a higher frictional force component in comparison with the measured sum of panel forces plotted in fig 25 the simulation 2 5 yielded higher dynamic friction coefficient which resulted in higher frictional forces 5 4 panel line load the comparison of the spatial distributions of panel load for the load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 2103 0900 with numerical simulations is shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively the peak load mean load and standard deviation for each simulation in the parametric study is presented in table 10 and table 11 the distribution of average maximum and standard deviation of the panel load values for load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 2103 0900 showed local minimum on panel 1 and maximum on the panel 5 the overall distribution of the panel load had a parabolic like shape with maximum values on panels facing the drift direction and lower values on the panels located at edges of the panel spectrum the obtained numerical panel line load differed from the measured values which could be related to variable ice thickness and uncertainty in measurement of the water stage water level and drift angle wong and brown 2018 have reported that for the same ice properties a variation of 5 cm in thickness can result in a difference as high as 1 mn in horizontal load four different comparisons have been made for each load event namely a average panel line load b maximum panel line load c standard deviation of panel line load d panel line load at maximum global load p t max see fig 26 and fig 27 due to higher sampling rate despite the fact that the individual registered peak lasted for very short time it can give much higher load than the measured one 6 summary and conclusions the cohesive element method cem was used to simulate the interaction between the ice rubble field and norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse an explicit scheme was used to solve the finite element model in ls dyna the ice sheet was modelled using hexahedral elements bulk elements with the mohr coulomb linear elastic ideal plastic material model and the cohesive elements were inserted in between the bulk element mesh by duplicating nodes along all internal mesh boundaries the measurement data of selected sub load events was post processed to enable their comparison with simulation results a parametric study of simulations was performed and the effects of change in various parameters were documented the identification of the ice rubble structure load event was crucial the load events were chosen to be simulated based on logbook description drift angle and fairly constant ice thickness the drift angle was 45 with respect to north direction for both load events the measured average ice thickness and the drift speed were 0 760 m 0 25 m s for load event 1 0603 0600 and 0 5 m 0 15 m s for load event 2 2103 0900 the objectives of this study were to model the ice rubble field lighthouse interaction with cohesive element method and to study the effects of the various influential parameters on simulation results the numerical model used in the parametric study consists of hexahedral bulk element mesh connected by the cohesive elements and beam elements connected to each node of ice rubble field for buoyancy and drag the procedure of calibrating material models for bulk and cohesive elements require extensive sets of experimental data for example compressive strength tests shear strength tests and fracture toughness tests the absence of such experimental data requires the reliance on assumptions thus scaling of level ice material properties such as elastic modulus and fracture toughness was done to find suitable material properties for the ice rubble field the chosen scaling yielded reasonable material properties for the ice rubble field the average ice sheet thickness was estimated from laser and em measurements therefore the chosen ice thickness did not represent the natural variations in the ice sheet thickness correctly which may affect the accuracy of the model the assumption of homogeneity of material properties of ice rubble field may not be valid as ice sheet properties vary from within the ice rubble field based on the comparison of the time series for the global loads the influence of simulation parameters was shown however the presented numerical model has certain shortcomings regarding simulation of the nature of forces panel load levels and the fracture behaviour of the ice rubble field the general conclusions drawn here are based only on the cases studied in this paper and given below the discrete mass spring dashpot model is proposed to simulate the buoyancy and drag of ice blocks in water however accuracy of the discrete mass spring dashpot model is the subject of discussion the use of cohesive elements only for cohesive zone part of numerical model can reduce computational time without losing simulation accuracy the damping of the lighthouse was necessary to give realistic structural response under ice loading in the present study the damping method was applied with an ad hoc approach therefore the influence of the damping method on the failure mode of ice rubble field is not investigated here the damping effect of water on lighthouse is not modelled thus its contribution towards failure modes and load levels of ice rubble field is unknown the mixed mode formulations for cohesive element is successfully implement in this model to simulate ice rubble field structure interaction also the two element setup for calibration of cohesive elements is proposed the scaling used to estimate the ice rubble field properties was based on linear scaling factor of 1 Œ∑ r the ice rubble field can have different porosity profile along the depth therefore the depth dependent material properties cannot be scaled in this way especially that the dependency between the fracture toughness and porosity is unknown consequently more research is needed for finding an appropriate scaling factor the used bulk element material model i e mohr coulomb criteria did not have any softening feature implemented which may lead to an overestimation of the predicted forces the presented numerical model was able to capture the features of force time history such as load drops and peaks the rubble accumulation around the structure was also reasonable however measured data was not available to compare the rubble pile up dimensions the finite element size used in simulations is small enough to capture the macro cracking however to capture the micro cracking phenomena finer mesh size would be required furthermore hexahedral mesh tends to predict a higher load indicating the need of mesh shape and size reconsideration thus a tetrahedral element mesh can be adopted for future research to simulate realistic crack pattern the cohesion c value has direct effect on load levels higher cohesion values tend to give higher load levels whereas change in angle of internal friction has opposite trend the lower values of angle of internal friction œï produced higher load levels the nature force scatter is also changing with higher values of cohesion c giving wide scatter in contrast narrow force scatter was observed with higher values of angle of internal friction œï no general trend was observed with change of fracture toughness in case of load event 1 higher values of fracture toughness results in narrow scatter of force whereas in case of load event 2 higher values of fracture toughness registered highest forces with wider scatter of forces the decay coefficient used in set 1 d c 6 61 yielded lower dynamic friction coefficient which registered lower forces compared to set 2 d c 2 however it should be mentioned that the presented model is at a preliminary stage further developments as already suggested above are needed the simulation results showed potential to use this method to simulate ice interaction with other types of structures such as ships or marine vessels also this is a promising first step in showing the potential to simulate other types ice features for example ice ridge structure interaction the efforts to simulate various other ice load events will be furthermore

21001,an attempt has been made to predict the ice rubble field load on norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse by using cohesive element ce formulation two sub load events were selected to validate the numerical and material model used in simulation of interaction of the ice rubble field and lighthouse a literature review of simulation of rubble field structure interaction methods is also included in order to illustrate the knowledge gaps and highlight shortcomings of existing techniques a description of chosen ice rubble field load events and signal post processing is added a linear mohr coulomb material model was used for the bulk element for the cohesive element formulation a material model was chosen which is based on three irreversible mixed mode interaction with an arbitrary normalized traction separation law governed by a load curve the elastic modulus and fracture toughness for the ice rubble field were scaled using the ice rubble field porosity a parametric study was conducted and effects were documented the numerical model predicted similar values for maximum total force but average and standard deviation values of total force were higher than measured the observed load drops in measured force time histories were reproduced with reasonable accuracy in simulated force time histories keywords finite element analysis cohesive element method ice rubble structure interaction norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse 1 introduction the term ice rubble field can be used as generalised term for ice ridge fields where vast area of sea covered with ice blocks packed together the sea ice ridges are common ice feature in the arctic and subarctic sea which are the major load contributor on offshore and marine structures if icebergs are not present in that area the ice rubble is an integral part of ice ridges the ice rubble field is made up of piles of ice blocks and can be fully or partially consolidated the ice rubble field can be found in between colliding ice floes and can cover large areas the in situ testing gives opportunities to understanding the properties and failure of ice rubble in actual environmental conditions the ice rubble has always been considered as a granular material and can be described by the mohr coulomb criterion see iso19906 2010 therefore efforts have been devoted in the past to find reasonable values of the cohesion and the angle of internal friction see cornett and timco 1996 l√∏set and sayed 1993 timco et al 1992 sayed et al 1992 urroz and robert 1987 gale et al 1987 heinonen 2004 and liferov and bonnemaire 2005 literature reviews of test methods and analysis of results can be found in ettema and urroz 1989 timco and cornett 1999 kulyakhtin and h√∏yland 2014 and boroojerdi et al 2020 but numerical simulation methods have an advantage over laboratory and in situ testing of ice rubble as they offer a greater number of design parameters to be tested under controlled conditions therefore interest in developing numerical simulation methods is increasing additionally simulation methods help to increase the accuracy of the analytical methods used to estimate the design loads the numerical simulations enable us to separate and identify the contributions from various parameters controlling the ice rubble field structure interaction process the ice rubble field is anisotropic material the ice rubble field presents challenges in terms of constitutive modelling due to for example the simultaneous presence of freeze bonds and discrete nature of the ice blocks the failure behaviour of ice rubble often called the failure mode is important information for the estimating of ice loads the ice rubble failure is dominated by mixed mode failure and the rubble deformation process is controlled by several factors including compressive strength cohesive strength fracture toughness and the ice to ice friction thus a robust and reliable numerical method is required to predict realistic load levels created by unconsolidated or partially consolidated ice rubble the local pressure data can be linked to global ice load see bjerk√•s 2004 however fransson and lundqvist 2006 have proposed a statistical approach to determine the correlations of segmental loads the failure process is extremely sensitive to the initial conditions for example two different failure modes can be observed with and without the ice rubble present at the interaction zone see m√§√§tt√§nen and hoikkanen 1990 the failure process of ice rubble is also affected by the parent ice thickness rubble pile height ice blocks sizes the temperature salinity and the strain rate interacting structural properties such as its inclination width and stiffness also affects the failure process the numerical simulations can be used to study the ice rubble field loads on structures the challenges involved in the application of numerical methods in ice mechanics are well documented in bergan et al 2010 in the simulations of ice rubble field structure interactions it is necessary to consider a complicated process of fragmentation of ice formation and motion of ice blocks and interactions between the blocks as well as between the blocks and the structure the discrete element method dem has been used to simulation of fracture prone and discrete material such as ice rubble see evgin et al 1992a evgin et al 1992b hopkins 1997 and paavilainen et al 2011 in dem each ice block is modelled as separate non continuum element usually spherical the forces acting on each element are then computed from the initial properties and the relevant physical laws and contact models the combined fem dem approach was proposed to eliminate the rigidity issue of bulk element in the simulation of ice rubble structure interactions see polojarvi and tuhkuri 2009 paavilainen et al 2011 and polojarvi and tuhkuri 2013 in their approach dem was used to model the contact interactions and finite elements were used as constitutive relation which dictates the behaviour and the ice fracture therefore it is clear that without solving mesh entanglement problem conventional fem cannot be used to simulate ice rubble structure interaction in contrast wong and brown 2018 have proposed a model of the interaction between ice and conical bridge pier based on fem where ice sheet is modelled as linear elastic model and considers loads from ice rubble build up the recent development in mesh free formulation techniques of sph gives an accurate solution for large displacements that remain in continuum domain of lagrangian framework for application of sph formulation to simulate a behaviour of ice rubble in the punch through test see patil et al 2015 the same technique has been used to simulate behaviour of brash ice in an in situ test by patil et al 2020 a numerical technique called the cohesive zone model czm has been used for analysis of fracture in brittle and ductile materials see barenblatt 1962 and dugdale 1960 the implementation of the czm into numerical analysis has been termed the cohesive element method cem the cem requires the insertion of inter elements between bulk elements in the conventional finite element mesh upon reaching the threshold limit stress the inter elements cohesive elements fail and are removed from the calculation thus enabling the simulation of a crack in ice these newly formed finite element surfaces are then free to interact with each other the cem is based on the robust mathematical framework of conventional fem and is capable of explicitly simulating the fracture process zone fpz which is confined by finite element boundaries the cohesive element does not have any significant physical mass thus removing them does not violate any mass conservation law the cohesive elements describe the cohesive forces in the material when a fracture occurs the cohesive element method is not new when it comes to simulating interaction between level ice and structure see g√ºrtner 2009 konuk and yu 2010a konuk and yu 2010b daiyan and sand 2011 kuutti et al 2013 lu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the limitations and difficulties associated with the application of cohesive element method are highlighted by pang et al 2015 in this paper a numerical model is used to simulate the ice rubble field structure interaction process using cohesive element method cem the details of constitutive material models used for bulk elements and cohesive elements are given both material models are well described and implemented in the ls dyna finite element code a special purpose matlab 2019 script was written to post process the load event acquired measured data as well to create numerical model and post process the simulation results this numerical model is used in two separate parametric studies to investigate the effect of influential parameters such as cohesive strength angle of internal friction fracture toughness and exponential decay coefficient the numerical results are compared with the load event time series and the conclusions are drawn based on merit and drawbacks of the material model and numerical method 2 ice rubble field load event data full scale measurements of the ice loads at norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse were obtained in two measurement campaigns validation on low level ice forces on coastal structures loleif and measurements of structure in ice strice from 1999 to 2003 the ice forces acting on panels mounted on the lighthouse at water level and environmental variables such as ice thickness wind speeds air temperatures water stage etc were recorded and documented accelerometers tiltmeters and inclinometers were also used to determine the structural response under ice loading additionally continuous video recording from four different cameras was done for later interpretation of the data and analysis a detailed logging of ice condition observations and failure modes was conducted during the measurement periods the detailed description of the experimental setup at the norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse is given elsewhere see jochmann and schwarz 2000 haas and jochmann 2003 and bjerk√•s 2006 therefore only a brief introduction will be presented herein in this paper two load events were selected from strice 2002 measurement campaign data for further study the selected load events were further post processed to extract and visualise the valuable information the norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse was instrumented with 9 nine panels to measure the ice contact forces at the waterline the panels covered a span of 162 capturing ice loads from the north to the southeast the panel no 9 was oriented to the east and divided into 8 subpanels which permitted the detection of ice forces at different depths subpanels 9 1 and 9 2 make up the top row followed by subpanels 9 3 and 9 4 in the second row 9 5 and 9 6 in the third row and 9 7 and 9 8 in the bottom row in the actual measurement setup the original panel numbers were not in sequence to maintain the continuity and to avoid any confusion in later force analysis new panel numbers shown in squares were assigned see fig 1 a the ice conditions were monitored as well the waterline diameter of the lighthouse pier was 7 5 m and the height of base on which the lighthouse is 7 5 m see fig 1 b the measured force time data is used for further analysis and visualization of load events as follows 2 1 signal processing since the load panels were measuring the normal forces only the resultant force acting on the lighthouse was resolved from the individual total forces measured by the panels these forces were split into two components referring to a fixed n e coordinate system of the force measurement system one of the purposes of this study was to calibrate numerical and material model for these type of load events thus from the simulation point of view it was better to have a coordinate system which corresponded to the ice drift direction so further data processing was done to generate two force components in a x y coordinate system where the y axis was parallel to the ice drift direction in this way ice to structure friction contribution could be added later into force analysis see sand and fransson 2017 this was achieved as follows the panel forces were split into components referring to a x y coordinate system based on ice drift direction angle Œ∏ in this x y coordinate system x direction was normal to ice drift direction and y direction was parallel to ice drift direction the following equations were used to calculate the total resultant force the vector sum of the load panels normal to the drift direction p x and parallel to the drift direction p y were defined as 1 p x i 1 n p p x i p y i 1 n p p y i i 1 2 n p where n p 9 is the total number of active panels the contribution from each load panel to the vector sum p x and p y is 2 p x i p i cos Œ≤ cos Œ≤ sin Œ± i Œº sin Œ± i cos Œ± i p y i p i max 0 cos Œ± i Œº max 0 sin Œ± i where p i i 1 2 n p are the measured panel forces acting normal to the face of the panel and Œº is the ice to structure friction angles Œ± i are measured from the drift direction to centre of each panel as defined in fig 1 3 Œ± i œï Œ± 0 n i i 1 2 n p where n p 5 is the panel number normal to the drift direction Œ± 0 18 is panel coverage angle and œÜ is the angle measured from centre of panel n to the drift direction 4 œï Œ∏ n 1 2 Œ± 0 angles Œ≤ i are introduced to keep track on the sign of the contributing forces to the vector sum acting normal to the drift direction 5 Œ≤ 5 n p 3 n i Œ± 0 œï where n p 9 is the total is number of active panel and n 5 is the panel number normal to drift direction the total global ice load p t is calculated from the forces p x and p y acting in x direction and y direction 2 2 sub load events two load events were identified from the strice 2002 database for further analysis the load event 1 identified as 0603 0600 in the measurement database is from march 6 2002 database which starts at 07 24 00 and ends at 07 58 54 the load event 2 identified as 2103 0900 in the measurement database is from march 21 2002 which starts at 20 29 00 and ends at 21 03 00 the vector sum of the load panels in x y coordinate system is shown in fig 2 and fig 4 for load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 2103 0900 respectively for the simulation purposes a span of 120 s from force time history was selected for comparison the sub load event 1 0603 0600 is a span of 0 120 s and the sub load event 2 is a span of 60 180 s figs 3 and 4 gives the summary of ice force distribution on each individual panel for sub load event 1 and sub load event 2 respectively in case of load event 1 despite the ice drift was from 45 at 0 25 m s maximum force was recorded at panel 1 north this might be due to pre existing ice accumulation around the structure the water stage level recorded was 0 3 m which means local forces from thinner ice might be missing this confirms by looking at segmented load panel see fig 3b in case of load event 2 maximum force was recorded at panel 5 see fig 5 a the load event has avg ice thickness equals to 0 5 m the major environmental data recorded for these sub load events are shown in table 1 the summary of ice pressure acting on each individual panel for sub load event 1 0603 0600 and sub load event 2 2103 0900 is given in table 2 and table 3 respectively 3 constitutive relationships for the ice rubble field at freezing temperature varying degree of porosity and freeze bond strength or cohesive strength can exist across the depth of ice rubble field often ice rubble as a material has been characterized using properties from soil mechanics such as shear strength friction angle and cohesion the shear strength of the ice rubble has four components namely interlocking frictional contacts freeze bonding and failure of the ice blocks hopkins 1991 the interlocking and frictional resistance are macro level phenomena and affected by the shape and the size of the ice blocks whereas the breaking of the freeze bonds and failure of the ice blocks are considered as micro level phenomena controlled by tensile compressive and shear strength therefore both phenomena should be addressed adequately in the material model a study of repetto llamazares et al 2011 suggests that a mohr coulomb like failure model can be appropriate for the representation the freeze bond shear strength as a function of the normal confinement the mohr coulomb criterion can be used to estimate the strength of ice rubble see iso19906 2010 in the mohr coulomb yield criterion the ice rubble behaves as an elastic ideal plastic material for representative volume for bulk elements an isotropic elastic plastic material model was proposed by hilding et al 2012 and hilding et al 2011 wang et al 2018 has reported a decrease in the mean loads when using a linear softening plastic model compared to the perfect plastic model and concluded that contact forces decrease with cohesive softening of bulk elements however kulyakhtin and h√∏yland 2015 have shown that the mohr coulomb criterion cannot be used to define shear strength of ice rubble where high values of angle of internal friction involved despite these limitations a mohr coulomb yield criterion linear elastic and ideal plastic constitutive model can be utilized as bulk elements to simulate the microscopic failure at a macroscopic level in cem formulation in this study rubble field geometry was discretized with bulk elements connected to each other by cohesive elements a material model based on mohr coulomb criteria was used for bulk elements whereas mixed mode cohesive element formulation was used for cohesive elements see ls dyna 2017 the mohr coulomb criteria was used for solid elements only and intended to represent the ice blocks this criterion describes the dependence of shear stress œÑ on the normal stress œÉ n and is given as 6 œÑ max c œÉ n tan œÜ where c and œÜ are the cohesion and the angle of internal friction respectively which controls the fracture stress in mode i and mode ii respectively the compressive c x tensile t x and shear strength œÑ are given as follows 7 c x 2 c cos œÜ 1 sin œÜ t x 2 c cos œÜ 1 sin œÜ œÑ c in the parametric study the values of cohesion c and angle of internal friction œÜ were altered to determine their effect on load levels and failure pattern the mohr coulomb criterion considers effective shear strain as a deformation measurement which is also in accordance with the assumption of volume preservation 3 1 cohesive element formulation and constitutive relationships granular material such as ice rubble can be effectively analysed for its cracking behaviour by using the cohesive zone method it involves a gradual reduction of stress or strain in tension or shear loading during crack propagation in this method parameters describing the crack tip are used to the study of instability phenomena of cracked bodies these parameters include the strain energy release rate the fracture toughness and the crack tip opening displacement i e separation in the present research the tension softening is used to analyse the behaviour of ice rubble for the cohesive element a material model mat 186 based on three general irreversible mixed mode interaction cohesive formulations with arbitrary normalized traction separation law given by a load curve tslc was used to connect bulk elements see ls dyna 2017 this material model was chosen due to the flexibility it provides for the traction separation law the tabulated traction separation can be defined directly for both fracture modes i e i and ii see fig 6 a the interactions between fracture modes i and ii are considered and irreversible conditions are enforced through a damage formulation unloading reloading path pointing to from the origin the traction separation curve governs the deformation of cohesive elements subjected to tensile or shear stresses when the force or deformation reaches a critical value the cohesive element is deactivated or deleted resulting in crack formation and dissipation or release of the fracture energy g f a crack can grow via deformation and failure of neighbouring cohesive elements the traction separation behaviour of this model is mainly controlled by the energy release rate and peak traction the energy release rate g i c and peak traction t in normal direction defines mode i while the energy release rate g i i c and peak traction œÑ in tangential direction defines mode ii the maximum separation Œ¥ i f and Œ¥ i i f in mode i and mode ii are given respectively as 8 Œ¥ i f g i c a t s l c t Œ¥ i i f g i i c a t s l c œÑ where a t s l c is the total area of the normalized traction separation curve as shown in fig 6 b in the current research for mixed mode formulations of cohesive element the effective separation parameter tes and exponent of the mixed mode criteria xmu were set to 0 and 1 respectively the ultimate mixed mode displacement Œ¥ f i e total failure for this formulation of cohesive element is given as 9 Œ¥ f 1 Œ≤ 2 a t s l c t g i c x m u œÑ Œ≤ 2 g i i c x m u 1 x m u where Œ≤ Œ¥ i i Œ¥ i is the ratio of mode mixity in this model damage of the interface was considered i e irreversible conditions are enforced with loading or unloading paths coming from or going to the origin the total mixed mode relative displacement Œ¥m is defined as 10 Œ¥ m Œ¥ i 2 Œ¥ i i 2 where Œ¥ i Œ¥ 3 is the separation in normal direction i e mode i and 11 Œ¥ i i Œ¥ i 2 Œ¥ 2 2 is the separation in tangential direction i e mode ii to determine the shape of the traction separation curve tslc a three element setup was used the detailed description of calibration procedure was given in sand and fransson 2017 in this setup two bulk elements are joined together by a cohesive element then the bulk elements are subjected to uniaxial tensile loading i e pulling away from each other this causes the tensile softening of cohesive element as crack is assumed to occur between two elements the traction separation curve as shown in fig 6 b is based on damage formulation that accounts for strain softening the damaged traction t i d in mode i vary with the nominal traction t i in i direction i x y z as follows 12 t i d 1 d i t i the damage parameter d i increases from an initial value of zero to a maximum value of d max 0 99 moreover damage in the cohesive elements accumulates with traction t i in mode i in accordance with the following function 13 d i d max d 1 d 1 d exp c i t i t i where t i is the threshold value for damage in mode i in i th direction i x y z and d is a softening parameter set to 1 0 the mesh size sensitivity of these elements was controlled by maintaining constant fracture energy regardless of the element size this was achieved by including the equivalent element length l e q v cube root of the hexahedral element volume similarly the shape of the traction separation curve in mode ii can be obtained by assuming the same fracture toughness as in mode i i e k i c k i i c and threshold fracture stress œÑ the effective elastic modulus e eff for cohesive elements and is set equal to 5 6 e in this way a cohesive element stiffness will always be lower than for a bulk element the cohesive elements are act as a potential crack plane and deformation occurs according to a given traction separation curve when cohesive elements are subjected to tensile or shear stresses higher cohesive element stiffness can lead to numerical instability in explicit time stepping schemes in the mixed mode fracture where loading is both in normal and tangential directions a failure envelope type criterion that considers all stress and damage components can be utilized for more accurate fracture predictions 3 2 estimation and scaling of material properties in the rubble field structure interaction the value rubble porosity affects the magnitude of rubble load the rubble porosity Œ∑ r is not measured and value varies between 0 2 and 0 5 in various literature including h√∏yland 2000 assuming value of porosity close to 0 5 will underestimate the load as much of energy is absorbed by rubble itself whereas value close to 0 2 will results in higher load due to local crushing and shearing at the interaction zone for this analyses purpose ice rubble density œÅ r is assumed to be 700 kg m3 which gives porosity value of 0 24 the mechanical properties of ice rubble field are strongly dependent on the properties of the parent level ice sheet therefore it is likely to develop a relationship between properties of parent level ice sheet and ice rubble field fransson and stehn 1993 has shown the effect of porosity Œ∑ r on the elastic modulus and the fracture toughness of the warm ice using same the analogy as a preliminary approach properties of parent ice sheet were scaled by factor of 1 Œ∑ r to obtain properties of the ice rubble field the stiffness depends on the pressure rate in granular materials with high porosity such as the ice rubble field in this study following scaling was used to estimate the elastic modulus of the ice rubble field e r based on elastic modulus of ice e ice 14 e r e i c e 1 Œ∑ r mulmule and dempsey 1997 have studied mode i fracture of sea ice by using a fictitious crack model the behaviour of tslc is mainly controlled by fracture energy g i c for mode i failure and g i i c for mode ii failure fracture stress t for mode i failure and œÑ for mode ii failure and the shape of tslc the fracture energies g i c g i i c are defined as the energy release rate to create a unit crack and can be obtained from fracture mechanics tests for level ice based on in situ tests dempsey et al 1999 estimated fracture toughness for ice as between 0 170 m p a m for small ice specimen and 0 25 m p a m for large ice floes furthermore according to dempsey et al 2004 and dempsey et al 2012 the size independent fracture energy of first year ice is 15 j m2 and for multi year my ice the value is in the range of 23 47 j m2 however the uncertainty related to scale effect of test specimen is reported by timco and weeks 2010 in the simulations the fracture toughness varied between 0 100 and 0 250 m p a m it should also be noted that by using a relatively low value of fracture toughness the numerical model will become too brittle and too weak the critical fracture energy of the ice rubble field g r f can be expressed in terms of fracture toughness k i r c poison s ratio ŒΩ and elastic modulus e r as follows 15 g r f 1 ŒΩ 2 k i r c 2 e r similarly scaling of the fracture toughness for the ice rubble field based on its porosity can be done as follows 16 k i r c k i c 1 Œ∑ r so by using eqs 14 and 16 the fracture energy in eq 17 can be rewritten as follows 17 g r f 1 Œ∑ r g i c e f as the fragmentation of rubble field depends on complete dissipation of the fracture energy the fracture energy will be one important parameter that needs to be estimated as accurately as possible in the case of the rubble field the yield strength is very low compared to the level ice which means the failure of the ice rubble field mainly depends on the cohesive element properties a parametric study on the cohesive strength and fracture energy was performed to investigate the effects on load level failure mode and behaviour of ice rubble field the proposed scaling for properties of ice rubble field can be basis for further investigations in cem the tslc is used to define the relationship between traction t for mode i and œÑ for mode ii and separation Œ¥ as given in eq 8 the failure type ductile or brittle is mainly dependent on the shape of tslc two factors affect the shape of tsl namely the fracture stress and fracture energy the fracture stress is defined as the threshold stress to initiate a crack the three most common types of cohesive laws linear exponential and trapezoidal softening are commonly used in engineering practices to model the ductile type fracture a trapezoidal softening curve is used this type of curve has a softening behaviour with a significant plateau region after the peak to model brittle crack growth linear and exponential models are often used they give less fracture energy than the trapezoidal softening law as the area under the tslc represents the fracture energy per unit area i e the amount of energy dissipated when the crack was fully developed however based on experimental investigation of elastic plastic solids such as aluminium tvergaard and hutchinson 1992 and cornec et al 2003 have concluded that the effect of the tslc shape is insensitive to the resulting fracture behaviour as long as the fracture energy of the model is correct there are not any fixed and definitive criteria to select the shape of tslc as the cem is only an approximate mathematical representation of the physical fracture process modelling of the fracture process of ice rubble field is complicated due to high porosity and presence of cohesive bonds the tslc shape is affected by the change in fracture toughness of level ice k i c shear strength œÑ and angle of internal friction œÜ the tslc used in the parametric study associated with sub load event 2 are given in fig 7 to fig 9 the tslc with three different values of level ice fracture toughness used in scaling for mode i is given in fig 7 the tslc with two different values of fracture stress i e t i for mode i is given in fig 8 whereas the tslc for mode ii with three different values of fracture stress i e œÑ are given in fig 9 4 numerical modelling of ice rubble field interacting with the norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse the finite element method with lagrangian element formulation was chosen to simulate the lighthouse ice rubble field interaction load event the commercially available explicit finite element software ls dyna version r10 was used for modelling of ice rubble field and lighthouse the finite element model used to discretise the rubble field geometry had two different parts cohesive and non cohesive as shown in fig 10 b the cohesive elements were only used to discretise the middle part of ice rubble field termed as the cohesive part the cohesive part was supported by bulk elements with coarser mesh densities termed as non cohesive part this arrangement is useful in saving computational time as the number of nodes in the non action area are reduced also the purpose of the non cohesive part was to provide a confinement for the cohesive part the cohesive part was discretized with standard solid finite element e g hexahedral elements each individual solid element was connected to its neighbouring solid element using cohesive elements as finite thickness cohesive elements were found to perform better numerically than zero thickness elements see kuutti et al 2013 a very small thickness 10 4 mm is given to cohesive elements the shear strength of ice rubble is highly dependent on the boundary conditions see fransson and sandkvist 1985 ettema and urroz 1989 hopkins 1991 and timco and cornett 1999 therefore realistic boundary conditions are necessary to simulate load levels accurately the dimensions of ice rubble field used in simulations are shown in fig 10 b and are given in multiples of the diameter of structure d 7 5 m at water line the dimensions in x and y directions were kept five and six times the diameter of structure respectively the global axis system is shown in fig 10 the dimension in z direction was equal to the average thickness of the load event the outer nodes of ice rubble field were fixed in y and z direction the nodes at the edge of the opposite side of structure and side edges of ice rubble field geometry were fixed in x and y directions respectively the preliminary studies confirmed that the chosen dimensions of ice rubble field were not affecting the interaction process and load levels the lighthouse structure was modelled with 1 1 ratio using shell elements as per dimensions from strice 2002 database the bottom nodes at foundation of the lighthouse structures were fixed in all directions the general geometry and simplified finite element model used in the parametric analysis are shown in fig 10 the basic properties associated with ice rubble field are given in table 4 the elastic material model is used for lighthouse parts and the material properties used are given in table 5 furthermore ice rubble field was moved toward the structure with constant drift speed of the load event the model generation process was automated by using a special purpose matlab script the following assumptions were made in the finite element model 1 temperature variation in ice rubble is neglected i e ice rubble is assumed to have constant temperature 2 no spatial variation is considered in ice rubble i e ice rubble is assumed to have same material properties throughout 3 the volume of the ice element is conservative during the deformation 4 the strength of the rubble is uniform which means there is no spatial variation in the strength of the rubble field 5 thickness of the ice rubble field is equal to the average ice thickness of the load event the fully integrated solid hexahedral element formulation was used for a bulk element while 8 node cohesive element formulation elform 19 was chosen for a cohesive element the main drawback of hexahedral element type of mesh is zig zag crack pattern see wang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 lu et al 2014 konuk and yu 2010b in this type of mesh regardless of any mesh refinement a crack travel path is about 2 times longer than the intended crack path leading to an extra energy consumption the total error should be close to 1 2 the error can be reduced by using triangular shaped or tetrahedron mesh but with an increased computational time also it was reported by wang et al 2018 that the mean load increased with mesh refinement and convergence was not achieved in order to obtain realistic global horizontal loads lu et al 2014 suggested that mesh size preferably be twice the ice sheet thickness and has also shown that the fragmentation size is largely dependent on the element size a sufficiently small mesh size is required to simulate microcracks however computational time increases rapidly with smaller mesh size so it is impractical to use very small mesh size with cohesive elements to include the microcrack effect to address this issue some other techniques must be implemented for example an adaptive mesh refinement the crack pattern in ice rubble field and structure interaction is somewhat unknown and to keep the computational cost down hexahedral elements were used the mesh size was kept constant i e mesh sensitivity was not part of this study in this paper bulk element size for load event 1 0603 0600 was 200 200 and 190 in x y and z direction respectively and for load event 2 2103 0900 bulk element size was 200 200 and 125 in x y and z direction respectively in the numerical analysis the contact forces acting on the load panels were extracted by using force transducers note that the contact forces on the load panels were written in the global coordinate system and were transformed in direction normal and tangential to the load panels 4 1 hydrodynamic forces the buoyancy and drag forces of water are very important components in ice structure interaction simulation there are several methods available to include the buoyancy and drag into the numerical model for example the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale and cfd in which the water is represented as an explicit body in simulations but this explicit representation is very time consuming hence costly in the present study a cost effective way to include the buoyancy and the drag forces of water is presented by using a discrete mass spring dashpot system shown fig 11 the same method is used by sand and fransson 2017 to simulate level ice structure interaction with a lighthouse using cohesive element method a spring dashpot is connected to each node of the eight nodes of hexahedral element the buoyancy force f b i is a function of the displacement z t relative to waterline as shown in fig 11 b and c the buoyancy force on each fully submerged node of hexahedral bulk element of length l ex l ey and l ez in x y and z direction respectively was calculated as follows 18 f b i œÅ w g l e x l e y l e z 8 where f b i œÅ w and g are buoyancy force density of the water and gravitational acceleration l x l y and l z is the length of the hexahedral element in x y and z direction respectively the drag force f d i is defined by a basic viscous damping equation for an object moving with a vertical velocity v through a liquid 19 f d i 1 2 œÅ w v 2 c d l e x l e y 8 where c d is the drag coefficient and in all simulations the value of 1 05 was used which is equal to a drag coefficient of cube moving through a fluid then the total force f t i on each node for the discrete mass spring dashpot system in global z direction is given as 20 f t i f b i f d i œÅ r g l e x l e y l e z 8 where œÅ r is density of ice rubble 4 2 frictional forces when the force or deformation reaches a limit value the cohesive element is deactivated deleted from calculation once they are deleted free solid elements may interact with each other with pre defined contact condition in ls dyna the frictional coefficient Œº is assumed to be dependent on the relative velocity v rel of the surfaces in contact and calculated as follows 21 Œº Œº d Œº s Œº d e d c v r e l where Œº s Œº d and dc are the static dynamic and exponential decay coefficient of friction respectively the friction of saline ice was measured in a laboratory by kennedy et al 2000 and frederking and barker 2002 and in the field by sukhorukov and l√∏set 2013 the laboratory measurements by kennedy et al 2000 were done at low sliding velocities and with both saline and freshwater ice however the results of those experiments were for low sliding velocities only and do not indicate significant differences between the friction coefficients of saline and freshwater ice fortt and schulson 2007 suggested that peaked shape of friction curves versus sliding velocity was due to a change in sliding behaviour sukhorukov and l√∏set 2013 studied the friction of sea ice on sea ice performed in the barents sea and fjords at spitsbergen the presence of sea water in the sliding interface had very little effect on static and kinetic friction coefficients the measurement conducted in the field by sukhorukov and l√∏set 2013 give much higher friction coefficients than those obtained in the laboratory by kennedy et al 2000 this might be due to the fact that in the field the environment conditions are not easy to maintain and there might be additional processes like ploughing involved due to a higher roughness of the ice surface fransson et al 2011 showed that surface roughness speed and temperature play an important role in deciding the friction coefficient on ice surfaces similarly tikanm√§ki and sainio 2020 concluded that the surface roughness is the most influential parameter regarding the friction coefficient based on laboratory experiments the ice temperature was not measured for load events therefore an average of air temperature and water temperature values was used to estimate the ice temperature of ice for the sub load event for the sub load event 1 0603 0600 and for sub load event 2 2103 0900 the ice temperature t r was estimated to 6 c and 0 65 c respectively based on estimated ice temperature the decay coefficients were selected in such way that a fit was obtained to reported values of test data the static dynamic and decay friction coefficients used in simulations are given in table 6 modelled ice to ice friction coefficient vs values reported by others are shown in fig 12 two types of penalty contact formulations were defined an eroding single surface contact formulation was used for ice block to ice block contact due to failure of the ice sheet the ice block to ice block friction model mimics sea ice to sea ice friction as described in eq 21 for ice block to lighthouse contact an eroding surface to surface contact was used for this contact the static friction Œº s the dynamic Œº d and the decay d c coefficient were set to 0 1 0 05 and 0 02 respectively 4 3 damping when modelling ice structure interaction with cem the contact stiffness in the contact definition cannot be ignored see feng et al 2016 the kinetic energy of impacting ice sheet is converted into ice fragmentation which lead to bulk elements being expelled at high velocity this is a non physical phenomenon and results in predicting higher forces to obtain a stable model the viscous damping coefficient vdc was used in contact definition the vdc damps out unwanted oscillations normal to the contact segment the vdc should be an integer and expressed in percentage of critical damping the value of 20 recommended by ls dyna for impact simulation was applied in all performed simulations the lighthouse structure was modelled with the ratio of 1 1 and used material properties for steel concrete and sand consequently an appropriate damping force is needed to mimic the real world structural response to external forces such as collision with ice for the numerical lighthouse structure the damping frequency range deform method was chosen the user must input three parameters to define this damping for all numerical simulations 2 of the critical damping and the lowest f l o w and highest f h i g h frequencies were set to 2 5 hz and 200 hz respectively also the mass weighted damping was used to damp out the unrealistic motion of fragmented bulk elements as a preliminary approach the lowest eigenfrequency of the structure f l o w 2 5 h z was used in calculation of the damping coefficient as follows 22 d m a s s Œ∂ 4 œÄ f l o w the damping ratio Œ∂ was chosen to be 0 75 and 0 5 for sub load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 2103 0900 respectively 5 analysis of numerical simulation results the series of numerical simulations in the parametric study were conducted to identify and to quantify the influence of the parameters on simulation results the most important aspects of simulation results were the deformation of the ice rubble field failure pattern i e crack pattern the transportation of ice pieces from the crushed zone ice rubble formation process the piling of ice in front of the lighthouse the simulated force level and nature of force two parametric studies were performed one for each load event showing the effects of cohesion c angle of internal friction œÜ fracture toughness and friction decay coefficient in particular the measured force time history of two full scale sub load events were simulated using the cem the simulation time span was 60 s and was sufficient to capture the overall trend all the computations are done using double precision solver provide by ls dyna r10 0 with 8 cores cpus running in parallel on a server and supervised by a real time monitor the explicit time integration scheme was applied the mass scaling was applied to increase the stable time increment no significant increase of the mass of the model was observed due to the small thickness of the cohesive elements bulk elements experienced plasticity while being compacted in the failure region for sub load events 1 and 2 the data were sampled at frequency of 50 hz and 30 hz respectively the sampling frequency for all simulations was kept at 50 hz at the start of simulation t 0 the recorded force was zero as there was no contact between ice and lighthouse this differs from reality as a measured load event may begin with extra load on lighthouse due to unknown initial condition also the reported water level for load event 1 0603 0600 was above the load panels and initially ice was hitting only part of panels which makes the ice load highly sensitive to initial conditions consequently it is very difficult to mimic the initial conditions in simulations in simulation the initial condition is always zero loads or no contact while the measured load events always begin with load that has already built up on structure despite this limitation the simulation 1 1 was able to capture the dynamic nature for forces as well as ice accumulation behaviour the load event 2 has smaller average ice thickness than load event 1 0603 0600 which lead to lower panel loads in simulation 2 1 estimated material properties i e cohesion angle of internal friction and fracture toughness has yielded load peaks that match to the measured ones see fig 14 as the simulation progressed more and more ice came in contact with lighthouse which caused an increase in the force eventually reaching a stable level the load panels no 5 and 6 were showing highest force levels as they were aligned to the drift direction see fig 17 and fig 18 the frequent force drops can be seen in total panel force time figures figs 13 figs 14 and 19 25 the hexahedral elements used for bulk elements acted as small cantilever beams due to finite length and stiffness as deformation continued these small cantilever beams bended and buckled due to contact and friction the compressive crushing process was a cyclic process which causes these load drops the ice edge at the contact surface was moving either upwards or downwards during the loading and unloading phases the repeated vertical motion of the ice edge was caused by an imbalance in the counteracting forces that arise from the rubble pile formed above and below the ice sheet the ice rubble tends to form under the ice sheet near the crushed zone until it clears out two separate parametric studies were conducted for each sub load event in each simulation only one parameter was changed at a time thus enabling identification of the effect of that parameter both qualitatively and quantitatively input parameters of parametric studies for simulating the sub load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 2103 0900 are given in table 7 and table 8 respectively the comparison between measured and simulated global forces p t for sub load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 2103 0900 are presented in figs 13 and 14 respectively partially enlarged screenshots of the ice rubble field deformation in the front of the lighthouse for simulations 1 1 and 2 1 at t 2 12 20 37 50 and 60 s are shown in figs 15 and 16 respectively both simulations 1 1 and 2 1 captured the dynamic nature of the measured forces as well as the ice rubble formation process the detailed input to simulation 1 1 and 2 1 is given in table 9 the force drops near the end of simulation 1 1 see fig 13 which could be linked with clearing of rubble in front of lighthouse foundation in the simulation of sub load event 1 0603 0600 the lighthouse penetrated 15 m into the ice sheet at the end of the numerical analysis in simulation 2 1 the force drops were not as high as simulation 1 1 and the relatively narrow scatter of force was registered the occurrence of peaks and drops of the force can be associated with compressive failure contact friction and clearing of rubble in front of load panels initially the edge of the ice rubble field hits the structure which developed a local stress zone thus causing the ice to fail by crushing failure as the structure penetrated the ice rubble field ice load built up on several load panels and loose rubble started to form in front of the structure once the cohesive elements are deleted which further leads to further crushing failure the process of ice rubble formation starts as the simulation progressed ice rubble accumulated above and below water line the rate of ice rubble accumulation was different in the simulations of the two sub load events due to difference in ice drift speeds as a result at the end of 60 s the simulation 1 1 produces more ice rubble than simulation 2 1 the formation of crushing failure is a cyclic process and causes a cyclic loading response the continuous crushing failure of the ice sheet and clearing of ice rubble leads to the drops and rises of forces the vertical and horizontal motion of ice rubble was influenced by dynamic forces from friction and the ice rubble pile above and below the ice sheet the measured individual load event panel force data was also compared with numerical simulation 1 1 and 2 1 in figs 17 and 18 respectively at the start of the numerical analysis panel pressure normal to panels 5 and 6 increased rapidly this pressure fluctuation corresponds to the repetitive occurrence of the crushing failure the panel 1 was nearly inactive during the simulated time the measured panel load distribution was somewhat different from the performed numerical simulations the maximum panel pressure occurred on the panels facing the drift direction i e panel 5 and panel 6 while the panel pressure was considerably lower on the panels at the outer edge in case of simulation of load event 1 0603 0600 the actual measured load applied on the panel no 1 was significantly higher than the simulated it can be related to the unknown initial condition of the load event 5 1 effect of change in cohesion and internal angle of friction in the present material model for cohesive elements the threshold fracture stress in mode i and ii are based on relationships given in eq 7 which are functions of cohesion c and angle of internal friction œÜ it is assumed that the ice sheet representing the ice rubble field is elastic before reaching the threshold fracture stress after the first crack the ice rubble field is more prone to develop cracks in the vicinity of the initial crack once the crack is complete i e fracture energy is reached the ice rubble field behaves more like a viscous fluid when threshold fracture stress in mode i or mode ii decreases keeping same fracture energy the traction separation curve tends to exhibit ductile type fracture this results in narrow scatter of forces in the case of the decrease in the fracture stress in mode ii i e shear strength cracks go sideways as opposed to the case of decrease in fracture stress in mode i i e tensile strength the values used for cohesion and angle of internal friction were arbitrary and chosen to fit the peak load levels from load event a comparison of total panel forces of load event 1 0603 0600 and numerical simulation 1 1 and 1 2 is shown in fig 19 the decrease in cohesion from 67 kpa to 36 kpa 46 decrease resulted in a decrease of total panel forces by 27 for sub load event 1 0603 0600 fig 19 whereas the comparison of total panel forces of load event 2 2103 0900 to numerical simulation 2 1 and 2 2 is shown in fig 20 while increase in cohesion from 36 kpa to 67 kpa 86 increase mean forces increase by 124 as shown in fig 20 for sub load event 2 2103 0900 the angle of internal friction œÜ controls the tensile strength t and thus the fracture stress in mode i as the angle of internal friction œÜ is inversely proportional to tensile strength its decrease results in an increase of the tensile strength the effect of a change in the angle of internal friction on the total panel force for the sub load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 is shown in figs 21 and 22 three input values of 20 40 and 60 were used in simulation of sub load events 1 and 2 a wider scatter of forces is registered with increase in angle values in comparison the simulation 1 4 registered highest peak forces shown in fig 21 and the simulation 2 4 in fig 22 registered the highest peak forces whereas the lowest value of angle of internal friction i e 20 registered a narrow scatter of total forces 5 2 effect of change in fracture toughness the effects of changes in the fracture toughness on the numerical results compared with the load event were investigated the scaling of fracture toughness of level ice was done by using scaling formula presented in eq 16 the range for fracture toughness of level ice used was from 0 100 to 0 250 m p a m then the fracture energy was estimated based on eq 17 the comparison of different values of fracture toughness for level ice used in scaling in terms of total force time histories is shown in figs 23 and 24 the fracture toughness has a significant effect on the tslc the increase in fracture toughness keeping elastic modulus same the total fracture energy is also increased see eq 15 this means that the tslc will get a comparatively longer tail i e model will exhibit ductile behaviour in fig 23 simulation of load event 1 0603 0600 narrow scatters can be seen for num sim 1 6 k i c 0 250 whereas in fig 24 simulation of load event 2 2103 0900 higher force was registered for num sim 2 7 k i c 0 250 comparatively 5 3 effect of change in decay coefficient when cohesive elements are deleted bulk elements become separated from the parent ice sheet then the contact condition can be applied to implement the frictional forces the frictional coefficient was assumed to be dependent on the relative velocity v rel of the surfaces in contact see section 4 3 the input values used in parametric study for static Œº s dynamic Œº d and decay dc coefficients are shown in table 6 two sets of input values of exponential decay coefficients are used in parametric study number 2 associated with load event 2 2103 0900 by changing the decay coefficient d c the range of dynamic friction coefficient can be changed the values of decay coefficients used in set 1 and set 2 equals to 6 61 and 2 the effect of change of the decay coefficient was only investigated for sub load event 2 while for sub load event 1 0603 0600 the value was kept constant at 10 4 fig 25 shows the effect of two different values of decay coefficient on the modelled total force time history for the sub load event 2 2103 0900 in addition to the shortcomings of the hexahedral element mesh described in section 4 this type of mesh has also a larger contact surface area leading to a higher frictional force component in comparison with the measured sum of panel forces plotted in fig 25 the simulation 2 5 yielded higher dynamic friction coefficient which resulted in higher frictional forces 5 4 panel line load the comparison of the spatial distributions of panel load for the load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 2103 0900 with numerical simulations is shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively the peak load mean load and standard deviation for each simulation in the parametric study is presented in table 10 and table 11 the distribution of average maximum and standard deviation of the panel load values for load event 1 0603 0600 and 2 2103 0900 showed local minimum on panel 1 and maximum on the panel 5 the overall distribution of the panel load had a parabolic like shape with maximum values on panels facing the drift direction and lower values on the panels located at edges of the panel spectrum the obtained numerical panel line load differed from the measured values which could be related to variable ice thickness and uncertainty in measurement of the water stage water level and drift angle wong and brown 2018 have reported that for the same ice properties a variation of 5 cm in thickness can result in a difference as high as 1 mn in horizontal load four different comparisons have been made for each load event namely a average panel line load b maximum panel line load c standard deviation of panel line load d panel line load at maximum global load p t max see fig 26 and fig 27 due to higher sampling rate despite the fact that the individual registered peak lasted for very short time it can give much higher load than the measured one 6 summary and conclusions the cohesive element method cem was used to simulate the interaction between the ice rubble field and norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse an explicit scheme was used to solve the finite element model in ls dyna the ice sheet was modelled using hexahedral elements bulk elements with the mohr coulomb linear elastic ideal plastic material model and the cohesive elements were inserted in between the bulk element mesh by duplicating nodes along all internal mesh boundaries the measurement data of selected sub load events was post processed to enable their comparison with simulation results a parametric study of simulations was performed and the effects of change in various parameters were documented the identification of the ice rubble structure load event was crucial the load events were chosen to be simulated based on logbook description drift angle and fairly constant ice thickness the drift angle was 45 with respect to north direction for both load events the measured average ice thickness and the drift speed were 0 760 m 0 25 m s for load event 1 0603 0600 and 0 5 m 0 15 m s for load event 2 2103 0900 the objectives of this study were to model the ice rubble field lighthouse interaction with cohesive element method and to study the effects of the various influential parameters on simulation results the numerical model used in the parametric study consists of hexahedral bulk element mesh connected by the cohesive elements and beam elements connected to each node of ice rubble field for buoyancy and drag the procedure of calibrating material models for bulk and cohesive elements require extensive sets of experimental data for example compressive strength tests shear strength tests and fracture toughness tests the absence of such experimental data requires the reliance on assumptions thus scaling of level ice material properties such as elastic modulus and fracture toughness was done to find suitable material properties for the ice rubble field the chosen scaling yielded reasonable material properties for the ice rubble field the average ice sheet thickness was estimated from laser and em measurements therefore the chosen ice thickness did not represent the natural variations in the ice sheet thickness correctly which may affect the accuracy of the model the assumption of homogeneity of material properties of ice rubble field may not be valid as ice sheet properties vary from within the ice rubble field based on the comparison of the time series for the global loads the influence of simulation parameters was shown however the presented numerical model has certain shortcomings regarding simulation of the nature of forces panel load levels and the fracture behaviour of the ice rubble field the general conclusions drawn here are based only on the cases studied in this paper and given below the discrete mass spring dashpot model is proposed to simulate the buoyancy and drag of ice blocks in water however accuracy of the discrete mass spring dashpot model is the subject of discussion the use of cohesive elements only for cohesive zone part of numerical model can reduce computational time without losing simulation accuracy the damping of the lighthouse was necessary to give realistic structural response under ice loading in the present study the damping method was applied with an ad hoc approach therefore the influence of the damping method on the failure mode of ice rubble field is not investigated here the damping effect of water on lighthouse is not modelled thus its contribution towards failure modes and load levels of ice rubble field is unknown the mixed mode formulations for cohesive element is successfully implement in this model to simulate ice rubble field structure interaction also the two element setup for calibration of cohesive elements is proposed the scaling used to estimate the ice rubble field properties was based on linear scaling factor of 1 Œ∑ r the ice rubble field can have different porosity profile along the depth therefore the depth dependent material properties cannot be scaled in this way especially that the dependency between the fracture toughness and porosity is unknown consequently more research is needed for finding an appropriate scaling factor the used bulk element material model i e mohr coulomb criteria did not have any softening feature implemented which may lead to an overestimation of the predicted forces the presented numerical model was able to capture the features of force time history such as load drops and peaks the rubble accumulation around the structure was also reasonable however measured data was not available to compare the rubble pile up dimensions the finite element size used in simulations is small enough to capture the macro cracking however to capture the micro cracking phenomena finer mesh size would be required furthermore hexahedral mesh tends to predict a higher load indicating the need of mesh shape and size reconsideration thus a tetrahedral element mesh can be adopted for future research to simulate realistic crack pattern the cohesion c value has direct effect on load levels higher cohesion values tend to give higher load levels whereas change in angle of internal friction has opposite trend the lower values of angle of internal friction œï produced higher load levels the nature force scatter is also changing with higher values of cohesion c giving wide scatter in contrast narrow force scatter was observed with higher values of angle of internal friction œï no general trend was observed with change of fracture toughness in case of load event 1 higher values of fracture toughness results in narrow scatter of force whereas in case of load event 2 higher values of fracture toughness registered highest forces with wider scatter of forces the decay coefficient used in set 1 d c 6 61 yielded lower dynamic friction coefficient which registered lower forces compared to set 2 d c 2 however it should be mentioned that the presented model is at a preliminary stage further developments as already suggested above are needed the simulation results showed potential to use this method to simulate ice interaction with other types of structures such as ships or marine vessels also this is a promising first step in showing the potential to simulate other types ice features for example ice ridge structure interaction the efforts to simulate various other ice load events will be furthermore

and operated by nordlaks oppdrett as located in √∏ksfjorden lofoten islands norway 68 24 35 5 n 15 25 44 8 e fig 1 and is placed in a fjord which has a narrow strait to the north leading into a larger basin with depths up to 104 m the farm consists of nine cages arranged in a single row from west to east and spans an area with a depth of 100 m data were collected from the third westernmost cage with stocked cages at either sides of the cage all cages at fornes had a circumference of 160 m and were equipped with conical nets fig 1 the net had a solidity of 0 16 and was 55 m deep with a concrete weight of 2 4 tonnes in water attached to the tip of the cone the shielding skirt applied was a permeable canvas lice skirt norwegian weather protection frekhaug norway with a solidity of 51 mesh opening of 350 350 Œºm and a depth of 10 m the skirt was weighted with 2 kg m lead rope at the bottom and installed as a cylinder around the conical net roughly 10 days prior to measurements were carried out the skirt is one piece of fabric installed with a 10 m overlap the biomass in the cage during the experiment was 750 tonnes with 191 310 fish with an average weight of 3 8 kg 2 2 equipment description adv and dcp current speed and direction outside the cage were recorded using two current profilers attached to anchoring buoys on both sides of the cage pointing downwards with a vertical resolution cell size of 1 m to the south west of the cage in position b fig 1 an aanderaa seaguard ii doppler current profiler dcp measured continuously with a sampling frequency of 0 5 hz the dcp had a velocity accuracy of 0 3 cm s or 1 of reading with a velocity resolution of 0 1 cm s the data were averaged and stored every minute to the north east of the cage in position a fig 1 a nortek aquadopp current profiler 400 mhz adcp was used the adcp had a velocity accuracy of 0 5 cm s or 1 of measured value and a horizontal and vertical velocity precision of 0 7 cm s and 2 2 cm s respectively the data were averaged over every 3rd minute as buoy mounted dcps can experience bias mayer et al 2007 the first depth cell was excluded from the data set inside the cage the current velocity was measured using nortek vector acoustic doppler velocimeters adv with a sampling rate of 8 hz with 120 samples per burst and a burst interval of 60 s the sampling volume was 0 18 cm3 placed 0 15 m from the probes and the sensor had an accuracy 0 5 of measured value 1 mm s velocity precision typical 1 of velocity range at 16 hz the advs were suspended from a buoy at 3 6 9 and 12 m depths and placed in the centre of the cage position c in fig 1 given the depth of the site it is assumed that the influence from bathymetry on the measured current speed is negligible 2 3 flow velocity reduction different studies have been conducted regarding the velocity reduction behind net panels reviewed in klebert et al 2013 in model cages kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 or numerically lee et al 2008 bi et al 2014 kim et al 2014 only a few are performed at full scale in commercial cage with fish johansson et al 2007 klebert et al 2015 klebert and su 2020 the latest being conducted in circular cages with or with skirt in this study a more complex conical cage geometry is investigated with a twine thickness d of 2 7 mm and a mesh size s of 29 mm the calculated net solidity s n 2 d s is 0 19 to estimate the velocity flow reduction inside the cage and in its wake the expressions by l√∏land 1993 and f√∏re et al 2020 are used l√∏land 1993 proposed a theoretical expression for the non dimensional velocity reduction factor r behind a net panel based on the solidity sn of the nets r u w u 0 where u w is the flow velocity in the wake of the cage and u 0 is the free stream velocity the velocity reduction factor r is defined as r 1 0 46 c d where c d is the drag of the netpanel calculated from sn with the following expression c d 0 04 0 04 0 33 s n 6 54 s n 2 4 88 s n 3 by performing measurements with net panels with solidity sn ranging from 0 15 to 0 32 f√∏re et al 2020 found that an improved expression for r was r 1 02 0 84 s n in the following the different formulations for the velocity flow reduction are represented together with the measurements data at different location 3 results and discussion 3 1 preprocessing of data velocity spikes caused by doppler noise signal aliasing and disturbances from the fish as the cage was fully stocked were removed by filtering the raw data from the advs using the improved phase space filter goring and nikora 2002 for bubbly flows birjandi and bibeau 2011 velocity spikes were not replaced the adv data were averaged over 1 min and if more than 50 of the data in a minute had been removed the entire minute was excluded from further analyses to establish the characteristic of the flow field around a conical net a stable incoming current was necessary hence certain critera were set for the incoming current previous measurements at the fornes farm site in accord with ns9415 standard norway 2009 found that the main current direction was towards north east 45 60 and south west 210 225 and that the site was influenced by the tidal current the adcp and dcp data agreed well with this see fig 2 and fig 3 the data from each sensor was therefore averaged over 30 min intervals and if the current direction in the upstream sensor was between 30 and 75 or between 200 and 245 the sample was categorized as northward or southward respectively in addition to these requirements the standard deviation in the upstream sensor during each 30 min sample could not exceed 30 the averaged horizontal speed had to be over 0 05 m s and only dates where there was little to no signs of density stratifications in the water column were considered the criteria set for the current upstream of the cage are summarised in table 1 the current had a clear semi diurnal tidal pattern figs 2 and 3 with the nortek adcps current direction measurements appearing less structured than the aanderaa s dcp this is partially due to the direction fluctuating around 0 360 but also due to the aanderaa dcp having a higher temporal resolution and being positioned downstream when the current was moving southwards making it appear more structured throughout the period figs 2 and 3 the stratification of the water column is evident in fig 3 displaying the speed of the aanderaa s dcp for instance on the 3rd of july when the top layers had a lower speed than the deeper layers ctd profiles were also taken irregularly throughout the campaign and showed a clear pycnocline on the 3rd of july at 7 5 m depth that gradually moved up to 3 m depth on the 4th before disappearing on the 5th ctd data is published in j√≥nsd√≥ttir et al 2020 it was therefore only the later periods of the 4th of july and the 5th of july that were relevant for establishing a more or less homogenous current flow field around the conical cage the requirements resulted in four data series with the current heading towards the south with a minimum and maximum average direction of 216 and 244 and seven data series with the current heading towards the north with a minimum and maximum average direction of 32 and 75 the relevant periods are listed in table 2 for the advs there was an additional condition for the relevant sampling periods if more than 16 min of the 30 min averaged over in a period had been removed when using the phase space filter for bubbly flow the sample was removed from further analysis this requirement was set to each individual depth hence some samples have no data from certain depths see figs 4 and 5 the short duration of this study and the limited number of periods satisfying the criteria should be noted however given the depth at fornes the clear tidal influence of the site and the farm layout the results give an clear indication of how the current flow around a conical cage differs from that of a cylindrical cage 3 2 current flow during selected periods the average current speed and direction in all sensors were calculated for the relevant periods listed in table 2 and are presented in figs 4 and 5 the current speed inside the cage at all depths were lower than the speed measured upstream of the cage but was not necessarily higher than the speed measured downstream of the cage figs 4 and 5 the maximum average current speed at the inside of the cage was 6 cm s while the maximum average current speed outside was 15 cm s the current direction inside of the cage did not always agree with the current direction upstream and downstream of the cage the current downstream and upstream were in relatively good agreement except at 3 m when the current was heading southwards and a slight disagreement in some of the cases at 3 m and 12 m when heading northwards however this discrepancy could be influenced by the fluctuation around 0 360 the difference in direction between inside and upstream of the cage could be caused by the recirculation pattern seen in lien et al 2014 as this pattern was not observed when fish was present in a shielded cage klebert and su 2020 it is however more likely that this variation in direction was caused by the very low current speeds inside the cage 3 3 flow through cage and net to compare data from different sensors the characteristic horizontal current speed was established by averaging the horizontal speed in each sensor over all sample periods defined in table 2 for each depth to ensure that there were no topographic effects or other effects dependent on the direction of the current the two groups northwards and southwards were preserved the characteristics horizontal current speed was then normalized using the maximum averaged horizontal current speed recorded upstream independent of depth fig 6 the results from this study differ from those observed in unshielded cylindrical cages the current through an unshielded cylindrical cage had a linear reduction from the sensor upstream to the sensor downstream klebert et al 2015 downstream of the cage there was a reduction in current speed the entire depth of the cage and below the cage there was an acceleration of the current klebert et al 2015 no such acceleration could be observed in this study due to the spatial limitation of the sensors but it is unlikely that any such acceleration would have occurred at fornes due to its conical shape in the upper 22 m of the 55 m deep conical cage there was a clear reduction in current speed downstream independently of current direction similar to that observed for cylindrical cages below 22 m however there was no visible blocking effect from the cage fig 6 this is likely due to the tapered shape and smaller diameter of the cage at that depth which is only 28 m the reduction in speed downstream was at its highest in the upper 10 m of the cage this is particularly clear for the current that was heading southwards which has an increase in normalized current speed from 9 m depth and deeper this pattern was not as evident in the downstream current heading northwards but the highest reduction rates were still within the top 10 m these results indicate that the permeable skirt enhanced the reduction of current flow downstream of the cage the current flow upstream also appear to be influenced by the skirt with a non linear response upstream of the skirt volume and a near linear response from 9 m when the current was heading northward fig 6 the skirt could have influenced the current upstream by decelerating the incoming current flow as the effect was not constant upstream of the skirt the slower velocity closer to the surface could have been caused by the stratification at fornes the hydrographic conditions at fornes are detailed in j√≥nsd√≥ttir et al 2020 and describe a pycnocline that broke down from the 2nd to the 5th of july on the 4th of july a weak pycnocline was present at roughly 2 m depth with homogeneous water below while the water column was homogeneous on the 5th it was assumed that the pycnocline would have little effect on the characteristic current flow as the normalized current speed was determined by averaging over data from late on 4 th and the 5 th of july however given the position of the pycnocline it is possible that it had some effect on the current speed at 3 m depth the increase in current speed downstream of the cage at 9 m when the current was heading southwards could be due to deformations of the skirt when the current speed is sufficiently high the upstream section of the skirt can creep upwards as it is pushed into the cage while the downstream section will lift and stand out like a sail lien et al 2014 how the downstream section deforms is dependent on if the skirt is installed as one whole piece or as a long piece of fabric where the ends overlap at fornes the skirt was installed as one piece of fabric overlapping at the south side of the cage at the overlap the skirt was observed to balloon out behind the cage up to several meters at times fig 7 the ballooning in fig 7 was probably due to the shorter period of currents close to 20 cm s just prior to the picture being taken fig 3 a preliminary study at the same site in 2018 observed skirt deformations by use of pressure sensors along the bottom of the skirt and registered greater vertical deformation of the skirt downstream than upstream when currents exceeded roughly 13 cm s volent et al 2020 it should be noted that the horizontal speed inside and downstream of the cage were very low during the selected periods figs 4 and 5 so it s uncertain if the skirt was deforming at all during the chosen periods the normalized average current speed on the inside of the cage was lower or equal to the current speed downstream fig 6 thereby not replicating the linear reduction through the cage seen for unshielded cylindrical cages klebert et al 2015 the current speed inside the cage followed a similar pattern independent of current directions with a strong average current speed at 3 m depth the weakest current speed at 6 m depth and an increase in current speed from 6 to 12 m depth fig 6 it should also be noted that there were only two samples included in the southward data group at 3 m depth see fig 5 which could explain why the normalized current speed was at its highest inside the cage at 3 m depth when the current was heading southwards the high reduction at 6 m depth could be due to the vertical positioning of the biomass in the cage as biomass can increase the reduction in speed klebert and su 2020 during this study the stocking density was 19 kg m 3 atlantic salmon rarely distributes themselves evenly vertically in the cage and prefer to swim at deeper depths during the day and closer to the surface during night oppedal et al 2011 as this study took place during the summer in northern norway the sun never set and the continuous daylight may have resulted in the salmon swimming in a higher density at 6 m and below thereby reducing the current speed there more than other layers unfortunately the behaviour of the salmon was not monitored during this study 3 4 reduction in current speed the reduction factor r was calculated for 3 6 9 and 12 m and compared with the reduction factor found using the expressions by l√∏land 1993 and f√∏re et al 2020 fig 8 the expression by f√∏re et al 2020 was better at estimating the current reduction downstream of the skirt sn 0 51 than l√∏land 1993 this was expected as the expression by f√∏re et al 2020 is developed to correctly estimate the current downstream of nets with high solidity the reduction from upstream to inside the cage was however higher than expected compared with both expressions this could be due to the low current speed in this study as the lowest incoming current speed utilised in f√∏re et al 2020 was 0 25 m s compared to 0 05 m s in this study furthermore both l√∏land 1993 and f√∏re et al 2020 utilised stretched out plane nets the conical cage in this study had an inclination angle which would have increased the reduction but also had the opportunity to deform there could also have been biofouling on both the net and skirt which would have increased the solidity and reduction in current speed through the cage as the estimate by f√∏re et al 2020 was good downstream of the cage but not inside the cage it could be that the biomass around the advs resulted in low current speeds another reason is that comparing adv data with adcp data is not optimal as the adv averages over a very small volume while the adcp averages over cell sizes of 1 m the highest reduction inside the cage was 86 r 0 14 at 6 m depth for unshielded cages exposed to currents as strong as 60 cm s the reduction from outside to inside is 21 5 at 6 m depth klebert et al 2015 in another study by johansson et al 2014 the reduction inside a non shielded cage varied from 0 to 50 when the speed outside was 20 cm s johansson et al 2014 given the high biomass in this study inclination of the cage the general low current speeds during the relevant periods and the presence of a shielding skirt a reduction of 86 was deemed reasonable 4 conclusion current speed upstream downstream and inside a conical full scale shielded sea cage were monitored the velocity measurement inside the cage showed a more complex flow pattern than for a cylindrical cage probably due to the interaction between the permeable skirt and the conical shape of the cage which could both have affected the distribution of fish in the water column differently than in a cylindrical cage speed was generally low inside the cage the weakest current speed inside the cage was at 6 m depth independently of direction current speed increased beneath this depth there was a clear reduction in current speed downstream of the shielding skirt with the highest reduction recorded behind the shielded volume no blocking effect was observed beneath 22 m depth probably due to the conical shape of the cage the difference in current flow field behind the conical cage compared with a cylindrical cage may have implications for the dispersal of waste feed pellets and microorganisms from the cage influencing the benthic impact of the farm and further work should focus on documenting

concrete weight of 2 4 tonnes in water attached to the tip of the cone the shielding skirt applied was a permeable canvas lice skirt norwegian weather protection frekhaug norway with a solidity of 51 mesh opening of 350 350 Œºm and a depth of 10 m the skirt was weighted with 2 kg m lead rope at the bottom and installed as a cylinder around the conical net roughly 10 days prior to measurements were carried out the skirt is one piece of fabric installed with a 10 m overlap the biomass in the cage during the experiment was 750 tonnes with 191 310 fish with an average weight of 3 8 kg 2 2 equipment description adv and dcp current speed and direction outside the cage were recorded using two current profilers attached to anchoring buoys on both sides of the cage pointing downwards with a vertical resolution cell size of 1 m to the south west of the cage in position b fig 1 an aanderaa seaguard ii doppler current profiler dcp measured continuously with a sampling frequency of 0 5 hz the dcp had a velocity accuracy of 0 3 cm s or 1 of reading with a velocity resolution of 0 1 cm s the data were averaged and stored every minute to the north east of the cage in position a fig 1 a nortek aquadopp current profiler 400 mhz adcp was used the adcp had a velocity accuracy of 0 5 cm s or 1 of measured value and a horizontal and vertical velocity precision of 0 7 cm s and 2 2 cm s respectively the data were averaged over every 3rd minute as buoy mounted dcps can experience bias mayer et al 2007 the first depth cell was excluded from the data set inside the cage the current velocity was measured using nortek vector acoustic doppler velocimeters adv with a sampling rate of 8 hz with 120 samples per burst and a burst interval of 60 s the sampling volume was 0 18 cm3 placed 0 15 m from the probes and the sensor had an accuracy 0 5 of measured value 1 mm s velocity precision typical 1 of velocity range at 16 hz the advs were suspended from a buoy at 3 6 9 and 12 m depths and placed in the centre of the cage position c in fig 1 given the depth of the site it is assumed that the influence from bathymetry on the measured current speed is negligible 2 3 flow velocity reduction different studies have been conducted regarding the velocity reduction behind net panels reviewed in klebert et al 2013 in model cages kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 or numerically lee et al 2008 bi et al 2014 kim et al 2014 only a few are performed at full scale in commercial cage with fish johansson et al 2007 klebert et al 2015 klebert and su 2020 the latest being conducted in circular cages with or with skirt in this study a more complex conical cage geometry is investigated with a twine thickness d of 2 7 mm and a mesh size s of 29 mm the calculated net solidity s n 2 d s is 0 19 to estimate the velocity flow reduction inside the cage and in its wake the expressions by l√∏land 1993 and f√∏re et al 2020 are used l√∏land 1993 proposed a theoretical expression for the non dimensional velocity reduction factor r behind a net panel based on the solidity sn of the nets r u w u 0 where u w is the flow velocity in the wake of the cage and u 0 is the free stream velocity the velocity reduction factor r is defined as r 1 0 46 c d where c d is the drag of the netpanel calculated from sn with the following expression c d 0 04 0 04 0 33 s n 6 54 s n 2 4 88 s n 3 by performing measurements with net panels with solidity sn ranging from 0 15 to 0 32 f√∏re et al 2020 found that an improved expression for r was r 1 02 0 84 s n in the following the different formulations for the velocity flow reduction are represented together with the measurements data at different location 3 results and discussion 3 1 preprocessing of data velocity spikes caused by doppler noise signal aliasing and disturbances from the fish as the cage was fully stocked were removed by filtering the raw data from the advs using the improved phase space filter goring and nikora 2002 for bubbly flows birjandi and bibeau 2011 velocity spikes were not replaced the adv data were averaged over 1 min and if more than 50 of the data in a minute had been removed the entire minute was excluded from further analyses to establish the characteristic of the flow field around a conical net a stable incoming current was necessary hence certain critera were set for the incoming current previous measurements at the fornes farm site in accord with ns9415 standard norway 2009 found that the main current direction was towards north east 45 60 and south west 210 225 and that the site was influenced by the tidal current the adcp and dcp data agreed well with this see fig 2 and fig 3 the data from each sensor was therefore averaged over 30 min intervals and if the current direction in the upstream sensor was between 30 and 75 or between 200 and 245 the sample was categorized as northward or southward respectively in addition to these requirements the standard deviation in the upstream sensor during each 30 min sample could not exceed 30 the averaged horizontal speed had to be over 0 05 m s and only dates where there was little to no signs of density stratifications in the water column were considered the criteria set for the current upstream of the cage are summarised in table 1 the current had a clear semi diurnal tidal pattern figs 2 and 3 with the nortek adcps current direction measurements appearing less structured than the aanderaa s dcp this is partially due to the direction fluctuating around 0 360 but also due to the aanderaa dcp having a higher temporal resolution and being positioned downstream when the current was moving southwards making it appear more structured throughout the period figs 2 and 3 the stratification of the water column is evident in fig 3 displaying the speed of the aanderaa s dcp for instance on the 3rd of july when the top layers had a lower speed than the deeper layers ctd profiles were also taken irregularly throughout the campaign and showed a clear pycnocline on the 3rd of july at 7 5 m depth that gradually moved up to 3 m depth on the 4th before disappearing on the 5th ctd data is published in j√≥nsd√≥ttir et al 2020 it was therefore only the later periods of the 4th of july and the 5th of july that were relevant for establishing a more or less homogenous current flow field around the conical cage the requirements resulted in four data series with the current heading towards the south with a minimum and maximum average direction of 216 and 244 and seven data series with the current heading towards the north with a minimum and maximum average direction of 32 and 75 the relevant periods are listed in table 2 for the advs there was an additional condition for the relevant sampling periods if more than 16 min of the 30 min averaged over in a period had been removed when using the phase space filter for bubbly flow the sample was removed from further analysis this requirement was set to each individual depth hence some samples have no data from certain depths see figs 4 and 5 the short duration of this study and the limited number of periods satisfying the criteria should be noted however given the depth at fornes the clear tidal influence of the site and the farm layout the results give an clear indication of how the current flow around a conical cage differs from that of a cylindrical cage 3 2 current flow during selected periods the average current speed and direction in all sensors were calculated for the relevant periods listed in table 2 and are presented in figs 4 and 5 the current speed inside the cage at all depths were lower than the speed measured upstream of the cage but was not necessarily higher than the speed measured downstream of the cage figs 4 and 5 the maximum average current speed at the inside of the cage was 6 cm s while the maximum average current speed outside was 15 cm s the current direction inside of the cage did not always agree with the current direction upstream and downstream of the cage the current downstream and upstream were in relatively good agreement except at 3 m when the current was heading southwards and a slight disagreement in some of the cases at 3 m and 12 m when heading northwards however this discrepancy could be influenced by the fluctuation around 0 360 the difference in direction between inside and upstream of the cage could be caused by the recirculation pattern seen in lien et al 2014 as this pattern was not observed when fish was present in a shielded cage klebert and su 2020 it is however more likely that this variation in direction was caused by the very low current speeds inside the cage 3 3 flow through cage and net to compare data from different sensors the characteristic horizontal current speed was established by averaging the horizontal speed in each sensor over all sample periods defined in table 2 for each depth to ensure that there were no topographic effects or other effects dependent on the direction of the current the two groups northwards and southwards were preserved the characteristics horizontal current speed was then normalized using the maximum averaged horizontal current speed recorded upstream independent of depth fig 6 the results from this study differ from those observed in unshielded cylindrical cages the current through an unshielded cylindrical cage had a linear reduction from the sensor upstream to the sensor downstream klebert et al 2015 downstream of the cage there was a reduction in current speed the entire depth of the cage and below the cage there was an acceleration of the current klebert et al 2015 no such acceleration could be observed in this study due to the spatial limitation of the sensors but it is unlikely that any such acceleration would have occurred at fornes due to its conical shape in the upper 22 m of the 55 m deep conical cage there was a clear reduction in current speed downstream independently of current direction similar to that observed for cylindrical cages below 22 m however there was no visible blocking effect from the cage fig 6 this is likely due to the tapered shape and smaller diameter of the cage at that depth which is only 28 m the reduction in speed downstream was at its highest in the upper 10 m of the cage this is particularly clear for the current that was heading southwards which has an increase in normalized current speed from 9 m depth and deeper this pattern was not as evident in the downstream current heading northwards but the highest reduction rates were still within the top 10 m these results indicate that the permeable skirt enhanced the reduction of current flow downstream of the cage the current flow upstream also appear to be influenced by the skirt with a non linear response upstream of the skirt volume and a near linear response from 9 m when the current was heading northward fig 6 the skirt could have influenced the current upstream by decelerating the incoming current flow as the effect was not constant upstream of the skirt the slower velocity closer to the surface could have been caused by the stratification at fornes the hydrographic conditions at fornes are detailed in j√≥nsd√≥ttir et al 2020 and describe a pycnocline that broke down from the 2nd to the 5th of july on the 4th of july a weak pycnocline was present at roughly 2 m depth with homogeneous water below while the water column was homogeneous on the 5th it was assumed that the pycnocline would have little effect on the characteristic current flow as the normalized current speed was determined by averaging over data from late on 4 th and the 5 th of july however given the position of the pycnocline it is possible that it had some effect on the current speed at 3 m depth the increase in current speed downstream of the cage at 9 m when the current was heading southwards could be due to deformations of the skirt when the current speed is sufficiently high the upstream section of the skirt can creep upwards as it is pushed into the cage while the downstream section will lift and stand out like a sail lien et al 2014 how the downstream section deforms is dependent on if the skirt is installed as one whole piece or as a long piece of fabric where the ends overlap at fornes the skirt was installed as one piece of fabric overlapping at the south side of the cage at the overlap the skirt was observed to balloon out behind the cage up to several meters at times fig 7 the ballooning in fig 7 was probably due to the shorter period of currents close to 20 cm s just prior to the picture being taken fig 3 a preliminary study at the same site in 2018 observed skirt deformations by use of pressure sensors along the bottom of the skirt and registered greater vertical deformation of the skirt downstream than upstream when currents exceeded roughly 13 cm s volent et al 2020 it should be noted that the horizontal speed inside and downstream of the cage were very low during the selected periods figs 4 and 5 so it s uncertain if the skirt was deforming at all during the chosen periods the normalized average current speed on the inside of the cage was lower or equal to the current speed downstream fig 6 thereby not replicating the linear reduction through the cage seen for unshielded cylindrical cages klebert et al 2015 the current speed inside the cage followed a similar pattern independent of current directions with a strong average current speed at 3 m depth the weakest current speed at 6 m depth and an increase in current speed from 6 to 12 m depth fig 6 it should also be noted that there were only two samples included in the southward data group at 3 m depth see fig 5 which could explain why the normalized current speed was at its highest inside the cage at 3 m depth when the current was heading southwards the high reduction at 6 m depth could be due to the vertical positioning of the biomass in the cage as biomass can increase the reduction in speed klebert and su 2020 during this study the stocking density was 19 kg m 3 atlantic salmon rarely distributes themselves evenly vertically in the cage and prefer to swim at deeper depths during the day and closer to the surface during night oppedal et al 2011 as this study took place during the summer in northern norway the sun never set and the continuous daylight may have resulted in the salmon swimming in a higher density at 6 m and below thereby reducing the current speed there more than other layers unfortunately the behaviour of the salmon was not monitored during this study 3 4 reduction in current speed the reduction factor r was calculated for 3 6 9 and 12 m and compared with the reduction factor found using the expressions by l√∏land 1993 and f√∏re et al 2020 fig 8 the expression by f√∏re et al 2020 was better at estimating the current reduction downstream of the skirt sn 0 51 than l√∏land 1993 this was expected as the expression by f√∏re et al 2020 is developed to correctly estimate the current downstream of nets with high solidity the reduction from upstream to inside the cage was however higher than expected compared with both expressions this could be due to the low current speed in this study as the lowest incoming current speed utilised in f√∏re et al 2020 was 0 25 m s compared to 0 05 m s in this study furthermore both l√∏land 1993 and f√∏re et al 2020 utilised stretched out plane nets the conical cage in this study had an inclination angle which would have increased the reduction but also had the opportunity to deform there could also have been biofouling on both the net and skirt which would have increased the solidity and reduction in current speed through the cage as the estimate by f√∏re et al 2020 was good downstream of the cage but not inside the cage it could be that the biomass around the advs resulted in low current speeds another reason is that comparing adv data with adcp data is not optimal as the adv averages over a very small volume while the adcp averages over cell sizes of 1 m the highest reduction inside the cage was 86 r 0 14 at 6 m depth for unshielded cages exposed to currents as strong as 60 cm s the reduction from outside to inside is 21 5 at 6 m depth klebert et al 2015 in another study by johansson et al 2014 the reduction inside a non shielded cage varied from 0 to 50 when the speed outside was 20 cm s johansson et al 2014 given the high biomass in this study inclination of the cage the general low current speeds during the relevant periods and the presence of a shielding skirt a reduction of 86 was deemed reasonable 4 conclusion current speed upstream downstream and inside a conical full scale shielded sea cage were monitored the velocity measurement inside the cage showed a more complex flow pattern than for a cylindrical cage probably due to the interaction between the permeable skirt and the conical shape of the cage which could both have affected the distribution of fish in the water column differently than in a cylindrical cage speed was generally low inside the cage the weakest current speed inside the cage was at 6 m depth independently of direction current speed increased beneath this depth there was a clear reduction in current speed downstream of the shielding skirt with the highest reduction recorded behind the shielded volume no blocking effect was observed beneath 22 m depth probably due to the conical shape of the cage the difference in current flow field behind the conical cage compared with a cylindrical cage may have implications for the dispersal of waste feed pellets and microorganisms from the cage influencing the benthic impact of the farm and further work should focus on documenting

21003,several studies have identified stability issues related to artificial reefs ars installed on the seabed however initial ar settlement during free fall installation has not been well examined we performed a laboratory scale experiment regression analysis and numerical simulation to evaluate the initial settlements of two cube type ar models during free fall installation into soft soil settlement tended to increase by impact velocity and ar mass but to decrease as soil density increased the most significant parameter controlling settlement was soil density followed by the impact velocity and the ar mass of the 56 cases examined 76 79 71 43 and 98 21 exhibited relative differences of 20 as revealed experimentally and by regression analysis and simulation given the terminal velocities of the two ar models the corresponding settlement ranges were 2 12 5 36 mm and 4 56 11 56 mm respectively thus the effective useable volumes of the ar models fell by approximately 4 12 depending on clay composition if the models attained their terminal velocities during free fall installation these initial settlement data indicate that free fall installation negatively affects both

human activities in coastal waters have devastated natural reefs that previously played several positive roles elliot et al 2018 fine et al 2019 in the hope that artificial reefs ars would emulate

kim et al 2008d 0 7 1 3 m kim et al 2009 and 1 9 2 0 m kim et al 2010 the causes of such severe settlement include soft soil ar weight and structure intensive ar stacking free fall installation and physical features such as currents and waves e g barber et al 2009 london convention and protocol unep 2009 fabi et al 2015 yoon et al 2016 settlement reduces the effective useable ar volume and thus functionality kim and kim 2008 yoon et al 2016 the effective useable volume is usually measured with the aid of a multi beam echo sounder and excludes volumes lost due to burial breakage washout and settlement several recommendations have been presented to prevent severe ar settlement these recommendations can be classified into two types reformation of ar design and enhancement of the surrounding environment these elements are connected no ar can be independent of the environment thus reef design should be extended to include at least site selection it is essential that the ar should resist local hydrodynamic forces not exceed the capacity of the underlying sediment to support its weight and maintain its structural integrity sheng 2000 several new ar designs seek to reduce scour and accordingly settlement e g d√ºzbastƒ±lar and ≈üent√ºrk 2009 fabi et al 2011 2015 l√≥pez et al 2016 lee et al 2018 other methods used to reduce settlement include seabed reinforcement with a bed of small stones or pebbles lindberg and relini 2000 or a geogrid or geogrid bamboo structure yun and kim 2018 in terms of site selection most researchers recommend that ars not be installed on soft seabed soils see table 1 however some initial ar deployments were performed without adequate site investigations which led to settlement issues in several countries including south korea even if the substrate is hard local scouring erosion d√ºzbastƒ±lar et al 2006 and sediment accretion in the vicinity of an ar may lead to partial or complete burial sheng 2000 settlement issues become more pronounced when ars are installed via free fall or are intensively stacked free fall installation was common in the past especially for relatively small inexpensive ars e g cube type ars an ar falls at a rate dictated by its weight buoyancy and the drag force attaining a terminal velocity at a critical depth and colliding with the seabed to impart a maximum kinetic energy manoukian et al 2011 kim and na 2019 this collision results in initial settlement the extent of which depends on the soil incident angle and level of kinetic energy initial settlement becomes more evident if ars are installed via intensive stacking kim et al 2017 thus featuring collisions between an already installed ar and a new falling ar yoon et al 2016 the physical environment affecting ar settlement can be viewed on either a large or small scale sheng 2000 large scale features include the physical processes in play at spatial scales much larger than that of the ar structure small scale features include the physical environment in the immediate vicinity of the ar which is influenced by local climate large scale physical processes and interactions between the ar and the surrounding water and sediment the ar may experience scour and may slide be overturned and undergo settlement sometimes leading to washout or burial lindberg and seaman 2011 yoon et al 2016 unballasted ar tire bundles deployed approximately 1 8 km offshore of florida became washed out sherman and spieler 2006 similarly used tire ars in southeast asia were easily scattered by currents chou 1997 recently a cylinder type ar was reported near the coast of busan south korea 156 km distant from the installation site near tsushima island japan na 2020 if burial is defined by submergence of more than half an ar into the seabed several examples can be given in one two layer ar more than half of the ar height was submerged in sandy mud kim et al 2010 the primary cause may be severe settlement accretion of sandy mud in the vicinity of the reef or both associated with free fall installation intensive stacking and the physical environment previously settlement has been recorded no earlier than a few years after ar installation but free fall installation and intensive stacking are associated with major initial settlement few authors have explored whether initial settlement affects long term settlement this may be primarily attributable to a lack of interest in current ar practice and poor engineering and or failure to realize that this is a serious issue it is presently necessary to inspect the seabed immediately after ar installation this process increases costs it would be preferable to predict initial settlement during the design stage lindberg and relini 2000 either a laboratory scale experiment or numerical simulation could be used to this end the former option is preferable but it is difficult to reproduce the seabed conditions in deep water the results depend on how well these problems are solved the second option simulation is relatively easy but it can be difficult to select a reasonable material model here we explore the settlement of two cube type ar models during installation on several types of soft soil we perform a laboratory scale experiment regression analysis and numerical simulation we chose cube type ars because these were installed via free falls from vessels over nearly 139 413 ha 1394 km2 of korean coastal waters from 1971 to 2013 kim et al 2017 accounting for 64 5 of the total ar area and 67 4 of the volume kim et al 2016b cube type ars are popular in korea and elsewhere because of their simple shape good workability and relatively low cost sheehy 1982 chua and chou 1994 l√∂k et al 2002 jan et al 2003 it is worthwhile to explore free fall settlement e g kim et al 2010 yoon et al 2016 we used 1 40 and 1 20 ar models their terminal velocities were calculated based on the drag coefficients derived via numerical flow analysis ar settlements into soils of different compositions were measured next we developed a regression equation for settlement estimation and identified parameters that significantly affected settlement for numerical simulation of the collision the riedel hiermaier thoma rht concrete model and the drucker prager dp material model were employed to represent the ar and seabed soil compositions respectively transient dynamic analyses were performed to simulate the collision between an ar and various seabed soils yielding settlement data finally the experimental regression and simulation results were compared in terms of accuracy and the simulation results were improved using scale factors the hypotheses and limitations of this study are as follows first in terms of the drag coefficient of a box type ar we only considered pressure form drag because the ar is blunt second the terminal ar velocity was obtained by considering only ar weight buoyancy and drag third we used 1 40 and 1 20 models of a cube type ar during preparation we discovered that the densities differed slightly 2308 and 2146 kg m 3 from the target value 2314 kg m 3 nevertheless we used the target value when calculating terminal velocities fourth we prepared four different soil clay samples that we held saturated for 2 months in plastic bags to ensure that they behaved as natural seabed soils do we assumed that this mimicked saturated seabed conditions fifth during simulations we used the rht concrete and dp material models to analyze the ar material and seabed soils respectively these models have certain limitations for example the drucker prager model may not accurately model the porosity of fully saturated soils thus the simulations may underestimate ar settlement finally our primary concern was estimation of initial settlement into seabed soil after free fall installation so we assumed that the material model used to analyze the target structure the cube type ar and ar failure were not of major concern 2 materials and methods 2 1 cube type ars and clay deposits cube type ars in south korea are fabricated from concrete steel reinforced bars of typical dimensions 1 m l 1 m b 1 m h and 2 m l 2 m b 2 m h kim et al 2008b 2008c the latter ar thus has a volume of 8 m3 and weighs 33 34 kn 3 4 tonnes this kind of ar features eight horizontal and four vertical members each with a thickness of 0 25 m jung et al 2016 these ars have been used to improve fisheries and protect migratory fish given the relatively large void accessible from each surface kim et al 2014a fig 1 presents two models of the cube type ar 2 m 2 m 2 m used 1 40 and 1 20 the dimensions are 50 mm l 50 mm b 50 mm h and 100 mm l 100 mm b 100 mm h respectively fig 2 the member thicknesses are 6 25 mm and 12 5 mm respectively for numerical simulation the original ar shape fig 1 was modified by excluding the four triangular corners fig 2 the calculated densities of the 1 40 and 1 20 models were 2308 and 2146 kg

clay giao et al 2003 standard sand silt and kaolin have grain diameters of 0 5 2 mm 0 002 0 063 mm and 0 025 0 035 Œºm respectively we prepared four clay samples with different mixing ratios table 2 for example sample 1 contained 20 sand 40 silt and 40 kaolin of the four samples sample 3 had the highest proportion of sand 65 22 followed by samples 2 4 and 1 we kept all samples saturated in plastic bags for 2 months prior to each experiment the surface of each sample was flattened to ensure accurate settlement measurements the densities of the four soil samples were 1 86 g ml 1 or 1 86 10 6 g m 3 1 92 g ml 1 or 1 92 10 6 g m 3 2 06 g ml 1 or 2 06 10 6 g m 3 and 1 80 g ml 1 or 1 80 10 6 g m 3 respectively 2 2 use of flow analysis to derive drag coefficients in fluid mechanics drag refers to forces acting on a solid in the direction of the relative fluid flow velocity the drag on a solid is generally dependent on its velocity v and may be either linear or quadratic owen and ryu 2005 the parameter differentiating these two regimes is the reynolds number r e which is the ratio of the inertial to the viscous forces as shown in eq 1 here œÅ f is the fluid density l a characteristic cross sectional length v the solid velocity and Œ∑ the dynamic fluid viscosity 1 r e œÅ f l v Œ∑ when a solid is moving underwater eq 2 yields a good approximation of drag here f d l i n and f d q u a d refer to the linear and quadratic regimes respectively the linear regime is attributable to the viscous drag of the medium drag is generally proportional to the medium viscosity and the linear solid size the quadratic regime is attributable to the fact that the solid accelerates the medium with which it is continually colliding the drag is proportional to the density of the medium and the cross sectional area of the solid here b and c are the coefficients that are sought 2 f d f d l i n f d q u a d b v c v 2 at a high reynolds number e g r e 103 the quadratic regime dominates and the linear regime is negligible in such a case the numerator of eq 1 parasitic drag is a representative drag of the quadratic regime and is a combination of pressure form drag and friction skin drag these two drags significantly affect the total drag acting on an underwater solid hasanloo et al 2012 woo et al 2014 woo and na 2014 pressure drag dependent on the form of the solid follows the drag equation thus increasing with the square of the speed and becomes of particular concern at high speeds in contrast friction drag is caused by fluid friction against the skin of an object moving through the fluid tangential forces are created when a fluid flows over a surface a rough surface experiences more friction drag that is directly proportional to the wetted surface rea friction drag also increases with the square of the velocity consider a smooth body moving through viscous incompressible water at a speed v the drag coefficient c d is defined in eq 3 where f d is the drag œÅ w is the water density and a is a characteristic area it should be noted that the total drag is the sum of the friction and pressure drags and that the drag coefficient is a function of the reynolds number r e 3 c d f d 1 2 œÅ w a v 2 consider flow over a flat plate lying parallel to the flow the total drag is equal to the friction drag the drag coefficient is as shown in eq 4 here œÑ w is the shear stress caused by flow and a is the total surface area in contact with the fluid i e the wetted area hence the drag coefficient depends on the shear stress 4 c d s u r f a c e œÑ w d a 1 2 œÅ w a v 2 now consider an example of pressure drag flow over a flat plate lying normal to the flow the total drag is equal to the pressure drag because the wall shear stress is perpendicular to the flow direction and therefore does not contribute to drag for such a case the drag coefficient is as shown in eq 5 here p is the pressure caused by flow and a is the frontal or projected area of the object with this geometry the flow separates from the edges of the plate and backflow recirculating flow is observed in the low energy plate wake 5 c d s u r f a c e p d a 1 2 œÅ w a v 2 it should be noted that the drag coefficients for all objects with sharp edges are usually independent of the reynolds number r e 103 because the edges serve as separation points and the size of the wake is thus determined by the geometry of the object fox et al 2004 therefore we assumed that the drag coefficients of cube type ars were independent of the reynolds number the ars have sharp edges in other words regardless of the reynolds number the drag coefficients were assumed to be constant additionally because each ar was installed normal to the flow direction we assumed that pressure drag was the major contributor to the drag coefficient thus we used eq 5 in general pressure cannot be analytically determined hence we used numerical flow analysis to determine the drag coefficient of a cube type ar similar analyses have been performed to obtain the drag coefficients of 24 already installed ars woo et al 2014 in contrast our flow analysis focused on freefall ar installation the drag coefficient is required when calculating the terminal velocity of a box type ar thus we performed flow analyses to determine the pressure field around ars by applying the element based finite volume method ebfvm used in computational fluid dynamics which has found many applications in aircraft underwater pipeline and ar engineering gylys et al 2012 liu and su 2013 liu et al 2013 kim et al 2014a 2014b 2016a 2016b we used the procedure of woo and na 2014 we made certain assumptions first water is incompressive viscous and newtonian second the water temperature is 25 c the density is 1000 kg m 3 and the dynamic viscosity is 8 899 10 4 kg m 1 s 1 finally we used the shear stress transport model of menter 1994 to deal with turbulence we employed ansys cfx software for ebfvm analysis ansys inc 2012 the flow field the domain was of dimensions 20 m l 20 m b 20 m h and the ar was located at the center the domain size was 10 fold that of the ar size 2 m 2 m 2m the boundaries and ar surfaces were well separated the boundary featured a symmetrical inlet and outlet at the inlet the initial flow velocity was 10 m s 1 because velocities at or below this level do not affect ar drag coefficients woo et al 2014 the outlet featured a zero pressure gradient the side faces were assumed to be symmetrical to minimize any boundary effect on the flow domain for precision hexahedrons with eight nodes served as the elements the maximum element size near the ar was 0 044 m and the maximum element size distant from the ar was 0 22 m the analysis yielded the drag coefficient c d 1 40 of a box type ar used for terminal velocity calculation 2 3 terminal velocities and critical depths the motions of the objects the ar models can be described by eq 6 newton s second law of motion here w is the gravitational force f b is the buoyant force f d is the drag force m s is the mass of the model g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 and v is the velocity thus eq 6 becomes eq 7 here m w is the water mass œÅ w is the water density 1000 kg m 3 c d is the drag coefficient 1 40 of the ar model and a is the projected area of the model the terminal velocity is the highest velocity attainable by an object as it falls through a fluid in fluid dynamics an object attains its terminal velocity when its speed becomes constant because of an opposing restraining force thus when the acceleration d v d t is zero in eq 7 the terminal velocity is obtained as shown in eq 8 here œÅ s is the density 2314 kg m 3 of the ar model and v is the volume 6 f y w f b f d m s d v d t 7 m s g m w

t fig 3 presents the falling velocities vs distance curves of the two models 1 40 and 1 20 here v t is the terminal velocity and y c is the critical depth corresponding to v t the terminal velocities of the two models are 0 640 and 0 847 m s 1 at 0 460 and 0 660 s respectively and the corresponding critical depths are 0 243 and 0 464 m 2 4 material modeling of the ar for numerical simulation as mentioned above the cube type ar is fabricated from concrete steel reinforced bars it is reasonable to not consider the bars during ar modeling our focus is on seabed settlement during ar installation in general concrete exhibits non linear compression behavior given its inhomogeneity and porosity therefore we used the rht concrete model of riedel et al 1999 which has been widely employed for damage analysis when concrete encounters transient dynamic forces such as collisions and explosions riedel et al 1999 2009 ding et al 2013 hu et al 2016 abdel kader 2019 transient dynamic analysis

an iterative approach must be used to solve for the current pressure because that pressure p is implicitly involved in eq 12 tu and lu 2009 it should be noted that an equation of state e g the p Œ±

2010 to simulate the material behavior of seabed soil clay we used an extended drucker prager edp model the so called edp linear model this model is characterized by a linear yield criterion a linear plastic flow potential and plastic strain increments some aspects of the model are briefly introduced below the edp material model includes three yield criteria with flow potentials similar to those of the classic drucker prager model commonly used to analyze geomaterials exhibiting internal cohesion and friction the yield functions can be combined with an isotropic or kinematic hardening rule if yield stress evolves during plastic deformation for analysis we used an edp linear yield criterion œÉ y 0 as shown in eq 22 here œÉ e is the equivalent von mises stress œÉ y is the uniaxial yield stress and Œ± is the pressure sensitivity the uniaxial yield stress œÉ y is expressed as a function of œÜ and the cohesive value intercept c is defined in eq 23 the pressure sensitivity Œ± is a

respectively based on those values we considered seven experimental impact velocities 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 25 1 50 1 75 and 2 00 m s 1 using the law of conservation of energy yoon and na 2013 the corresponding falling heights were 13 29 51 80 115 156 and 204 mm respectively these heights were used to simulate ar installation the experimental setup is shown in fig 5 and featured a pylon an inelastic string a ruler the ar models and clay we tested four soil samples seven impact velocities and two ar models 56 combinations for each case we performed five tests and averaged the values 2 7 simulation setup using the material models of the ar and the seabed soil as summarized as tables 3 6 a numerical model was constructed as shown in fig 6 here the initial conditions were v t 0 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 25 1 50 1 75 and 2 00 m s 1 and y t 0 1 mm an initial displacement 1 mm was intentionally applied to simulate free fall the boundary conditions were u x u y u z 0 at the left and right sides and free at the top and bottom the seabed was 20 cm l 20 cm w 10 cm h as shown in fig 6 the lagrangian method was used to describe the interactions vertical movements between the ar models and the seabed to measure ar model settlements we selected four nodal points at each corner of the top side the simulations terminated when vertical movement ceased we used ansys autodyn software for simulation this efficiently solves collision or large deformation problems woo et al 2015 2016 ansys inc 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results table 7 lists the seabed impact velocities of the 1 40 and 1 20 models into soils 1 to 4 settlement varied by impact velocity soil density and the ar model mass settlement tended to increase with velocity and mass fig 7 but velocity was more significant because kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity in contrast as shown in fig 8 settlement tended to decrease as soil density increased the effects of soil density and ar mass became more evident as the velocity increased of the 56 settlements the maxima of the 1 20 model were 33 4 mm sample 1 18 2 mm sample 2 13 0 mm sample 3 and 35 2 mm sample 4 respectively for the 1 40 model the maxima were 20 2 mm sample 1 12 2 mm sample 2 7 6 mm sample 3 and 21 2 mm sample 4 respectively all maxima were attained at the highest impact velocity 2 00 m s 1 we present the gradients of impact velocities by soil density in table 8 depending on the impact velocities the gradients were all positive from 0 65 to 2 11 for the 1 40 model and from 0 38 to 1 13 for the 1 20 model in terms of soil densities the gradients were all negative and ranged from 0 56 to 5 59 for the 1 40 model and 0 50 to 9 17 for the 1 20 model thus the primary parameter controlling settlement is soil density followed by the impact velocity and the ar mass 3 2 regression analysis equation 29 is a general multiple regression equation ∆í œë i x i featuring three independent variables x i i 1 2 and 3 here œë 0 is an intercept factor and œë i represents values of regression factors taking the impact velocity v unit of m s 1 soil density d unit of kg m 3 and ar mass m unit of kg as independent variables settlement s unit of m can be expressed as a function of v d and m as shown in eq 30 using the natural logarithm and the identity we can rewrite eq 30 as eq 31 which is in similar form to eq 29 here the coefficients are as follows Œ≤ 0 e œë 0 and Œ≤ i œë i i 1 2 and 3 we used the experimental data figs 7 and 8 to derive these coefficients Œ≤ 0 4 515 1020 Œ≤ 1 1 263 Œ≤ 2 6 888 and Œ≤ 3 0 207 accordingly the regression equation is that of eq 32 29 f œë i x i œë 0 œë 1 x 1 œë 2 x 2 œë 3 x 3 30 s ∆í v d m Œ≤ 0 v Œ≤ 1 d Œ≤ 2 m Œ≤ 3 31 ln s ln Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 ln v Œ≤ 2 ln d Œ≤ 3 ln m 32 s 4 515 10 20 v 1 263 d 6 888 m 0 207 in eq 32 the positive values 1 263 and 0 207 for Œ≤ 1 and Œ≤ 3 reflect not only the positive effects of the independent variables v and m on ar settlement s but also the fact that the impact velocity v contributes more than does the ar mass m in contrast the negative value of 6 888 for Œ≤ 2 shows that a higher soil density d mitigates ar settlement given the magnitudes the most significant parameter affecting settlement is soil density followed by the impact velocity and then by the ar mass it should be emphasized that all of these observations were confirmed experimentally figs 7 and 8 for comparative purposes the regression analysis and experimental results are plotted in fig 9 of all data 76 79 had relative errors 20 thus validating the accuracy of the regression equation we used the terminal velocities of the two ar models 0 640 m s 1 1 40 model and 0 847 m s 1 1 20 model to calculate settlements from the regression equation eq 32 for the 1 40 model the settlements were 4 27 mm sample 1 3 44 mm sample 2 2 12 mm sample 3 and 5 36 mm sample 4 given the height 50 mm of the 1 40 model the settlements indicate effective useable volume losses of 8 54 sample 1 6 88 sample 2 4 24 sample 3 and 10 72 sample 4 respectively for the 1 20 model the settlements were 9 22 mm sample 1 7 41 mm sample 2 4 56 mm sample 3 and 11 56 mm sample 4 given the height 100 mm of the 1 20 model the settlements indicate useable volume losses of 9 22 sample 1 7 41 sample 2 4 56 sample 3 and 11 56 sample 4 respectively the effective useable volume losses ranged from 4 24 to 10 72 for the 1 40 model and 4 56 11 56 for the 1 20 model these findings indicate the negative effects of initial free fall installation on ar settlement in other words the effective useable volume of the cube type ar decreases by approximately 4 12 depending on the clay composition if the ar attains terminal velocity during the initial installation given the long term settlement range 0 1 1 85 m of cube type ars 2 m 2 m 2 m observed in the field kim et al 2008a 2008d 2009 the effective useable volume loss is 5 0 92 5 of which the initial effective useable volume loss 4 12 accounts for approximately 4 3 80 0 it should be emphasized here that the initial settlement compromises functionality rather than stability of ars the loss of the effective useable volume according to the initial settlement should be considered as the loss of ar functionality because it reduces not only the useable volume of an ar but also the neighboring space between ars however uniform settlement of ars does not necessarily indicates the loss of ar stability because the settlement may increase the interlocking mechanism with the seabed and possible random stacking may create the interlocking of ars however if differential settlement occurs due to inclination angles of falling ars to the seabed han et al 2020 then the interlocking with the seabed may weaken potential stability issues e g scouring and washout may occur and consequently overall layout of the intensively stacking form may collapse yoon et al 2016 nevertheless it should be noted that the free fall installation is an economic way to deploy relatively cheaper ars e g cube type ar in comparison to the controlled deployment with wires and divers that require more time cost equipment and manpower thus it is not always better to install ars in the controlled manner for a relatively large scale ar set group or complex thus the major concern here is the seabed soil condition the number of ars considered and the economic way to install in this respect a proper site selection e g kennish et al 2002 barber et al 2009 mousavi et al 2015 and a promising ar design should be made in the pre deployment stage considering the goal scale and budget of an ar project for the site selection as discussed in the study the soft seabed soils should be avoided to secure the useable volume functionality and to mitigate a possible potential of stability issue that is why this study focused on measurement and prediction of the initial settlement and accordingly the corresponding effective useable volume loss 3 3 simulation results table 9 lists the simulation results of 1 40 and 1 20 models falling into seabed soil samples 1 to 4 by the impact velocities and soil densities all results were recorded at four nodal points as explained earlier and the magnitudes compared for all cases the four values at the four nodal points were nearly identical as expected given the geometrical symmetry as shown in table 9 settlement varied by the impact velocity soil density and the ar model ar mass for soil sample 1 and the 1 40 model the displacement contours are shown in fig 10 for the seven impact velocities negative vertical displacements settlements are evident under the model frames and positive displacements protrusions in the center and around the model for the 1 40 model the experimental and simulation results are shown in fig 11 of the four samples the experimental and simulation results were similar for samples 2 and 3 but not for samples 1 and 4 because the densities d s 2 1 92 10 6 and d s 3 2 06 10 6 g m 3 of samples 2 and 3 were larger than those d s 1 1 86 10 6 and d s 4 1 80 10 6 g m 3 of samples 1 and 4 the differences between the experimental and simulation results increased as the impact velocity increased in other words the differences were clearer when settlement was relatively large the averaged relative differences were 18 54 sample 2 21 68 sample 3 43 63 sample 1 and 52 04 sample 4 respectively for the 1 20 model the experimental and simulation results are shown in fig 12 observations were similar to those described above the averaged relative differences were 8 67 sample 2 24 10 sample 3 33 85 sample 1 and 40 61 sample 4 respectively to allow more detailed comparison all experimental and simulation results are plotted in fig 13 of the 56 cases 59 66 exhibited relative differences of 20 hence simulation accuracy requires improvement the inaccuracy is explained by soil porosity during settlement two soil movements can occur the first is particle rearrangement attributable to porosity the particles first move closer together and then even closer if kinetic energy is imparted to them however the material model used for seabed soil does not consider porosity as an example fig 14 a presents the particle arrangement of the high density sample the particles are very close thus with small gaps and particle re arrangement occurs rapidly after collision accordingly the re arrangement effect on settlement is minor in comparison to movement imparted by kinetic energy in contrast the particle arrangement of the low density sample shown in fig 14b is associated with relatively large settlement attributable to both particle re arrangement and kinetic energy this explains why the experimental and simulation results for samples 1 and 4 exhibit relatively large differences to increase simulation accuracy we developed adjustment factors afs the ratios of the experimental to simulation results for each ar model and soil sample we calculated seven adjustment factors corresponding to the seven impact velocities and then averaged them for each ar model the four averaged factors are plotted with respect to the four soil densities d in fig 15 yielding trend lines a f 1 40 and a f 1 20 then using all eight points we obtained a final trend line a f although the first two lines exhibit better coefficients of determination r2 0 94 and 0 85 than the final line r2 0 82 we selected the trend line a f as representative as shown in eq 33 because it was associated with all points of the ar models 33 a f 4 20 d 9 39 applying these adjustment factors to the simulation results of the 1 40 model the averaged relative differences become 10 19 sample 2 10 20 sample 3 22 14 sample 1 and 12 91 sample 4 for the 1 20 model the averaged relative differences become 37 43 sample 2 14 48 sample 3 12 74 sample 1 and 10 11 sample 4 of the eight relative differences only two exceed 20 hence application of eq 33 to the simulation results improved accuracy however it should be noted that the relative difference was averaged so it is necessary to represent all comparisons in one frame as shown in fig 16 we found that 76 79 71 43 and 98 21 of the 56 cases exhibited relative differences 20 for experiment vs regression experiment vs simulation and regression vs simulation respectively hence the accuracy of the simulation results was improved by adjustment 4 conclusions we estimated settlements associated with two cube type ar models during free fall installation into soft soil samples using a laboratory scale experiment regression analysis and numerical simulation in total we explored 56 combinations of two ar models four soil samples and seven impact velocities settlement tended to increase with increasing impact velocity and ar mass and to decrease with increased soil density all approaches revealed that the most significant parameter controlling ar settlement was soil density followed by impact velocity and then ar mass although the regression analysis results matched the experimental results relatively well most simulation results underestimated the experimental data so we applied adjustment factors to enhance accuracy as a result 76 79 71 43 and 98 21 of the 56 cases exhibited relative differences 20 for experiment vs regression experiment vs simulation and regression vs simulation respectively the accuracy of simulation was improved by adjustment for the terminal velocities of the two ar models 0 640 m s 1 1 40 model and 0 847 m s 1 1 20 model the ranges of settlement were 2 12 5 36 mm for the 1 40 model and 4 56 11 56 mm for the 1 20 model in terms of model heights 50 and 100 mm the loss of effective useable volume ranged from 4 24 to 10 72 for the 1 40 model and 4 56 11 56 for the 1 20 model in other words the effective useable volume of the cube type ar is reduced by approximately 4 12 depending on clay composition if the ar attains terminal velocity during free fall installation such losses 4 12 account for approximately 4 3 80 0 of total losses 5 92 5 recorded in the long term settlements 0 1 1 85 m of the cube type ars height of 2 m which were installed in the fields as described in the regression analysis initial ar free fall settlement compromises ar functionality because it may accelerate long term settlement and reduce the useable volume if differential settlement occurs according to the possible incident angles of ars into the seabed then it may also cause the stability issues thus it is desirable to avoid the initial settlement of ars which is potentially caused by a free fall installation particularly in uncertain conditions e g soil types incident angles etc in this respect a proper site selection e

21003,several studies have identified stability issues related to artificial reefs ars installed on the seabed however initial ar settlement during free fall installation has not been well examined we performed a laboratory scale experiment regression analysis and numerical simulation to evaluate the initial settlements of two cube type ar models during free fall installation into soft soil settlement tended to increase by impact velocity and ar mass but to decrease as soil density increased the most significant parameter controlling settlement was soil density followed by the impact velocity and the ar mass of the 56 cases examined 76 79 71 43 and 98 21 exhibited relative differences of 20 as revealed experimentally and by regression analysis and simulation given the terminal velocities of the two ar models the corresponding settlement ranges were 2 12 5 36 mm and 4 56 11 56 mm respectively thus the effective useable volumes of the ar models fell by approximately 4 12 depending on clay composition if the models attained their terminal velocities during free fall installation these initial settlement data indicate that free fall installation negatively affects both ar stability and functionality graphical abstract image keywords cube artificial reef free fall installation initial settlement laboratory scale experiment numerical collision analysis 1 introduction

ars are thus multi purpose structures kim et al 2016b 2019 however several ecological environmental and engineering issues must be solved given the escalating use of ars jensen et al 2000 svane and peterson 2001 lee et al 2018 as elsewhere e g baine 2001 shyue and yang 2002 sumer and freds√∏e 2002 manoukian et al 2011 lop√©z et al 2016 researchers in korea have identified stability issues associated with ars installed on the seabed since 1971 all of sampling side scan sonar multi beam echo sounder and scuba diving data have been evaluated most seabed soils are soft materials kim et al 2008a 2008d 2009 either sand silt and clay kim et al 2010 or sandy mud muddy sand and mud yoon et al 2016 ars installed at various sites on such soils settled by 0 6 1 85 m kim et al 2008a 0 1 1 3 m kim et al 2008d 0 7 1 3 m kim et al 2009 and 1 9 2 0 m kim et al 2010 the causes of such severe settlement include soft soil ar weight and structure intensive ar stacking free fall installation and physical features such as currents and waves e g barber et al 2009 london convention and protocol unep 2009 fabi et al 2015 yoon et al 2016 settlement reduces the effective useable ar volume and thus functionality kim and kim 2008 yoon et al 2016 the effective useable volume is usually measured with the aid of a multi beam echo sounder and excludes volumes lost due to burial breakage washout and settlement several recommendations have been presented to prevent severe ar settlement these recommendations can be classified into two types reformation of ar design and enhancement of the surrounding environment these elements are connected no ar can be independent of the environment thus reef design should be extended to include at least site selection it is essential that the ar should resist local hydrodynamic forces not exceed the capacity of the underlying sediment to support its weight and maintain its structural integrity sheng 2000 several new ar designs seek to reduce scour and accordingly settlement e g d√ºzbastƒ±lar and ≈üent√ºrk 2009 fabi et al 2011 2015 l√≥pez et al 2016 lee et al 2018 other methods used to reduce settlement include seabed reinforcement with a bed of small stones or pebbles lindberg and relini 2000 or a geogrid or geogrid bamboo structure yun and kim 2018 in terms of site selection most researchers recommend that ars not be installed on soft seabed soils see table 1 however some initial ar deployments were performed without adequate site investigations which led to settlement issues in several countries including south korea even if the substrate is hard local scouring erosion d√ºzbastƒ±lar et al 2006 and sediment accretion in the vicinity of an ar may lead to partial or complete burial sheng 2000 settlement issues become more pronounced when ars are installed via free fall or are intensively stacked free fall installation was common in the past especially for relatively small inexpensive ars e g cube type ars an ar falls at a rate dictated by its weight buoyancy and the drag force attaining a terminal velocity at a critical depth and colliding with the seabed to impart a maximum kinetic energy manoukian et al 2011 kim and na 2019 this collision results in initial settlement the extent of which depends on the soil incident angle and level of kinetic energy initial settlement becomes more evident if ars are installed via intensive stacking kim et al 2017 thus featuring collisions between an already installed ar and a new falling ar yoon et al 2016 the physical environment affecting ar settlement can be viewed on either a large or small scale sheng 2000 large scale features include the physical processes in play at spatial scales much larger than that of the ar structure small scale features include the physical environment in the immediate vicinity of the ar which is influenced by local climate large scale physical processes and interactions between the ar and the surrounding water and sediment the ar may experience scour and may slide be overturned and undergo settlement sometimes leading to washout or burial lindberg and seaman 2011 yoon et al 2016 unballasted ar tire bundles deployed approximately 1 8 km offshore of florida became washed out sherman and spieler 2006 similarly used tire ars in southeast asia were easily scattered by currents chou 1997 recently a cylinder type ar was reported near the coast of busan south korea 156 km distant from the installation site near tsushima island japan na 2020 if burial is defined by submergence of more than half an ar into the seabed several examples can be given in one two layer ar more than half of the ar height was submerged in sandy mud kim et al 2010 the primary cause may be severe settlement accretion of sandy mud in the vicinity of the reef or both associated with free fall installation intensive stacking and the physical environment previously settlement has been recorded no earlier than a few years after ar installation but free fall installation and intensive stacking are associated with major initial settlement few authors have explored whether initial settlement affects long term settlement this may be primarily attributable to a lack of interest in current ar practice and poor engineering and or failure to realize that this is a serious issue it is presently necessary to inspect the seabed immediately after ar installation this process increases costs it would be preferable to predict initial settlement during the design stage lindberg and relini 2000 either a laboratory scale experiment or numerical simulation could be used to this end the former option is preferable but it is difficult to reproduce the seabed conditions in deep water the results depend on how well these problems are solved the second option simulation is relatively easy but it can be difficult to select a reasonable material model here we explore the settlement of two cube type ar models during installation on several types of soft soil we perform a laboratory scale experiment regression analysis and numerical simulation we chose cube type ars because these were installed via free falls from vessels over nearly 139 413 ha 1394 km2 of korean coastal waters from 1971 to 2013 kim et al 2017 accounting for 64 5 of the total ar area and 67 4 of the volume kim et al 2016b cube type ars are popular in korea and elsewhere because of their simple shape good workability and relatively low cost sheehy 1982 chua and chou 1994 l√∂k et al 2002 jan et al 2003 it is worthwhile to explore free fall settlement e g kim et al 2010 yoon et al 2016 we used 1 40 and 1 20 ar models their terminal velocities were calculated based on the drag coefficients derived via numerical flow analysis ar settlements into soils of different compositions were measured next we developed a regression equation for settlement estimation and identified parameters that significantly affected settlement for numerical simulation of the collision the riedel hiermaier thoma rht concrete model and the drucker prager dp material model were employed to represent the ar and seabed soil compositions respectively transient dynamic analyses were performed to simulate the collision between an ar and various seabed soils yielding settlement data finally the experimental regression and simulation results were compared in terms of accuracy and the simulation results were improved using scale factors the hypotheses and limitations of this study are as follows first in terms of the drag coefficient of a box type ar we only considered pressure form drag because the ar is blunt second the terminal ar velocity was obtained by considering only ar weight buoyancy and drag third we used 1 40 and 1 20 models of a cube type ar during preparation we discovered that the densities differed slightly 2308 and 2146 kg m 3 from the target value 2314 kg m 3 nevertheless we used the target value when calculating terminal velocities fourth we prepared four different soil clay samples that we held saturated for 2 months in plastic bags to ensure that they behaved as natural seabed soils do we assumed that this mimicked saturated seabed conditions fifth during simulations we used the rht concrete and dp material models to analyze the ar material and seabed soils respectively these models have certain limitations for example the drucker prager model may not accurately model the porosity of fully saturated soils thus the simulations may underestimate ar settlement finally our primary concern was estimation of initial settlement into seabed soil after free fall installation so we assumed that the material model used to analyze the target structure the cube type ar and ar failure were not of major concern 2 materials and methods 2 1 cube type ars and clay deposits cube type ars in south korea are fabricated from concrete steel reinforced bars of typical dimensions 1 m l 1 m b 1 m h and 2 m l 2 m b 2 m h kim et al 2008b 2008c the latter ar thus has a volume of 8 m3 and weighs 33 34 kn 3 4 tonnes this kind of ar features eight horizontal and four vertical members each with a thickness of 0 25 m jung et al 2016 these ars have been used to improve fisheries and protect migratory fish given the relatively large void accessible from each surface kim et al 2014a fig 1 presents two models of the cube type ar 2 m 2 m 2 m used 1 40 and 1 20 the dimensions are 50 mm l 50 mm b 50 mm h and 100 mm l 100 mm b 100 mm h respectively fig 2 the member thicknesses are 6 25 mm and 12 5 mm respectively for numerical simulation the original ar shape fig 1 was modified by excluding the four triangular corners fig 2 the calculated densities of the 1 40 and 1 20 models were 2308 and 2146 kg

clay giao et al 2003 standard sand silt and kaolin have grain diameters of 0 5 2 mm 0 002 0 063 mm and 0 025 0 035 Œºm respectively we prepared four clay samples with different mixing ratios table 2 for example sample 1 contained 20 sand 40 silt and 40 kaolin of the four samples sample 3 had the highest proportion of sand 65 22 followed by samples 2 4 and 1 we kept all samples saturated in plastic bags for 2 months prior to each experiment the surface of each sample was flattened to ensure accurate settlement measurements the densities of the four soil samples were 1 86 g ml 1 or 1 86 10 6 g m 3 1 92 g ml 1 or 1 92 10 6 g m 3 2 06 g ml 1 or 2 06 10 6 g m 3 and 1 80 g ml 1 or 1 80 10 6 g m 3 respectively 2 2 use of flow analysis to derive drag coefficients in fluid mechanics drag refers to forces acting on a solid in the direction of the relative fluid flow velocity the drag on a solid is generally dependent on its velocity v and may be either linear or quadratic owen and ryu 2005 the parameter differentiating these two regimes is the reynolds number r e which is the ratio of the inertial to the viscous forces as shown in eq 1 here œÅ f is the fluid density l a characteristic cross sectional length v the solid velocity and Œ∑ the dynamic fluid viscosity 1 r e œÅ f l v Œ∑ when a solid is moving underwater eq 2 yields a good approximation of drag here f d l i n and f d q u a d refer to the linear and quadratic regimes respectively the linear regime is attributable to the viscous drag of the medium drag is generally proportional to the medium viscosity and the linear solid size the quadratic regime is attributable to the fact that the solid accelerates the medium with which it is continually colliding the drag is proportional to the density of the medium and the cross sectional area of the solid here b and c are the coefficients that are sought 2 f d f d l i n f d q u a d b v c v 2 at a high reynolds number e g r e 103 the quadratic regime dominates and the linear regime is negligible in such a case the numerator of eq 1 parasitic drag is a representative drag of the quadratic regime and is a combination of pressure form drag and friction skin drag these two drags significantly affect the total drag acting on an underwater solid hasanloo et al 2012 woo et al 2014 woo and na 2014 pressure drag dependent on the form of the solid follows the drag equation thus increasing with the square of the speed and becomes of particular concern at high speeds in contrast friction drag is caused by fluid friction against the skin of an object moving through the fluid tangential forces are created when a fluid flows over a surface a rough surface experiences more friction drag that is directly proportional to the wetted surface rea friction drag also increases with the square of the velocity consider a smooth body moving through viscous incompressible water at a speed v the drag coefficient c d is defined in eq 3 where f d is the drag œÅ w is the water density and a is a characteristic area it should be noted that the total drag is the sum of the friction and pressure drags and that the drag coefficient is a function of the reynolds number r e 3 c d f d 1 2 œÅ w a v 2 consider flow over a flat plate lying parallel to the flow the total drag is equal to the friction drag the drag coefficient is as shown in eq 4 here œÑ w is the shear stress caused by flow and a is the total surface area in contact with the fluid i e the wetted area hence the drag coefficient depends on the shear stress 4 c d s u r f a c e œÑ w d a 1 2 œÅ w a v 2 now consider an example of pressure drag flow over a flat plate lying normal to the flow the total drag is equal to the pressure drag because the wall shear stress is perpendicular to the flow direction and therefore does not contribute to drag for such a case the drag coefficient is as shown in eq 5 here p is the pressure caused by flow and a is the frontal or projected area of the object with this geometry the flow separates from the edges of the plate and backflow recirculating flow is observed in the low energy plate wake 5 c d s u r f a c e p d a 1 2 œÅ w a v 2 it should be noted that the drag coefficients for all objects with sharp edges are usually independent of the reynolds number r e 103 because the edges serve as separation points and the size of the wake is thus determined by the geometry of the object fox et al 2004 therefore we assumed that the drag coefficients of cube type ars were independent of the reynolds number the ars have sharp edges in other words regardless of the reynolds number the drag coefficients were assumed to be constant additionally because each ar was installed normal to the flow direction we assumed that pressure drag was the major contributor to the drag coefficient thus we used eq 5 in general pressure cannot be analytically determined hence we used numerical flow analysis to determine the drag coefficient of a cube type ar similar analyses have been performed to obtain the drag coefficients of 24 already installed ars woo et al 2014 in contrast our flow analysis focused on freefall ar installation the drag coefficient is required when calculating the terminal velocity of a box type ar thus we performed flow analyses to determine the pressure field around ars by applying the element based finite volume method ebfvm used in computational fluid dynamics which has found many applications in aircraft underwater pipeline and ar engineering gylys et al 2012 liu and su 2013 liu et al 2013 kim et al 2014a 2014b 2016a 2016b we used the procedure of woo and na 2014 we made certain assumptions first water is incompressive viscous and newtonian second the water temperature is 25 c the density is 1000 kg m 3 and the dynamic viscosity is 8 899 10 4 kg m 1 s 1 finally we used the shear stress transport model of menter 1994 to deal with turbulence we employed ansys cfx software for ebfvm analysis ansys inc 2012 the flow field the domain was of dimensions 20 m l 20 m b 20 m h and the ar was located at the center the domain size was 10 fold that of the ar size 2 m 2 m 2m the boundaries and ar surfaces were well separated the boundary featured a symmetrical inlet and outlet at the inlet the initial flow velocity was 10 m s 1 because velocities at or below this level do not affect ar drag coefficients woo et al 2014 the outlet featured a zero pressure gradient the side faces were assumed to be symmetrical to minimize any boundary effect on the flow domain for precision hexahedrons with eight nodes served as the elements the maximum element size near the ar was 0 044 m and the maximum element size distant from the ar was 0 22 m the analysis yielded the drag coefficient c d 1 40 of a box type ar used for terminal velocity calculation 2 3 terminal velocities and critical depths the motions of the objects the ar models can be described by eq 6 newton s second law of motion here w is the gravitational force f b is the buoyant force f d is the drag force m s is the mass of the model g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 and v is the velocity thus eq 6 becomes eq 7 here m w is the water mass œÅ w is the water density 1000 kg m 3 c d is the drag coefficient 1 40 of the ar model and a is the projected area of the model the terminal velocity is the highest velocity attainable by an object as it falls through a fluid in fluid dynamics an object attains its terminal velocity when its speed becomes constant because of an opposing restraining force thus when the acceleration d v d t is zero in eq 7 the terminal velocity is obtained as shown in eq 8 here œÅ s is the density 2314 kg m 3 of the ar model and v is the volume 6 f y w f b f d m s d v d t 7 m s g m w

can be solved by separation of variables with an initial velocity indicating free fall i e v 0 0 thus the falling collision velocity v t of each ar model can be expressed by eq 9 9 a v t v t tanh œÅ s œÅ w œÅ s g v t t given the initial distance i e y 0 0 and integrating eq 9 the falling collision distance of each ar model is given by eq 10 10 y t œÅ s œÅ s œÅ w v t 2 g ln cosh œÅ s œÅ w œÅ s g v t t fig 3 presents the falling velocities vs distance curves of the two models 1 40 and 1 20 here v t is the terminal velocity and y c is the critical depth corresponding to v t the terminal velocities of the two models are 0 640 and 0 847 m s 1 at 0 460 and 0 660 s respectively and the corresponding critical depths are 0 243 and 0 464 m 2 4 material modeling of the ar for numerical simulation as mentioned above the cube type ar is fabricated from concrete steel reinforced bars it is reasonable to not consider the bars during ar modeling our focus is on seabed settlement during ar installation in general concrete exhibits non linear compression behavior given its inhomogeneity and porosity therefore we used the rht concrete model of riedel et al 1999 which has been widely employed for damage analysis when concrete encounters transient dynamic forces such as collisions and explosions riedel et al 1999 2009 ding et al 2013 hu et al 2016 abdel kader 2019 transient dynamic analysis requires an equation of state a strength equation a failure equation and erosion criteria the rht concrete model features the p Œ± equation of state dedicated strength and failure equations and erosion criteria based on geometric distortion tu and lu 2009 tables 3 5 list the associated material parameters modified from heck√∂tter and sievers 2017 the p Œ± equation of state of a fully

material thermodynamic state which is dependent on p and e however it is difficult to evaluate Œ± in the absence of considerable data assume that the shock hugoniot reflects the relationship between p

an iterative approach must be used to solve for the current pressure because that pressure p is implicitly involved in eq 12 tu and lu 2009 it should be noted that an equation of state e g the p Œ± equation of state above is independent of the material used concrete is very brittle thus vulnerable to tensile loading at small deformations borrvall and riedel 2011 the rht strength model depicts

granular frictional materials such as soils rocks and concrete e g mouazen and nem√©nyi 1997 alejano and bobet 2012 yang 2020 several such models are available including the classic drucker prager model drucker and prager 1952 extended drucker prager models e g hadjigeorgiou et al 1998 pariseau 2007 drucker prager cap models e g lubarda et al 1996 and drucker prager concrete models e g yu et al 2010 to simulate the material behavior of seabed soil clay we used an extended drucker prager edp model the so called edp linear model this model is characterized by a linear yield criterion a linear plastic flow potential and plastic strain increments some aspects of the model are briefly introduced below the edp material model includes three yield criteria with flow potentials similar to those of the classic drucker prager model commonly used to analyze geomaterials exhibiting internal cohesion and friction the yield functions can be combined with an isotropic or kinematic hardening rule if yield stress evolves during plastic deformation for analysis we used an edp linear yield criterion œÉ y 0 as shown in eq 22 here œÉ e is the equivalent von mises stress œÉ y is the uniaxial yield stress and Œ± is the pressure sensitivity the uniaxial yield stress œÉ y is expressed as a function of œÜ and the cohesive value intercept c is defined in eq 23 the pressure sensitivity Œ± is a

respectively based on those values we considered seven experimental impact velocities 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 25 1 50 1 75 and 2 00 m s 1 using the law of conservation of energy yoon and na 2013 the corresponding falling heights were 13 29 51 80 115 156 and 204 mm respectively these heights were used to simulate ar installation the experimental setup is shown in fig 5 and featured a pylon an inelastic string a ruler the ar models and clay we tested four soil samples seven impact velocities and two ar models 56 combinations for each case we performed five tests and averaged the values 2 7 simulation setup using the material models of the ar and the seabed soil as summarized as tables 3 6 a numerical model was constructed as shown in fig 6 here the initial conditions were v t 0 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 25 1 50 1 75 and 2 00 m s 1 and y t 0 1 mm an initial displacement 1 mm was intentionally applied to simulate free fall the boundary conditions were u x u y u z 0 at the left and right sides and free at the top and bottom the seabed was 20 cm l 20 cm w 10 cm h as shown in fig 6 the lagrangian method was used to describe the interactions vertical movements between the ar models and the seabed to measure ar model settlements we selected four nodal points at each corner of the top side the simulations terminated when vertical movement ceased we used ansys autodyn software for simulation this efficiently solves collision or large deformation problems woo et al 2015 2016 ansys inc 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results table 7 lists the seabed impact velocities of the 1 40 and 1 20 models into soils 1 to 4 settlement varied by impact velocity soil density and the ar model mass settlement tended to increase with velocity and mass fig 7 but velocity was more significant because kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity in contrast as shown in fig 8 settlement tended to decrease as soil density increased the effects of soil density and ar mass became more evident as the velocity increased of the 56 settlements the maxima of the 1 20 model were 33 4 mm sample 1 18 2 mm sample 2 13 0 mm sample 3 and 35 2 mm sample 4 respectively for the 1 40 model the maxima were 20 2 mm sample 1 12 2 mm sample 2 7 6 mm sample 3 and 21 2 mm sample 4 respectively all maxima were attained at the highest impact velocity 2 00 m s 1 we present the gradients of impact velocities by soil density in table 8 depending on the impact velocities the gradients were all positive from 0 65 to 2 11 for the 1 40 model and from 0 38 to 1 13 for the 1 20 model in terms of soil densities the gradients were all negative and ranged from 0 56 to 5 59 for the 1 40 model and 0 50 to 9 17 for the 1 20 model thus the primary parameter controlling settlement is soil density followed by the impact velocity and the ar mass 3 2 regression analysis equation 29 is a general multiple regression equation ∆í œë i x i featuring three independent variables x i i 1 2 and 3 here œë 0 is an intercept factor and œë i represents values of regression factors taking the impact velocity v unit of m s 1 soil density d unit of kg m 3 and ar mass m unit of kg as independent variables settlement s unit of m can be expressed as a function of v d and m as shown in eq 30 using the natural logarithm and the identity we can rewrite eq 30 as eq 31 which is in similar form to eq 29 here the coefficients are as follows Œ≤ 0 e œë 0 and Œ≤ i œë i i 1 2 and 3 we used the experimental data figs 7 and 8 to derive these coefficients Œ≤ 0 4 515 1020 Œ≤ 1 1 263

Œ≤ 3 ln m 32 s 4 515 10 20 v 1 263 d 6 888 m 0 207 in eq 32 the positive values 1 263 and 0 207 for Œ≤ 1 and Œ≤ 3 reflect not only the positive effects of the independent variables v and m on ar settlement s but also the fact that the impact velocity v contributes more than does the ar mass m in contrast the negative value of 6 888 for Œ≤ 2 shows that a higher soil density d mitigates ar settlement given the magnitudes the most significant parameter affecting settlement is soil density followed by the impact velocity and then by the ar mass it should be emphasized that all of these observations were confirmed experimentally figs 7 and 8 for comparative purposes the regression analysis and experimental results are plotted in fig 9 of all data 76 79 had relative errors 20 thus validating the accuracy of the regression equation we used the terminal velocities of the two ar models 0 640 m s 1 1 40 model and 0 847 m s 1 1 20 model to calculate settlements from the regression equation eq 32 for the 1 40 model the settlements were 4 27 mm sample 1 3 44 mm sample 2 2 12 mm sample 3 and 5 36 mm sample 4 given the height 50 mm of the 1 40 model the settlements indicate effective useable volume losses of 8 54 sample 1 6 88 sample 2 4 24 sample 3 and 10 72 sample 4 respectively for the 1 20 model the settlements were 9 22 mm sample 1 7 41 mm sample 2 4 56 mm sample 3 and 11 56 mm sample 4 given the height 100 mm of the 1 20 model the settlements indicate useable volume losses of 9 22 sample 1 7 41 sample 2 4 56 sample 3 and 11 56 sample 4 respectively the effective useable volume losses ranged from 4 24 to 10 72 for the 1 40 model and 4 56 11 56 for the 1 20 model these findings indicate the negative effects of initial free fall installation on ar settlement in other words the effective useable volume of the cube type ar decreases by approximately 4 12 depending on the clay composition if the ar attains terminal velocity during the initial installation given the long term settlement range 0 1 1 85 m of cube type ars 2 m 2 m 2 m observed in the field kim et al 2008a 2008d 2009 the effective useable volume loss is 5 0 92 5 of which the initial effective useable volume loss 4 12 accounts for approximately 4 3 80 0 it should be emphasized here that the initial settlement compromises functionality rather than stability of ars the loss of the effective useable volume according to the initial settlement should be considered as the loss of ar functionality because it reduces not only the useable volume of an ar but also the neighboring space between ars however uniform settlement of ars does not necessarily indicates the loss of ar stability because the settlement may increase the interlocking mechanism with the seabed and possible random stacking may create the interlocking of ars however if differential settlement occurs due to inclination angles of falling ars to the seabed han et al 2020 then the interlocking with the seabed may weaken potential stability issues e g scouring and washout may occur and consequently overall layout of the intensively stacking form may collapse yoon et al 2016 nevertheless it should be noted that the free fall installation is an economic way to deploy relatively cheaper ars e g cube type ar in comparison to the controlled deployment with wires and divers that require more time cost equipment and manpower thus it is not always better to install ars in the controlled manner for a relatively large scale ar set group or complex thus the major concern here is the seabed soil condition the number of ars considered and the economic way to install in this respect a proper site selection e g kennish et al 2002 barber et al 2009 mousavi et al 2015 and a promising ar design should be made in the pre deployment stage considering the goal scale and budget of an ar project for the site selection as discussed in the study the soft seabed soils should be avoided to secure the useable volume functionality and to mitigate a possible potential of stability issue that is why this study focused on measurement and prediction of the initial settlement and accordingly the corresponding effective useable volume loss 3 3 simulation results table 9 lists the simulation results of 1 40 and 1 20 models falling into seabed soil samples 1 to 4 by the impact velocities and soil densities all results were recorded at four nodal points as explained earlier and the magnitudes compared for all cases the four values at the four nodal points were nearly identical as expected given the geometrical symmetry as shown in table 9 settlement varied by the impact velocity soil density and the ar model ar mass for soil sample 1 and the 1 40 model the displacement contours are shown in fig 10 for the seven impact velocities negative vertical displacements settlements are evident under the model frames and positive displacements protrusions in the center and around the model for the 1 40 model the experimental and simulation results are shown in fig 11 of the four samples the experimental and simulation results were similar for samples 2 and 3 but not for samples 1 and 4 because the densities d s 2 1 92 10 6 and d s 3 2 06 10 6 g m 3 of samples 2 and 3 were larger than those d s 1 1 86 10 6 and d s 4 1 80 10 6 g m 3 of samples 1 and 4 the differences between the experimental and simulation results increased as the impact velocity increased in other words the differences were clearer when settlement was relatively large the averaged relative differences were 18 54 sample 2 21 68 sample 3 43 63 sample 1 and 52 04 sample 4 respectively for the 1 20 model the experimental and simulation results are shown in fig 12 observations were similar to those described above the averaged relative differences were 8 67 sample 2 24 10 sample 3 33 85 sample 1 and 40 61 sample 4 respectively to allow more detailed comparison all experimental and simulation results are plotted in fig 13 of the 56 cases 59 66 exhibited relative differences of 20 hence simulation accuracy requires improvement the inaccuracy is explained by soil porosity during settlement two soil movements can occur the first is particle rearrangement attributable to porosity the particles first move closer together and then even closer if kinetic energy is imparted to them however the material model used for seabed soil does not consider porosity as an example fig 14 a presents the particle arrangement of the high density sample the particles are very close thus with small gaps and particle re arrangement occurs rapidly after collision accordingly the re arrangement effect on settlement is minor in comparison to movement imparted by kinetic energy in contrast the particle arrangement of the low density sample shown in fig 14b is associated with relatively large settlement attributable to both particle re arrangement and kinetic energy this explains why the experimental and simulation results for samples 1 and 4 exhibit relatively large differences to increase simulation accuracy we developed adjustment factors afs the ratios of the experimental to simulation results for each ar model and soil sample we calculated seven adjustment factors corresponding to the seven impact velocities and then averaged them for each ar model the four averaged factors are plotted with respect to the four soil densities d in fig 15 yielding trend lines a f 1 40 and a f 1 20 then using all eight points we obtained a final trend line a f although the first two lines exhibit better coefficients of determination r2 0 94 and 0 85 than the final line r2 0 82 we selected the trend line a f as representative as shown in eq 33 because it was associated with all points of the ar models 33 a f 4 20 d 9 39 applying these adjustment factors to the simulation results of the 1 40 model the averaged relative differences become 10 19 sample 2 10 20 sample 3 22 14 sample 1 and 12 91 sample 4 for the 1 20 model the averaged relative differences become 37 43 sample 2 14 48 sample 3 12 74 sample 1 and 10 11 sample 4 of the eight relative differences only two exceed 20 hence application of eq 33 to the simulation results improved accuracy however it should be noted that the relative difference was averaged so it is necessary to represent all comparisons in one frame as shown in fig 16 we found that 76 79 71 43 and 98 21 of the 56 cases exhibited relative differences 20 for experiment vs regression experiment vs simulation and regression vs simulation respectively hence the accuracy of the simulation results was improved by adjustment 4 conclusions we estimated settlements associated with two cube type ar models during free fall installation into soft soil samples using a laboratory scale experiment regression analysis and numerical simulation in total we explored 56 combinations of two ar models four soil samples and seven impact velocities settlement tended to increase with increasing impact velocity and ar mass and to decrease with increased soil density all approaches revealed that the most significant parameter controlling ar settlement was soil density followed by impact velocity and then ar mass although the regression analysis results matched the experimental results relatively well most simulation results underestimated the experimental data so we applied adjustment factors to enhance accuracy as a result 76 79 71 43 and 98 21 of the 56 cases exhibited relative differences 20 for experiment vs regression experiment vs simulation and regression vs simulation respectively the accuracy of simulation was improved by adjustment for the terminal velocities of the two ar models 0 640 m s 1 1 40 model and 0 847 m s 1 1 20 model the ranges of settlement were 2 12 5 36 mm for the 1 40 model and 4 56 11 56 mm for the 1 20 model in terms of model heights 50 and 100 mm the loss of effective useable volume ranged from 4 24 to 10 72 for the 1 40 model and 4 56 11 56 for the 1 20 model in other words the effective useable volume of the cube type ar is reduced by approximately 4 12 depending on clay composition if the ar attains terminal velocity during free fall installation such losses 4 12 account for approximately 4 3 80 0 of total losses 5 92 5 recorded in the long term settlements 0 1 1 85 m of the cube type ars height of 2 m which were installed in the fields as described in the regression analysis initial ar free fall settlement compromises ar functionality because it may accelerate long term settlement and reduce the useable volume if differential settlement occurs according to the possible incident angles of ars into the seabed then it may also cause the stability issues thus it is desirable to avoid the initial settlement of ars which is potentially caused by a free fall installation particularly in uncertain conditions e g soil types incident angles etc in this respect a proper site selection e g kennish et al 2002 barber et al 2009 mousavi et al 2015 and a promising ar design should be made in the pre deployment stage by considering the goal scale and budget of an ar project credit

21004,compared with the conventional floating offshore platforms the fowts floating offshore wind turbines are subjected to larger wind heeling moments to cause significant pitch motions which bring challenges to the power generation efficiency and structure safety due to the existence of wind turbines in addition the dynamic cable connected with fowt is subject to a load that is greatly affected by horizontal motions of fowt therefore the inhibitions of horizontal and pitch motions are vital to fowt however conventional mooring systems mainly inhibit the horizontal motions of floating structures in this paper an innovative type of mooring system is proposed to inhibit both the horizontal and pitch motions of fowt the analytical results based on the innovative mooring system are compared with those of conventional mooring system in addition the mechanism of restoring forces and moments of mooring systems are analyzed and discussed keywords floating wind turbine mooring system pitch motion horizontal motion restoring force and moment 1 introduction with the continuous development of offshore wind power lee and zhao 2020 it has become an inevitable trend to go to the deep sea with the increasing of water depth the structural safety and economic efficiency of fixed offshore wind turbines are greatly challenged compared with the fixed type floating offshore wind turbines have a better development prospect in deep sea different from conventional floating oil or gas platforms there is a set of wind power generation equipment added on the fowt which is subjected to a large wind heeling moment in addition the nacelle of wind turbine is of great mass and height the issues mentioned above result in significant pitch motions the pitch motions of fowt bring great challenge to its structural safety and power generation efficiency based on the problems above many scholars have studied the influence of pitch motions on fowt jeon et al 2014 proposed several hypothetical flow states of fowt under pitch motions and verified them using vortex lattice method the results showed that a turbulent wake state tws arises when the fowt is pitching in the upwind direction which is unpredictable in blade element method bem simulation shen et al 2018 studied the influence of pitch motions on unsteady aerodynamics using a lifting surface method with a free wake model the research found that the pitch motions lead to highly unsteady aerodynamics which not only affects the aerodynamic torque but also other loads on the wind turbine and with the increasing of pitch frequency the average power output of the wind turbine increases and the average rotor thrust decreases karimian et al karimian aliabadi and rasekh 2020 also analyzed the aerodynamic characteristics of fowt under pitch motions with the coupled aerodynamic pitch angle control system model compared with fixed platform cases the mean thrust coefficient is reduced for almost all range of tip speed ratios tsrs and the mean power coefficient for tsrs less than 7 is also reduced while the cases for high tsrs is just the reverse with the input of pitch motions xiao et al xiao and yang 2019 investigated the effects of ocean swell waves and swell induced pitch motions on the wake flow statistics and power extraction of floating wind turbines with a hybrid numerical model coupling wind large eddy les and high order spectral wave comparison between the fixed and floating turbine cases showed that swell induced turbine pitch motions cause noticeable oscillations of vertical velocity variance and reynolds stress therefore it s critical to reduce the pitch motions of fowt lackner 2009 designed a new variable power collective pitch controller which produces substantial reductions in the pitch motions and velocities larsen et al larsen and hanson 2007 found that blade pitch control induces negative damping of fowt pitching oscillation in some cases on this basis iino et al 2012 improved the control algorism of wind turbine to reduce pitch negative damping by analysis and verified the control performance with small scaled experiment guo et al 2012 also designed a wind turbine controller with pid control the results showed that individual pitch control technique is able to effectively reduce pitching motions of fowt along with little influence on output power kakuya et al 2018 proposed a floating platform vibration control method to reduce pitch motions of fowt this method can efficiently suppress the vibration of pitch angles moreover the dynamic cable connected with fowt is subject to a load that is greatly affected by horizontal motions of fowt thies et al 2017 evaluated the influences of the environmental conditions and the cable design parameters on the mechanical loads and potential failure modes of a dynamic cable attached to a dynamic floating structure they found that the cable should maintain as s shaped as possible which is influenced greatly by horizontal motions of floating structure to achieve a good load distribution along the cable and high reliability taninoki et al 2017 developed a dynamic cable system for a hybrid spar type fowt and its motions and mechanical stress were calculated the results confirmed that the cable system withstands mechanical stress caused by the large horizontal motions of fowt in addition bae li et al bae et al 2017 li et al 2018 investigated the influence on cable induced by the large horizontal offset of fowt under the failure of one mooring line and the research showed that the cable is likely to be disconnected generally the horizontal and pitch motions of fowt should be inhibited the horizontal motions are usually inhibited by mooring system and the optimization of pitch motion performance of fowt usually starts from the control system the optimization of control system does have a significant effect on pitch motions but it may be unsteady while faced with complicated environment conditions and decreases the efficiency of power generation besides the redesign of platform structure may be an effective method to improve motion performance but it will also significantly increase time and economic costs as we all know the conventional mooring system usually use catenaries or taut elastic mooring lines and the fairleads are put at the same depth to keep the horizontal position of floating platform the catenary mooring system mainly depends on the gravity of mooring lines to provide restoring force while the taut mooring system mainly depends on the elastic elongation in this paper an innovative type of mooring system is proposed to inhibit both the horizontal and pitch motions of fowt to verify the effects of innovative mooring system on horizontal and pitch motion inhibition the dynamic responses of fowt are analyzed and then compared with the conventional type the results show that the motion performances of fowt with this innovative mooring system are both enhanced in these two dofs degrees of freedom consequently in order to improve the motion performances of fowt the innovative mooring system proposed by the authors is an efficient economical and reliable scheme the hydrodynamics are calculated by aqwa and the aerodynamic calculation of wind turbine including data transfer with the floating foundation are completed by an external dll file yang et al 2020 2 mooring system 2 1 fowt model in this paper the oc3 hywind spar and nrel 5mw offshore wind turbine are used for case study the main performance parameters of fowt are given in table 1 and principle dimensions of oc3 hywind are shown in fig 1 jonkman et al 2009 jonkman 2010 the origin of the reference coordinate system is on the horizontal plane the oxy plane coincides with the still water surface and the z axis is vertically upward which coincides with the center line of the platform as shown in fig 2 2 2 design philosophy the conventional mooring system mainly inhibits the horizontal motions of floating structures but has little effects on pitch motions in this study an innovative type of mooring system is proposed by the authors of this paper to reduce both the horizontal and pitch motions of fowt the fairleads of conventional mooring system are usually at the same depth the innovative type of mooring system divides fairleads into two groups which are at different depths in this way the mooring system can provide larger restoring moments to resist the heeling moments meanwhile compared with the conventional type this mooring system is able to generate larger horizontal restoring forces taking advantage of the pitch motions of fowt which will be explained detailly in 4 3 a similar concept was introduced by jochem jochem 2019 11 but there was no more detailed introduction about it except a figure according to the figure it can be seen that the mooring lines were taut spread with suction anchors the mooring system proposed in this paper is designed with catenary which has better fatigue performance and is more convenient for installation and maintaining compared with the taut type in conclusion compared with the conventional type the innovative mooring system proposed in this paper mainly has two following improvements 1 generating larger pitch restoring moments to reduce pitch motions 2 generating larger horizontal restoring forces to reduce horizontal motions the motion inhibition performances of innovative and conventional mooring systems are calculated and compared in this paper the detailed parameters of mooring lines are given in table 2 and the layouts of two mooring systems are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 these two types both have 9 mooring lines and the conventional type put all the fairleads at the same water depth 70m while the innovative type put them at two different water depths 10m line no 1 3 4 6 7 9 120m line no 2 5 8 additionally the total mooring line length of innovative and conventional mooring system are respectively 8820m and 8550m it is means that the innovative mooring system improves the motion performance significantly at a small cost compared with redesign of the platform 2 3 static restoring stiffnesses the static restoring stiffnesses of two mooring systems are calculated as shown in fig 5 the piecewise extrapolating method is employed to solve the static problem of a single line by discretization boundary conditions and iteration fan et al 2014 thus the restoring forces of mooring system can be obtained by tension and direction angle of each mooring line it should be noted that the displacements are positive along the x axis and the pitch angle is 0 to make the results clear only the restoring stiffnesses in surge heave and pitch dofs are given which are the most important to fowt additionally the shapes of mooring line with fairleads at different depths for different displacements in the same vertical plane are presented as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 5 the horizontal restoring stiffnesses of two mooring systems are basically equal while the pitch motions are not considered the vertical restoring stiffness of innovative type is a little larger than that of conventional type it s obvious that the pitch restoring stiffness generated by innovative type is nearly a magnitude larger than that of conventional type which helps to reduce the pitch motions 3 methodology 3 1 frequency domain analysis based on the three dimension potential flow theory the diffraction potential and radiation

based on the rate of change of linear and angular momentum the difference frequency force is obtained by full qtf method which includes the influence of second order velocity potential ansys 2018 3 2 aerodynamic loads the thrust and torque of the wind turbine are calculated by blade element momentum bem theory the bem theory discretizes the blade into blade elements and uses the theorem of

results and analysis 4 1 model validation the number of elements used in the hydrodynamic model is 6233 in order to validate the reliability of hydrodynamic model the transfer functions of mean drift force calculated by far field method and near field method are given to verify the quality of mesh generation as shown in fig 7 and it can be seen that the results obtained by two methods are basically close which means that the mesh generation is reliable in addition the added mass and radiation damping in frequency domain are given as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 with comparison to the results in references jonkman 2010 yue et al 2020 the overall trend of them are roughly the same while the numbers are slightly different the main purpose of this paper is to compare the motion inhibition performances of two mooring systems under the condition of ensuring the same hydrodynamic coefficients of platform the slight differences are acceptable thus it can be proved that the hydrodynamic model is reliable 4 2 motion responses the time domain motion responses of fowt with two types of mooring system under the same environment conditions are calculated and compared the environment conditions are given in table 3 jonkman and musial 2010 the jonswap wave spectrum is employed to simulate the random sea waves as shown in fig 10 the wind and wave incidence in the positive direction along the x axis among the 6 dof motions surge heave and pitch are the most important to fowt the motion responses of these three dofs and corresponding power spectral densities psd are presented as shown in fig 11 the time duration of numerical simulation is 10000 s but only 1000 s is captured in the figures to present the results clear as shown in fig 11 the surge and pitch motions of innovative type are significantly smaller than those of conventional type and the heave motions of innovative type are also decreased a little it approves that the innovative mooring system is able to improve the motion performance of fowt especially in the horizontal and pitch dofs according to the motion psd the motions in these three dofs are dominated by low frequency components as for the wave frequency components the heave and pitch motions are more significant than surge motions in addition the natural frequencies of these two types in surge heave and pitch dofs are respectively 0 075 rad s 0 20 rad s and 0 16 rad s the innovative mooring system reduces the peak values of motion psd without changing the peak frequencies in these three dofs compared with the conventional type it indicates that the innovative mooring system will not change the natural motion frequencies of fowt to cause new problems while reducing the motions furthermore the motion responses were statistically processed as shown in table 4 the mean maximum significant values and standard deviations of innovative type in surge and pitch dofs all decrease compared with conventional type which means the motion performances of fowt in surge and pitch dofs are significantly improved by the innovative mooring system and the maximum significant values and standard deviation of innovative type in heave dof are also smaller than those of conventional type which means the innovative mooring system also improves the heave performance of fowt 4 3 analysis on restoring stiffness and damping contributions 4 3 1 restoring stiffness contributions as verified in 4 2 the innovative mooring system has significantly positive effects on surge and pitch motion performances of fowt compared with the conventional type in order to better demonstrate the motion inhibition performances the restoring forces and moments of two mooring systems in surge and pitch dofs are calculated and compared in time domain as shown in fig 12 the statistics of them are given in table 5 in addition since the fowt is not sensitive to heave motions compared with conventional floating platforms with risers the vertical restoring stiffness will not be discussed as shown in fig 12 and table 5 the mean and maximum pitch restoring moments of innovative type are nearly an order of magnitude larger than those of conventional type while the mean and maximum horizontal restoring forces of two mooring systems are basically equal according to table 4 the mean positions of innovative type in pitch and surge dofs respectively decrease 17 87 and 37 97 compared with conventional type it means that the pitch restoring stiffness of innovative type is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of conventional type and horizontal restoring stiffness of innovative type is also obviously larger than that of conventional type the pitch restoring stiffness is consistent with the initial design whereas as mentioned in 2 3 without considering the pitch motions the horizontal static restoring stiffnesses of two mooring systems are basically equal it can be inferred that the pitch motions have positive effects on horizontal restoring stiffness of the innovative mooring system moreover since the innovative mooring system is more sensitive to pitch motions the wave frequency component of horizontal restoring forces of innovative mooring system seems to be intensified under the coupled motions in surge and pitch dofs compared with the conventional type as shown in fig 12 a it will be explained detailly in 4 3 3 4 3 2 mooring damping contributions the motion inhibition performances of mooring system are determined by not only its restoring stiffness but also its damping contribution in order to figure out the damping contributions of these two mooring systems in surge and pitch dofs the free decay tests in still water are numerically simulated as shown in fig 13 similarly the vertical damping contribution will not be discussed it should be noted that the decay test of a certain dof is carried out independently which means that the motions of the other five dofs are set as deactivated to exclude interference according to fig 13 in surge dof the decay curves of conventional and innovative types fit with each other well which means that the damping contributions of two mooring systems in surge dof are basically equal however in pitch dof the decay rate of innovative type is obviously faster than that of conventional type which means that the damping contribution of innovative mooring system in pitch dof is significantly larger than that of conventional type the innovative mooring system is more sensitive to the pitch motion due to the larger distance between two groups of fairleads compared with the conventional type as mentioned in 4 3 1 the pitch motions seem to improve the horizontal restoring stiffness of innovative mooring system in order to find out the effects of pitch motions on horizontal damping contributions of two mooring systems another coupled free decay test in still water is numerically simulated the surge and pitch dofs are both set as activated and both have initial deviations in one decay test while the other four dofs are set as deactivated as shown in fig 14 the results show that when the surge motions are coupled with pitch motions the damping contribution of innovative mooring system in surge dof is obviously increased it can be inferred that the pitch motions have positive effects on horizontal damping contribution of the innovative mooring system in addition the free decay period of innovative type in surge dof increases while coupled with pitch motions which means the horizontal restoring stiffness decreases it seems to be inconsistent with the results obtained before and will be explained in the analysis below when wind and wave incidence in the positive direction along the x axis due to the wind heeling moments the balance positions of fowt in the surge and pitch dofs have positive deviations and the surge displacements and pitch angles are also basically located in the positive interval therefore for the innovative mooring system the positive horizontal deviations of the upper fairleads are obviously larger than that of the center of gravity while the horizontal restoring stiffness of the innovative mooring system mainly depends on the mooring line tension corresponding to these fairleads it will lead to the increase of the horizontal restoring stiffness however the horizontal restoring stiffness of the innovative mooring system is reduced in the surge pitch coupling free decay compared with that of the conventional type this is mainly because the balance positions of each dofs in free decay are 0 while the additional horizontal restoring stiffness induced by pitch motions is asymmetric for the positive and negative angels due to the asymmetric arrangement of mooring lines it might result in the reduction of horizontal restoring stiffness under certain conditions 4 3 3 analysis on power spectral densities based on the results and analysis above it can be inferred that under the influences of environment loads the pitch motions seem to have positive effects on horizontal motion inhibition performances of innovative mooring system compared with conventional type in order to make a deeper analysis the psd of horizontal restoring forces is calculated as shown in fig 15 the peak frequencies of surge heave and pitch motions are marked in fig 15 to make the analysis below clear the low frequency component of psd which represents the conventional type only have one peak value which coincides with the peak frequency of surge psd however for the innovative type the low frequency components of psd have two peak values which coincide with the peak frequencies of surge and pitch psd it indicates that the horizontal restoring forces of conventional mooring system are mainly induced by surge motions but the horizontal restoring forces of innovative type are induced by both surge and pitch motions this is because the innovative mooring system is more sensitive to pitch motions with the effects of larger vertical distance between two groups of fairleads in other words the same pitch angle will result in a larger horizontal deviation at the fairleads of innovative mooring system than those of the conventional type it also confirms the analysis of horizontal restoring stiffness at the end of 4 3 2 moreover the wave frequency components of psd of innovative type are obviously larger than those of conventional type which is consistent with results shown in fig 12 a as mentioned in 4 2 compared with surge motions the pitch motion psd at wave frequency is more significant in this way the wave frequency components of horizontal restoring forces are enlarged based on the above analysis it can be explained that under the influences of environment loads the innovative mooring system is able to generate larger horizontal restoring stiffness and damping contribution with the effects of pitch motions compared with the conventional type 4 4 comparison of mooring line tension in order to research the influence of two mooring systems on mooring line tension the mooring line tension is calculated and compared it is found that the maximum tension is on the mooring line no 6 and no 7 thus the mooring line tension is given in fig 16 and the statistics are given in table 6 according to the results above it is obviously that the maximum tension occurred on mooring line of innovative mooring system increase about 1 3 which is caused by the increase of suspension length of mooring line due to the position of fairlead being moved up though it s dangerous to a mooring system it still can be solved by means such as partial reinforcement the purpose of this paper is to research the motion

21004,compared with the conventional floating offshore platforms the fowts floating offshore wind turbines are subjected to larger wind heeling moments to cause significant pitch motions which bring challenges to the power generation efficiency and structure safety due to the existence of wind turbines in addition the dynamic cable connected with fowt is subject to a load that is greatly affected by horizontal motions of fowt therefore the inhibitions of horizontal and pitch motions are vital to fowt however conventional mooring systems mainly inhibit the horizontal motions of floating structures in this paper an innovative type of mooring system is proposed to inhibit both the horizontal and pitch motions of fowt the analytical results based on the innovative mooring system are compared with those of conventional mooring system in addition the mechanism of restoring forces and moments of mooring systems are analyzed and discussed keywords floating wind turbine mooring system pitch motion horizontal motion restoring force and moment 1 introduction with the continuous development of offshore wind power lee and zhao 2020 it has become an inevitable trend to go to the deep sea with the increasing of water depth the structural safety and economic efficiency of fixed offshore wind turbines are greatly challenged compared with the fixed type floating offshore wind turbines have a better development prospect in deep sea different from conventional floating oil or gas platforms there is a set of wind power generation equipment added on the fowt which is subjected to a large wind heeling moment in addition the nacelle of wind turbine is of great mass and height the issues mentioned above result in significant pitch motions the pitch motions of fowt bring great challenge to its structural safety and power generation efficiency based on the problems above many scholars have studied the influence of pitch motions on fowt jeon et al 2014 proposed several hypothetical flow states of fowt under pitch motions and verified them using vortex lattice method the results showed that a turbulent wake state tws arises when the fowt is pitching in the upwind direction which is unpredictable in blade element method bem simulation shen et al 2018 studied the influence of pitch motions on unsteady aerodynamics using a lifting surface method with a free wake model the research found that the pitch motions lead to highly unsteady aerodynamics which not only affects the aerodynamic torque but also other loads on the wind turbine and with the increasing of pitch frequency the average power output of the wind turbine increases and the average rotor thrust decreases karimian et al karimian aliabadi and rasekh 2020 also analyzed the aerodynamic characteristics of fowt under pitch motions with the coupled aerodynamic pitch angle control system model compared with fixed platform cases the mean thrust coefficient is reduced for almost all range of tip speed ratios tsrs and the mean power coefficient for tsrs less than 7 is also reduced while the cases for high tsrs is just the reverse with the input of pitch motions xiao et al xiao and yang 2019 investigated the effects of ocean swell waves and swell induced pitch motions on the wake flow statistics and power extraction of floating wind turbines with a hybrid numerical model coupling wind large eddy les and high order spectral wave comparison between the fixed and floating turbine cases showed that swell induced turbine pitch motions cause noticeable oscillations of vertical velocity variance and reynolds stress therefore it s critical to reduce the pitch motions of fowt lackner 2009 designed a new variable power collective pitch controller which produces substantial reductions in the pitch motions and velocities larsen et al larsen and hanson 2007 found that blade pitch control induces negative damping of fowt pitching oscillation in some cases on this basis iino et al 2012 improved the control algorism of wind turbine to reduce pitch negative damping by analysis and verified the control performance with small scaled experiment guo et al 2012 also designed a wind turbine controller with pid control the results showed that individual pitch control technique is able to effectively reduce pitching motions of fowt along with little influence on output power kakuya et al 2018 proposed a floating platform vibration control method to reduce pitch motions of fowt this method can efficiently suppress the vibration of pitch angles moreover the dynamic cable connected with fowt is subject to a load that is greatly affected by horizontal motions of fowt thies et al 2017 evaluated the influences of the environmental conditions and the cable design parameters on the mechanical loads and potential failure modes of a dynamic cable attached to a dynamic floating structure they found that the cable should maintain as s shaped as possible which is influenced greatly by horizontal motions of floating structure to achieve a good load distribution along the cable and high reliability taninoki et al 2017 developed a dynamic cable system for a hybrid spar type fowt and its motions and mechanical stress were calculated the results confirmed that the cable system withstands mechanical stress caused by the large horizontal motions of fowt in addition bae li et al bae et al 2017 li et al 2018 investigated the influence on cable induced by the large horizontal offset of fowt under the failure of one mooring line and the research showed that the cable is likely to be disconnected generally the horizontal and pitch motions of fowt should be inhibited the horizontal motions are usually inhibited by mooring system and the optimization of pitch motion performance of fowt usually starts from the control system the optimization of control system does have a significant effect on pitch motions but it may be unsteady while faced with complicated environment conditions and decreases the efficiency of power generation besides the redesign of platform structure may be an effective method to improve motion performance but it will also significantly increase time and economic costs as we all know the conventional mooring system usually use catenaries or taut elastic mooring lines and the fairleads are put at the same depth to keep the horizontal position of floating platform the catenary mooring system mainly depends on the gravity of mooring lines to provide restoring force while the taut mooring system mainly depends on the elastic elongation in this paper an innovative type of mooring system is proposed to inhibit both the horizontal and pitch motions of fowt to verify the effects of innovative mooring system on horizontal and pitch motion inhibition the dynamic responses of fowt are analyzed and then compared with the conventional type the results show that the motion performances of fowt with this innovative mooring system are both enhanced in these two dofs degrees of freedom consequently in order to improve the motion performances of fowt the innovative mooring system proposed by the authors is an efficient economical and reliable scheme the hydrodynamics are calculated by aqwa and the aerodynamic calculation of wind turbine including data transfer with the floating foundation are completed by an external dll file yang et al 2020 2 mooring system 2 1 fowt model in this paper the oc3 hywind spar and nrel 5mw offshore wind turbine are used for case study the main performance parameters of fowt are given in table 1 and principle dimensions of oc3 hywind are shown in fig 1 jonkman et al 2009 jonkman 2010 the origin of the reference coordinate system is on the horizontal plane the oxy plane coincides with the still water surface and the z axis is vertically upward which coincides with the center line of the platform as shown in fig 2 2 2 design philosophy the conventional mooring system mainly inhibits the horizontal motions of floating structures but has little effects on pitch motions in this study an innovative type of mooring system is proposed by the authors of this paper to reduce both the horizontal and pitch motions of fowt the fairleads of conventional mooring system are usually at the same depth the innovative type of mooring system divides fairleads into two groups which are at different depths in this way the mooring system can provide larger restoring moments to resist the heeling moments meanwhile compared with the conventional type this mooring system is able to generate larger horizontal restoring forces taking advantage of the pitch motions of fowt which will be explained detailly in 4 3 a similar concept was introduced by jochem jochem 2019 11 but there was no more detailed introduction about it except a figure according to the figure it can be seen that the mooring lines were taut spread with suction anchors the mooring system proposed in this paper is designed with catenary which has better fatigue performance and is more convenient for installation and maintaining compared with the taut type in conclusion compared with the conventional type the innovative mooring system proposed in this paper mainly has two following improvements 1 generating larger pitch restoring moments to reduce pitch motions 2 generating larger horizontal restoring forces to reduce horizontal motions the motion inhibition performances of innovative and conventional mooring systems are calculated and compared in this paper the detailed parameters of mooring lines are given in table 2 and the layouts of two mooring systems are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 these two types both have 9 mooring lines and the conventional type put all the fairleads at the same water depth 70m while the innovative type put them at two different water depths 10m line no 1 3 4 6 7 9 120m line no 2 5 8 additionally the total mooring line length of innovative and conventional mooring system are respectively 8820m and 8550m it is means that the innovative mooring system improves the motion performance significantly at a small cost compared with redesign of the platform 2 3 static restoring stiffnesses the static restoring stiffnesses of two mooring systems are calculated as shown in fig 5 the piecewise extrapolating method is employed to solve the static problem of a single line by discretization boundary conditions and iteration fan et al 2014 thus the restoring forces of mooring system can be obtained by tension and direction angle of each mooring line it should be noted that the displacements are positive along the x axis and the pitch angle is 0 to make the results clear only the restoring stiffnesses in surge heave and pitch dofs are given which are the most important to fowt additionally the shapes of mooring line with fairleads at different depths for different displacements in the same vertical plane are presented as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 5 the horizontal restoring stiffnesses of two mooring systems are basically equal while the pitch motions are not considered the vertical restoring stiffness of innovative type is a little larger than that of conventional type it s obvious that the pitch restoring stiffness generated by innovative type is nearly a magnitude larger than that of conventional type which helps to reduce the pitch motions 3 methodology 3 1 frequency domain analysis based on the three dimension potential flow theory the diffraction potential and radiation

based on the rate of change of linear and angular momentum the difference frequency force is obtained by full qtf method which includes the influence of second order velocity potential ansys 2018 3 2 aerodynamic loads the thrust and torque of the wind turbine are calculated by blade element momentum bem theory the bem theory discretizes the blade into blade elements and uses the theorem of

results and analysis 4 1 model validation the number of elements used in the hydrodynamic model is 6233 in order to validate the reliability of hydrodynamic model the transfer functions of mean drift force calculated by far field method and near field method are given to verify the quality of mesh generation as shown in fig 7 and it can be seen that the results obtained by two methods are basically close which means that the mesh generation is reliable in addition the added mass and radiation damping in frequency domain are given as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 with comparison to the results in references jonkman 2010 yue et al 2020 the overall trend of them are roughly the same while the numbers are slightly different the main purpose of this paper is to compare the motion inhibition performances of two mooring systems under the condition of ensuring the same hydrodynamic coefficients of platform the slight differences are acceptable thus it can be proved that the hydrodynamic model is reliable 4 2 motion responses the time domain motion responses of fowt with two types of mooring system under the same environment conditions are calculated and compared the environment conditions are given in table 3 jonkman and musial 2010 the jonswap wave spectrum is employed to simulate the random sea waves as shown in fig 10 the wind and wave incidence in the positive direction along the x axis among the 6 dof motions surge heave and pitch are the most important to fowt the motion responses of these three dofs and corresponding power spectral densities psd are presented as shown in fig 11 the time duration of numerical simulation is 10000 s but only 1000 s is captured in the figures to present the results clear as shown in fig 11 the surge and pitch motions of innovative type are significantly smaller than those of conventional type and the heave motions of innovative type are also decreased a little it approves that the innovative mooring system is able to improve the motion performance of fowt especially in the horizontal and pitch dofs according to the motion psd the motions in these three dofs are dominated by low frequency components as for the wave frequency components the heave and pitch motions are more significant than surge motions in addition the natural frequencies of these two types in surge heave and pitch dofs are respectively 0 075 rad s 0 20 rad s and 0 16 rad s the innovative mooring system reduces the peak values of motion psd without changing the peak frequencies in these three dofs compared with the conventional type it indicates that the innovative mooring system will not change the natural motion frequencies of fowt to cause new problems while reducing the motions furthermore the motion responses were statistically processed as shown in table 4 the mean maximum significant values and standard deviations of innovative type in surge and pitch dofs all decrease compared with conventional type which means the motion performances of fowt in surge and pitch dofs are significantly improved by the innovative mooring system and the maximum significant values and standard deviation of innovative type in heave dof are also smaller than those of conventional type which means the innovative mooring system also improves the heave performance of fowt 4 3 analysis on restoring stiffness and damping contributions 4 3 1 restoring stiffness contributions as verified in 4 2 the innovative mooring system has significantly positive effects on surge and pitch motion performances of fowt compared with the conventional type in order to better demonstrate the motion inhibition performances the restoring forces and moments of two mooring systems in surge and pitch dofs are calculated and compared in time domain as shown in fig 12 the statistics of them are given in table 5 in addition since the fowt is not sensitive to heave motions compared with conventional floating platforms with risers the vertical restoring stiffness will not be discussed as shown in fig 12 and table 5 the mean and maximum pitch restoring moments of innovative type are nearly an order of magnitude larger than those of conventional type while the mean and maximum horizontal restoring forces of two mooring systems are basically equal according to table 4 the mean positions of innovative type in pitch and surge dofs respectively decrease 17 87 and 37 97 compared with conventional type it means that the pitch restoring stiffness of innovative type is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of conventional type and horizontal restoring stiffness of innovative type is also obviously larger than that of conventional type the pitch restoring stiffness is consistent with the initial design whereas as mentioned in 2 3 without considering the pitch motions the horizontal static restoring stiffnesses of two mooring systems are basically equal it can be inferred that the pitch motions have positive effects on horizontal restoring stiffness of the innovative mooring system moreover since the innovative mooring system is more sensitive to pitch motions the wave frequency component of horizontal restoring forces of innovative mooring system seems to be intensified under the coupled motions in surge and pitch dofs compared with the conventional type as shown in fig 12 a it will be explained detailly in 4 3 3 4 3 2 mooring damping contributions the motion inhibition performances of mooring system are determined by not only its restoring stiffness but also its damping contribution in order to figure out the damping contributions of these two mooring systems in surge and pitch dofs the free decay tests in still water are numerically simulated as shown in fig 13 similarly the vertical damping contribution will not be discussed it should be noted that the decay test of a certain dof is carried out independently which means that the motions of the other five dofs are set as deactivated to exclude interference according to fig 13 in surge dof the decay curves of conventional and innovative types fit with each other well which means that the damping contributions of two mooring systems in surge dof are basically equal however in pitch dof the decay rate of innovative type is obviously faster than that of conventional type which means that the damping contribution of innovative mooring system in pitch dof is significantly larger than that of conventional type the innovative mooring system is more sensitive to the pitch motion due to the larger distance between two groups of fairleads compared with the conventional type as mentioned in 4 3 1 the pitch motions seem to improve the horizontal restoring stiffness of innovative mooring system in order to find out the effects of pitch motions on horizontal damping contributions of two mooring systems another coupled free decay test in still water is numerically simulated the surge and pitch dofs are both set as activated and both have initial deviations in one decay test while the other four dofs are set as deactivated as shown in fig 14 the results show that when the surge motions are coupled with pitch motions the damping contribution of innovative mooring system in surge dof is obviously increased it can be inferred that the pitch motions have positive effects on horizontal damping contribution of the innovative mooring system in addition the free decay period of innovative type in surge dof increases while coupled with pitch motions which means the horizontal restoring stiffness decreases it seems to be inconsistent with the results obtained before and will be explained in the analysis below when wind and wave incidence in the positive direction along the x axis due to the wind heeling moments the balance positions of fowt in the surge and pitch dofs have positive deviations and the surge displacements and pitch angles are also basically located in the positive interval therefore for the innovative mooring system the positive horizontal deviations of the upper fairleads are obviously larger than that of the center of gravity while the horizontal restoring stiffness of the innovative mooring system mainly depends on the mooring line tension corresponding to these fairleads it will lead to the increase of the horizontal restoring stiffness however the horizontal restoring stiffness of the innovative mooring system is reduced in the surge pitch coupling free decay compared with that of the conventional type this is mainly because the balance positions of each dofs in free decay are 0 while the additional horizontal restoring stiffness induced by pitch motions is asymmetric for the positive and negative angels due to the asymmetric arrangement of mooring lines it might result in the reduction of horizontal restoring stiffness under certain conditions 4 3 3 analysis on power spectral densities based on the results and analysis above it can be inferred that under the influences of environment loads the pitch motions seem to have positive effects on horizontal motion inhibition performances of innovative mooring system compared with conventional type in order to make a deeper analysis the psd of horizontal restoring forces is calculated as shown in fig 15 the peak frequencies of surge heave and pitch motions are marked in fig 15 to make the analysis below clear the low frequency component of psd which represents the conventional type only have one peak value which coincides with the peak frequency of surge psd however for the innovative type the low frequency components of psd have two peak values which coincide with the peak frequencies of surge and pitch psd it indicates that the horizontal restoring forces of conventional mooring system are mainly induced by surge motions but the horizontal restoring forces of innovative type are induced by both surge and pitch motions this is because the innovative mooring system is more sensitive to pitch motions with the effects of larger vertical distance between two groups of fairleads in other words the same pitch angle will result in a larger horizontal deviation at the fairleads of innovative mooring system than those of the conventional type it also confirms the analysis of horizontal restoring stiffness at the end of 4 3 2 moreover the wave frequency components of psd of innovative type are obviously larger than those of conventional type which is consistent with results shown in fig 12 a as mentioned in 4 2 compared with surge motions the pitch motion psd at wave frequency is more significant in this way the wave frequency components of horizontal restoring forces are enlarged based on the above analysis it can be explained that under the influences of environment loads the innovative mooring system is able to generate larger horizontal restoring stiffness and damping contribution with the effects of pitch motions compared with the conventional type 4 4 comparison of mooring line tension in order to research the influence of two mooring systems on mooring line tension the mooring line tension is calculated and compared it is found that the maximum tension is on the mooring line no 6 and no 7 thus the mooring line tension is given in fig 16 and the statistics are given in table 6 according to the results above it is obviously that the maximum tension occurred on mooring line of innovative mooring system increase about 1 3 which is caused by the increase of suspension length of mooring line due to the position of fairlead being moved up though it s dangerous to a mooring system it still can be solved by means such as partial reinforcement the purpose of this paper is to research the motion inhibition performance of the innovative mooring system the problem of mooring system safety will be discussed in the future research 5 conclusions in order to inhibit the motion responses of spar floating offshore wind turbines an innovative type of mooring system is proposed by the authors for the purpose to validate the advantages of this mooring system a conventional type of mooring system
