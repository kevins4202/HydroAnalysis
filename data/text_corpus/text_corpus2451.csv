12255,the assessment of groundwater vulnerability to contamination has proved to be an effective tool for water resource management the primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the vulnerability of aquifer by using the drastic method this was followed by a secondary objective of assessing the effect of each drastic parameter on the final vulnerability map by applying sensitivity analysis drastic assigned highest vulnerability to the eastern border of the nct of delhi and lowest values were observed in the southern part of the study area thereafter sensitivity analysis was conducted to validate the scores used in drastic and it was found that the theoretical weights were in agreement with effective weights this analysis further suggested that net recharge depth to water table and impact of vadose zone were the key factors determining vulnerability it was concluded that the final recommendation derived from the combination of drastic with senstivity analysis could be used as an efficient tool for local authorities and policy makers to manage groundwater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater vulnerability drastic sensitivity analysis gis delhi 1 introduction in recent decades india has witnessed a rapid rise in the demand of water a reduction of 5 in the national per capita annual availability of water has been witnessed as the availability has reduced from 1816 cubic meter in 2001 to 1720 cubic meter in 2015 suhag 2016 the water scarcity situation is worsening with each passing day leading to overexploitation of surface and groundwater resources further due to unprecedented population growth urbanization and industrialization most of the surface water resources have been polluted singh et al 2013 consequently the dependence of the majority of the population on ground water sources has increased leading to raised contamination singh et al 2015 since aquifers are inherently susceptible to contamination from land use and anthropogenic activities groundwater contamination has become an increasingly acute problem saidi et al 2011 the demand of the increasing population in the semi arid regions also fosters a continual need to develop new methods and plans to preserve groundwater resources from future contamination katyal 2011 in this context scientists and resource managers have sought to develop aquifer vulnerability assessment techniques for forecasting the likely areas which are more vulnerable to contamination due to activities at or near the land surface national research council 1993 vrba and zaporozec 1994 gogu and dassargues 2000 al hallaq and elaish 2011 the assessment of groundwater vulnerability to pollution has been subjected to intensive research and a variety of methods have been developed such as drastic aller et al 1987 god foster 1987 avi van stempvoort et al 1993 and sintacs civita 1994 one of the most widely applied standard method for assessing groundwater vulnerability is drastic which takes into account seven hydrogeological parameters the parameters are rated and weighted depending on their relative importance to contamination though drastic was initially developed for groundwater vulnerability assessment in u s a over years it has found wide application in various other countries varol and devaz 2010 applied drastic to investigate the vulnerability of sarkikaraagac basin turkey alwathaf and mansouri 2011 assessed the sana s basin in yemen and found that highly vulnerable areas were located around wastewater disposal sites drastic has also been applied in tunisia by saidi et al 2012 along with hazard assessment to evaluate the risk of contamination in iran ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 compared drastic with god concluding that drastic was more accurate flexible and suitable for detailed hydrogeochemical study recently sharadqah 2017 compared drastic with god and sintacs to estimate their efficiency for the vulnerability assessment in ecuador the findings indicated drastic to be most efficient in terms of effective results interestingly though drastic uses subjectivity in weights sensitivity analysis to check this subjectivity has not been carried out in any of these studies over years one of the major advantage of the drastic is the use of high number of input data layers for the assessment evans and myers 1990 which is believed to limit the impacts of errors or uncertainties of the individual parameters on the final output rosen 1994 while some scientists have believed that groundwater vulnerability can be assessed without using all the parameters of the drastic barber et al 1993 others have criticized this model for bringing in subjectivity in the selection of the seven parameters ratings and weights napolitano and fabbri 1996 thus to address these issues sensitivity analysis was introduced which compared the theoretical weights with effective weights and reported the error shirazi et al 2012 in japan babiker et al 2005 evaluated the relative importance of the drastic parameters through senstivity analysis and the results revealed similarity in effective and theoretical weights similar studies were conducted by al hallaq and elaish 2011 in palestine and by djémin et al 2016 in côte d ivoire in few cases sensitivity analysis showed a high error and deviation in assigned weights and thus modification in drastic was introduced by changing weights and rating range this modified drastic improved upon the results of groundwater vulnerability assessment hasiniaina et al 2010 zhou et al 2010 javadi et al 2011 further to progress the weights and accuracy of drastic analytical hierarchy process ahp was employed by hailin et al 2011 in china in india drastic has been duly applied at kapgarhi catchment in west bengal remesan and panda 2008 central ganga plain inuttar pradesh rahman 2008 rameshwaram in tamil nadu sivasankar and ramachandramoorthy 2009 and jabalpur in madhya pradesh gupta 2014 application of modified drastic with altered weights and rates has also been reported from indo gangetic plain khan et al 2010 of aligarh uttar pradesh alam et al 2012 and mewat haryana mehra et al 2016 simultaneous usage of ahp with drastic has been detailed out by researchers like thirumalaivasan and karmegam 2001 in upper palar watershed tamil nadu and natraj and katyal 2014 in loni region maharashtra however no detailed literature is available on the usage of sensitivity analysis with drastic thus an attempt to cater to this significant facet has been done through this research paper the present study is designed to categorize delhi into different zones in terms of vulnerability to contamination the city has limited surface water allocation and is thus completely dependent on the groundwater to meet its industrial agricultural and domestic needs since groundwater is supporting major anthropogenic activity in the region its protection and management is vital this can be achieved through maps which demarcate zones where it is susceptible to receive and transmit pollution so that they can be prevented from future contamination because of its wide application worldwide drastic has been used to identify and categorize the vulnerable zones in terms of contamination drastic uses a standardized methodology which gives results suitable for screening regions with respect to groundwater protection monitoring and clean up efforts simultaneously sensitivity analysis through two different methods has been carried out to ascertain and corroborate the weights used in drastic thus fundamentally the study achieves two objectives of studying aquifer vulnerability through drastic and thereafter assessment of each drastic parameter on the final vulnerability map through sensitivity analysis 2 study area national capital territory nct of delhi occupies an area of 1483 km2 which lies between 28 24 15 and 28 53 00 n latitudes and 76 50 24 and 77 20 30 e longitudes fig 1 administratively it is divided into nine districts this region is the part of gangetic alluvial plain and has an elevation ranging from 198 to 220 m above mean sea level the climate of the study area is characterized by extreme summer season from march till june the warm monsoon period between july to september and cold winters from october to february the average annual rainfall of territory is 612 mm with the rainfall increasing from south west to north west about three fourth of the total annual rainfall is received during the monsoon months july september and the rest in the form of winter rain central ground water board 2012 kumar et al 2009 geologically the area is transected by a rocky quartzite ridge which is a prolongation of the aravalli hills fig 2 extending along the southern border of delhi and ending to the north on the west bank of the yamuna river srivastava and ramanathan 2008 the groundwater availability in the territory is controlled by the hydrogeological situation attributed to the different geological formation the alluvium formations within the study area are either due to active or recent sedimentation processes newer alluvium or due to the sediment deposited earlier older alluvium the alluvial deposits are generally of quaternary age the newer alluvium belongs to recent age and is referred to the sediments deposited in the flood plains of yamuna river the older alluvium consists of sediments deposited as a result of past cycles of sedimentation of pleistocene age and occurs extensively in the alluvial plains of the territory shekhar et al 2009 kumar et al 2006 physiographically the study area shows four major distinct physiographic units that influence the groundwater occurrence a the delhi ridge b isolated and nearly closed chattarpur alluvial basin c alluvial plains on the eastern and western sides of the ridge and d yamuna floodplain deposits katyal 2011 tomer et al 2016 land use in delhi has a major influence on groundwater recharge water use and water quality datta et al 1997 rao et al 2007 kumar et al 2011 in the presence of diverse landform features and rapid land use change it is difficult to identify groundwater resources that can be exploited as sustainable drinking water supplies kumar et al 2013 it is observed that of the total geographical area of 1484 km2 urban area constitutes around 49 while about 38 of the total land area is used for agriculture the agricultural land use is repeatedly modified and more areas are shifted from cultivation and being utilized for other uses the water supply resources in delhi are also under tremendous stress because of the growing population industrial activities and salinity problems population of delhi has increased from 1 7 million in 1951 to 16 7 million in 2011 with a growth at a rate of 2 1 per annum in the last decade census of india 2011 since the city is inhabited by more than 16 million people the condition of the groundwater quantity as well as quality is expected to deteriorate further kumar et al 2006 kumar et al 2013 3 materials and methods drastic model was used in order to assess the aquifer vulnerability to pollution in nct of delhi the information about the layers of the model was provided via geographic information system gis arc gis 10 software was used to create an interactive geodatabase compile the geospatial data compute drastic indices generate vulnerability maps and finally to conduct sensitivity analysis 3 1 vulnerability assessment the drastic model was developed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 1985 to evaluate pollution potential of groundwater for entire u s a it was based on the following assumptions a the potential contamination sources are on the surface of the soil b the potential contamination sources reach the aquifer through the infiltration mechanism c the pollutant has the mobility similar to the groundwater and d the hydrogeological unit considered has a surface of greater than 40 ha aller et al 1987 saidi et al 2011 drastic finds its basis in hydrogeologic setting with the acronym drastic standing for the seven parameters used to calculate vulnerability index the parameters are depth to water table net recharge aquifer media soil media topography slope percentage impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer the model employs a numerical ranking system that assigns relative weights and rates to various parameters that help in the evaluation of relative groundwater vulnerability to contamination sinanh and razack 2009 the numerical relative rating varies from 1 to 10 and weights from 1 to 5 table 1 indicates drastic rating and weighting values according to the various hydrogeological settings in the study area the final vulnerability is a weighted sum of the above seven parameters and can be computed using additive equation 1 1 d i d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where w is weight factor for parameter and r is rate for parameters every parameter in this model has a fixed weight and rates which are based on their relative importance and relative effect on the aquifer vulnerability babiker et al 2005 these weights and ratings are established using the delphi technique aller et al 1987 gogu and dassargues 2000 which are well defined and have been used worldwide dixon 2005 rahman 2008 pusatli et al 2009 mohammad 2017 the application of drastic is based on the existing multidisciplinary data table 2 gives an overview of the data sources used for each parameter the thematic maps representing the depth to water table d recharge r and hydraulic conductivity c parameters were created by using kriging interpolation technique however the soil type s aquifer media a impact of the vadose zone i and topography t maps were geo referenced and digitized from different data files fig 3 provides an overview of methodology adopted for groundwater vulnerability analysis kriging is a powerful technique of spatial interpolation that uses complex mathematical formulas to estimate values at unknown points based on the values at known points kriging uses semivariance to measure spatial autocorrelation and is computed through equation 2 2 γ h 1 2 z x i z x j 2 where γ h is the semivariance between known points x i and x j separated by distance h and z is the attribute value gupta 2017 among the various types of kriging ordinary kriging method has been used in the present study it provides the best linear unbiased estimate blue of the regionalized variable at an unsampled location because the interpolated values are computed from equations that minimize the variance of the estimation error chang 2012 it is based on the configuration of the data and on the semivariogram yamamoto 2005 a semivariogram is a plot that shows the variance in measure with distance between all pairs of sampled locations the distance at which the curve flattens out is called the range fig 4 for distances greater than the range it is assumed that there exists no autocorrelation between the points the value on the y axis the semivariogram attains at range is known as sill the intercept made by the semivariogram model on y axis of the semivariogram is called the nugget li and heap 2008 3 2 sensitivity analysis as described earlier scientists have had a reservation regarding the usage of drastic because of subjectivity the ratings and weights carry thus it is imperative to check for any discrepancies in assigning the weights barber et al 1993 napolitano and fabbri 1996 mclay et al 2001 which in this study has been achieved through two methodologies 3 2 1 map removal sensitivity analysis this test identifies the sensitivity of vulnerability map by removing one or more layer maps at a time and was calculated using equation 3 3 s 100 v n vx i n v where s is the sensitivity measure v is the intrinsic vulnerability index of the method n and n represents the total number of parameters used to calculate v and vxi and vxi is the intrinsic vulnerability index obtained after removal of the parameter x 3 2 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis this test was carried out to assess the influence of each of the seven parameters of the model on the vulnerability measure in this analysis real or effective weight of each parameter has been compared with it s assigned or theoretical weight the real or the effective weight has been computed using equation 4 4 w 100 p r p w v where w refers to the effective weight of each parameter pr and pw are the rating value and the weight for each parameter and v represents the overall vulnerability index the theoretical weight was calculated using equation 5 5 t w 100 x w x w where tw refers to the theoretical weight of each parameter and xw is the weight for each parameter the mean percent error between theoretical weight and actual weight has been computed using equation 6 6 mean percent error 100 actual value theoretical value theoretical value 4 results and discussion to get a fair understanding of drastic each of drastic parameters its effect on aquifer vulnerability and the ratings and weight it carries has been described below 4 1 drastic parameters and aquifer vulnerability depth to water table is one of the essential factors that determine the thickness of material through which a contaminant must travel before reaching the aquifer the aquifer potential protection increases with depth to water because deeper water levels result from longer travel times thus maximum weight 5 has been assigned to the depth to groundwater in this study depth to water table was measured using piezometers installed by cgwb the depth to water table in the study area ranges from 1 23 meters below ground level mbgl to 44 9 mbgl it has been classified into ranges defined by drastic model and was thus assigned rates from 1 minimum impact on vulnerability to 10 maximum impact on vulnerability this indicated that the deeper the groundwater the smaller is the rating value babiker et al 2005 these standardized ratings were also confirmed from the literature abdelmadjid and omar 2013 natraj and katyal 2014 ghosh et al 2015 the least rating of 1 was given to the deeper aquifers i e region around delhi ridge and maximum was given to shallow aquifers i e around yamuna floodplain fig 5 a i the net recharge is the amount of water from precipitation and artificial sources that migrates to the water table recharge water is a significant vehicle for percolating and transporting contaminants from the vadose zone to the saturated zone alam et al 2012 thus the more the recharge greater are the chances for contaminants to reach the water table for this study data pertaining to net recharge was collected from the imd and cgwb recharge was calculated using equation 7 7 net recharge r e c h a r g e r a t e rainfall evaporation further this parameter was rated on a 1 10 standard scale which has been reported by breabăn and paiu 2012 kumari et al 2016 and ahada and suthar 2018 in their work the net recharge in the study area ranged from 170 30 to 434 48 mm yr and was assigned a rating of 6 8 and 9 a higher rating of 9 was assigned to higher recharge areas e g region around water bodies and coarse sand aquifer because these areas provide permeable pathway to the pollutants from surface to groundwater table natraj 2017 the lowest recharge rate 6 was coupled with the urban land use that prevents downward penetration of rainwater and was reported around delhi ridge fig 5a ii net recharge was assigned a weight of 4 in this model the net recharge map was corroborated with depth to water table and it was found that wherever the net recharge was high the value of depth to water table was low aquifer media refers to the consolidated or unconsolidated rock which serves as an aquifer herlinger and antonio 2007 the aquifer media exerts a significant control over the route and path length which a contaminant must follow aller et al 1987 in general aquifer media reflects the contaminant attenuation capacity of the aquifer that depends on the amount and sorting of fine grains the lower the grain size the higher the attenuation capacity of aquifer media and consequently lower the pollution potential so the finer media was assigned a low rating as compared to the coarse media mehra et al 2016 for the study area an aquifer media map fig 5a iii was created from the geological map of delhi and was assigned a rating of 3 5 and 6 with a weight value of 3 soil media characteristics influence groundwater vulnerability as it directly impacts the amount of recharge and the ability of contaminants to infiltrate the vadose zone different types of soil have different water holding characteristics that influence the travel time of pollutants the presence of fine grain size materials such as clay peat or silt and the percentage of organic matter within the soil cover can decrease intrinsic permeability and retard contaminant migration through physicochemical processes i e absorption ionic exchange oxidation and biodegradation al abadi et al 2017 different soil types have been assigned rates according to their permeability with permeable soil getting a high rating as compared to the less permeable soil in this study a soil map of the study area fig 5a iv was prepared from the soil map of national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nagpur 1999 and a weight of 2 and ratings of 4 5 6 and 8 were assigned topography refers to the slope of an area areas with low slope tend to retain water for longer period of time and thus allow a higher infiltration or recharge of water and a greater potential for contaminant migration areas with steep slopes experience large amounts of runoff and smaller amounts of infiltration making them less vulnerable to groundwater contamination al adamat et al 2003 for major part of study area the topography fig 5b v displayed a gentle slope 0 6 and thus has been assigned the drastic rating score of 9 however the slope percentage increases towards the south of the study area near delhi ridge 18 and thus has been given a weight of 1 impact of vadose zone i vadose zone is the ground portion found between the aquifer and the soil cover where pores or joints are unsaturated its influence on aquifer pollution potential is similar to that of soil cover i e it depends on permeability and the attenuation characteristics of the media if vadose zone is composed of a permeable material then it has a high impact on water movement based on the geological description of the study area the vadose zone is generally given a rating from 4 to 6 a weight of 5 has been used in this study fig 5b vi hydraulic conductivity c refers to the ability of the aquifer to transmit water and controls the contaminant migration and dispersion from the injection point within the saturated zone and the plume concentration an aquifer with high conductivity is more vulnerable to contamination than others herein the value of hydraulic conductivity was calculated using transmissivity and saturated thickness of the aquifer values of which were obtained from cgwb for the study area the value of hydraulic conductivity ranged between 0 55 and 13 51 m day north east and eastern part of the study area fig 5b vii were characterized with high hydraulic conductivity and were thus assigned the highest rating of 10 a weight of 3 was also given to this parameter once the ratings and weights of each parameter were decided a final vulnerability map fig 6 was generated by running the model in the arcgis environment the drastic scores so obtained varied from 85 to 157 these values were reclassified into four classes of low medium high and very high vulnerability using the quantile classification scheme table 3 the results of the model show that of the total 1483 square kilometer sq km an area of about 323 17 sq km is in the low vulnerability zone with a drastic index ranging between 85 and 103 parallely around 506 sq km is in the medium zone with drastic value ranging from 104 to 121 381 08 sq km of the total area is in high vulnerability with a drastic index between 122 and 139 and 272 75 sq km is in very high vulnerability zone with a drastic value ranging from 140 to 157 the results further indicate that 45 of the nct of delhi is at very high to high risk in terms of pollution potential with regions concentrated in north west north east and some parts of west district of delhi this could be due to combination of gentle slope porous vadose zone and shallow water table while on one hand the areas under very high vulnerability zone are observed around river yamuna bhalaswa landfill and gazipur landfill areas in the north west and west region of the city including kanjhawala rohini kingsway camp and nangloi are in high vulnerability zone the areas in the south south west and west districts of delhi that include najafgarh dwarka bawana ashok vihar and mayur vihar have medium vulnerability a significant part of southwest and south delhi district is in low pollution potential category and includes areas along southern part of delhi ridge like hauz khas shekhawati lines and aya nagar this could be attributed to the high slope low recharge and deep water table that reduces the chances of the aquifer getting polluted in all the drastic analysis indicates that area along yamuna floodplain is most prone to contamination while the chances are lowest in delhi ridge area to verify the zonation generated by drastic ground truthing was conducted to substantiate the identified vulnerability zones the zonation completely corroborated with the recognized zones and thus process of sensitivity analysis was proceeded with 4 2 validation method sensitivity analysis was conducted by both the methods described earlier to understand and evaluate each method on the basis of effect it holds on the intrinsic sensitivity maps these methods have been used to analyze the reliability of vulnerability criteria and validate developed vulnerability maps table 4 presents a statistical summary of the seven parameters of the drastic model to workout vulnerability of groundwater in nct of delhi an examination of the means of the parameters reveals that the highest contributor to the vulnerability index is net recharge mean 8 09 followed by the depth to water table mean 5 82 the third and fourth significant contributors are impact of vadose zone mean 5 27 and aquifer media mean 5 23 while on one hand soil media and topography mean value 4 95 and 4 09 respectively contribute moderately to the vulnerability index hydraulic conductivity with a mean value of 3 82 contributes lowest to the contamination of groundwater the coefficient of variation indicates that maximum variation is observed in hydraulic conductivity 58 08 depth to water table 53 47 and topography 41 94 while moderate variation was observed in impact of vadose zone 18 68 soil media 18 14 and net recharge 13 70 lowest variation was seen in the parameter aquifer media 13 11 4 2 1 map removal sensitivity analysis as described earlier sensitivity analysis is imperative to validate and evaluate the uniformity of the analytical results and forms basis for efficient evaluation of the vulnerability maps pathak et al 2009 the map removal sensitivity analysis technique requires removing each thematic layer individually and computing variation index these maps depict a variation in the spatial distribution of different vulnerability classes of the variation index the individual maps so generated are illustrated through fig 7 a and b along with table 5 together giving an insight into the variation of the vulnerability index as a result of removing each layer from the assessment highest variation index was observed for the parameter net recharge r mean variation index 6 23 which could be attributed to the high theoretical weight table 5 assigned to this layer furthermore the vulnerability index also seems to be sensitive to the removal of depth to water table d and vadose zone layer i as the mean variation index for these two parameters is 5 55 and 5 51 removal of the aquifer media a hydraulic conductivity c and soil media s respective mean variation indices being 4 07 3 5 and 3 36 also contributed significantly to the variation of vulnerability index the least sensitive parameter was topography t with the mean variation index of 2 82 4 2 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis while the map removal sensitivity analysis evaluates the importance of each seven parameters by calculating variation index single parameter sensitivity analysis compares theoretical weights with effective weights babiker et al 2005 the effective weight is a function of the value of the single parameter in reference to other six parameters clubbed with the weight assigned to it by the drastic model calculated through equation 4 theoretical weights are the standardized values for each parameter and is calculated using equation 5 the minimum and maximum value of effective weights has been depicted in table 6 the error value indicates the difference between the theoretical and effective weights and is computed through equation 6 it must be mentioned that for computation of error mean value of effective weights has been considered the values generated for effective weight indicate net recharge r to be most influencing parameter as it has highest effective weight of 25 43 this is followed by depth to water table parameter d and impact of vadose zone i with the effective weight of 21 35 and 21 04 respectively however it is important to mention that effective weights should not be considered in isolation as can be observed that the percentage error is highest 47 46 in hydraulic conductivity c indicating large difference in the value of theoretical and effective weight though hydraulic conductivity c has low effective weight 8 82 it can be established that because of high error there shall be inconsistency in the parametric evaluation of this parameter on the similar lines it can be inferred that parameters topography t and net recharge r with high error of 39 82 and 31 58 might not exhibit best of results at the same time parameters like depth to water table d and impact of vadose zone i with a low error of 1 62 and 3 15 shall demonstrate better results 5 conclusion the gis based drastic model has been utilized to assess the potential groundwater vulnerability in the nct of delhi thereafter sensitivity analysis has been carried out to validate the drastic using two different methods the results revealed that drastic index varied from 85 to 157 dividing the study region into four vulnerability classes low 85 103 medium 104 121 high 122 139 and very high 140 157 the southern part of the study area specifically around delhi ridge was found to be in the category of low vulnerability this could be attributed to the high slope and deep water table in the region that reduces the chances of aquifer getting polluted simultaneously eastern part of the study area was adjudged to be highly vulnerable this could be reasoned to its sandy and gravel lithology with high permeability and low depth of groundwater which leads to high net recharge of the aquifer findingsindicated the grave scenario of groundwater quality in nct delhi thus requiring an urgent remedial action the sensitivity analysis revealed that the intrinsic vulnerability of the study area is primarily due to the net recharge depth to water table and impact of vadose zone because of the higher effective weight these parameters carried the map removal sensitivity analysis indicated that the vulnerability index is highly sensitive to the removal of net recharge depth to water and impact of vadose zone layers and is least sensitive to the removal of the topography the same was reinforced by single parameter sensitivity analysis as the effective weights generated corroborated with variation index values however it is essential to keep in mind that parameters with high error are not reliable in terms of result generation in such cases drastic should be replaced by modified drastic or ahp drastic acknowledgments the authors sincerely thank the central ground water board delhi for providing necessary assistance the authors

loni region maharashtra however no detailed literature is available on the usage of sensitivity analysis with drastic thus an attempt to cater to this significant facet has been done through this research paper the present study is designed to categorize delhi into different zones in terms of vulnerability to contamination the city has limited surface water allocation and is thus completely dependent on the groundwater to meet its industrial agricultural and domestic needs since groundwater is supporting major anthropogenic activity in the region its protection and management is vital this can be achieved through maps which demarcate zones where it is susceptible to receive and transmit pollution so that they can be prevented from future contamination because of its wide application worldwide drastic has been used to identify and categorize the vulnerable zones in terms of contamination drastic uses a standardized methodology which gives results suitable for screening regions with respect to groundwater protection monitoring and clean up efforts simultaneously sensitivity analysis through two different methods has been carried out to ascertain and corroborate the weights used in drastic thus fundamentally the study achieves two objectives of studying aquifer vulnerability through drastic and thereafter assessment of each drastic parameter on the final vulnerability map through sensitivity analysis 2 study area national capital territory nct of delhi occupies an area of 1483 km2 which lies between 28 24 15 and 28 53 00 n latitudes and 76 50 24 and 77 20 30 e longitudes fig 1 administratively it is divided into nine districts this region is the part of gangetic alluvial plain and has an elevation ranging from 198 to 220 m above mean sea level the climate of the study area is characterized by extreme summer season from march till june the warm monsoon period between july to september and cold winters from october to february the average annual rainfall of territory is 612 mm with the rainfall increasing from south west to north west about three fourth of the total annual rainfall is received during the monsoon months july september and the rest in the form of winter rain central ground water board 2012 kumar et al 2009 geologically the area is transected by a rocky quartzite ridge which is a prolongation of the aravalli hills fig 2 extending along the southern border of delhi and ending to the north on the west bank of the yamuna river srivastava and ramanathan 2008 the groundwater availability in the territory is controlled by the hydrogeological situation attributed to the different geological formation the alluvium formations within the study area are either due to active or recent sedimentation processes newer alluvium or due to the sediment deposited earlier older alluvium the alluvial deposits are generally of quaternary age the newer alluvium belongs to recent age and is referred to the sediments deposited in the flood plains of yamuna river the older alluvium consists of sediments deposited as a result of past cycles of sedimentation of pleistocene age and occurs extensively in the alluvial plains of the territory shekhar et al 2009 kumar et al 2006 physiographically the study area shows four major distinct physiographic units that influence the groundwater occurrence a the delhi ridge b isolated and nearly closed chattarpur alluvial basin c alluvial plains on the eastern and western sides of the ridge and d yamuna floodplain deposits katyal 2011 tomer et al 2016 land use in delhi has a major influence on groundwater recharge water use and water quality datta et al 1997 rao et al 2007 kumar et al 2011 in the presence of diverse landform features and rapid land use change it is difficult to identify groundwater resources that can be exploited as sustainable drinking water supplies kumar et al 2013 it is observed that of the total geographical area of 1484 km2 urban area constitutes around 49 while about 38 of the total land area is used for agriculture the agricultural land use is repeatedly modified and more areas are shifted from cultivation and being utilized for other uses the water supply resources in delhi are also under tremendous stress because of the growing population industrial activities and salinity problems population of delhi has increased from 1 7 million in 1951 to 16 7 million in 2011 with a growth at a rate of 2 1 per annum in the last decade census of india 2011 since the city is inhabited by more than 16 million people the condition of the groundwater quantity as well as quality is expected to deteriorate further kumar et al 2006 kumar et al 2013 3 materials and methods drastic model was used in order to assess the aquifer vulnerability to pollution in nct of delhi the information about the layers of the model was provided via geographic information system gis arc gis 10 software was used to create an interactive geodatabase compile the geospatial data compute drastic indices generate vulnerability maps and finally to conduct sensitivity analysis 3 1 vulnerability assessment the drastic model was developed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 1985 to evaluate pollution potential of groundwater for entire u s a it was based on the following assumptions a the potential contamination sources are on the surface of the soil b the potential contamination sources reach the aquifer through the infiltration mechanism c the pollutant has the mobility similar to the groundwater and d the hydrogeological unit considered has a surface of greater than 40 ha aller et al 1987 saidi et al 2011 drastic finds its basis in hydrogeologic setting with the acronym drastic standing for the seven parameters used to calculate vulnerability index the parameters are depth to water table net recharge aquifer media soil media topography slope percentage impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer the model employs a numerical ranking system that assigns relative weights and rates to various parameters that help in the evaluation of relative groundwater vulnerability to contamination sinanh and razack 2009 the numerical relative rating varies from 1 to 10 and weights from 1 to 5 table 1 indicates drastic rating and weighting values according to the various hydrogeological settings in the study area the final vulnerability is a weighted sum of the above seven parameters and can be computed using additive equation 1 1 d i d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where w is weight factor for parameter and r is rate for parameters every parameter in this model has a fixed weight and rates which are based on their relative importance and relative effect on the aquifer vulnerability babiker et al 2005 these weights and ratings are established using the delphi technique aller et al 1987 gogu and dassargues 2000 which are well defined and have been used worldwide dixon 2005 rahman 2008 pusatli et al 2009 mohammad 2017 the application of drastic is based on the existing multidisciplinary data table 2 gives an overview of the data sources used for each parameter the thematic maps representing the depth to water table d recharge r and hydraulic conductivity c parameters were created by using kriging interpolation technique however the soil type s aquifer media a impact of the vadose zone i and topography t maps were geo referenced and digitized from different data files fig 3 provides an overview of methodology adopted for groundwater vulnerability analysis kriging is a powerful technique of spatial interpolation that uses complex mathematical formulas to estimate values at unknown points based on the values at known points kriging uses semivariance to measure spatial autocorrelation and is computed through equation 2 2 γ h 1 2 z x i z x j 2 where γ h is the semivariance between known points x i and x j separated by distance h and z is the attribute value gupta 2017 among the various types of kriging ordinary kriging method has been used in the present study it provides the best linear unbiased estimate blue of the regionalized variable at an unsampled location because the interpolated values are computed from equations that minimize the variance of the estimation error chang 2012 it is based on the configuration of the data and on the semivariogram yamamoto 2005 a semivariogram is a plot that shows the variance in measure with distance between all pairs of sampled locations the distance at which the curve flattens out is called the range fig 4 for distances greater than the range it is assumed that there exists no autocorrelation between the points the value on the y axis the semivariogram attains at range is known as sill the intercept made by the semivariogram model on y axis of the semivariogram is called the nugget li and heap 2008 3 2 sensitivity analysis as described earlier scientists have had a reservation regarding the usage of drastic because of subjectivity the ratings and weights carry thus it is imperative to check for any discrepancies in assigning the weights barber et al 1993 napolitano and fabbri 1996 mclay et al 2001 which in this study has been achieved through two methodologies 3 2 1 map removal sensitivity analysis this test identifies the sensitivity of vulnerability map by removing one or more layer maps at a time and was calculated using equation 3 3 s 100 v n vx i n v where s is the sensitivity measure v is the intrinsic vulnerability index of the method n and n represents the total number of parameters used to calculate v and vxi and vxi is the intrinsic vulnerability index obtained after removal of the parameter x 3 2 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis this test was carried out to assess the influence of each of the seven parameters of the model on the vulnerability measure in this analysis real or effective weight of each parameter has been compared with it s assigned or theoretical weight the real or the effective weight has been computed using equation 4 4 w 100 p r p w v where w refers to the effective weight of each parameter pr and pw are the rating value and the weight for each parameter and v represents the overall vulnerability index the theoretical weight was calculated using equation 5 5 t w 100 x w x w where tw refers to the theoretical weight of each parameter and xw is the weight for each parameter the mean percent error between theoretical weight and actual weight has been computed using equation 6 6 mean percent error 100 actual value theoretical value theoretical value 4 results and discussion to get a fair understanding of drastic each of drastic parameters its effect on aquifer vulnerability and the ratings and weight it carries has been described below 4 1 drastic parameters and aquifer vulnerability depth to water table is one of the essential factors that determine the thickness of material through which a contaminant must travel before reaching the aquifer the aquifer potential protection increases with depth to water because deeper water levels result from longer travel times thus maximum weight 5 has been assigned to the depth to groundwater in this study depth to water table was measured using piezometers installed by cgwb the depth to water table in the study area ranges from 1 23 meters below ground level mbgl to 44 9 mbgl it has been classified into ranges defined by drastic model and was thus assigned rates from 1 minimum impact on vulnerability to 10 maximum impact on vulnerability this indicated that the deeper the groundwater the smaller is the rating value babiker et al 2005 these standardized ratings were also confirmed from the literature abdelmadjid and omar 2013 natraj and katyal 2014 ghosh et al 2015 the least rating of 1 was given to the deeper aquifers i e region around delhi ridge and maximum was given to shallow aquifers i e around yamuna floodplain fig 5 a i the net recharge is the amount of water from precipitation and artificial sources that migrates to the water table recharge water is a significant vehicle for percolating and transporting contaminants from the vadose zone to the saturated zone alam et al 2012 thus the more the recharge greater are the chances for contaminants to reach the water table for this study data pertaining to net recharge was collected from the imd and cgwb recharge was calculated using equation 7 7 net recharge r e c h a r g e r a t e rainfall evaporation further this parameter was rated on a 1 10 standard scale which has been reported by breabăn and paiu 2012 kumari et al 2016 and ahada and suthar 2018 in their work the net recharge in the study area ranged from 170 30 to 434 48 mm yr and was assigned a rating of 6 8 and 9 a higher rating of 9 was assigned to higher recharge areas e g region around water bodies and coarse sand aquifer because these areas provide permeable pathway to the pollutants from surface to groundwater table natraj 2017 the lowest recharge rate 6 was coupled with the urban land use that prevents downward penetration of rainwater and was reported around delhi ridge fig 5a ii net recharge was assigned a weight of 4 in this model the net recharge map was corroborated with depth to water table and it was found that wherever the net recharge was high the value of depth to water table was low aquifer media refers to the consolidated or unconsolidated rock which serves as an aquifer herlinger and antonio 2007 the aquifer media exerts a significant control over the route and path length which a contaminant must follow aller et al 1987 in general aquifer media reflects the contaminant attenuation capacity of the aquifer that depends on the amount and sorting of fine grains the lower the grain size the higher the attenuation capacity of aquifer media and consequently lower the pollution potential so the finer media was assigned a low rating as compared to the coarse media mehra et al 2016 for the study area an aquifer media map fig 5a iii was created from the geological map of delhi and was assigned a rating of 3 5 and 6 with a weight value of 3 soil media characteristics influence groundwater vulnerability as it directly impacts the amount of recharge and the ability of contaminants to infiltrate the vadose zone different types of soil have different water holding characteristics that influence the travel time of pollutants the presence of fine grain size materials such as clay peat or silt and the percentage of organic matter within the soil cover can decrease intrinsic permeability and retard contaminant migration through physicochemical processes i e absorption ionic exchange oxidation and biodegradation al abadi et al 2017 different soil types have been assigned rates according to their permeability with permeable soil getting a high rating as compared to the less permeable soil in this study a soil map of the study area fig 5a iv was prepared from the soil map of national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nagpur 1999 and a weight of 2 and ratings of 4 5 6 and 8 were assigned topography refers to the slope of an area areas with low slope tend to retain water for longer period of time and thus allow a higher infiltration or recharge of water and a greater potential for contaminant migration areas with steep slopes experience large amounts of runoff and smaller amounts of infiltration making them less vulnerable to groundwater contamination al adamat et al 2003 for major part of study area the topography fig 5b v displayed a gentle slope 0 6 and thus has been assigned the drastic rating score of 9 however the slope percentage increases towards the south of the study area near delhi ridge 18 and thus has been given a weight of 1 impact of vadose zone i vadose zone is the ground portion found between the aquifer and the soil cover where pores or joints are unsaturated its influence on aquifer pollution potential is similar to that of soil cover i e it depends on permeability and the attenuation characteristics of the media if vadose zone is composed of a permeable material then it has a high impact on water movement based on the geological description of the study area the vadose zone is generally given a rating from 4 to 6 a weight of 5 has been used in this study fig 5b vi hydraulic conductivity c refers to the ability of the aquifer to transmit water and controls the contaminant migration and dispersion from the injection point within the saturated zone and the plume concentration an aquifer with high conductivity is more vulnerable to contamination than others herein the value of hydraulic conductivity was calculated using transmissivity and saturated thickness of the aquifer values of which were obtained from cgwb for the study area the value of hydraulic conductivity ranged between 0 55 and 13 51 m day north east and eastern part of the study area fig 5b vii were characterized with high hydraulic conductivity and were thus assigned the highest rating of 10 a weight of 3 was also given to this parameter once the ratings and weights of each parameter were decided a final vulnerability map fig 6 was generated by running the model in the arcgis environment the drastic scores so obtained varied from 85 to 157 these values were reclassified into four classes of low medium high and very high vulnerability using the quantile classification scheme table 3 the results of the model show that of the total 1483 square kilometer sq km an area of about 323 17 sq km is in the low vulnerability zone with a drastic index ranging between 85 and 103 parallely around 506 sq km is in the medium zone with drastic value ranging from 104 to 121 381 08 sq km of the total area is in high vulnerability with a drastic index between 122 and 139 and 272 75 sq km is in very high vulnerability zone with a drastic value ranging from 140 to 157 the results further indicate that 45 of the nct of delhi is at very high to high risk in terms of pollution potential with regions concentrated in north west north east and some parts of west district of delhi this could be due to combination of gentle slope porous vadose zone and shallow water table while on one hand the areas under very high vulnerability zone are observed around river yamuna bhalaswa landfill and gazipur landfill areas in the north west and west region of the city including kanjhawala rohini kingsway camp and nangloi are in high vulnerability zone the areas in the south south west and west districts of delhi that include najafgarh dwarka bawana ashok vihar and mayur vihar have medium vulnerability a significant part of southwest and south delhi district is in low pollution potential category and includes areas along southern part of delhi ridge like hauz khas shekhawati lines and aya nagar this could be attributed to the high slope low recharge and deep water table that reduces the chances of the aquifer getting polluted in all the drastic analysis indicates that area along yamuna floodplain is most prone to contamination while the chances are lowest in delhi ridge area to verify the zonation generated by drastic ground truthing was conducted to substantiate the identified vulnerability zones the zonation completely corroborated with the recognized zones and thus process of sensitivity analysis was proceeded with 4 2 validation method sensitivity analysis was conducted by both the methods described earlier to understand and evaluate each method on the basis of effect it holds on the intrinsic sensitivity maps these methods have been used to analyze the reliability of vulnerability criteria and validate developed vulnerability maps table 4 presents a statistical summary of the seven parameters of the drastic model to workout vulnerability of groundwater in nct of delhi an examination of the means of the parameters reveals that the highest contributor to the vulnerability index is net recharge mean 8 09 followed by the depth to water table mean 5 82 the third and fourth significant contributors are impact of vadose zone mean 5 27 and aquifer media mean 5 23 while on one hand soil media and topography mean value 4 95 and 4 09 respectively contribute moderately to the vulnerability index hydraulic conductivity with a mean value of 3 82 contributes lowest to the contamination of groundwater the coefficient of variation indicates that maximum variation is observed in hydraulic conductivity 58 08 depth to water table 53 47 and topography 41 94 while moderate variation was observed in impact of vadose zone 18 68 soil media 18 14 and net recharge 13 70 lowest variation was seen in the parameter aquifer media 13 11 4 2 1 map removal sensitivity analysis as described earlier sensitivity analysis is imperative to validate and evaluate the uniformity of the analytical results and forms basis for efficient evaluation of the vulnerability maps pathak et al 2009 the map removal sensitivity analysis technique requires removing each thematic layer individually and computing variation index these maps depict a variation in the spatial distribution of different vulnerability classes of the variation index the individual maps so generated are illustrated through fig 7 a and b along with table 5 together giving an insight into the variation of the vulnerability index as a result of removing each layer from the assessment highest variation index was observed for the parameter net recharge r mean variation index 6 23 which could be attributed to the high theoretical weight table 5 assigned to this layer furthermore the vulnerability index also seems to be sensitive to the removal of depth to water table d and vadose zone layer i as the mean variation index for these two parameters is 5 55 and 5 51 removal of the aquifer media a hydraulic conductivity c and soil media s respective mean variation indices being 4 07 3 5 and 3 36 also contributed significantly to the variation of vulnerability index the least sensitive parameter was topography t with the mean variation index of 2 82 4 2 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis while the map removal sensitivity analysis evaluates the importance of each seven parameters by calculating variation index single parameter sensitivity analysis compares theoretical weights with effective weights babiker et al 2005 the effective weight is a function of the value of the single parameter in reference to other six parameters clubbed with the weight assigned to it by the drastic model calculated through equation 4 theoretical weights are the standardized values for each parameter and is calculated using equation 5 the minimum and maximum value of effective weights has been depicted in table 6 the error value indicates the difference between the theoretical and effective weights and is computed through equation 6 it must be mentioned that for computation of error mean value of effective weights has been considered the values generated for effective weight indicate net recharge r to be most influencing parameter as it has highest effective weight of 25 43 this is followed by depth to water table parameter d and impact of vadose zone i with the effective weight of 21 35 and 21 04 respectively however it is important to mention that effective weights should not be considered in isolation as can be observed that the percentage error is highest 47 46 in hydraulic conductivity c indicating large difference in the value of theoretical and effective weight though hydraulic conductivity c has low effective weight 8 82 it can be established that because of high error there shall be inconsistency in the parametric evaluation of this parameter on the similar lines it can be inferred that parameters topography t and net recharge r with high error of 39 82 and 31 58 might not exhibit best of results at the same time parameters like depth to water table d and impact of vadose zone i with a low error of 1 62 and 3 15 shall demonstrate better results 5 conclusion the gis based drastic model has been utilized to assess the potential groundwater vulnerability in the nct of delhi thereafter sensitivity analysis has been carried out to validate the drastic using two different methods the results revealed that drastic index varied from 85 to 157 dividing the study region into four vulnerability classes low 85 103 medium 104 121 high 122 139 and very high 140 157 the southern part of the study area specifically around delhi ridge was found to be in the category of low vulnerability this could be attributed to the high slope and deep water table in the region that reduces the chances of aquifer getting polluted simultaneously eastern part of the study area was adjudged to be highly vulnerable this could be reasoned to its sandy and gravel lithology with high permeability and low depth of groundwater which leads to high net recharge of the aquifer findingsindicated the grave scenario of groundwater quality in nct delhi thus requiring an urgent remedial action the sensitivity analysis revealed that the intrinsic vulnerability of the study area is primarily due to the net recharge depth to water table and impact of vadose zone because of the higher effective weight these parameters carried the map removal sensitivity analysis indicated that the vulnerability index is highly sensitive to the removal of net recharge depth to water and impact of vadose zone layers and is least sensitive to the removal of the topography the same was reinforced by single parameter sensitivity analysis as the effective weights generated corroborated with variation index values however it is essential to keep in mind that parameters with high error are not reliable in terms of result generation in such cases drastic should be replaced by modified drastic or ahp drastic acknowledgments the authors sincerely thank the central ground water board delhi for providing necessary assistance the authors

12256,it is evident that arsenic has detrimental effect on health including deadlier disease such as cancer diabetes mellitus birth defects which can eventually lead to adverse effect on our social life over the last 40 years several research on arsenic epidemiology and public health carried out in bangladesh to ratify its adverse effect on our health and social life however most of these researches focused on the extent of arsenic contamination in groundwater and related health consequences lack of comprehensive matrix lead us to compile all published arsenic research articles that had been undertaken in bangladesh during millennium development goals mdgs period 2000 2015 focused on the recommendation of arsenic mitigation and technologies and future direction review matrix was developed in three different categories 1 policy level 2 facilities and technologies and 3 health system as these categories were the key areas to mitigate arsenic exposure we noted mixed policy recommendations and of those incoordination among different stakeholders came up as one of the key barriers for arsenic mitigation in bangladesh sharing low or arsenic free tubewell proper use and maintenance of arsenic filters structural supply water such as the pipe water and pay per use concept were highlighted in several research women should be actively involved in all mitigation programs in bangladesh keywords arsenic mitigation bangladesh safe water sustainable development goals 1 introduction arsenic is a naturally occurring element found readily in our soil our water and in the food we eat naturally occurring arsenic in water has affected the lives of millions of people in bangladesh which is often termed as largest mass poisoning of a population in history smith et al 2000 despite some mitigation efforts 52 million people in these regions are still drinking water containing arsenic above the commonly accepted limit of 10 ppb with 20 million consuming concentrations of more than 50 ppb cullen and reimer 2016 chakraborti et al 2018 although drinking arsenic contaminated water is considered as the main sources of arsenic intoxication to human health there are other major sources which remain behind the curtain several studies confirmed the presence of arsenic in different varieties of rice contaminated via three successive routes water soil crop huq et al 2006 khan et al 2009 other study estimated that around 30 arsenic ingestion could occur though arsenic contaminated rice and other food sources duxbury et al 2003 correll et al 2006 this indirect arsenic ingestion occurs firstly when crops are irrigated and then cooked with arsenic contaminated water meharg and rahman 2003 williams et al 2005 the impact of arsenic contamination either via directly drinking contaminated water or indirectly consuming arsenic contaminated foods is expected to be felt in generations to come arsenic affects multiple systems of the human body such as respiratory vascular nervous and endocrine system and causes numerous health hazards including increased risk of cancer adverse pregnancy outcomes reduce women s reproductive life and impaired child development ahmad et al 2001 milton et al 2005 ahamed et al 2006 ahsan et al 2006 majumdar et al 2014 yunus et al 2014 rahman et al 2015 according to who guidelines water containing more than 10 μg l of arsenic is deemed to be contaminated whereas the benchmark for bangladesh rises up to 50 μg l due to some practical reasons who 1996 caldwell et al 2006 van geen et al 2006 about 20 million people in bangladesh are now using tubewells contaminated with arsenic over the permissible level 50 ppb unicef 2008 numerous alternative water supply technologies have been identified and tested in different areas of bangladesh to reduce the concentration of arsenic in water the government of bangladesh gob started implementing mitigation programs in 1996 with support from the developmental partner as well as national and international ngos improved wells deep tube wells pond sand filters rainwater harvesting and piped water supply have all been piloted and adopted in bangladesh as possible mitigation strategies ahamed et al 2006 howard et al 2006 milton et al 2012 however after three decades of the first identification of arsenic 93 tubewells used for drinking purpose had no color to identify whether it is arsenic free or contaminated and 71 of respondents didn t know whether tubewells used for drinking were tested for identifying arsenic contamination in the last one two years pfaff et al 2017 in addition to these 5 of people who were disabled need special support to fetch the water from nearby water point source a review paper published in 2016 compiled all the research that had been taken place on arsenic contamination of underground water in bangladesh the review matrix showed that majority of the studies were commenced to find out the extent of arsenic contamination in underground water in bangladesh and it s notorious health consequences to those who had been drinking arsenic contaminated water yunus et al 2016 nonetheless a few research had been conducted to find the potential solution of this mass underground water poisoning in bangladesh edmunds et al 2015 we deem it is time to think earnestly about the potential solution of this carcinomatous toxin that is naturally present in the groundwater and threaten human life with every drop of contaminated water we therefore in this paper took an attempt to compile all the recommendation suggested in the arsenic epidemiology and public health research focused on mitigation technologies and future direction that had been undertaken in bangladesh during millennium development goals mdgs period 2000 2015 table 1 gathering comprehensive evidence in the mdgs period would shed light on the future direction for appropriate arsenic mitigation safe water access and its research priorities for sustainable development goals sdgs period in bangladesh 2 extent and health effect of arsenic contamination in bangladesh the presence of arsenic in drinking water in bangladesh is extensive and widespread in 1998 it was found that 41 out of 64 districts had arsenic concentrations in groundwater exceeding 50 μg l mukherjee et al 2006 another study reported that 50 out of 64 districts had groundwater arsenic concentration exceeding 50 μg l by 2005 ahamed et al 2006 an estimated 57 million people in bangladesh are at risk of arsenic induced disease due to chronic contamination of arsenic in their drinking water which exceeds the who safe drinking limit ahmad 2001 the dietary preference of bangladeshi population particularly the heavy intake of ground or root vegetables are found to be positively associated with arsenic toxicity manifested by carotid intima media thickness cmt in addition to this eating food crops such as rice which is irrigated by contaminated groundwater might lead to adverse health consequences including increased risk of death and disease khan et al 2009 adams 2013 arsenic toxicity affects millions of people in bangladesh in 1998 arsenic associated skin problems were first drawn to public attention chowdhury et al 2000 arsenic exposure results in melanosis pigmentation followed by keratosis and hyperkeratosis nrc 1999 ahamed et al 2006 besides these characteristic dermal lesions which includes conjunctival congestion non pitting foot swelling hepatomegaly splenomegaly ascites and bowen s disease and gangrene are all associated with arsenic toxicity ahamed et al 2006 arsenic related skin lesions are also linked to early onset menopause and reduced reproductive period yunus et al 2014 high concentration of arsenic exposure could have both carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects mazumder et al 2000 who 2001 rahman et al 2007 wasserman et al 2007 non carcinogenic effect includes chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases liver diseases neurotoxicity chronic cough and diabetic mellitus carcinogenic effects include the high risk of developing cancer such as lung cancer and bladder cancer ferreccio and sancha 2006 sun et al 2006 milton et al 2012 which persists for decades after initial arsenic exposure ahsan et al 2006 there is also an increased risk of lung cancer mortality among people with severe skin lesions caused by arsenic toxicity argos et al 2014 a positive association was found between arsenic exposure via drinking water and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortions ahmad et al 2001 milton et al 2005 ahamed et al 2006 stillbirths ahmad et al 2001 milton et al 2005 ahamed et al 2006 and pre term births ahmad et al 2001 ahamed et al 2006 and impair child development different studies conducted in arsenic affected areas in bangladesh confirmed that child health particularly children s low birth weight ahmad et al 2001 milton et al 2005 ahamed et al 2006 neonatal mortality ahmad et al 2001 milton et al 2005 ahamed et al 2006 and infant mortality ahmad et al 2001 ahamed et al 2006 are associated with arsenic exposure 3 arsenic mitigation at the policy level mixed policy recommendations were noted with regards to the arsenic mitigation earlier in 2001 an article published in the lancet suggested revising the bangladesh national drinking water standards for arsenic to 0 05 μg l after considering local bangladeshi context as it could improve health ahmad et al 2001 it was not clearly explained why such recommendation was made because bangladesh adopted who s earlier guideline in 1996 which was 50 μg l or lesser who 1996 and who set global arsenic acceptance level in drinking water to 10 μg l or less who 1998 the government of bangladesh gob in its national policy for arsenic recommended to use alternative water sources such as community based dugwells pond sand filters rainwater harvesting deep tubewells and piped water in the arsenic affected areas gob 2014 it had been suggested that installation of home based arsenic removal technologies could sustain gob goal to mitigate arsenic shafiquzzaman et al 2009 sanchez et al 2016 however study reported that villagers shared less enthusiasm on using rainwater instead of tube well because of their deep rooted mind set on using the tube well water regardless its quality jakariya et al 2007b at the policy level researchers also highlighted that coordination among various actors and mass awareness campaign on the adverse effect of arsenic could lead to success jochem et al 2016 knowledge building by means of campaigns and surveys was initially used to raise awareness about arsenic contamination and its effects khan et al 2015 it has been shown that perceived risk may decrease with increased knowledge arcury et al 2002 aziz et al 2015 it is therefore important for the target population to understand the extent of the problem and agree to adopt alternative options to mitigate risk and demand safe water supplies however convenience is an important factor to consider in public health mitigation policies various studies have been completed to understand the mechanisms of mobilization and demobilization of arsenic and its mitigation in certain hydrogeological conditions johnston et al 2014 policies have been formulated to provide arsenic safe water to more than 22 million people exposed to arsenic above the national drinking water limit however more than 19 million people are still exposed to the same level as reported by the latest mics survey unicef 2014 other studies suggested that bangladesh should experiment paying for water concept to be implemented in the rural area as it was assumed to be a potential solution and could create ownership among the users johnston et al 2014 khan et al 2014 khan and yang 2014 george et al 2017 it was estimated that allocation of small fraction of bangladesh s gdp on ensuring arsenic free water could eliminate arsenic by 2030 flanagan et al 2012 contrary other study argued that dismantling the existing 8 10 million tubewells may not be economically variable case for bangladesh jakariya et al 2007b other study supported that arsenic safe tubewell water is the most accepted format among the users because of its low cost maintenance better water quality and easy operation hossain et al 2015 4 facilities and technologies for arsenic mitigation mitigation efforts have stagnated over the past years resulting very slow progress in providing safe water to the most vulnerable communities this stagnation has taken place at times when significant advances have been made towards arsenic mitigation in science and policy fronts during the mdgs period 2000 2015 a majority of the study focused on developing facilities and or technologies suggesting a various dimension of arsenic mitigation common suggestions were to find out effective arsenic treatment and establishment of those treatment plant at the community level ahmad 2001 argos et al 2012 flanagan et al 2012 other suggestion includes installing deep tubewells and reinstalling arsenic contaminated deep tubewells in 50 100 m depth instead of 20 30 m depth and monitor the ground quality over 5 years hoque et al 2006 howard et al 2006 jakariya et al 2007b robinson et al 2011 johnston et al 2014 earlier studies reported that local drillers could set tube well location based on the colour of the sedimentation where preference should be given to red coloured sediments and dark coloured sediments must be avoided von brömssen et al 2008 it is because dark coloured sediment is a reliable indicator to detect high and low as concentration in the groundwater von brömssen et al 2007 mobile phone technology could be used for spatial determination to safer aquifer for installing new tubewells van geen et al 2006 well sharing switch wells structural supply water such as the pipe water and pay per use concept also came to attention as it was suggested in several studies hoque et al 2004 ahmed et al 2006 joya et al 2006 argos et al 2012 milton et al 2012 johnston et al 2014 simply remarking affected tubewells as red and using sediment color tool for targeting arsenic safe aquifers could be another useful strategy as it could help people to be aware of arsenic contaminated tubewells and its detrimental effect on health jakariya et al 2007b few other studies suggested to use arsenic filters such as three pitcher filters and sono arsenic filter saf and arsenic removal from water sources through reverse osmosis schmidt et al 2016 however it was pointed out that it may not lead to an effective arsenic mitigation without the pictorial guidebook for assembling the filter proper use and timely maintenance milton et al 2007 shafiquzzaman et al 2009 other researcher studied oral therapies such as vitamins and microminerals on those patients who have been suffering from chronic arsenic intoxication the study reported that riboflavin pyridoxine vitamins a c and e and folic acid could reduce the risk of arsenic skin lesions zablotska et al 2008 apart from arsenic free drinking water and its mitigation effort several studies investigated rice as a potential source of arsenic contamination to human health studies suggested bioremediation field injection of molasses selection and breeding including genetic modification of low arsenic rice cultivars paddy field water management and use of silicon fertilizer harvey et al 2002 zhao et al 2010 to reduce arsenic absorption in rice another study added that balanced fertilizer has the potential to reduce arsenic accumulation in rice even though it is cultivated with arsenic contaminated irrigation water imamul huq et al 2011 5 compatible health system for arsenic mitigation a few researches were given importance on the role of the health system in arsenic mitigation strategies earlier in 2001 the lancet article suggested that human resources development should be a part of comprehensive arsenic mitigation plan ahmad 2001 different test results between field tester and laboratory analyst are not infrequent and proper training of the field personnel along with cross verification of the field test results with lab investigation could be ideal way to determine true arsenic concentration in the ground water jakariya et al 2007a other articles had emphasized on the awareness of the adverse health effect of drinking arsenic contaminated water and effective dissemination of the arsenic free technologies among affected population ahamed et al 2006 aziz et al 2006 shafiquzzaman et al 2009 in addition community education capacity of local stakeholders and developing the water arsenic wa testing capability among the affected population could be another way of reducing arsenic burden in bangladesh rammelt and boes 2004 aziz et al 2006 george et al 2012 herath et al 2016 interestingly one study published in 2006 highlighted a different dimension of arsenic mitigation they stated women in affected areas should be actively involved in any arsenic mitigation program they suggested to encourage the population to consume home grown fruits and vegetables ahamed et al 2006 6 discussion given the high burden of arsenic contamination in groundwater several projects were implemented such as bangladesh arsenic mitigation water supply project bamwsp in 2002 where arsenic safe water was provided to 2 2 5 million people covering 4 000 highly arsenic affected villages 9272 deep tube wells 300 rain water harvesting system 393 dug wells and 1 pipe water supply system were installed as of 2006 world bank 2007 another major project was initiated by bangladesh government titled bd rural water supply and sanitation project in 2012 with the aim to increase safe water supply in the highly arsenic contaminated rural areas among the major five components of the project the primary component included installation of rural pipe water in 383 unions of 20 districts ieg review team 2018 gob 2019 however as of 2017 december due to the slow pipe water connection the number of beneficiaries shrunken from 71 506 to 14 000 households ieg review team 2018 second component was installation of non piped water supply through deep tube wells and dug well in areas where groundwater is highly contaminated with arsenic but have low population density due to the project restructuring in 2015 this second component was dropped other three components included capacity development project management and disaster contingency risk response among the department of public health engineering dphe personnel and government officials ieg review team 2018 although various government departments carried out multiple arsenic mitigation project still there are pockets where emphasize should be given among the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs set to be achieved by 2030 water was considered as one of the major areas for sustainable development and sdg 6 to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all was solely entitled for water and sanitation guppy et al 2018 in sdg 6 sub indicators it was emphasized in all areas of water including universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water sdg 6 1 ensuring water quality by reducing pollution sdg 6 3 water use efficiently sdg 6 4 integrated water resource management sdg 6 5 and restoration of water ecosystem sdg 6 6 furthermore sdg 6 emphasized on the capacity building to developing countries sdg 6a and support to strengthen the participation of local communities sdg 6b in water and sanitation management un 2018 although sdg 6 focuses on water and sanitation it is meticulously linked other sdgs such sdg 1 poverty sdg 2 malnutrition sdg water borne disease sdg 4 education sgd 10 income growth sdg 11 water related disaster and sdg 12 natural resources un water 2016 it implies that numerous sdg goals will be under threat for not ensuring water for all our comprehensive review matrix pointed out the research recommendations and conclusions that were carried out during the mdg 2000 2015 period and shows the future directions for research and assist decision making for the policy makers on mitigating arsenic although numerous research had been conducted in bangladesh within the mdgs period 2000 2015 there seems to be lack of consensus among different stakeholders which resulted in ineffective arsenic mitigation program in bangladesh it is possible and is likely that further arsenic mitigation research has been conducted in bangladesh beyond 2015 end of the mdgs period however this review did not cover those research this might lead to a failure to capture recent progress of the arsenic mitigation in bangladesh understanding the magnitude of arsenic contamination burden the 6th international congress titled arsenic research and global sustainability was held in stockholm sweden in 2016 to find out a holistic solution towards environmental arsenic contamination by solidification of consensus among the academicians industries research laboratories government agencies and the private sector bhattacharya et al 2016 another limitation of this review is that it only counted on published research in bangladesh thus there are chances of bias towards positive results dwan et al 2008 this means that only those arsenic mitigation public health program and or research that had been successful were published which highlighted only one side of the story however arsenic mitigation public health programs in bangladesh are multidimensional therefore a different side to the story could be that arsenic mitigation public health programs were not evaluated properly using rigorous evaluation techniques it is also possible that those programs were evaluated but professionals were not keen in publishing the effectiveness of the program which limits our knowledge on this issue despite this fact a few researches published showed limited and or no effect of their effort in reducing arsenic toxicity in human health a double blind randomized placebo controlled study clinicaltrials gov identifier nct00392561 reported that either alone or in combination with vitamin e 400 mg racemic alpha tocopherol and selenium 200 μg l selenomethionine oral pills have no significant improvement of arsenic induced skin lesions after 6 months of intervention verret et al 2005 7 conclusion there is a need for updating policies and strategies for arsenic mitigation in the light of recent scientific findings for safer sources of water and guides for targeting aquifers pragmatic policy based on scientific findings remains as the key element of successful arsenic mitigation in bangladesh proper groundwater and surface water governance have to be initiated through a competent authority with support from all stakeholders in order to mitigate arsenic it should also be linked with ensuring sustainable safe water supply for meeting increased demands in relation to population growth urbanization and industrialization

12256,it is evident that arsenic has detrimental effect on health including deadlier disease such as cancer diabetes mellitus birth defects which can eventually lead to adverse effect on our social life over the last 40 years several research on arsenic epidemiology and public health carried out in bangladesh to ratify its adverse effect on our health and social life however most of these researches focused on the extent of arsenic contamination in groundwater and related health consequences lack of comprehensive matrix lead us to compile all published arsenic research articles that had been undertaken in bangladesh during millennium development goals mdgs period 2000 2015 focused on the recommendation of arsenic mitigation and technologies and future direction review matrix was developed in three different categories 1 policy level 2 facilities and technologies and 3 health system as these categories were the key areas to mitigate arsenic exposure we noted mixed policy recommendations and of those incoordination among different stakeholders came up as one of the key barriers for arsenic mitigation in bangladesh sharing low or arsenic free tubewell proper use and maintenance of arsenic filters structural supply water such as the pipe water and pay per use concept were highlighted in several research women should be actively involved in all mitigation programs in bangladesh keywords arsenic mitigation bangladesh safe water sustainable development goals 1 introduction arsenic is a naturally occurring element found readily in our soil our water and in the food we eat naturally occurring arsenic in water has affected the lives of millions of people in bangladesh which is often termed as largest mass poisoning of a population in history smith et al 2000 despite some mitigation efforts 52 million people in these regions are still drinking water containing arsenic above the commonly accepted limit of 10 ppb with 20 million consuming concentrations of more than 50 ppb cullen and reimer 2016 chakraborti et al 2018 although drinking arsenic contaminated water is considered as the main sources of arsenic intoxication to human health there are other major sources which remain behind the curtain several studies confirmed the presence of arsenic in different varieties of rice contaminated via three successive routes water soil crop huq et al 2006 khan et al 2009 other study estimated that around 30 arsenic ingestion could occur though arsenic contaminated rice and other food sources duxbury et al 2003 correll et al 2006 this indirect arsenic ingestion occurs firstly when crops are irrigated and then cooked with arsenic contaminated water meharg and rahman 2003 williams et al 2005 the impact of arsenic contamination either via directly drinking contaminated water or indirectly consuming arsenic contaminated foods is expected to be felt in generations to come arsenic affects multiple systems of the human body such as respiratory vascular nervous and endocrine system and causes numerous health hazards including increased risk of cancer adverse pregnancy outcomes reduce women s reproductive life and impaired child development ahmad et al 2001 milton et al 2005 ahamed et al 2006 ahsan et al 2006 majumdar et al 2014 yunus et al 2014 rahman et al 2015 according to who guidelines water containing more than 10 μg l of arsenic is deemed to be contaminated whereas the benchmark for bangladesh rises up to 50 μg l due to some practical reasons who 1996 caldwell et al 2006 van geen et al 2006 about 20 million people in bangladesh are now using tubewells contaminated with arsenic over the permissible level 50 ppb unicef 2008 numerous alternative water supply technologies have been identified and tested in different areas of bangladesh to reduce the concentration of arsenic in water the government of bangladesh gob started implementing mitigation programs in 1996 with support from the developmental partner as well as national and international ngos improved wells deep tube wells pond sand filters rainwater harvesting and piped water supply have all been piloted and adopted in bangladesh as possible mitigation strategies ahamed et al 2006 howard et al 2006 milton et al 2012 however after three decades of the first identification of arsenic 93 tubewells used for drinking purpose had no color to identify whether it is arsenic free or contaminated and 71 of respondents didn t know whether tubewells used for drinking were tested for identifying arsenic contamination in the last one two years pfaff et al 2017 in addition to these 5 of people who were disabled need special support to fetch the water from nearby water point source a review paper published in 2016 compiled all the research that had been taken place on arsenic contamination of underground water in bangladesh the review matrix showed that majority of the studies were commenced to find out the extent of arsenic contamination in underground water in bangladesh and it s notorious health consequences to those who had been drinking arsenic contaminated water yunus et al 2016 nonetheless a few research had been conducted to find the potential solution of this mass underground water poisoning in bangladesh edmunds et al 2015 we deem it is time to think earnestly about the potential solution of this carcinomatous toxin that is naturally present in the groundwater and threaten human life with every drop of contaminated water we therefore in this paper took an attempt to compile all the recommendation suggested in the arsenic epidemiology and public health research focused on mitigation technologies and future direction that had been undertaken in bangladesh during millennium development goals mdgs period 2000 2015 table 1 gathering comprehensive evidence in the mdgs period would shed light on the future direction for appropriate arsenic mitigation safe water access and its research priorities for sustainable development goals sdgs period in bangladesh 2 extent and health effect of arsenic contamination in bangladesh the presence of arsenic in drinking water in bangladesh is extensive and widespread in 1998 it was found that 41 out of 64 districts had arsenic concentrations in groundwater exceeding 50 μg l mukherjee et al 2006 another study reported that 50 out of 64 districts had groundwater arsenic concentration exceeding 50 μg l by 2005 ahamed et al 2006 an estimated 57 million people in bangladesh are at risk of arsenic induced disease due to chronic contamination of arsenic in their drinking water which exceeds the who safe drinking limit ahmad 2001 the dietary preference of bangladeshi population particularly the heavy intake of ground or root vegetables are found to be positively associated with arsenic toxicity manifested by carotid intima media thickness cmt in addition to this eating food crops such as rice which is irrigated by contaminated groundwater might lead to adverse health consequences including increased risk of death and disease khan et al 2009 adams 2013 arsenic toxicity affects millions of people in bangladesh in 1998 arsenic associated skin problems were first drawn to public attention chowdhury et al 2000 arsenic exposure results in melanosis pigmentation followed by keratosis and hyperkeratosis nrc 1999 ahamed et al 2006 besides these characteristic dermal lesions which includes conjunctival congestion non pitting foot swelling hepatomegaly splenomegaly ascites and bowen s disease and gangrene are all associated with arsenic toxicity ahamed et al 2006 arsenic related skin lesions are also linked to early onset menopause and reduced reproductive period yunus et al 2014 high concentration of arsenic exposure could have both carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects mazumder et al 2000 who 2001 rahman et al 2007 wasserman et al 2007 non carcinogenic effect includes chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases liver diseases neurotoxicity chronic cough and diabetic mellitus carcinogenic effects include the high risk of developing cancer such as lung cancer and bladder cancer ferreccio and sancha 2006 sun et al 2006 milton et al 2012 which persists for decades after initial arsenic exposure ahsan et al 2006 there is also an increased risk of lung cancer mortality among people with severe skin lesions caused by arsenic toxicity argos et al 2014 a positive association was found between arsenic exposure via drinking water and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortions ahmad et al 2001 milton et al 2005 ahamed et al 2006 stillbirths ahmad et al 2001 milton et al 2005 ahamed et al 2006 and pre term births ahmad et al 2001 ahamed et al 2006 and impair child development different studies conducted in arsenic affected areas in bangladesh confirmed that child health particularly children s low birth weight ahmad et al 2001 milton et al 2005 ahamed et al 2006 neonatal mortality ahmad et al 2001 milton et al 2005 ahamed et al 2006 and infant mortality ahmad et al 2001 ahamed et al 2006 are associated with arsenic exposure 3 arsenic mitigation at the policy level mixed policy recommendations were noted with regards to the arsenic mitigation earlier in 2001 an article published in the lancet suggested revising the bangladesh national drinking water standards for arsenic to 0 05 μg l after considering local bangladeshi context as it could improve health ahmad et al 2001 it was not clearly explained why such recommendation was made because bangladesh adopted who s earlier guideline in 1996 which was 50 μg l or lesser who 1996 and who set global arsenic acceptance level in drinking water to 10 μg l or less who 1998 the government of bangladesh gob in its national policy for arsenic recommended to use alternative water sources such as community based dugwells pond sand filters rainwater harvesting deep tubewells and piped water in the arsenic affected areas gob 2014 it had been suggested that installation of home based arsenic removal technologies could sustain gob goal to mitigate arsenic shafiquzzaman et al 2009 sanchez et al 2016 however study reported that villagers shared less enthusiasm on using rainwater instead of tube well because of their deep rooted mind set on using the tube well water regardless its quality jakariya et al 2007b at the policy level researchers also highlighted that coordination among various actors and mass awareness campaign on the adverse effect of arsenic could lead to success jochem et al 2016 knowledge building by means of campaigns and surveys was initially used to raise awareness about arsenic contamination and its effects khan et al 2015 it has been shown that perceived risk may decrease with increased knowledge arcury et al 2002 aziz et al 2015 it is therefore important for the target population to understand the extent of the problem and agree to adopt alternative options to mitigate risk and demand safe water supplies however convenience is an important factor to consider in public health mitigation policies various studies have been completed to understand the mechanisms of mobilization and demobilization of arsenic and its mitigation in certain hydrogeological conditions johnston et al 2014 policies have been formulated to provide arsenic safe water to more than 22 million people exposed to arsenic above the national drinking water limit however more than 19 million people are still exposed to the same level as reported by the latest mics survey unicef 2014 other studies suggested that bangladesh should experiment paying for water concept to be implemented in the rural area as it was assumed to be a potential solution and could create ownership among the users johnston et al 2014 khan et al 2014 khan and yang 2014 george et al 2017 it was estimated that allocation of small fraction of bangladesh s gdp on

fulfillment of soybean needs must still be done by imported from various countries to overcome this problem an increase in soybean production are needs and can be directed to dry land however the availability of water in dry land is one of the main factors in the lack of a percentage of the plant s ability to grow on it one way to make water and nutrients effective for plants and to improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil is by applying hydrogels abedi koupai et al 2008 guilherme et al 2015 ullah et al 2015 hydrogel polymer seems to be extremely effective to be as a soil conditioner in agricultural sector conditioner which has the ability to hold water and nutrients can support plant growth by improving soil properties abobatta 2018 hydrogels are hydrophilic polymers that have the ability to expand in water and form a state of equilibrium hoffman 2012 nguyen and west 2002 the use of hydrogels in the growing media is one alternative to reduce the intensity of watering the use of hydrogels can be utilized in various fields including as superabsorbent polymeric materials ahmed 2015 zhao et al 2005 the advantages of using hydrogels when compared to other absorbent materials such as paper cellulose and cotton are their absorption capability several times compared to their weight resistance to pressure and 90 of the ingredients can be decomposed so that they are environmentally friendly adel et al 2010 gorgieva and kokol 2011 yoshimura et al 2006 the high concentration of amount of hydrogel it is not good either for soil plant because the plants cannot be respected and root activity against absorption of nutrients is disrupted hydrogel with the right amount will improved soil moisture content and provided water to the plants this was experienced in soils treated with hydrogels that gained more soil moisture as compared to controls gilbert et al 2014 hydrogel polymer have the ability to absorb water is quite a hundred times its original weight within short period of time and desorb the adsorbed water under stress condition omidian et al 1998 zhang 2002 one of polymer could be potential for crosslinking to form a hydrogel is chitosan bhattarai et al 2010 boucard et al 2007 obara et al 2003 chitosan is a linear polysaccharide that is good materials for synthesis of hydrogel because it has an amine group nh2 singh et al 2012 in the other hand edta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid can be used as a cross linker agent the advantages of edta as a cross linker are cheaper and less toxic than other conventional crosslinking agents such as edc ethylene dichloride juang et al 1999 shimizu et al 2004 polymer chitosan edta has been widely modificated as the material absorb of metal juang et al 1999 has successfully modificated the copper cu heavy metal adsorbent from chitosan and edta by cross link method the presence of coo also nh2 from chitosan and edta is an active sites in bond formation and adsorption process meanwhile polymer super adsorbent chitosan edta it s not studied yet in soil conditioner application for growing of soybean plant therefore in this research hydrogel of chitosan edta was prepared using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as cross linked with various composition and applied as soil conditioner for soybean plant the characteristic were analyzed include the morphology swelling crosslinking degree and the functional group of the hydrogel the objective of study is to determine the effect of hydrogel composition toward physic chemical characteristics of soil and the

link using the equation c r o s s l i n k i n g d e g r e e w g w 0 100 where wg is a heavy hydrogel which is cross linked edta after immersion and wo is heavy dry hydrogel before immersion deligkaris et al 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 chitosan characterization preparation of chitosan edta crosslinking hydrogel as soil conditioner was successfully carried out in the process of making chitosan beads re polymerization of chitosan chitosan was made in a gel form and then formed solid again by printing in naoh solution bhattarai et al 2005 hirano et al 1990 kumar 2000 hydrogels are cross linked hydrophilic polymer structures that can imbibe large amounts of water or biological fluids hydrogels are one of the upcoming classes of polymer based systems that embrace numerous biomedical and agriculture applications due to their inherent property of biocompatibility they offer good opportunities as protein delivery systems or tissue engineering scaffolds lee et al 2000 murthy et al 2002 the structures of chitosan edta were confirmed by ft ir spectra analysis fig 1 a shows the ft ir spectra of difference in spectrum between chitosan edta and chitosan edta crosslinking from the spectrum shows the different graphs between the three which indicate a difference in the functional groups possessed of these compounds absorption at 3442 94 cm 1 is a functional group of oh chitosan and the ch3 bond of the acetyl group can be identified at wave number 2922 16 cm 1 the nh2 group was identified at wave number 1654 92 cm 1 which is a characteristic of chitosan the presence of absorption bands that appear in the area of 3425 58 cm 1 indicates the existence of stretching vibrations of the hydroxyl oh groups present in the edta structure the occurrence of cross linked chitosan with edta was identified from a shift of 1654 92 cm 1 in chitosan and 1587 42 cm 1 from edta to 1635 64 cm 1 which is the absorption area of co this is indicated by the wave number 500 1500 cm 1 which shows a decrease in the peak of the spectrum 3 2 morphological analysis of hydrogels using scanning electron microscopy sem the results of sem analysis with a magnification of 2500 times shown in fig 2 fig 2 a shows the sem results of cross linked edta chitosan hydrogel with a comparison of chita225 this hydrogel has an uneven surface fig 2 b shows the hydrogel with the comparison of chita205 the surface morphology of the hydrogel forms an aggregates that is rather hollow allowing it to absorb water and help plant growth the next picture is c shows the results of sem analysis of hydrogels with the comparison of chita210 this hydrogel has a few lumps that are less hollow tend to be tight the tight shape of the cavity allows this hydrogel to have a low water absorption capacity this is supported by the swelling degree of the comparison hydrogel chita210 with the lowest value among all comparisons gao and wang in 2008 stated that the adsorption capacity was influenced by bulk density and porosity the greater the porosity the greater the absorption capacity and the greater the bulk density the smaller the absorption capacity the presence of uneven granules on the surface of the hydrogel has been identified as crosslinking 3 3 chitosan edta hydrogel test 3 3 1 effect of the composition of the concentration on swelling of chitosan edta hydrogels based on fig 3 the hydrogel with the ratio of chita225 has the highest swelling of all other hydrogel comparisons which is 325 40 this is confirmed by the results of sem the hydrogel has an irregular and clumping surface so that the composition of the chita225 hydrogel has a high degree of swelling this is caused by the presence of an anionic group so that the bonds between molecules are less dense as a result there is more space for fluid to be occupied so that the absorption capacity becomes greater the smallest swelling is obtained from the chita210 hydrogel composition the hydrogel produces swelling degrees around 248 60 the size of swelling hydrogels are influenced by ionic interactions between cross linked groups and the density of cross linked bonds haraguchi and takehisa 2002 qu et al 2000 the degree of chita225 hydrogel is high because it has many cavities and a rough surface so that the water is easily absorbed into the hydrogel conversely the chita210 hydrogel swelling degree has a tight structure so that water is difficult to absorb into the hydrogel however the mechanical properties of the chita210 hydrogel are better the hydrogel structure of the strong and dense chita210 ratio thus decreases the absorption or swelling power of the hydrogel 3 3 2 effect of the composition of the concentration on the crosslinking degree of chitosan edta hydrogels based on fig 4 can be seen that the lowest crosslink degree is a hydrogel with a ratio of chita225 which is equal to 35 71 while for the comparison of chita205 and chita210 each has a cross linked degree value of 41 66 and 46 15 based on the graphs in figures there is a relationship where the degree of chitosan swelling is inversely proportional to the degree of crosslinking this is also confirmed by the statement of zhou et al in 2011 that the greater the degree of crosslinking of a hydrogel will cause a decrease in the volume of water trapped in the hydrogel polymer network see fig 5 3 4 hydrogel testing 3 4 1 effect of hydrogel composition on ph ph measurement was carried out on the first day of planting until the 75th day after planting the addition of hydrogels before and after planting in polybags does not significantly affect soil ph polybag control that were not added with hydrogels had a nearly constant ph value of 7 9 75 days soil ph values that tend to lead to bases in control polybags cause nutrients to be absorbed by plants so they have slow growth because the standard ph value of soybean plants is 5 8 7 ph values that exceed or less than growth requirements will cause soybean plant growth slowing down because absorption of nutrients will not work well the ph value of the soil causes nutrients to be easily absorbed by chili plants in polybags so that the ph value in accordance with the requirements for growing plants causes high plants quickly and has a thick number of leaves because nutrients can be absorbed properly 3 4 2 effect of hydrogel composition on soil moisture based on the results of the study the highest percentage of moisture was obtained in the treatment of variations in the composition of the addition of hydrogel chita225 polybag soil samples on a given hydrogel has a percent moisture because based on the swelling ability chita225 hydrogels has the ability of swelling the greatest among all comparisons this is because the presence of hydrogels can hold water contained in the soil so it can control the release of water and maintain soil moisture hüttermann et al 1999 based on fig 7 it was found that the soil which was not added to the hydrogel had lower moisture than the soil which was added to the hydrogel see fig 6 rainfall soil type and rate of evapotranspiration are factors that determine soil moisture where soil moisture will determine the availability of water in the soil for plant growth decreasing the availability of water soil moisture can cause a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis and an increase in the root growth rate this condition can cause the growth of the upper part of the plant to be inhibited and the growth of the root part increases so that the productivity of the plant decreases 3 4 3 the effect of hydrogel on temperature based on the graph obtained the soil temperature indicates that there is no major influence with the addition of hydrogels the temperature before and after additions ranged from 28 c to 29 c according to tyagi and tripathi 1983 the optimal soil temperature for seed germination was 24 2 32 8 c so that based on the graph shown the soil temperature in the test plant met the requirements growing soybean plants optimal germination occurs at 30 c and in good environmental conditions soybean seeds can germinate within 4 days after planting soya pods are formed optimally at temperatures of 26 6 32 c at higher temperatures thus increasing the speed of evapotranspiration and the increase in the process will be higher lamina 1989 according to prasad et al 2006 the average daily temperature was 35 during the reproductive phase can reduce fruit at high or low temperatures and non permanent rainfall greatly affect plant growth high temperature pressure is one of the factors that cause losses to crop harvesting which can cause plant growth and productivity to be uncontrolled decreased plant growth is also strongly influenced by air temperature and high soil temperature 3 5 effect of hydrogel composition on absorbed potassium levels the adding of hydrogels and fertilizers containing nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in soybean plants has sufficient influence on the availability of potassium elements in the test plants based on the results obtained the potassium levels on the first day were relatively low at 11 16 and after addition of hydrogels and fertilizers containing nitrogen phosphorus and potassium potassium levels increased until the 75th day the highest potassium level is a plant with a composition of hydrogel with a ratio of chita225 of 25 25 ppm furthermore in the control plants showed low potassium levels compared with plants with the addition of hydrogels which amounted to 15 53 ppm in addition the control plants also showed poor growth compared to all plants with the addition of fertilizers and hydrogels see fig 8 3 6 effect of composition of hydrogels on soil c organic based on fig 10 the level of c organic in the 75th day test plant showed varied results test plant with the addition of hydrogel chita225 ratio has a value of most major organic c is 2 5 while c organic levels on the first day and on each test plant was 1 6 and 1 7 soils that have undergone decomposition or weathering have higher c organic levels compared to soils that have not experienced decomposition this can be seen in the results of measurement that the organic c th 75 level is higher than the control and th 1 the value of the c organic content is still included in the normal category according to seremesic s 2011 statement that the content of soil c organic according to the soil nutrient criteria is 2 1 3 0 seremesic et al 2011 this proves that the addition of hydrogels has a good influence on the test plant soil see fig 9 3 7 cation exchange capacity fig 10 shows the cation exchange capacity before and after administration of varied hydrogels and fertilizers containing nitrogen phosphorus and potassium control plants have lower cation exchange capacity values compared to plants with the addition of hydrogels the highest cation exchange capacity value was found on the soil with the treatment of chita225 which was equal to 17 22 me 100 g one that affects the value of cation exchange capacity is the humus content of soil and type of clay mineral the value of cation exchange capacity is usually low this condition is often found in mineral soils dry land instead soils have a moderate to high organic matter usually has the relatife cation exchange capacity value f higher than soils low in organic matter 3 8 effect of hydrogel composition on soybean plant height the composition of various variations of the hydrogel concentration had a significant effect on the height of the test plant stem based on fig 12 control soybean plants that were not added to the hydrogel experienced higher plant growth which tended to be slower than the plants added to the hydrogel this can occur because there is no hydrogel on the soil that can absorb excess water so the plants quickly experience water shortages lack of water causes plant growth to tend to be slow the addition of cs edta hydrogel to soybean plants gave a fairly good influence on plant growth the most visible test plant height was cs edta hydrogel chita225 because it had a good increase in stem height of 98 2 cm on the 75th day see fig 11 this is supported by sem analysis and swelling degrees of the chita225 concentration hydrogel hydrogels with the ratio chita210 have thelowest stem height growth compared to polybags with the addition of other hydrogels this is because the soil experiences drought quickly so that the plant roots cannot absorb water for its growth cs edta hydrogel chita210 is not able to hold more water in the tissue which will be released to the ground until the 75th day 3 9 effect of hydrogel composition on the number of plant leaves the graph showed that the addition of hydrogels had an effect on the number of leaves of the test plants in plants with chita225 hydrogel concentration the number of leaves increases and widens on every 5 days of measurement observation of the number of leaves owned by cs edta polybag chita225 on day 60 was 25 strands this means that the addition of hydrogels has an effect on the number and width of the leaves of the test plants the amount is the largest number of leaves because in the days that follow the leaves appear to fall due to days 65 75 entering the harvest period borrmann et al 2009 4 conclusion the results of ftir characterization indicate that the presence of functional groups of chitosan and cross linked chitosan edta which are the main constituent materials of hydrogels while the sem results indicate the presence of hollow clumps on the surface of the hydrogel this difference greatly affects the degree of swelling and the degree of crosslinking of the hydrogels the application of hydrogels in soil did not significantly affect to ph temperature and soil cation exchange capacity while for soil moisture plant height number of leaves c organic and potassium levels hydrogels have a significantly effect the synthesized chitosan edta hydrogel is potentially for soil conditioner and increase the performance of soy bean plant acknowledgement we acknowledge the fiancial support from the drpm ministry of research technology and

hydrogels with the comparison of chita210 this hydrogel has a few lumps that are less hollow tend to be tight the tight shape of the cavity allows this hydrogel to have a low water absorption capacity this is supported by the swelling degree of the comparison hydrogel chita210 with the lowest value among all comparisons gao and wang in 2008 stated that the adsorption capacity was influenced by bulk density and porosity the greater the porosity the greater the absorption capacity and the greater the bulk density the smaller the absorption capacity the presence of uneven granules on the surface of the hydrogel has been identified as crosslinking 3 3 chitosan edta hydrogel test 3 3 1 effect of the composition of the concentration on swelling of chitosan edta hydrogels based on fig 3 the hydrogel with the ratio of chita225 has the highest swelling of all other hydrogel comparisons which is 325 40 this is confirmed by the results of sem the hydrogel has an irregular and clumping surface so that the composition of the chita225 hydrogel has a high degree of swelling this is caused by the presence of an anionic group so that the bonds between molecules are less dense as a result there is more

248 60 the size of swelling hydrogels are influenced by ionic interactions between cross linked groups and the density of cross linked bonds haraguchi and takehisa 2002 qu et al 2000 the degree of chita225 hydrogel is high because it has many cavities and a rough surface so that the water is easily absorbed into the hydrogel conversely the chita210 hydrogel swelling degree has a tight structure so that water is difficult to absorb into the hydrogel however the mechanical properties of the chita210 hydrogel are better the hydrogel structure of the strong and dense chita210 ratio thus decreases the absorption or swelling power of the hydrogel 3 3 2 effect of the composition of the concentration on the crosslinking degree of chitosan edta hydrogels based on fig 4 can be seen that

based on the graphs in figures there is a relationship where the degree of chitosan swelling is inversely proportional to the degree of crosslinking this is also confirmed by the statement of zhou et al in 2011 that the greater the degree of crosslinking of a hydrogel will cause a decrease in the volume of water trapped in the hydrogel polymer network see fig 5 3 4 hydrogel testing 3 4 1 effect of

based on the results of the study the highest percentage of moisture was obtained in the treatment of variations in the composition of the addition of hydrogel chita225 polybag soil samples on a given hydrogel has a percent moisture because based on the swelling ability chita225 hydrogels has the ability of swelling the greatest among all comparisons this is because the presence of hydrogels can hold water contained in the soil so it can control the release of water and maintain soil moisture hüttermann et al 1999 based on fig 7 it was found that the soil which was not added to the hydrogel had lower moisture than the soil which was added to the hydrogel see fig 6 rainfall soil type and rate of evapotranspiration are factors that determine soil moisture where soil moisture will determine the availability of water in the soil for plant growth decreasing the availability of water soil moisture can cause a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis and an increase in the root growth rate this condition can cause the growth of the upper part of the plant to be inhibited and the growth of the root part increases so that the productivity of the plant decreases 3 4 3 the effect of hydrogel on temperature based on the graph obtained the soil temperature indicates that there is no major influence with the addition of hydrogels the temperature before and after additions ranged from 28 c to 29 c according to tyagi and tripathi 1983 the optimal soil temperature for seed germination was 24 2 32 8 c so that based on the graph shown the soil temperature in the test plant met the requirements growing soybean plants optimal germination occurs at 30 c and in good environmental conditions soybean seeds can germinate within 4 days after planting soya pods are formed optimally at temperatures of 26 6 32 c at higher temperatures thus increasing the speed of evapotranspiration and the increase in the process will be higher lamina 1989 according to prasad et al 2006 the average daily temperature was 35 during the reproductive phase can reduce fruit at high or low temperatures and non permanent rainfall greatly affect plant growth high temperature pressure is one of the factors that cause losses to crop harvesting which can cause plant growth and productivity to be uncontrolled decreased plant growth is also strongly influenced by air temperature and high soil temperature 3 5 effect of hydrogel composition on absorbed potassium levels the adding of hydrogels and fertilizers containing nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in soybean plants has sufficient influence on the availability of potassium elements in the test plants based on the results obtained the potassium levels on the first day were relatively low at 11 16 and after addition of hydrogels and fertilizers containing nitrogen phosphorus and potassium potassium levels increased until the 75th day the highest potassium level is a plant with a composition of hydrogel with a ratio of chita225 of 25 25 ppm furthermore in the control plants showed low potassium levels compared with plants with the addition of hydrogels which amounted to 15 53 ppm in addition the control plants also showed poor growth compared to all plants with the addition of fertilizers and hydrogels see fig 8 3 6 effect of composition of hydrogels on soil c organic based on fig 10 the level of c organic in the 75th day test plant showed varied results test plant with the addition of hydrogel chita225 ratio has a value of most major organic c is 2 5 while c organic levels on the first day and on each test plant was 1 6 and 1 7 soils that have undergone decomposition or weathering have higher c organic levels compared to soils that have not experienced decomposition this can be seen in the results of measurement that the organic c th 75 level is higher than the control and th 1 the value of the c organic content is still included in the normal category according to seremesic s 2011 statement that the content of soil c organic according to the soil nutrient criteria is 2 1 3 0 seremesic et al 2011 this proves that the addition of hydrogels has a good influence on the test plant soil see fig 9 3 7 cation exchange capacity fig 10 shows the cation exchange capacity before and after administration of varied hydrogels and fertilizers containing nitrogen phosphorus and potassium control plants have lower cation exchange capacity values compared to plants with the addition of hydrogels the highest cation exchange capacity value was found on the soil with the treatment of chita225 which was equal to 17 22 me 100 g one that affects the value of cation exchange capacity is the humus content of soil and type of clay mineral the value of cation exchange capacity is usually low this condition is often found in mineral soils dry land instead soils have a moderate to high organic matter usually has the relatife cation exchange capacity value f higher than soils low in organic matter 3 8 effect of hydrogel composition on soybean plant height the composition of various variations of the hydrogel concentration had a significant effect on the height of the test plant stem based on fig 12 control soybean plants that were not added to the hydrogel experienced higher plant growth which tended to be slower than the plants added to the hydrogel this can occur because there is no hydrogel on the soil that can absorb excess water so the plants quickly experience water shortages lack of water causes plant growth to tend to be slow the addition of cs edta hydrogel to soybean plants gave a fairly good influence on plant growth the most visible test plant height was cs edta hydrogel chita225 because it had a good increase in stem height of 98 2 cm on the 75th day see fig 11 this is supported by sem analysis and swelling degrees of the chita225 concentration hydrogel hydrogels with the ratio chita210 have thelowest stem height growth compared to polybags with the addition of other hydrogels this is because the soil experiences drought quickly so that the plant roots cannot absorb water for its growth cs edta hydrogel chita210 is not able to hold more water in the tissue which will be released to the ground until the 75th day 3 9 effect of hydrogel composition on the number of plant leaves the graph showed that the addition of hydrogels had an effect on the number of leaves of the test plants in plants with chita225 hydrogel concentration the number of leaves increases and widens on every 5 days of measurement observation of the number of leaves owned by cs edta polybag chita225 on day 60 was 25 strands this means that the addition of hydrogels has an effect on the number and width of the leaves of the test plants the amount is the largest number of leaves because in the days that follow the leaves appear to fall due to days 65 75 entering the harvest period borrmann et al 2009 4 conclusion the results of ftir characterization indicate that the presence of functional groups of chitosan and cross linked chitosan edta which are the main constituent materials of hydrogels while the sem results indicate the presence of hollow clumps on the surface of the hydrogel this difference greatly affects the degree of swelling and the degree of crosslinking of the hydrogels the application of hydrogels in soil did not significantly affect to ph temperature and soil cation exchange capacity while for soil moisture plant height number of leaves c organic and potassium levels hydrogels have a significantly effect the synthesized chitosan edta hydrogel is potentially for soil conditioner and increase the performance of soy bean plant acknowledgement we acknowledge the fiancial support from the drpm ministry of research technology and

12258,due to the need to forecast changes in groundwater systems and environment groundwater modeling has been emerged in this study the groundwater level of the kabodarahang aquifer located in iran hamadan province is simulated by means of three models modflow extreme learning machine elm and wavelet extreme learning machine wa elm at the beginning the groundwater level simulation is carried out by modflow with reasonable accuracy so that the correlation coefficient r 2 and the scatter index si are calculated 0 917 and 0 0004 respectively after that through different input combinations as well as the stepwise selection 10 different models are developed as different lags for the elm and wa elm models based on the numerical results yielded by all three models wa elm is introduced as the superior model in simulating the groundwater level for instance the correlation coefficient r 2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nsc are computed 0 959 and 0 915 respectively according to the uncertainty analysis it is proved that the superior model has an underestimated performance furthermore the by products of the model such as weights and biases are then utilized to develop an explicit method for estimating the groundwater level the developed model can be easily employed by an engineer with sufficient knowledge of matrix operation without prior information about the extreme learning machine it is as accurate as the developed wa elm hybrid model and more precise than elm and modflow keywords groundwater level modflow extreme learning machine wavelet uncertainty analysis 1 introduction groundwater is an important natural resource widely used for meeting domestic industrial and agricultural requirements bashi azghadi et al 2010 according to the koppen climate classification iran is classified into the dessert and dry steppes climate and accessing water has always been one of the most important challenges in the whole country in iran seventy billion cubic meters of water is extracted from groundwater resources for various purposes each year equivalent to two thirds of the country water usage which highlights the crucial role of groundwater resources in meeting water demands of the country furthermore in recent years by increasing population and industrial development on a very rapid pace as well as the modernization of agriculture groundwater resources are gradually declining groundwater resources are stored below the surface of the earth away from direct observation so full understanding of their properties takes a long time for carrying out many exploratory studies which are very time consuming and expensive groundwater models are appropriate tools for continuous quality quantity monitoring of aquifers the simulation of groundwater flow by mathematical models is an indirect approach for solving problems by consuming less cost than direct methods in fact the purpose of the development of mathematical models is to simulate natural conditions of water tables by means of a series of mathematical relations understanding of groundwater resources is improved through the application of mathematical models capable of simulating the dynamics of an aquifer system boyce et al 2015 due to the need to solve the flow equations in groundwater the numerical modeling has been begun in most university research centers and consulting engineers since 30 years ago finite difference models are superior in practical hydrological works because their design and understanding are easier and have less mathematical complexity furthermore several finite difference models with good efficiency have been developed by research organizations such as the us geological survey and the us environmental protection agency one of these models is modflow 3d finite difference model of groundwater flows many researchers used modflow to simulate groundwater levels in various areas dong et al 2012 lachaal et al 2012 ou et al 2013 2016 chen et al 2017 for instance coelho et al 2017 conducted a study based on the field data belonging to an aquifer in a watershed located in vicosa minas gerias brazil to evaluate numerical hydrological models produced using different boundary conditions because the field data did not allow a good definition of the most appropriate boundary condition for simulating the observed field properties in the study area they created three numerical hydrological models in visual modflow and calibrated them using winpest ghb general head boundary river and stream boundary conditions resulted in a calibrated standard root mean square rms were in the range of 7 3 13 02 showing high correlation coefficients in the range of 94 97 the results of their study showed that for all three boundary conditions the normalized rms resulted from calibration was similar to that resulted from validation which confirms its validity in recent years soft computing methods have been used to simulate and estimate various phenomena liu et al 2008 dastorani et al 2010 heddam et al 2012 ghumman et al 2018 ebrahimi and rajaee 2017 by collecting data from two wells situated in the qom plain tried to simulate groundwater level in their study the influence of a wavelet analysis on training of the artificial neural network ann multi linear regression mlr and support vector regression svr methods was evaluated then they compared ann mlr and svr with the wavelet ann wavelet mlr and wavelet svr models in simulating one month ahead of groundwater level they concluded that the decomposition of groundwater level time series into sub time series noticeably enhances training of the models they found that for both wells the meyer and daubechies 5 db5 mother wavelets obtain more accurate results than other wavelets barzegar et al 2017 simulated the maraghe bonab aquifer in order to evaluate the performance of the wavelet group method of the data handling wa gmdh approach and wa elm models as well as combining wavelet based models for modeling groundwater level they employed 367 monthly groundwater level datasets for training and evaluating the model finally they concluded that wavelet based models improve the performance of group method of data handling gmdh and the elm model in simulating groundwater level an increasing number of studies have specifically examined the application of numerical models and soft computing techniques in simulating groundwater level due to simple modeling easy coding and fast computation in simulating complex yet practical fields of science elm has recently gained more attention than other tools the elm models are rarely used probably because they do not significantly improve the accuracy compared to empirical formulae and or few engineers are familiar with the elm models to overcome these problems first we develop an elm model in conjunction with the db2 mother wavelet transform in order to enhance the accuracy of the model exploring the literature demonstrates that no previous studies has been carried out on the groundwater level prediction of the kabodarahang aquifer located in iran hamadan province by utilizing the extreme learning machine elm in conjunction with the wavelet transform wa elm different normalization approaches and mother wavelet families in combination with different inputs produced by the stepwise fit function in the matlab environment are considered to present the optimum model the result of the proposed hybrid method is compared with elm as an artificial intelligence based method and modflow as a physically based technique moreover a wa elm based model is developed to estimate groundwater level by engineers with basic knowledge of matrix operation without sufficient knowledge of elm 2 study area the kabodarahang plain has an area of 3470 square kilometers located in the north of hamadan province this region has a semi arid to dry and cold climate the main source of atmospheric precipitation of this region is the mediterranean and the main source of air humidity and rainfall is provided by western fronts the average precipitation of kabodarahang plain according to the long term statistics 36 years is estimated 281 5 mm year according to the meteorological organization statistics the average temperature at the station is 11 1 c the average minimum and maximum temperatures are recorded 2 9 c and 34 4 c respectively the warmest and coldest months of the year are recorded july and january with 40 c and 32 c respectively the average annual evaporation of this region is estimated to be 1820 mm the employed dataset in this study is related to 25 years monthly samples 301 samples from august1990 to september2015 the geographic location of the study area is illustrated in fig 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 modflow 2000 modflow is a computer program that numerically solves the three dimensional groundwater flow equation for a porous medium by using a finite difference method harbaugh et al 2000 the three dimensional movement of groundwater of constant density through porous earth material may be described by a partial differential equation for many data input quantities modflow 2000 allows definition using parameter values each of them can be applied to data input for many grid cells harbaugh et al 2000 this model is almost a complete model for numerical modeling of a system flow in saturated environments because it has many abilities and subprograms to simulate a groundwater table system as a widely used groundwater flow model modflow provides a set of packages in order to simulate hydrological stresses input and output flows to a groundwater system dong et al 2012 according to different properties these packages can be classified into three categories including point line and area properties the well package wel can simulate a specified recharge or discharge point such as a well the general head boundary package ghb the river package riv and the drain package drn provide line properties of input or output flows to a groundwater system area properties such as precipitation plant transpiration and direct evaporation are modeled using the recharge rch and evapotranspiration et packages dong et al 2012 in order to perform the model in the steady state after establishing the model geometric characteristics and completing all necessary packages a period of relatively stable water levels 1996 1997 is chosen for running the model in the steady state in this case the daily average of the recharge and discharge parameters as well as the average water table level in the chosen period are prepared and imported to the conceptual model in the first step the model manual adjustment of the level and recharge parameters is done in the model and the outputs are compared with the observational levels after that the automatic calibration process is conducted to carry out the auto calibration approach the pest software runs in this study the study area is delineated in modflow 2000 to establish the model of the kabodarahang plain aquifer to this end the geographical area is processed in the gis environment and the resulted file is imported to the model then by choosing an appropriate mesh the geographical area is divided into cells by importing the dem file of the study area the elevations of the surface bottom and thickness of the layer are defined by considering the study objectives the transient flow regime is selected for simulating the hydraulics of the groundwater flow according to the modeling time period 10 years the hydrological stress periods are applied the hydrodynamic coefficients of the aquifer such as the hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficients are interpolated and calibrated based on the values obtained from the pumping tests the agricultural and industrial pumping wells and rivers as well as streams within the study area are applied to the model according to the time steps using the wel and riv packages respectively the recharge coefficient produced by rainfall and runoff as well as return water from agricultural activities in each stress period are estimated using the hec hms model and applied to the modflow groundwater flow model the recharge coefficient is concluded from the hec hms model and corrected through the trial and error process after the first run in the transient state the storage and conductivity parameters as the most effective parameters in the sensitivity analysis are optimized and the model verification performed using the data obtained from 23 wells with acceptable distribution in the study area as the observational data and the difference between calibration heads versus observed heads is obtained in an acceptable range finally in order to obtain the observational values of groundwater level for 120 months the time series values of the baba nazar well located in 35 27 41 n 48 41 58 e are extracted to evaluate fluctuations of groundwater level in this point 3 2 methods and model development first a review on the extreme learning machine elm as a method based on the powerful computational intelligence which has a good performance in complex non linear systems and the discrete wavelet transform dwt as a suitable time series decomposition method is provided then the model is developed and a combination of two wavelet and elm methods called wa elm is presented 3 2 1 extreme learning machine elm elm is a training algorithm for the single layer feed forward neural network slffnn the main idea of the algorithm is based on the concept of slffnn which with h hidden nodes randomly determines values of input weights and biases of the hidden layer according to continuous probability distribution with probability of 1 so that to be able to train n separate samples slffnn is provided as a linear system in which hidden node parameters are determined randomly and network output weights are obtained in an analytic way by means of a generalized inverse of the hidden layer output matrix elm has many advantages such better performance much less modeling time less modeling error and less weights norm compared to conventional neural networks such as artificial neural networks anns in conventional neural networks achieving a good modeling requires adjustment for various parameters such as learning epochs and learning rate while in elm after selecting the type of the activation function only the number of hidden layer neurons needs to be adjusted besides difficulties such as improper learning rate local minima and over fitting existing in gradient based networks are simply addressed by elm in addition training of gradient based networks is possible only for derivative activation functions whereas elm also works well with irreducible functions huang et al 2004 training of elm is conducted quickly and its generalization performance is remarkably high the ability of universal approximation in this method has been proven by huang et al 2006 huang and chen 2007 2008 the structure of the elm network is depicted in fig 2 by considering n optional samples for training the model as x i y i where x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n r n and y i y i 1 y i 2 y i m r m so that xi is a n 1 vector and yi is a m 1 vector by considering the activation function as g x and the number of hidden nodes equal to h the slffnn model is rewritten as follows 1 i 1 h β i g i x j i 1 h β i g i a i x j b i j 1 2 n where ai ai1 ai2 ai3 ain t is the weight vector among hidden and input nodes βi β1 β2 β3 βim t is the weight vector among hidden and output nodes and bi is the threshold of the ith hidden node the matrix form of equation 1 is as follows 2 y i 1 h β i g i x j g β where 3 y y 1 t y l t n m 4 β β 1 t β l t h m 5 g f a 1 x 1 b 1 f a h x 1 b h f a 1 x n b 1 f a h x n b h n h where t is the transport operator β denotes output weights and g is the hidden layer output matrix additionally the structure of the extreme learning machine is illustrated in fig 2 in order to find least squares responses the matrix of output weights is expressed as follows 6 β h y where h is the moore penrose generalized inverse mpgi of the of hidden layer output matrix y moreover for modeling by elm the number of hidden layer neurons and the activation function type should be optimized in this paper the trial and error approach is implemented to determine the number of optimized hidden layer neurons in other words for a model with a fixed number of inputs the number of neurons varies from 1 to 25 the results indicate that increasing the number of hidden layer neurons has no noticeable effect on modeling to this end the number of hidden layer neurons is considered 19 equal to the number of optimized hidden layer neurons furthermore for determining the activation function type five different functions are considered including the sine function sin the radial basis function radbas the triangular basis function tribas the hardlimit function hardlim and the sigmoid function sig which are defined as follows 7 the sine activation function sin g a b x sin w a b 8 the radial basis activation function radbas g a b x exp b x c 2 9 the triangular basis activation function tribas g a b x 1 a x b a x b 0 0 o t h e r w i s e 10 the hardlimit activation function hardlim g a b x 1 i f a x b 0 0 o t h e r w i s e 11 the sigmoid activation function sig g a b x 1 1 exp a b x 3 2 2 wavelet transform wavelet is a transformation tool utilized for decomposition compression and de noising this method is a time independent spectral analysis decomposing time series in the frequency time environment in order to describe the time scale processes and their relations daubechies 1990 similar to the fourier transform the wavelet transform considers time series as a linear combination of multiple base functions one of the main features of the wavelet transform is its ability to achieve time frequency and situation data simultaneously misiti et al 1996 the continuous wavelet transform cwt is able to operate in any scale although calculating the wavelet coefficients in any scale is difficult and requires long computational time and producing a large amount of data in the discrete wavelet transform dwt only one subset of scales and situations are chosen for conducting calculations dwt decomposes a signal to a set of functions cohen and kovacevic 1996 12 ψ i l x 2 i 2 ψ i l 2 i x l where ψ i l x is generated by another wavelet ψ x translated by l and expanded by i the mother wavelet should satisfy the following conditions 13 ψ x d x 0 the dw function of a signal is computed as follows 14 c i l f x ψ i l x d x where 15 f x i l c i l ψ i l x d x where c i l is the signal estimate coefficient form the scaling function ϕ x the mother wavelet is presented as 16 φ x 2 k 0 n φ 2 x n 17 ψ x 2 k 1 n φ 2 x n where k 1 1 n h 0 1 n due to different characteristics of wavelet types various sets of k0 n are considered 3 2 3 proposed wavelet elm wa elm in this study time series are divided into several series using the wavelet analysis and then the decomposed components are used as the em model input the models provided using wa elm are developed through integrating the decomposition ability of series by the wavelet analysis and elm in order to employ the wavelet analysis the matlab wavelet toolbox misiti et al 2004 is utilized the input parameters to the model generated using dwt are in the form of different sub signals including a and d where a represents the approximation of sub series and d represents details fig 3 illustrates the observed ground water level gwl time series of the baba nazar well this time series s is decomposed to three time series i e a1 d1 d2 using the daubechies mother wavelet with two levels of decomposition this s series mother wavelet decomposes the measured gwl into an approximation a2 signal and two detailed sub signals d1 d2 so that s a2 d1 d2 the hybrid model proposed in this study wa elm is shown in fig 4 in order to develop the wa elm model the measured values of the gwl time series in the baba nazar station using different mother wavelets and considering two levels are decomposed into different sub signals including a t d1 t and d2 t by considering different delays each one of them are decomposed into three sub series and employed as inputs of the model to determine the model output gwl t for modeling wa elm first the mother wavelet and the decomposition level should be identified generally the decomposition level for each specific problem is obtained through the trial and error approach but recent studies nourani et al 2014 indicate that this level can be calculated as follows 18 l int log n where l is the decomposition level n is the number of samples and int is the integer part of l in this study the value of the data used for training is n 180 thus the value of the decomposition level is taken into account equal to 2 in fact in order to model gwl t using wl elm despite the number of x delays the number of model inputs is equal to 3 so that each of input series are decomposed into three series including a2 d1 and d2 furthermore for decomposing the gwl series five different families including haar haar daubechies db symlets sym dmeyer dmey and coiflets coif are used in general by considering different types related to each family the total number of wavelets types is 24 it is worth noting that the utilization of the wavelet analysis does not necessarily increase the modeling accuracy and the important point is the proper selection of the mother wavelet in fact if wavelets are combined well with time series they increase modeling accuracy however the determination of the mother wavelet in such way is not simple and may yield ambiguous results hence in this study using the trial and error procedure and considering different combinations the best mother wavelet is detected in addition the selection of the input combination taken from different delays has also a significant impact on the results there is no specific rule for determining effective lags in the gwl estimation so that most performed studies use the autocorrelation function acf and the partial autocorrelation function pacf analysis however using of these two analyzes provides no identification of non linear dependences and choosing effective lag times for time series with the extreme seasonality is not performed well barzegar et al 2017 in this study the input combinations are selected using the stepwise fitting in other words the stepwisefit function is used in the matlab environment this function identifies proper parameters for a linear regression in order to calculate the value of p value this function uses the f test function the p value represents the probability of the effect of a specific input in the modeling the maximum value of p value is 0 05 and if the value is greater than 0 1 the parameter is eliminated silhavy et al 2017 the input combinations chosen by the stepwise selection are provided as different lags in the form of 10 different models as follows model 1 g w l t f g w l t 1 model 2 g w l t f g w l t 1 g w l

values by the numerical models o denotes the average of observed values and n is the number of observed values first different activation functions of the elm model are evaluated and the superior activation function for simulating groundwater level is selected preprocessing the raw input variables through the normalization is necessary prior to the calibration of the neural network model e g elm in this study normalization is an extensively used preprocessing technique scaling datasets into an acceptable range thus observed values are normalized and the best normalization coefficients for modeling groundwater level are selected in the next section different families of the wavelet model are studied and the superior family is introduced as the mother wavelet also in the next sections ten models of elm and wa elm are investigated and the superior models for each of the elm and wa elm models are chosen it should be noted that the artificial intelligence models are analyzed in the test mode 4 2 evaluation of activation functions initially the activation functions are studied for the elm model as discussed the elm model has five activation functions including sigmoid sine hardlimit triangle basis and radial basis in this section all activation functions are evaluated to identify the superior model in table 1 different values of the statistical index for all activation functions of the elm model are listed also the values of groundwater level simulated by the sigmoid sine hardlimit tribas and radbas activation functions are shown in fig 5 for example the values of r rmse and nsc for the sigmoid activation function are calculated 0 751 0 954 and 0 333 respectively furthermore the value of mae for this activation function is estimated 0 626 for the sine function the value of nsc is modeled almost equal to 0 333 however the sine function simulates the values of si and bias equal to 0 0006 and 0 216 respectively it should be noted that the mae bias and nsc statistical indices for the hardlimit activation function are estimated equal to 1 276 0 543 and 6 383 respectively the triangle basis activation function calculates the values of vaf rmse and nsc equal to 15 368 1321 and 0 189 respectively in addition the value of the correlation coefficient for the radial basis activation function is equal to 0 651 also the values of mae mape and nsc for this function are calculated 0 990 0 0005 and 0 189 respectively as shown the sigmoid activation function simulates different values of groundwater level with higher accuracy compared to the other activation functions 4 3 normalization as discussed above the difference between the maximum and minimum groundwater level is very small compared to different values of groundwater thus equation 29 is used to normalize different values of groundwater level generally inputting raw data brings about low speed and accuracy of simulation input data should be normalized to equalize the value of the data and enhance the speed and accuracy of model this prevents from excessive decrease of weights furthermore all data are placed between 0 and 1 through normalization this is beneficial since the output of most of the functions have a threshold between zero and one in this equation x represents normalized values x is the observed value x min is the minimum value x max is the maximum value and a and b are the normalization coefficients 28 x a x x min x max x min b to normalize the values of x between zero and one the groundwater level is simulated for the values of a and b by the sigmoid activation function selected in the previous section the results of the statistical indices as well as the simulated groundwater levels are provided in table 2 and fig 6 according to the normalization results when a 0 6 and b 0 2 the values of r vaf and mae are estimated equal to 0 751 56 090 and 0 626 respectively also for these coefficients the value of the nsc index is calculated equal to 0 333 while if a 0 7 and b 0 1 the values of si bias and nsc are estimated equal to 0 0006 0 111 and 0 203 respectively also the values of the correlation coefficient and the scatter index for the a 1 and b 0 normalization coefficients are equal to 0 719 and 0 0006 respectively for these coefficients the value of the nsc statistical index is also modeled equal to 0 341 in addition for cases that the normalization coefficients are a 0 8 and b 0 the rmse and mape are calculated equal to 0 998 and 0 0003 respectively for the a 2 and b 1 normalization coefficients the values of r mae and nsc are equal to 0 699 0 758 and 0 160 respectively according to the normalization results of groundwater levels the best a and b coefficients are obtained equal to 0 6 and 0 2 respectively additionaly the simulated groundwater level variations and observed values and the scatter plot for selected mother wavelet is depicted in fig 7 thus in the next sections these two coefficients are applied for simulating groundwater level 4 4 mother wavelet selection in this section the different families of the wavelet model are evaluated the wavelet model has five different families including haar db dmey sym and coif the haar family has one member and the db family has ten members while the dmey sym and coif families have one seven and five members respectively the results of the calculated statistical indices for different families of the wavelet are listed in table 3 the analysis of the different families indicates that db2 simulates the values of groundwater level with higher accuracy for this member of the db family the values of r rmse and bias are simulated equal to 0 872 0 828 and 0 143 respectively furthermore the value of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for db2 is calculated equal to 0 671 also the scatter plot and the simulation results of the groundwater levels for db2 are illustrated in fig 2 thus db2 is introduced as the mother wavelet in this study 4 5 selection of best input combination in the following the elm and wa elm models are studied as discussed for each of the elm and wa elm models ten different models are defined for these models the superior activation function which is the sigmoid function is selected also the superior normalization coefficients which are a 0 6 and b 0 2 are considered for the elm and wa elm models also the number of neurons is started from 2 and continues to 20 the number of neurons increases to some of the extent however after that this increasing number of neurons does not have a significant impact on modeling accuracy in this study for all the elm and wa elm models the number of neurons is selected equal to 19 besides for the wa elm models db2 is considered as the mother wavelet the results of all calculated statistical indices are listed in table 4 according to the modeling results among all elm models elm 2 simulates the values of groundwater level with higher accuracy compared to the other elm models for example the value of r for elm 2 is calculated equal to 0 828 while the values of rmse and mae for this model are calculated 0 824 and 0 569 respectively also for elm 2 the values of bias and nash are calculated equal to 0 136 and 0 672 respectively furthermore among all the wa elm models the wa elm2 model has a higher accuracy compared to the other defined models in other words the results of this model have a high correlation with the observed results for example the value of the correlation coefficient for wa elm 2 is calculated equal to 0 959 additionally for this model the values of the si mae and rmsre statistical indices are simulated equal to 0 0002 0 344 and 0 0002 respectively in addition for wa elm 2 the value of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is calculated equal to 0 915 in fig 8 the scatter plots and the simulation results calculated by the elm2 and wa elm2 models are illustrated as shown among all the elm and wa elm models the wa elm 2 model is introduced as the superior model in the following the matrix of the wa elm 2 model is introduced as follows the provided relationship for the wa elm2 model with the best performance among all relationships is expressed as follows 29 g w l t 1 1 exp inw inv bhn t outw where inv inw outw and bhn are the matrix of input variables input weights output weights and bias of hidden neurons respectively the values of this matrix for wa elm 2 are presented in the appendix 4 6 verification of wa elm 2 model in another piezometer the accuracy of the superior model wa elm 2 is surveyed for another piezometer dastjerd well the dastjerd well is located in 35 14 57 n 48 43 11 e additionally the distance between the baba nazar and dastjerd well is about 30 km in fig 9 the scatter plots and the simulated results of the wa elm2 model for the dastjerd well are illustrated for this well the correlation coefficient scatter index and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient are calculated 0 851 0 0004 and 0 862 respectively moreover the rmse and mae for this piezometer are estimated 0 796 and 0 542 respectively as it can be obviously seen the wa elm model has sufficient ability and reasonable accuracy for simulating groundwater level in other piezometers 4 7 comparison of wa elm and modflow results in the following the results of the groundwater level simulated by modflow are studied in table 5 the statistical indices calculated for this model are listed according to the results of the modflow model the values of the correlation coefficient and the scatter index are modeled equal to 0 917 and 0 0004 respectively also the value of rmse for this model is estimated equal to 0 749 it should be noted that the values of mae bias and nsc for the modflow model are calculated 0 716 0 030 and 0 727 respectively in addition the scatter plot for the modflow model is shown in fig 10 furthermore the results of the superior artificial intelligence wa elm 2 model are compared with the modflow results the comparison of the wa elm 2 and modflow models in simulating the groundwater level for the baba nazar well is shown in fig 11 according to the modeling results the wa elm 2 simulates the groundwater level values with higher accuracy compared to the modflow model for example the value of r for the wa elm 2 and modflow is modeled equal to 0 959 and 0 917 respectively also for the wa elm 2 and modflow models the value of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is estimated equal to 0 915 and 0 727 respectively furthermore owing to simple modeling easy coding and quick computation for simulations in complex yet practical issues the extreme learning machine elm has recently gained more attention than other models the elm models are rarely used probably because they do not significantly improve the accuracy compared to the physically based models like modflow and or engineers are not familiar with the elm models to overcome these problems we develop an elm model in conjunction with the db2 mother wavelet transform which markedly improves the accuracy of the groundwater simulation 4 8 uncertainty analysis in this section the uncertainty analysis is conducted for the elm 2 wa elm 2 and modflow models the uncertainty analysis is used to describe the error obtained by numerical models the value of the error calculated by numerical models e j is introduced as the difference between computed values p j and observed values t j e j p j t j in contrast the average of the obtained error is calculated as e j 1 n e j while the value of the standard deviation of calculated error values are defined as s e j 1 n e j e 2 n 1 the negative sign of e indicates the underestimated performance of the numerical model however the positive sign of e indicated the overestimated performance of that model it should be noted that using the parameters e and s e a confidence bound is created by the wilson score method around value predicted from an error without continuity correction in the following using 1 64 s e approximately leads to 95 confidence bound the uncertainty analysis parameters including the mean prediction error the width of uncertainty band and the 95 prediction error interval are listed in table 6 for the elm 2 wa elm 2 and modflow models for example the value of e for the elm 2 model is calculated equal to 0 136 thus the performance of this model is underestimated also the 95 prediction error interval is estimated between 0 112 and 0 160 furthermore the values of e for the wa elm 2 model are equal to 0 093 based on the uncertainty analysis results the wa elm 2 model has an underestimated performance however the 95 prediction error interval for this model is between 0 090 and 0 096 for the modflow model the value of the mean prediction error is also calculated as a negative value thus this model has an underestimated performance in estimating groundwater level 5 conclusion one of the most important issues in water resources management is estimating groundwater level in this paper the groundwater level in kabodarahang hamadan iran was simulated using three models including modflow extreme learning machine elm and wavelet extreme learning machine wa elm initially using the input parameters ten different models were defined for each of elm and wa elm models then the optimized activation function for the elm models was chosen also the best mother wavelet was detected for the wa elm models moreover the results of the elm and wa elm models were examined and the best soft computing model was introduced additionally the best artificial intelligence model wa elm was compared with the modflow model the results of these models showed that the wa elm model simulates groundwater level with higher accuracy for example for the superior model the values of mae and rmsre were obtained equal to 0 344 and 0 0002 respectively in addition a matrix was provided for the superior model to simulate groundwater level furthermore the uncertainty analysis results showed that the wa elm model has an underestimated performance and the 95 prediction error interval for this model was between 0 090 and 0 096 appendix values of matrix for wa elm 2 model the values of the matrix for wa elm 2 are presented as follows 30 i n v g w t t 1 a 2 g w t t 1 d 1 g w t t 1 d 2 g w t t 2 a 2 g w t t 2 d 1 g w t t

12258,due to the need to forecast changes in groundwater systems and environment groundwater modeling has been emerged in this study the groundwater level of the kabodarahang aquifer located in iran hamadan province is simulated by means of three models modflow extreme learning machine elm and wavelet extreme learning machine wa elm at the beginning the groundwater level simulation is carried out by modflow with reasonable accuracy so that the correlation coefficient r 2 and the scatter index si are calculated 0 917 and 0 0004 respectively after that through different input combinations as well as the stepwise selection 10 different models are developed as different lags for the elm and wa elm models based on the numerical results yielded by all three models wa elm is introduced as the superior model in simulating the groundwater level for instance the correlation coefficient r 2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nsc are computed 0 959 and 0 915 respectively according to the uncertainty analysis it is proved that the superior model has an underestimated performance furthermore the by products of the model such as weights and biases are then utilized to develop an explicit method for estimating the groundwater level the developed model can be easily employed by an engineer with sufficient knowledge of matrix operation without prior information about the extreme learning machine it is as accurate as the developed wa elm hybrid model and more precise than elm and modflow keywords groundwater level modflow extreme learning machine wavelet uncertainty analysis 1 introduction groundwater is an important natural resource widely used for meeting domestic industrial and agricultural requirements bashi azghadi et al 2010 according to the koppen climate classification iran is classified into the dessert and dry steppes climate and accessing water has always been one of the most important challenges in the whole country in iran seventy billion cubic meters of water is extracted from groundwater resources for various purposes each year equivalent to two thirds of the country water usage which highlights the crucial role of groundwater resources in meeting water demands of the country furthermore in recent years by increasing population and industrial development on a very rapid pace as well as the modernization of agriculture groundwater resources are gradually declining groundwater resources are stored below the surface of the earth away from direct observation so full understanding of their properties takes a long time for carrying out many exploratory studies which are very time consuming and expensive groundwater models are appropriate tools for continuous quality quantity monitoring of aquifers the simulation of groundwater flow by mathematical models is an indirect approach for solving problems by consuming less cost than direct methods in fact the purpose of the development of mathematical models is to simulate natural conditions of water tables by means of a series of mathematical relations understanding of groundwater resources is improved through the application of mathematical models capable of simulating the dynamics of an aquifer system boyce et al 2015 due to the need to solve the flow equations in groundwater the numerical modeling has been begun in most university research centers and consulting engineers since 30 years ago finite difference models are superior in practical hydrological works because their design and understanding are easier and have less mathematical complexity furthermore several finite difference models with good efficiency have been developed by research organizations such as the us geological survey and the us environmental protection agency one of these models is modflow 3d finite difference model of groundwater flows many researchers used modflow to simulate groundwater levels in various areas dong et al 2012 lachaal et al 2012 ou et al 2013 2016 chen et al 2017 for instance coelho et al 2017 conducted a study based on the field data belonging to an aquifer in a watershed located in vicosa minas gerias brazil to evaluate numerical hydrological models produced using different boundary conditions because the field data did not allow a good definition of the most appropriate boundary condition for simulating the observed field properties in the study area they created three numerical hydrological models in visual modflow and calibrated them using winpest ghb general head boundary river and stream boundary conditions resulted in a calibrated standard root mean square rms were in the range of 7 3 13 02 showing high correlation coefficients in the range of 94 97 the results of their study showed that for all three boundary conditions the normalized rms resulted from calibration was similar to that resulted from validation which confirms its validity in recent years soft computing methods have been used to simulate and estimate various phenomena liu et al 2008 dastorani et al 2010 heddam et al 2012 ghumman et al 2018 ebrahimi and rajaee 2017 by collecting data from two wells situated in the qom plain tried to simulate groundwater level in their study the influence of a wavelet analysis on training of the artificial neural network ann multi linear regression mlr and support vector regression svr methods was evaluated then they compared ann mlr and svr with the wavelet ann wavelet mlr and wavelet svr models in simulating one month ahead of groundwater level they concluded that the decomposition of groundwater level time series into sub time series noticeably enhances training of the models they found that for both wells the meyer and daubechies 5 db5 mother wavelets obtain more accurate results than other wavelets barzegar et al 2017 simulated the maraghe bonab aquifer in order to evaluate the performance of the wavelet group method of the data handling wa gmdh approach and wa elm models as well as combining wavelet based models for modeling groundwater level they employed 367 monthly groundwater level datasets for training and evaluating the model finally they concluded that wavelet based models improve the performance of group method of data handling gmdh and the elm model in simulating groundwater level an increasing number of studies have specifically examined the application of numerical models and soft computing techniques in simulating groundwater level due to simple modeling easy coding and fast computation in simulating complex yet practical fields of science elm has recently gained more attention than other tools the elm models are rarely used probably because they do not significantly improve the accuracy compared to empirical formulae and or few engineers are familiar with the elm models to overcome these problems first we develop an elm model in conjunction with the db2 mother wavelet transform in order to enhance the accuracy of the model exploring the literature demonstrates that no previous studies has been carried out on the groundwater level prediction of the kabodarahang aquifer located in iran hamadan province by utilizing the extreme learning machine elm in conjunction with the wavelet transform wa elm different normalization approaches and mother wavelet families in combination with different inputs produced by the stepwise fit function in the matlab environment are considered to present the optimum model the result of the proposed hybrid method is compared with elm as an artificial intelligence based method and modflow as a physically based technique moreover a wa elm based model is developed to estimate groundwater level by engineers with basic knowledge of matrix operation without sufficient knowledge of elm 2 study area the kabodarahang plain has an area of 3470 square kilometers located in the north of hamadan province this region has a semi arid to dry and cold climate the main source of atmospheric precipitation of this region is the mediterranean and the main source of air humidity and rainfall is provided by western fronts the average precipitation of kabodarahang plain according to the long term statistics 36 years is estimated 281 5 mm year according to the meteorological organization statistics the average temperature at the station is 11 1 c the average minimum and maximum temperatures are recorded 2 9 c and 34 4 c respectively the warmest and coldest months of the year are recorded july and january with 40 c and 32 c respectively the average annual evaporation of this region is estimated to be 1820 mm the employed dataset in this study is related to 25 years monthly samples 301 samples from august1990 to september2015 the geographic location of the study area is illustrated in fig 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 modflow 2000 modflow is a computer program that numerically solves the three dimensional groundwater flow equation for a porous medium by using a finite difference method harbaugh et al 2000 the three dimensional movement of groundwater of constant density through porous earth material may be described by a partial differential equation for many data input quantities modflow 2000 allows definition using parameter values each of them can be applied to data input for many grid cells harbaugh et al 2000 this model is almost a complete model for numerical modeling of a system flow in saturated environments because it has many abilities and subprograms to simulate a groundwater table system as a widely used groundwater flow model modflow provides a set of packages in order to simulate hydrological stresses input and output flows to a groundwater system dong et al 2012 according to different properties these packages can be classified into three categories including point line and area properties the well package wel can simulate a specified recharge or discharge point such as a well the general head boundary package ghb the river package riv and the drain package drn provide line properties of input or output flows to a groundwater system area properties such as precipitation plant transpiration and direct evaporation are modeled using the recharge rch and evapotranspiration et packages dong et al 2012 in order to perform the model in the steady state after establishing the model geometric characteristics and completing all necessary packages a period of relatively stable water levels 1996 1997 is chosen for running the model in the steady state in this case the daily average of the recharge and discharge parameters as well as the average water table level in the chosen period are prepared and imported to the conceptual model in the first step the model manual adjustment of the level and recharge parameters is done in the model and the outputs are compared with the observational levels after that the automatic calibration process is conducted to carry out the auto calibration approach the pest software runs in this study the study area is delineated in modflow 2000 to establish the model of the kabodarahang plain aquifer to this end the geographical area is processed in the gis environment and the resulted file is imported to the model then by choosing an appropriate mesh the geographical area is divided into cells by importing the dem file of the study area the elevations of the surface bottom and thickness of the layer are defined by considering the study objectives the transient flow regime is selected for simulating the hydraulics of the groundwater flow according to the modeling time period 10 years the hydrological stress periods are applied the hydrodynamic coefficients of the aquifer such as the hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficients are interpolated and calibrated based on the values obtained from the pumping tests the agricultural and industrial pumping wells and rivers as well as streams within the study area are applied to the model according to the time steps using the wel and riv packages respectively the recharge coefficient produced by rainfall and runoff as well as return water from agricultural activities in each stress period are estimated using the hec hms model and applied to the modflow groundwater flow model the recharge coefficient is concluded from the hec hms model and corrected through the trial and error process after the first run in the transient state the storage and conductivity parameters as the most effective parameters in the sensitivity analysis are optimized and the model verification performed using the data obtained from 23 wells with acceptable distribution in the study area as the observational data and the difference between calibration heads versus observed heads is obtained in an acceptable range finally in order to obtain the observational values of groundwater level for 120 months the time series values of the baba nazar well located in 35 27 41 n 48 41 58 e are extracted to evaluate fluctuations of groundwater level in this point 3 2 methods and model development first a review on the extreme learning machine elm as a method based on the powerful computational intelligence which has a good performance in complex non linear systems and the discrete wavelet transform dwt as a suitable time series decomposition method is provided then the model is developed and a combination of two wavelet and elm methods called wa elm is presented 3 2 1 extreme learning machine elm elm is a training algorithm for the single layer feed forward neural network slffnn the main idea of the algorithm is based on the concept of slffnn which with h hidden nodes randomly determines values of input weights and biases of the hidden layer according to continuous probability distribution with probability of 1 so that to be able to train n separate samples slffnn is provided as a linear system in which hidden node parameters are determined randomly and network output weights are obtained in an analytic way by means of a generalized inverse of the hidden layer output matrix elm has many advantages such better performance much less modeling time less modeling error and less weights norm compared to conventional neural networks such as artificial neural networks anns in conventional neural networks achieving a good modeling requires adjustment for various parameters such as learning epochs and learning rate while in elm after selecting the type of the activation function only the number of hidden layer neurons needs to be adjusted besides difficulties such as improper learning rate local minima and over fitting existing in gradient based networks are simply addressed by elm in addition training of gradient based networks is possible only for derivative activation functions whereas elm also works well with irreducible functions huang et al 2004 training of elm is conducted quickly and its generalization performance is remarkably high the ability of universal approximation in this method has been proven by huang et al 2006 huang and chen 2007 2008 the structure of the elm network is depicted in fig 2 by considering n optional samples for training the model as x i y i where x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n r n and y i y i 1 y i 2 y i m r m so that xi is a n 1 vector and yi is a m 1 vector by considering the activation function as g x and the number of hidden nodes equal to h the slffnn model is rewritten as follows 1 i 1 h β i g i x j i 1 h β i g i a i x j b i j 1 2 n where ai ai1 ai2 ai3 ain t is the weight vector among hidden and input nodes βi β1 β2 β3 βim t is the weight vector among hidden and output nodes and bi is the threshold of the ith hidden node the matrix form of equation 1 is as follows 2 y i 1 h β i g i x j g β where 3 y y 1 t y l t n m 4 β β 1 t β l t h m 5 g f a 1 x 1 b 1 f a h x 1 b h f a 1 x n b 1 f a h x n b h n h where t is the transport operator β denotes output weights and g is the hidden layer output matrix additionally the structure of the extreme learning machine is illustrated in fig 2 in order to find least squares responses the matrix of output weights is expressed as follows 6 β h y where h is the moore penrose generalized inverse mpgi of the of hidden layer output matrix y moreover for modeling by elm the number of hidden layer neurons and the activation function type should be optimized in this paper the trial and error approach is implemented to determine the number of optimized hidden layer neurons in other words for a model with a fixed number of inputs the number of neurons varies from 1 to 25 the results indicate that increasing the number of hidden layer neurons has no noticeable effect on modeling to this end the number of hidden layer neurons is considered 19 equal to the number of optimized hidden layer neurons furthermore for determining the activation function type five different functions are considered including the sine function sin the radial basis function radbas the triangular basis function tribas the hardlimit function hardlim and the sigmoid function sig which are defined as follows 7 the sine activation function sin g a b x sin w a b 8 the radial basis activation function radbas g a b x exp b x c 2 9 the triangular basis activation function tribas g a b x 1 a x b a x b 0 0 o t h e r w i s e 10 the hardlimit activation function hardlim g a b x 1 i f a x b 0 0 o t h e r w i s e 11 the sigmoid activation function sig g a b x 1 1 exp a b x 3 2 2 wavelet transform wavelet is a transformation tool utilized for decomposition compression and de noising this method is a time independent spectral analysis decomposing time series in the frequency time environment in order to describe the time scale processes and their relations daubechies 1990 similar to the fourier transform the wavelet transform considers time series as a linear combination of multiple base functions one of the main features of the wavelet transform is its ability to achieve time frequency and situation data simultaneously misiti et al 1996 the continuous wavelet transform cwt is able to operate in any scale although calculating the wavelet coefficients in any scale is difficult and requires long computational time and producing a large amount of data in the discrete wavelet transform dwt only one subset of scales and situations are chosen for conducting calculations dwt decomposes a signal to a set of functions cohen and kovacevic 1996 12 ψ i l x 2 i 2 ψ i l 2 i x l where ψ i l x is generated by another wavelet ψ x translated by l and expanded by i the mother wavelet should satisfy the following conditions 13 ψ x d x 0 the dw function of a signal is computed as follows 14 c i l f x ψ i l x d x where 15 f x i l c i l ψ i l x d x where c i l is the signal estimate coefficient form the scaling function ϕ x the mother wavelet is presented as 16 φ x 2 k 0 n φ 2 x n 17 ψ x 2 k 1 n φ 2 x n where k 1 1 n h 0 1 n due to different characteristics of wavelet types various sets of k0 n are considered 3 2 3 proposed wavelet elm wa elm in this study time series are divided into several series using the wavelet analysis and then the decomposed components are used as the em model input the models provided using wa elm are developed through integrating the decomposition ability of series by the wavelet analysis and elm in order to employ the wavelet analysis the matlab wavelet toolbox misiti et al 2004 is utilized the input parameters to the model generated using dwt are in the form of different sub signals including a and d where a represents the approximation of sub series and d represents details fig 3 illustrates the observed ground water level gwl time series of the baba nazar well this time series s is decomposed to three time series i e a1 d1 d2 using the daubechies mother wavelet with two levels of decomposition this s series mother wavelet decomposes the measured gwl into an approximation a2 signal and two detailed sub signals d1 d2 so that s a2 d1 d2 the hybrid model proposed in this study wa elm is shown in fig 4 in order to develop the wa elm model the measured values of the gwl time series in the baba nazar station using different mother wavelets and considering two levels are decomposed into different sub signals including a t d1 t and d2 t by considering different delays each one of them are decomposed into three sub series and employed as inputs of the model to determine the model output gwl t for modeling wa elm first the mother wavelet and the decomposition level should be identified generally the decomposition level for each specific problem is obtained through the trial and error approach but recent studies nourani et al 2014 indicate that this level can be calculated as follows 18 l int log n where l is the decomposition level n is the number of samples and int is the integer part of l in this study the value of the data used for training is n 180 thus the value of the decomposition level is taken into account equal to 2 in fact in order to model gwl t using wl elm despite the number of x delays the number of model inputs is equal to 3 so that each of input series are decomposed into three series including a2 d1 and d2 furthermore for decomposing the gwl series five different families including haar haar daubechies db symlets sym dmeyer dmey and coiflets coif are used in general by considering different types related to each family the total number of wavelets types is 24 it is worth noting that the utilization of the wavelet analysis does not necessarily increase the modeling accuracy and the important point is the proper selection of the mother wavelet in fact if wavelets are combined well with time series they increase modeling accuracy however the determination of the mother wavelet in such way is not simple and may yield ambiguous results hence in this study using the trial and error procedure and considering different combinations the best mother wavelet is detected in addition the selection of the input combination taken from different delays has also a significant impact on the results there is no specific rule for determining effective lags in the gwl estimation so that most performed studies use the autocorrelation function acf and the partial autocorrelation function pacf analysis however using of these two analyzes provides no identification of non linear dependences and choosing effective lag times for time series with the extreme seasonality is not performed well barzegar et al 2017 in this study the input combinations are selected using the stepwise fitting in other words the stepwisefit function is used in the matlab environment this function identifies proper parameters for a linear regression in order to calculate the value of p value this function uses the f test function the p value represents the probability of the effect of a specific input in the modeling the maximum value of p value is 0 05 and if the value is greater than 0 1 the parameter is eliminated silhavy et al 2017 the input combinations chosen by the stepwise selection are provided as different lags in the form of 10 different models as follows model 1 g w l t f g w l t 1 model 2 g w l t f g w l t 1 g w l

activation function for simulating groundwater level is selected preprocessing the raw input variables through the normalization is necessary prior to the calibration of the neural network model e g elm in this study normalization is an extensively used preprocessing technique scaling datasets into an acceptable range thus observed values are normalized and the best normalization coefficients for modeling groundwater level are selected in the next section different families of the wavelet model are studied and the superior family is introduced as the mother wavelet also in the next sections ten models of elm and wa elm are investigated and the superior models for each of the elm and wa elm models are chosen it should be noted that the artificial intelligence models are analyzed in the test mode 4 2 evaluation of activation functions initially the activation functions are studied for the elm model as discussed the elm model has five activation functions including sigmoid sine hardlimit triangle basis and radial basis in this section all activation functions are evaluated to identify the superior model in table 1 different values of the statistical index for all activation functions of the elm model are listed also the values of groundwater level simulated by the sigmoid sine hardlimit tribas and radbas activation functions are shown in fig 5 for example the values of r rmse and nsc for the sigmoid activation function are calculated 0 751 0 954 and 0 333 respectively furthermore the value of mae for this activation function is estimated 0 626 for the sine function the value of nsc is modeled almost equal to 0 333 however the sine function simulates the values of si and bias equal to 0 0006 and 0 216 respectively it should be noted that the mae bias and nsc statistical indices for the hardlimit activation function are estimated equal to 1 276 0 543 and 6 383 respectively the triangle basis activation function calculates the values of vaf rmse and nsc equal to 15 368 1321 and 0 189 respectively in addition the value of the correlation coefficient for the radial basis activation function is equal to 0 651 also the values of mae mape and nsc for this function are calculated 0 990 0 0005 and 0 189 respectively as shown the sigmoid activation function simulates different values of groundwater level with higher accuracy compared to the other activation functions 4 3 normalization as discussed above the difference between the maximum and minimum groundwater level is very small compared to different values of groundwater thus equation 29 is used to normalize different values of groundwater level generally inputting raw data brings about low speed and accuracy of simulation input data should be normalized to equalize the value of the data and enhance the speed and accuracy of model this prevents from excessive decrease of weights furthermore all data are placed between 0 and 1 through normalization this is beneficial since the output of most of the functions have a threshold between zero and one in this equation x represents normalized values x is the observed value x min is the minimum value x max is the maximum value and a and b are the normalization coefficients 28 x a x x min x max x min b to normalize the values of x between zero and one the groundwater level is simulated for the values of a and b by the sigmoid activation function selected in the previous section the results of the statistical indices as well as the simulated groundwater levels are provided in table 2 and fig 6 according to the normalization results when a 0 6 and b 0 2 the values of r vaf and mae are estimated equal to 0 751 56 090 and 0 626 respectively also for these coefficients the value of the nsc index is calculated equal to 0 333 while if a 0 7 and b 0 1 the values of si bias and nsc are estimated equal to 0 0006 0 111 and 0 203 respectively also the values of the correlation coefficient and the scatter index for the a 1 and b 0 normalization coefficients are equal to 0 719 and 0 0006 respectively for these coefficients the value of the nsc statistical index is also modeled equal to 0 341 in addition for cases that the normalization coefficients are a 0 8 and b 0 the rmse and mape are calculated equal to 0 998 and 0 0003 respectively for the a 2 and b 1 normalization coefficients the values of r mae and nsc are equal to 0 699 0 758 and 0 160 respectively according to the normalization results of groundwater levels the best a and b coefficients are obtained equal to 0 6 and 0 2 respectively additionaly the simulated groundwater level variations and observed values and the scatter plot for selected mother wavelet is depicted in fig 7 thus in the next sections these two coefficients are applied for simulating groundwater level 4 4 mother wavelet selection in this section the different families of the wavelet model are evaluated the wavelet model has five different families including haar db dmey sym and coif the haar family has one member and the db family has ten members while the dmey sym and coif families have one seven and five members respectively the results of the calculated statistical indices for different families of the wavelet are listed in table 3 the analysis of the different families indicates that db2 simulates the values of groundwater level with higher accuracy for this member of the db family the values of r rmse and bias are simulated equal to 0 872 0 828 and 0 143 respectively furthermore the value of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for db2 is calculated equal to 0 671 also the scatter plot and the simulation results of the groundwater levels for db2 are illustrated in fig 2 thus db2 is introduced as the mother wavelet in this study 4 5 selection of best input combination in the following the elm and wa elm models are studied as discussed for each of the elm and wa elm models ten different models are defined for these models the superior activation function which is the sigmoid function is selected also the superior normalization coefficients which are a 0 6 and b 0 2 are considered for the elm and wa elm models also the number of neurons is started from 2 and continues to 20 the number of neurons increases to some of the extent however after that this increasing number of neurons does not have a significant impact on modeling accuracy in this study for all the elm and wa elm models the number of neurons is selected equal to 19 besides for the wa elm models db2 is considered as the mother wavelet the results of all calculated statistical indices are listed in table 4 according to the modeling results among all elm models elm 2 simulates the values of groundwater level with higher accuracy compared to the other elm models for example the value of r for elm 2 is calculated equal to 0 828 while the values of rmse and mae for this model are calculated 0 824 and 0 569 respectively also for elm 2 the values of bias and nash are calculated equal to 0 136 and 0 672 respectively furthermore among all the wa elm models the wa elm2 model has a higher accuracy compared to the other defined models in other words the results of this model have a high correlation with the observed results for example the value of the correlation coefficient for wa elm 2 is calculated equal to 0 959 additionally for this model the values of the si mae and rmsre statistical indices are simulated equal to 0 0002 0 344 and 0 0002 respectively in addition for wa elm 2 the value of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is calculated equal to 0 915 in fig 8 the scatter plots and the simulation results calculated by the elm2 and wa elm2 models are illustrated as shown among all the elm and wa elm models the wa elm 2 model is introduced as the superior model in the following the matrix of the wa elm 2 model is introduced as follows the provided relationship for the wa elm2 model with the best performance among all relationships is expressed as follows 29 g w l t 1 1 exp inw inv bhn t outw where inv inw outw and bhn are the matrix of input variables input weights output weights and bias of hidden neurons respectively the values of this matrix for wa elm 2 are presented in the appendix 4 6 verification of wa elm 2 model in another piezometer the accuracy of the superior model wa elm 2 is surveyed for another piezometer dastjerd well the dastjerd well is located in 35 14 57 n 48 43 11 e additionally the distance between the baba nazar and dastjerd well is about 30 km in fig 9 the scatter plots and the simulated results of the wa elm2 model for the dastjerd well are illustrated for this well the correlation coefficient scatter index and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient are calculated 0 851 0 0004 and 0 862 respectively moreover the rmse and mae for this piezometer are estimated 0 796 and 0 542 respectively as it can be obviously seen the wa elm model has sufficient ability and reasonable accuracy for simulating groundwater level in other piezometers 4 7 comparison of wa elm and modflow results in the following the results of the groundwater level simulated by modflow are studied in table 5 the statistical indices calculated for this model are listed according to the results of the modflow model the values of the correlation coefficient and the scatter index are modeled equal to 0 917 and 0 0004 respectively also the value of rmse for this model is estimated equal to 0 749 it should be noted that the values of mae bias and nsc for the modflow model are calculated 0 716 0 030 and 0 727 respectively in addition the scatter plot for the modflow model is shown in fig 10 furthermore the results of the superior artificial intelligence wa elm 2 model are compared with the modflow results the comparison of the wa elm 2 and modflow models in simulating the groundwater level for the baba nazar well is shown in fig 11 according to the modeling results the wa elm 2 simulates the groundwater level values with higher accuracy compared to the modflow model for example the value of r for the wa elm 2 and modflow is modeled equal to 0 959 and 0 917 respectively also for the wa elm 2 and modflow models the value of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is estimated equal to 0 915 and 0 727 respectively furthermore owing to simple modeling easy coding and quick computation for simulations in complex yet practical issues the extreme learning machine elm has recently gained more attention than other models the elm models are rarely used probably because they do not significantly improve the accuracy compared to the physically based models like modflow and or engineers are not familiar with the elm models to overcome these problems we develop an elm model in conjunction with the db2 mother wavelet transform which markedly improves the accuracy of the groundwater simulation 4 8 uncertainty analysis in this section the uncertainty analysis is conducted for the elm 2 wa elm 2 and modflow models the uncertainty analysis is used to describe the error obtained by numerical models the value of the error calculated by numerical models e j is introduced as the difference between computed values p j and observed values t j e j p j t j in contrast the average of the obtained error is calculated as e j 1 n e j while the value of the standard deviation of calculated error values are defined as s e j 1 n e j e 2 n 1 the negative sign of e indicates the underestimated performance of the numerical model however the positive sign of e indicated the overestimated performance of that model it should be noted that using the parameters e and s e a confidence bound is created by the wilson score method around value predicted from an error without continuity correction in the following using 1 64 s e approximately leads to 95 confidence bound the uncertainty analysis parameters including the mean prediction error the width of uncertainty band and the 95 prediction error interval are listed in table 6 for the elm 2 wa elm 2 and modflow models for example the value of e for the elm 2 model is calculated equal to 0 136 thus the performance of this model is underestimated also the 95 prediction error interval is estimated between 0 112 and 0 160 furthermore the values of e for the wa elm 2 model are equal to 0 093 based on the uncertainty analysis results the wa elm 2 model has an underestimated performance however the 95 prediction error interval for this model is between 0 090 and 0 096 for the modflow model the value of the mean prediction error is also calculated as a negative value thus this model has an underestimated performance in estimating groundwater level 5 conclusion one of the most important issues in water resources management is estimating groundwater level in this paper the groundwater level in kabodarahang hamadan iran was simulated using three models including modflow extreme learning machine elm and wavelet extreme learning machine wa elm initially using the input parameters ten different models were defined for each of elm and wa elm models then the optimized activation function for the elm models was chosen also the best mother wavelet was detected for the wa elm models moreover the results of the elm and wa elm models were examined and the best soft computing model was introduced additionally the best artificial intelligence model wa elm was compared with the modflow model the results of these models showed that the wa elm model simulates groundwater level with higher accuracy for example for the superior model the values of mae and rmsre were obtained equal to 0 344 and 0 0002 respectively in addition a matrix was provided for the superior model to simulate groundwater level furthermore the uncertainty analysis results showed that the wa elm model has an underestimated performance and the 95 prediction error interval for this model was between 0 090 and 0 096 appendix values of matrix for wa elm 2 model the values of the matrix for wa elm 2 are presented as follows 30 i n v g w t t 1 a 2 g w t t 1 d 1 g w t t 1 d 2 g w t t 2 a 2 g w t t 2 d 1 g w t t

12259,fluoride fˉ has been renowned as one of the solemn problems in groundwater which causes severe health effects such dental and skeletal fluorosis in human being here we demonstrate pectin biopolymer based binary metal oxide composite which has been efficaciously employed as an adsorbent for fˉ adsorption from water a factorial design method was utilized to assess the quantitative adsorption of fˉ ion by synthesized pectin al fe paf composite from aqueous solution three factors namely adsorbent dose initial fˉ concentration and temperature were explored to study their effect on the adsorption of fˉ these experimental factors and their corresponding levels were as follow viz adsorbent dosage 1 a 5 0 g l initial fluoride concentration 10 b 1000 mg l and temperature of solution 298 c 313 k the experimental adsorption capacity values analyzed by adsorption isotherms and kinetic models were 243 9 and 286 90 mg g respectively and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was found 333 0 mg g thermodynamic investigations illustrated that the adsorption process was feasible spontaneous and exothermic whereas the nature of adsorption process was physisorption together with chemisorption altogether this study scrutinizes the novel synthesis of paf biopolymer composite for the adsorption of fˉ and it also added with factorial design method for the study of quantitative adsorption of fˉ which favors the batch adsorption experiment results however no literature has been reported yet which used the factorial design experiment and utilization of pectin biopolymer with bimetallic oxide entrapped adsorbent for fˉ adsorption graphical abstract image 1 keywords pectin fluoride langmuir adsorption capacity a paf 1 introduction water pollution by fluoride fˉ is a major concern which need to be addressed urgently an increase of fˉ content in both ground as well as surface water due to various natural and anthropogenic activities has a detrimental effect on our ecosystem bhatnagar et al 2011 fluoride ores minerals e g fluorspar cryolite biotite topaz etc and marine environment are the two major natural sources which boosted the fˉ content in the groundwater as well as surface water however the anthropogenic sources e g ceramics glass tile bricks fertilizers and cement industries etc are supposed to be dominant contributor source for increased fˉ content in the water fluorine the strongest oxidizing element is found in air water and soil miretzky et al 2011 though the problem of the fˉ adulteration in groundwater and its effect on developing countries are more yet the developed countries like usa japan new zealand australia and canada are also struggling with the fˉ contamination india and many other asian countries are more prone to fluoride adulteration in water there are 17 states of india which are continuously facing the challenging problem of fˉ contamination in groundwater and the endemic fluorosis has affected about one million people according to who the extreme acceptable limit for fˉ in drinking water is 1 5 mg l while on exceeding the limit it may cause severe skeletal deformation kidney and liver malfunctioning and fluorosis mondal and george 2015 at low levels fˉ has been shown to be effective in the prevention of dental caries however excessive intake of fˉ triggers the metabolic and physiological disturbance viz dental and skeletal fluorosis thyroid disorders liver disease in humans and animals kundu et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to evolve a highly selective and rapid method for the elimination of fluoride the conventional methods for fˉ removal are adsorption ion exchange nanofiltration and ro whereas the adsorption is more favorable method due to its economical maneuver adsorption is accomplished in removing contaminants in trace level and to has increased popularity in water treatment applications owing to its simplicity cost effectiveness efficiency easy operation and lower waste generation meenakshi and viswanathan 2007 ndiaye et al 2005 kameda et al 2017 yang et al 2016 in these days lots of adsorbents have been developed for fluoride removal from the aqueous solutions and with favorable results these include mg al layer double hydroxide nigri et al 2017 activated carbon singh et al 2017 and many metal oxide adsorbents dhillon and kumar 2015a 2015b dhillon et al 2017 nonetheless the utilization of purely metal oxide or nano based adsorbents for fluoride removal have some drawbacks it is difficult to be immobilized alienated and recycled in the removal process several biopolymer based adsorbents have attracted the significant attention of researchers as promising materials for fˉ removals such as chitosan alginic acid cellulose etc many studies have been reported on the adsorption of fˉ using biopolymer based adsorbents in order to remove limitations of use of pure metal oxides like la zr chitosan composite prabhu and meenakshi 2014 al la binary oxyhydroxides in chitosan template prabhu et al 2016 zr iv immobilized cross linked chitosan liu et al 2015 al loaded alginate beads kaygusuz et al 2015 polymeric materials based methods have numerous advantages for instance it is easy to handle quick and furnishes good quality of water rising environmental apprehensions in water treatment have led to increased utilization of organic ligands fixed on solid polymeric supports to recover and remove inorganic pollutant from the water pectin carries several cooh coor and oh functional groups which shows a high affinity towards metals to form stable complex nesic et al 2014 pectin can form rigid gels or insoluble polymer with multivalent cations such as zn2 cu2 pb2 al3 etc which cross link the galacturonic acid chains of pectin therefore pectin has been used for heavy metal removal from aqueous solution but the application of pectin for fˉ adsorption is very rare i e only one reports is available in the literature which shows good results for fluoride removal studies zhu et al zhu et al 2016 synthesized pectin al2o3 zro2 core shell beads with adsorption capacity of 98 07 mg g but the limitation of this work is its tedious synthesis process low adsorption capacity very slow fluoride uptake i e 480 min and additionally the availability of very few studies on adsorption equilibria and kinetics so in order to address these limitations we synthesized pectin incorporated with al and fe by simple coprecipitation method from our cautious literature investigation there is no study reported regarding the in situ synthesis of al and fe mixed oxide in oxygen rich pectin template for fˉ adsorption the synthesized paf biopolymer composite adsorbent is better than previously reported adsorbents of biopolymer based class of bimetalic incorporated polymers because of very high adsorption capacity low adsorbent dose requirement i e 5 g l and higher fˉ adsorption rate 50 min the outstanding adsorption of fˉ can be attributed to its relatively high surface area and hierarchical porous structure more importantly it works even with a very high concentration of fˉ solution i e 1000 mg l here we report the synthesis of pectin al fe adsorbent for the effective fluoride removal study in order to understand the mechanism of fluoride adsorption deep study of adsorption isotherms kinetic models and thermodynamic study has been done the xps and ftir studies support the mechanism of fluoride adsorption governed by isotherms the effect of different parameters has been studied by batch experiment method which affect the adsorption process statistical analysis has been done to decrease the experimental trials and favors the results of batch experiments in a statistical experiment various experimental factors need to be changed simultaneously to obtain maximum information with fewer experimental trials for this it is imperative to plan the process and design an experiment to collect analyze and interpret the data to reach a valid and objective conclusion this work provides an elaborated factorial designing method for adsorption experiment to decrease the experimental trials 2 experimental 2 1 materials and equipment all chemical reagents and solvents were analytical grade and purchased from merck pectin was purchased from the sigma aldrich fe no3 3 9h2o al no3 3 9h2o naoh nacl na2so4 nano3 nahco3 nah2po4 and naf are all analytical reagents the surface area pore size distribution and other surface characteristics were studied by using surface analyzed of quantachrome autosorb iq instrument the surface area of paf before and after fluoride adsorbed was calculated by bet method to analyze the surface morphology of the adsorbent fesem attach with oxford edx was utilized edx helps to understand the elemental composition of the adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorption in order to determine the functionalities of the adsorbent ftir study was done which analyze the change in bond length and the functional groups during the adsorption process the binding energy and concertation of any kind of bonding was determined by xps analysis the crystallinity was examined by using bruker d8 xrd thermogravimetry curves tga were measured using tga 4000 from room temperature to 800 c under an n2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 c min 2 2 synthesis of pectin al fe paf the pectin supported mixed binary metal oxide composite was synthesized by following ways swaina et al 2013 one percent pectin solution made by dissolving 1 g pectin in to 100 ml di water and stirred to obtain homogeneous solution was mixed with 100 ml of 1 m al and the same amount of fe salt solution followed by continuous stirring up to 1 h after that 5 m aqueous nh3 was added slowly to the above solution to obtain mixed binary metal oxide precipitate at pectin template the precipitate was filtered and washed with di water to remove impurities finally the material was dried for 6 h at 60 c and then it was dried in a muffle furnace up to 300 c to remove the volatile gases the removal of volatile gases increases the porosity of the adsorbent finally the adsorbent was ground to obtain fine activated powder form and used for the further studies of adsorption experiments the possible chemical linkage between metals and pectin template of synthesized adsorbent is shown in scheme s1 2 3 adsorption experiments adsorption process depends on many factors like contact time ph adsorbent dose temperature ci and the co ions present in the water to make adsorption of the fˉ and to empathize on to the paf adsorbent adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate to study these factors one by one all parameters were kept constant except one parameter which was under the study the variation of parameters studied was in range of adsorbent dose 1 6 g l contact time 0 60 min ci 10 1000 mg l ph 2 12 temperature 298 308 318 k and 10 mg l of co ion concentration the equilibrium adsorption and kinetics studies were done by using ci and contact time respectively the adsorption isotherms experiments were performed by using 5 g l adsorbent dose ph 6 0 ci ranging from 10 to 1000 mg l and at three different temperatures the kinetic analysis experiments were performed by using 5 g l adsorbent dose ph 6 0 ci of 100 and 1000 mg l and contact time variation was from t 0 60 min to explore the effect of ph on the fˉ adsorption 100 mg l fˉ solution 5 g l dose contact time 50 min and ph ranges from 2 to 12 were taken to study the influence of naturally occurring co existing anions in water such as clˉ no3ˉ so4 2ˉ hco3ˉ and po4 3 ions on fˉ adsorption 100 ml of 100 mg l fˉ solutions with 5 g l adsorbent and 10 mg l of co existing anions were utilized the remaining fˉ concentration was analyzed by ion selective electrode and calculated by using the following eqs 1 3 1 adsorption a ci ce 100 co 2 adsorption capacity qe v ci ce m 3 qt v ci ct m where ci ce ct m v qe and qt are initial fluoride concentration mg l equilibrium fluoride concentration mg l equilibrium fluoride concentration mg l at time t mass of adsorbent g l volume of solution l adsorption capacity at ce mg g and adsorption capacity at ct mg g respectively 2 4 factorial design of experiments the above experimental design examines all factors simultaneously as compared to conventional experimental design which considers all variables one by one ideal conditions are achieved by altering some factors at once and utilizing different levels of factors they are extensively utilized in the experiments which consider many factors where it is compulsory to study the interaction effect of factors on the response a few numbers of the experiment require many factors in 2n factorial design experiment which reduces material time and cost zhang et al 2015 meski et al 2011 factorial design explains the impact of factors and the effect of variation of factors on the other factors 23 factorial design was used to investigate the effect of different factors on fluoride adsorption by paf as shown in table 1 three factors i e ci adsorbent dosage and temperature were varied at two levels 3 results and discussion 3 1 possible mechanism of fluoride adsorption onto pec al fe composite the fˉ adsorption by the paf was controlled by the adsorption mechanism and the appropriate schemes are shown in fig 1 the improved qe of paf adsorbent is primarily owing to the higher availability of functional groups on pectin template additionally the attached metal ion on the pectin template are hard acid so they favor to bind with a hard base most preferably with fˉ the positively charged metal ions were electrostatically attracted with the cooh and coor group of the pectin template and formed o m bond so fluoride adsorption possible might be due to electrostatic interaction shown in fig 1b in addition to this the neutralization of metal ions does not take place which in turn allows entrapping of fluoride from the solution due to the complexation mechanism so complexation reactions also possibly responsible for the adsorption mechanism fig 1c dabrowski et al 2004 the metal exists in form of metal hydroxides so ion exchange might be responsible for the adsorption mechanism fig 1a so overall adsorption of fˉ by paf is possible by ion exchange with a hydroxyl group electrostatically interacted with mn and also complexation with metal ions scheme s2 and m f bond was formed alvarez et al 2015 3 2 adsorption kinetics to investigate the kinetics of fluoride adsorption behaviors onto paf well known kinetic models were utilized the experiments were explored in the time range of 5 60 min at two different ci 100 and 1000 mg l fluoride a onto paf was very high and the fluoride qe was increased with time and moderately increased to the maximum value the fˉ qt and a reached 19 59 and 185 7 mg g 97 95 and 92 85 in the first 30 min for 100 and 1000 mg l respectively and the qt was reached 19 9 and 191 48 mg g at 50 min figs s1 a and b which is indicative of the vacant adsorption sites at the initial stage hence the qe increased with time however the adsorption sites were occupied with fˉ and eventually saturated in the late stage resulting in the low fˉ adsorption and low adsorption equilibrium to further understand the kinetics of fˉ adsorption with varying contact time onto paf adsorbent the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso intraparticle diffusion ipd and elovich raghav and kumar 2018 dhillon et al 2018 xing et al 2017 shi et al 2015 sapna et al 2018 kinetic models were used

2 and kinetic data are tabulated in table 2 kinetic studies carried out at lower and higher ci in order to understand behavior of the kinetics of the process in wide range of fluoride concentration pso kinetic model fitted better in ci 100 mg l while pso figs s2 c and d and pfo figs s2 a and b found equal contribution in higher range of ci 1000 mg l the fluoride adsorption occurs through chemisorption in low concertation range while chemisorption and physisorption responsible at higher concertation although all four kinetic models fitted in the kinetic data but at low range pso model fitted best the r2 value of pso is greater than pfo the qe for pso was found 243 9 mg g the results indicated that the pso model describes fluoride adsorption kinetics and the fluoride adsorption process follows the chemisorption type of mechanism which shows the involvement of valence force between adsorbent and adsorbate generally it is found that the transfer of the adsorbate from the solution to adsorbent follows certain sequential steps i e pore diffusion film or external diffusion surface diffusion and adsorption on the pore surface if the curve did not pass through the origin then it will show the contribution of ipd and surface adsorption to the rate determining step the adsorption kinetic experimental data best fitted to the pso model on going toward the higher concentration fluoride solution all kinetic model equally fitted in the kinetic data this might be due to at higher concentration and higher adsorbent dose more available active sites and larger fluoride ion concentration responsible for higher adsorption by number of ways on the basis r2 analysis the order of best fitted model at 100 mg l concentration pso pfo ipd elovich while at 1000 mg l pso figs s2 c and d pfo figs s2 a and b ipd figs 2 c and d elovich figs 2 a and b 3 3 adsorption isotherms fig s1c exhibits the variation of adsorption capacity and a with varying initial fˉ concentration from 10 to 1000 mg l the ci affects the a of fluoride in an irregular manner the a and qe both show opposite trends to each other the a decreased with increasing ci while the adsorption capacity increased with the increase in ci so further understand the adsorption mechanism different isotherms has been used the adsorption isotherm models play an important role in understanding the type of adsorption between the adsorbent and adsorbate by using different isotherm models viz langmuir parida et al 2011 dhillon et al 2017 freundlich yang et al 2015 temkin liu et al 2013 d r raghav and kumar 2018 dhillon and kumar 2015b models the suitability of the isotherm models was analyzed by the r2 to identify which isotherm is best described the adsorption process langmuir model establishes the relationship between the surface concentration of adsorbate to the number of active sites the aptness of langmuir model approves monolayer adsorption on the homogeneous surface of adsorbent without any interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent langmuir isotherm have four type of linearized forms which are presented in eqs 8 11 and parameters were obtained by plotting ce

from slope and intercept of all four langmuir isotherms at 298 308 and 318 k are given in table s1 the kl values exhibited the proficient binding capacities of fˉ at all the temperatures the values of qm and other langmuir parameters were tabulated in table 3 the qm calculated by langmuir model also compared with similar biopolymer adsorbent and it is given in table 4 which proves that our synthesized adsorbent has superior adsorption capacity the experimental adsorption capacity found 237 27 235 27 and 232 51 mg l while theoretical value 276 85 286 60 273 51 mg g calculated by l4 langmuir isotherm which is almost similar to the experimental values at 298 308 318 k respectively over the range of 10 1000 mg l fluoride concentration the qm value calculated by l1 isotherm was 312 5 333 312 5 mg g at 298 308 318 k respectively among four langmuir isotherms l1 and l2 fitted better in the adsorption data as compared to l3 and l4 so we consider l1 for further considerations the maximum adsorption capacity found at 308 k temperature so in order to compare the isotherms by r2 analysis the values of r2 were considered at 308 k freundlich isotherm presumes the multilayer as well as monolayer adsorption of the heterogeneous surface the adsorption energies decreased exponentially on the completion of the adsorption phenomenon linear eq 12 for freundlich isotherms is 12 freundlich ln qe ln kf 1 n ln ce kf freundlich constant n relates to the relative adsorption capacities and adsorption intensity of the adsorbent respectively the values of n from 1 10 show favorable adsorption the kf and n values were in the range of 2 81 3 91 and 1 29 1 63 respectively values of n indicating favorable adsorption fig 4 a 13 temkin qe ln qm kϵ2 14 d r ln qe ln qm kε2 15 epsilon ε

constant is related to the heat of adsorption and binding constant fig 4c showed temkin isotherm and the value of bt and kt were 0 85 0 43 and 0 36 l g and 56 51 67 02 and 66 15 at 293 298 and 303 k respectively the value of binding constant supports strong interactions between fluoride and paf and also small variation in the heat of adsorption the d r isotherm can be used to determine the adsorption mechanism the d r isotherm was applied at three different temperatures fig 4b and the em value was 2 75 kj mol if e 8 kj mol the adsorption can be explained by physical interaction which means that fˉ ions were attracted to adsorbent via physical interactions the qm calculated by d r model was 179 46 mg g the other parameters of d r isotherm shown in table 5 the results of all four isotherms suggested that the adsorption of fˉ onto paf agreed well with the langmuir as well as freundlich model based on the values of r2 among the four langmuir curves langmuir type i was the best fit and calculated qm was 333 mg g on the basis of r2 analysis the order of best fitted curve was found freundlich temkin d r langmuir so the adsorption of fluoride on to the paf adsorbent favors multilayer type of adsorption mechanism with maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 333 mg g 3 4 effect of temperature and adsorption thermodynamic parameters analysis the adsorption process was significantly affected by temperature fig s3a on increasing temperature there was a decrease in adsorption of fluoride onto paf which could be attributed to the weakening of adsorptive forces the a increases from 98 2 to 98 6 at 100 mg l fˉ concentration at 298 318 k for paf which suggests that the adsorption of fˉ onto paf was an exothermic process zhu et al 2015a b so the temperature was found unfavorable factor for studied paf and f adsorption system the vital thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption process were calculated by using the van t hoff equation rahman and haseen 2014 vital thermodynamic parameters are changed in gibbs energy change δg entropy δs enthalpy δh and calculated from plots of ln kd vs 1 t fig s3b are presented in table 6 the adsorption process of fˉ ion was exothermic in nature due to the negative values of δh the change in δg value between 20 and 0 kj mol indicates for physisorption 20 to 80 kj mol value indicates that physisorption together with chemisorption and 80 to 400 kj mol indicates chemisorption the values of δg 2 2 to 40 8 kj mol for the adsorption of fˉ onto paf were in the range of the physisorption together with chemisorption and confirm the spontaneous nature and feasibility of the adsorption process xue et al 2017 thus the fˉ adsorption process on paf was promising and reasonable at a lower temperature 298 k and the process became inauspicious as the temperature raised generally adsorption exhibit positive δs value but in this study we observed negative values of entropy and the decrease in entropy δs possibly due to the higher degree of adsorption of fluoride on the paf adsorbents from the all thermodynamic data analysis the adsorption process was found exothermic feasible and indicates physisorption together with chemisorption raghav et al 2019a 2019b 3 5 effect of dose the fˉ adsorption was significantly affected by the change in adsorbent dose to study the effect of an adsorbent dose all parameters of the batch experiment were kept constant and amount of adsorbent dose varies from 1 0 to 6 0 g l fig s1d showed that the a and qe steadily increased with increasing the adsorbent dose up to 5 0 g l and then remained constant this might be due to the increase in the mass of adsorbent increased surface and hence the availability of more adsorption sites for fˉ adsorption liu et al 2016 the a and qe 98 57 was observed for the ci of 1000 mg l the adsorption increased from 88 72 to 98 57 and 177 44 197 54 mg g on increasing the adsorbent dose from 1 0 to 6 0 g l 3 6 co ion effect in view of some anions commonly found in actual groundwater it was important to investigate the effect of co existing ions on the fˉ adsorption chloride bicarbonate phosphate sulfate and nitrate are typically present in fˉ contaminated water which may compete with fˉ for active adsorption sites on the adsorbent and influence the adsorption efficient to investigate the effect of co existing anions to fˉ adsorption on paf clˉ no3ˉ so4 2ˉ hco3ˉ and po4 3ˉ ions concentration 10 mg l were added into the fˉ solution with a fixed ci of 100 mg l the order of a for paf was found to be po4 3ˉ 95 45 so4 2ˉ 96 51 hco3 97 26 no3ˉ 98 45 cl 98 7 shown in fig s3c the affinity of ions to the adsorbent was closely related to the z r ratio charge towards radius the z r values of the anions are in the order of po4 3ˉ 3 0 238 so4 2ˉ 2 0 230 fˉ 1 0 133 hco3ˉ 1 0 156 no3ˉ 1 0 179 cl 1 0 181 po4 3 and so4 2 were easy to compete with fˉ to bond with the adsorbents because of the high z r values hco3ˉ lowers the fˉ adsorption capacity owing to the similar ionic radii to fˉ 0 133 nm and it is recommended that hco3ˉ fitted in place of ohˉ ion as well no noticeable effect was found due to the addition of clˉ and no3ˉ this might be owing to the low affinity of these two ions however both anions have larger ionic size about 0 18 nm than that of fˉ 0 133 nm nie et al 2012 yu et al 2013 3 7 desorption and regeneration seven consecutive adsorption desorption cycles were performed to study the desorption and regeneration of the paf adsorbent for each regeneration cycle the standard fluoride concentration of 100 mg l fˉ was used from fig s3d the a of fˉ was found 98 6 92 94 91 16 89 96 88 87 86 37 and 85 25 respectively for seven regeneration cycles the a adsorption remained almost unchanged during regeneration therefore paf adsorbent was suitable for regeneration 3 8 effects of ph and zeta potential the ph of solution significantly affected the fluoride adsorption due to the competition for active sites by ohˉ the investigation of ph was studied in the ph ranging from 2 to 12 and the results were presented in fig 5 a in strong alkaline condition the fˉ adsorption decreased because of the adsorption competition between fˉ ions and ohˉ ions after fˉ adsorption the ph values increased indicating that the ohˉ groups on adsorbent were exchanged with fˉ ions which was further investigated in the adsorption mechanism however the lower fˉ adsorption rate at higher ph condition might be ascribed to the competition between fˉ and ohˉ the final ph values after adsorption were also measured and shown in fig 5a equilibrium ph values increased as compared to initial ph values it might be due to the ligand exchange between ohˉ and fˉ which might release the ohˉ ion in the solution xu et al 2016 by ph drift method and zeta potential measurement the point of zero charge pzc was studied and it was found to be very close i e 6 5 and 6 3 respectively fig 5b moreover zeta potential as surface charge can greatly influence particle stability in suspension through electrostatic repulsion between particles the surface of adsorbent was positively charged when ph was lower than 6 3 so it is also suggested that with the help of the protonation of hydroxyl groups at lower ph values adsorption by electrostatic attraction promoted the adsorption process haldorai and shim 2014 3 10 factorial analysis fluoride adsorption by an adsorbent in a batch system usually depends on several factors factorial design of experiments was executed by practicing with various levels of factors with all possible permutations minitab 14 statistical software was utilized to examine the results of the experimental design to assess the main and interaction effects as well as the statistical parameters and the plots table 7 showed 8 experiments of 23 factorial design for fˉ adsorption study and a matrix was designed according to high and low levels the anova analysis was used to determine the main and interactions effect independent factors the main effect of fluoride adsorption was assigned by p 95 value the p values is the smallest level of significance which is responsible for the rejection of the null hypothesis when p values less than 0 05 then the main and interaction effect of each factor was found statistically significant a 77 612 12 46a 12 9b 7 12c 9 09ab 0 273ac 5 892bce the main effects of factors a b c and the interaction between factors ab ac ba bc ca and cb were determined and shown in figs s 4 7 the effect of a factor explains the change in response generated by the change in the level of factors which is known as the main effect it showed the primary factor of interest in the adsorption experiment fig s5 shows the interaction plots of three factors which shows the mutual effect of temperature on adsorbent dose and ci and confirms that on going from low level 1 to higher level 1 a increases with increase in adsorbent dose and ci with temperature fig s6 shows the interaction plot of adsorbent dose with the temperature and concertation which confirms the a increase with increase in adsorbent dose with both concertation and temperature the mean changes in the a of fˉ due to the change in the levels of each main factor from low to a high level are presented in fig s7 the length of the vertical line related to the statistical significance of a factor the change in response occurred due to change in vertical line when changing the main factor from level 1 to level 1 so fig s7 showed that adsorbent dose and ci have a positive effect increase in a with increase in the factor on fˉ adsorption and the opposite was found true for the temperature the effective interaction effect was significant only when the lines do not run parallel an interaction is effective when the change in factors from low to high levels was dependent on the second factor fig s 4 7 shows the interaction plots and table 8 shows the statistical parameters of main and interaction effect for fˉ adsorption fig s7 shows strong interactional effect between adsorbent dosage and concentration whereas the interaction effect for other factors is not significant ns as shown in table 8 safaand and bhatti 2011 bingol et al 2010 4 characterization of paf and paf f adsorbent 4 1 bet analysis n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were used to investigate changes in the pore structure of paf adsorbents after fˉ adsorption as shown in fig 6a all isotherms are mainly h3 type hysteresis loop which is characteristic for mesoporous structures the surface area pore diameter and total pore volume of adsorbents before and after fˉ adsorption are summarized in table 9 before adsorption the paf showed the largest specific surface area and pore volume of 122 75 m2 g and 4 03 cm3 g respectively for adsorbents large specific surface area and pore volume can expose more crystal boundaries and adsorption active sites which is beneficial to transmission diffusion and adsorption of adsorbate onto the adsorbent therefore it may be one of the reasons for the better adsorption performance of paf after the adsorption of fˉ the specific surface area and pore volume of the adsorbents obviously decreased as shown in table 9 it suggests that the surface physical adsorption and inner pore filling may exist in the fˉ adsorption process 4 2 ftir ftir spectra study was done to illustrate the functional groups attached to the adsorbent fig 6b the peak at 3748 cm 1 was due to the o h stretching bands and the peaks at 1635and 1527 cm 1 resembled coo anti symmetric and stretching vibration respectively the peak at 1060 cm 1 indicated the presence of c o group after fluoride adsorption peaks at 3744 1635 and 1523 cm 1 shifted to 3748 1645 and 1535 cm 1 respectively this shift in the peaks confirmed that oh and coo groups contributed to the adsorption the peaks at 695 and 599 cm 1 shifted to 705 and 605 cm 1 respectively and a new peak seemed at 418 cm 1 after adsorption indicates the presence of fluoride the whole study of ftir shows that there is an interaction between the metal and fluoride ion which further confirm the adsorption of fluoride on paf 4 3 fesem attach with edax and mapping the morphology of pectin fig s8c polymer and adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorbed was investigated with fesem as shown in figs s8 c g paf surface morphology at different magnifications was shown in figs s8 d and e the morphological images indicated that paf was highly nanoporous and microporous in nature after fluoride adsorption the paf morphology significantly changed figs s8 f and g the pore size gets decreased because a large amount of fluoride adsorbed on the paf surface the spherical shape fluoride ion accumulated in the pores which are clearly shown in fig s8f the same result was interpreted by bet analysis the edx images present the main component of paf before and after fluoride adsorption the element present in paf is c o fe al fig s8h and in paf f fig s8i only one extra element found i e fluoride the mapping images further support the main component of adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorbed each component of adsorbent was represented by different color in the edx mapping images figs s8 a and b 4 4 xps to find out the main mechanism of fˉ adsorption onto paf adsorbent xps was applied to determine binding energy b e and surface chemical composition of paf adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorbed from survey spectra of figs s9a new peak was detected around 684 41 ev after fluoride adsorption this new peak is denoted as f1s which is further confirmed by f 1s spectrum fig s10 xps spectrum of c 1s is comprised of three peaks with differentiating binding energy which corresponded to the c c c oh co sharma et al 2018 band fig s11 a1 and 2 the peaks were shifted towards the lower binding energy after fluoride adsorption further the o1s spectrum divided into three peaks assigned as anion oxide o2 hydroxyl bonded to the metal m oh adsorbed water h2o respectively after fluoride adsorption peaks were shifted toward lower binding energy fig s11 b1 and 2 the content of hydroxyl group after the adsorption of fluoride get decreases from 60 39 to 46 14 this indicates that the fluoride exchanges from hydroxyl groups of m oh the area ratio of anion oxide increased from 31 48 to 33 44 after fluoride adsorption indicating that the amount of organic fluoride bonded to the metal r m f formed after adsorption xps spectrum of al 2p is comprised of two peaks with different binding energy which is inferred to be al oh al h2o fig s12 a1 after fˉ adsorption al 2p spectrum shows shifted peaks which might be due to al bonded with fˉ fig s12 a2 the area of the al associated fˉ was obviously larger than that of the ferric associated which may be due to the high molar ratio of aluminum in the adsorbent fig s13 similarly fe 2p xps spectrum shows three peaks after fluoride adsorption they shifted toward lower binding energy fig s12 1and 2 represents the satellite peaks positioned about 710 21 and 723 92 ev which were caused by the charge transfer screening and can be attributed to the presence of fe iii ions after fˉ adsorption the peaks were shifted which may be due to fe f bonding the binding energy of respective elements of paf adsorbent as well as content on the surface before and after fluoride were tabulated in table 10 which further support the fˉ adsorption onto paf these results further confirmed the fluoride bonding with fe and al yang et al 2017 zhu et al 2015a b 4 5 tga the tga method was utilized to explore the thermal behavior of paf the tga curves were noted in a nitrogen atmosphere for the pyrolysis of paf with a heating rate of 10 c min fig s9b the tga analysis of paf showed three degradation steps in first step the thermal degradation observed about 9 70 at 100 200 c owing to the vaporization of moisture lured onto the adsorbent surface second steep degradation occurred at 200 400 c because of the denaturation of the pectin backbone as well as mixed oxyhydroxides with the weight loss percentage of 9 70 the third step degradation was seen at 400 600 c showed the oxidation of metal ions after 600 c no degradation observed and the tga curve was steady which indicated the thermal stability of the paf after this temperature range from the results we can conclude that the synthesized paf were thermostable enough to be used in fˉ adsorption 4 6 xrd figs s9 c and d shows the xrd pattern of pectin and paf before and after fluoride adsorption the xrd pattern analyzes by using the pcpdfwin software the peaks found in paf xrd pattern resembles the peaks of al2o3 and fe2o3 and in paf f xrd pattern the peaks correspond to alf3 fef3 including al2o3 and fe2o3 the peaks correspond to paf pattern matches with jcpdf file no 82 1467 85 0987 correspond to al2o3 and fe2o3 respectively and peaks correspond to paf f pattern matches with jcpdf file no 77 0252 85 0481 corresponds to alf3 fef3 respectively 5 practical implications and cost analysis to explore the practical consequences of our research the paf was utilized for the treatment of the groundwater with a high fˉ content of banasthali village which has triggered critical adverse effect on the health of local people the features of the underground water samples are shown in table 11 investigating the complication of substances and high concentration of fˉ 10 mg l in the water sample the residual fˉ concentration reduced with improving the adsorbent dose the fˉ concentration in the water sample decreased from 10 mg l to about 1 27 mg l at an adsorbent dose of 5 g l which comes under the permissible limit suggested by who 1 5 mg l this application implied that the adsorbents were able to be used in the practical treatment of drinking water the crucial aspect for the selection of adsorbent used in the industry is their cost the paf was prepared by using ar grade chemicals presently the cost of paf adsorbent is around us 30 79 per kg in the lab but the cost of fluoride removal on paf is rationally good compared with other traditional adsorbents table s2 additionally in future for the fruitful application industrial grade raw materials will take place the ar grade chemicals for the large scale preparation of adsorbent which will low down the cost of adsorbent and increases their application substantially velazquez jimenez et al 2014 ku and chiou 2002 tovar gomez et al 2013 atasoy and sahin 2014 raghav and kumar 2019 6 conclusion the synthesized paf adsorbent was used for fˉ adsorption the factorial design analysis showed that on increasing the temperature decrease in the fˉ adsorption occurred which was also illustrated by van t hoff plot where the increase of adsorbent dosage increases adsorption of fluoride the main effect results showed that the three factors have a marked effect on fˉ adsorption with a 95 confidence level the interaction effects revealed that the interaction between the dose and concentration had the most significant effect on the adsorption of fˉ the effects of ph contact time ci co ions regeneration cycle have also been inspected for the fluoride adsorption experiment in the kinetic model study it was found that pso kinetic models best fitted which implies chemisorption nature of adsorption the adsorption isotherm data fitted well with freundlich isotherm with high r2 i e 0 98 which reveals multilayer adsorption of fluoride the qm and qe for fˉ adsorption was found 243 9 and 333 mg g respectively the thermodynamic parameters revealed that the adsorption process was feasible exothermic and spontaneous competing financial interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests acknowledgment we gratefully

12259,fluoride fˉ has been renowned as one of the solemn problems in groundwater which causes severe health effects such dental and skeletal fluorosis in human being here we demonstrate pectin biopolymer based binary metal oxide composite which has been efficaciously employed as an adsorbent for fˉ adsorption from water a factorial design method was utilized to assess the quantitative adsorption of fˉ ion by synthesized pectin al fe paf composite from aqueous solution three factors namely adsorbent dose initial fˉ concentration and temperature were explored to study their effect on the adsorption of fˉ these experimental factors and their corresponding levels were as follow viz adsorbent dosage 1 a 5 0 g l initial fluoride concentration 10 b 1000 mg l and temperature of solution 298 c 313 k the experimental adsorption capacity values analyzed by adsorption isotherms and kinetic models were 243 9 and 286 90 mg g respectively and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was found 333 0 mg g thermodynamic investigations illustrated that the adsorption process was feasible spontaneous and exothermic whereas the nature of adsorption process was physisorption together with chemisorption altogether this study scrutinizes the novel synthesis of paf biopolymer composite for the adsorption of fˉ and it also added with factorial design method for the study of quantitative adsorption of fˉ which favors the batch adsorption experiment results however no literature has been reported yet which used the factorial design experiment and utilization of pectin biopolymer with bimetallic oxide entrapped adsorbent for fˉ adsorption graphical abstract image 1 keywords pectin fluoride langmuir adsorption capacity a paf 1 introduction water pollution by fluoride fˉ is a major concern which need to be addressed urgently an increase of fˉ content in both ground as well as surface water due to various natural and anthropogenic activities has a detrimental effect on our ecosystem bhatnagar et al 2011 fluoride ores minerals e g fluorspar cryolite biotite topaz etc and marine environment are the two major natural sources which boosted the fˉ content in the groundwater as well as surface water however the anthropogenic sources e g ceramics glass tile bricks fertilizers and cement industries etc are supposed to be dominant contributor source for increased fˉ content in the water fluorine the strongest oxidizing element is found in air water and soil miretzky et al 2011 though the problem of the fˉ adulteration in groundwater and its effect on developing countries are more yet the developed countries like usa japan new zealand australia and canada are also struggling with the fˉ contamination india and many other asian countries are more prone to fluoride adulteration in water there are 17 states of india which are continuously facing the challenging problem of fˉ contamination in groundwater and the endemic fluorosis has affected about one million people according to who the extreme acceptable limit for fˉ in drinking water is 1 5 mg l while on exceeding the limit it may cause severe skeletal deformation kidney and liver malfunctioning and fluorosis mondal and george 2015 at low levels fˉ has been shown to be effective in the prevention of dental caries however excessive intake of fˉ triggers the metabolic and physiological disturbance viz dental and skeletal fluorosis thyroid disorders liver disease in humans and animals kundu et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to evolve a highly selective and rapid method for the elimination of fluoride the conventional methods for fˉ removal are adsorption ion exchange nanofiltration and ro whereas the adsorption is more favorable method due to its economical maneuver adsorption is accomplished in removing contaminants in trace level and to has increased popularity in water treatment applications owing to its simplicity cost effectiveness efficiency easy operation and lower waste generation meenakshi and viswanathan 2007 ndiaye et al 2005 kameda et al 2017 yang et al 2016 in these days lots of adsorbents have been developed for fluoride removal from the aqueous solutions and with favorable results these include mg al layer double hydroxide nigri et al 2017 activated carbon singh et al 2017 and many metal oxide adsorbents dhillon and kumar 2015a 2015b dhillon et al 2017 nonetheless the utilization of purely metal oxide or nano based adsorbents for fluoride removal have some drawbacks it is difficult to be immobilized alienated and recycled in the removal process several biopolymer based adsorbents have attracted the significant attention of researchers as promising materials for fˉ removals such as chitosan alginic acid cellulose etc many studies have been reported on the adsorption of fˉ using biopolymer based adsorbents in order to remove limitations of use of pure metal oxides like la zr chitosan composite prabhu and meenakshi 2014 al la binary oxyhydroxides in chitosan template prabhu et al 2016 zr iv immobilized cross linked chitosan liu et al 2015 al loaded alginate beads kaygusuz et al 2015 polymeric materials based methods have numerous advantages for instance it is easy to handle quick and furnishes good quality of water rising environmental apprehensions in water treatment have led to increased utilization of organic ligands fixed on solid polymeric supports to recover and remove inorganic pollutant from the water pectin carries several cooh coor and oh functional groups which shows a high affinity towards metals to form stable complex nesic et al 2014 pectin can form rigid gels or insoluble polymer with multivalent cations such as zn2 cu2 pb2 al3 etc which cross link the galacturonic acid chains of pectin therefore pectin has been used for heavy metal removal from aqueous solution but the application of pectin for fˉ adsorption is very rare i e only one reports is available in the literature which shows good results for fluoride removal studies zhu et al zhu et al 2016 synthesized pectin al2o3 zro2 core shell beads with adsorption capacity of 98 07 mg g but the limitation of this work is its tedious synthesis process low adsorption capacity very slow fluoride uptake i e 480 min and additionally the availability of very few studies on adsorption equilibria and kinetics so in order to address these limitations we synthesized pectin incorporated with al and fe by simple coprecipitation method from our cautious literature investigation there is no study reported regarding the in situ synthesis of al and fe mixed oxide in oxygen rich pectin template for fˉ adsorption the synthesized paf biopolymer composite adsorbent is better than previously reported adsorbents of biopolymer based class of bimetalic incorporated polymers because of very high adsorption capacity low adsorbent dose requirement i e 5 g l and higher fˉ adsorption rate 50 min the outstanding adsorption of fˉ can be attributed to its relatively high surface area and hierarchical porous structure more importantly it works even with a very high concentration of fˉ solution i e 1000 mg l here we report the synthesis of pectin al fe adsorbent for the effective fluoride removal study in order to understand the mechanism of fluoride adsorption deep study of adsorption isotherms kinetic models and thermodynamic study has been done the xps and ftir studies support the mechanism of fluoride adsorption governed by isotherms the effect of different parameters has been studied by batch experiment method which affect the adsorption process statistical analysis has been done to decrease the experimental trials and favors the results of batch experiments in a statistical experiment various experimental factors need to be changed simultaneously to obtain maximum information with fewer experimental trials for this it is imperative to plan the process and design an experiment to collect analyze and interpret the data to reach a valid and objective conclusion this work provides an elaborated factorial designing method for adsorption experiment to decrease the experimental trials 2 experimental 2 1 materials and equipment all chemical reagents and solvents were analytical grade and purchased from merck pectin was purchased from the sigma aldrich fe no3 3 9h2o al no3 3 9h2o naoh nacl na2so4 nano3 nahco3 nah2po4 and naf are all analytical reagents the surface area pore size distribution and other surface characteristics were studied by using surface analyzed of quantachrome autosorb iq instrument the surface area of paf before and after fluoride adsorbed was calculated by bet method to analyze the surface morphology of the adsorbent fesem attach with oxford edx was utilized edx helps to understand the elemental composition of the adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorption in order to determine the functionalities of the adsorbent ftir study was done which analyze the change in bond length and the functional groups during the adsorption process the binding energy and concertation of any kind of bonding was determined by xps analysis the crystallinity was examined by using bruker d8 xrd thermogravimetry curves tga were measured using tga 4000 from room temperature to 800 c under an n2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 c min 2 2 synthesis of pectin al fe paf the pectin supported mixed binary metal oxide composite was synthesized by following ways swaina et al 2013 one percent pectin solution made by dissolving 1 g pectin in to 100 ml di water and stirred to obtain homogeneous solution was mixed with 100 ml of 1 m al and the same amount of fe salt solution followed by continuous stirring up to 1 h after that 5 m aqueous nh3 was added slowly to the above solution to obtain mixed binary metal oxide precipitate at pectin template the precipitate was filtered and washed with di water to remove impurities finally the material was dried for 6 h at 60 c and then it was dried in a muffle furnace up to 300 c to remove the volatile gases the removal of volatile gases increases the porosity of the adsorbent finally the adsorbent was ground to obtain fine activated powder form and used for the further studies of adsorption experiments the possible chemical linkage between metals and pectin template of synthesized adsorbent is shown in scheme s1 2 3 adsorption experiments adsorption process depends on many factors like contact time ph adsorbent dose temperature ci and the co ions present in the water to make adsorption of the fˉ and to empathize on to the paf adsorbent adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate to study these factors one by one all parameters were kept constant except one parameter which was under the study the variation of parameters studied was in range of adsorbent dose 1 6 g l contact time 0 60 min ci 10 1000 mg l ph 2 12 temperature 298 308 318 k and 10 mg l of co ion concentration the equilibrium adsorption and kinetics studies were done by using ci and contact time respectively the adsorption isotherms experiments were performed by using 5 g l adsorbent dose ph 6 0 ci ranging from 10 to 1000 mg l and at three different temperatures the kinetic analysis experiments were performed by using 5 g l adsorbent dose ph 6 0 ci of 100 and 1000 mg l and contact time variation was from t 0 60 min to explore the effect of ph on the fˉ adsorption 100 mg l fˉ solution 5 g l dose contact time 50 min and ph ranges from 2 to 12 were taken to study the influence of naturally occurring co existing anions in water such as clˉ no3ˉ so4 2ˉ hco3ˉ and po4 3 ions on fˉ adsorption 100 ml of 100 mg l fˉ solutions with 5 g l adsorbent and 10 mg l of co existing anions were utilized the remaining fˉ concentration was analyzed by ion selective electrode and calculated by using the following eqs 1 3 1 adsorption a ci ce 100 co 2 adsorption capacity qe v ci ce m 3 qt v ci ct m where ci ce ct m v qe and qt are initial fluoride

all variables one by one ideal conditions are achieved by altering some factors at once and utilizing different levels of factors they are extensively utilized in the experiments which consider many factors where it is compulsory to study the interaction effect of factors on the response a few numbers of the experiment require many factors in 2n factorial design experiment which reduces material time and cost zhang et al 2015 meski et al 2011 factorial design explains the impact of factors and the effect of variation of factors on the other factors 23 factorial design was used to investigate the effect of different factors on fluoride adsorption by paf as shown in table 1 three factors i e ci adsorbent dosage and temperature were varied at two levels 3 results and discussion 3 1 possible mechanism of fluoride adsorption onto pec al fe composite the fˉ adsorption by the paf was controlled by the adsorption mechanism and the appropriate schemes are shown in fig 1 the improved qe of paf adsorbent is primarily owing to the higher availability of functional groups on pectin template additionally the attached metal ion on the pectin template are hard acid so they favor to bind with a hard base most preferably with fˉ the positively charged metal ions were electrostatically attracted with the cooh and coor group of the pectin template and formed o m bond so fluoride adsorption possible might be due to electrostatic interaction shown in fig 1b in addition to this the neutralization of metal ions does not take place which in turn allows entrapping of fluoride from the solution due to the complexation mechanism so complexation reactions also possibly responsible for the adsorption mechanism fig 1c dabrowski et al 2004 the metal exists in form of metal hydroxides so ion exchange might be responsible for the adsorption mechanism fig 1a so overall adsorption of fˉ by paf is possible by ion exchange with a hydroxyl group electrostatically interacted with mn and also complexation with metal ions scheme s2 and m f bond was formed alvarez et al 2015 3 2 adsorption kinetics to investigate the kinetics of fluoride adsorption behaviors onto paf well known kinetic models were utilized the experiments were explored in the time range of 5 60 min at two different ci 100 and 1000 mg l fluoride a onto paf was very high and the fluoride qe was increased with time and moderately increased to the maximum value the fˉ qt and a reached 19 59 and 185 7 mg g 97 95 and 92 85 in the first 30 min for 100 and 1000 mg l respectively and the qt was reached 19 9 and 191 48 mg g at 50 min figs s1 a and b which is indicative of the vacant adsorption sites at the initial stage hence the qe increased with time however the adsorption sites were occupied with fˉ and eventually saturated in the late stage resulting in the low fˉ adsorption and low adsorption equilibrium to further understand the kinetics of fˉ adsorption with varying contact time onto paf adsorbent the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso intraparticle diffusion ipd and elovich raghav and kumar 2018 dhillon et al 2018 xing et al 2017 shi et al 2015 sapna et al 2018 kinetic models were used to simulate adsorption kinetics by using eqs 4 7 4 pfo ln qe qt ln qe k1 t 5 pso t qt 1 k2 qe 2 t qe 6 ipd qt ki t xi 7 elovich qt 1 β ln α β t 1 β ln t the simulated results are given in figs s2 and 2 and kinetic data are tabulated in table 2 kinetic studies carried out at lower and higher ci in order to understand behavior of the kinetics of the process in wide range of fluoride concentration pso kinetic model fitted better in ci 100 mg l while pso figs s2 c and d and pfo figs s2 a and b found equal contribution in higher range of ci 1000 mg l the fluoride adsorption occurs through chemisorption in low concertation range while chemisorption and physisorption responsible at higher concertation although all four kinetic models fitted in the kinetic data but at low range pso model fitted best the r2 value of pso is greater than pfo the qe for pso was found 243 9 mg g the results indicated that the pso model describes fluoride adsorption kinetics and the fluoride adsorption process follows the chemisorption type of mechanism which shows the involvement of valence force between adsorbent and adsorbate generally it is found that the transfer of the adsorbate from the solution to adsorbent follows certain sequential steps i e pore diffusion film or external diffusion surface diffusion and adsorption on the pore surface if the curve did not pass through the origin then it will show the contribution of ipd and surface adsorption to the rate determining step the adsorption kinetic experimental data best fitted to the pso model on going toward the higher concentration fluoride solution all kinetic model equally fitted in the kinetic data this might be due to at higher concentration and higher adsorbent dose more available active sites and larger fluoride ion concentration responsible for higher adsorption by number of ways on the basis r2 analysis the order of best fitted model at 100 mg l concentration pso pfo ipd elovich while at 1000 mg l pso figs s2 c and d pfo figs s2 a and b ipd figs 2 c and d elovich figs 2 a and b 3 3 adsorption isotherms fig s1c exhibits the variation of adsorption capacity and a with varying initial fˉ concentration from 10 to 1000 mg l the ci affects the a of fluoride in an irregular manner the a and qe both show opposite trends to each other the a decreased with increasing ci while the adsorption capacity increased with the increase in ci so further understand the adsorption mechanism different isotherms has been used the adsorption isotherm models play an important role in understanding the type of adsorption between the adsorbent and adsorbate by using different isotherm models viz langmuir parida et al 2011 dhillon et al 2017 freundlich yang et al 2015 temkin liu et al 2013 d r raghav and kumar 2018 dhillon and kumar 2015b models the suitability of the isotherm models was analyzed by the r2 to identify which isotherm is best described the adsorption process langmuir model establishes the relationship between the surface concentration of adsorbate to the number of active sites the aptness of langmuir model approves monolayer adsorption on the homogeneous surface of adsorbent without any interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent langmuir isotherm have four type of linearized forms which are presented in eqs 8 11 and parameters were obtained by plotting ce qe vs ce fig 3 a 1 ce vs 1 qe fig 3b qe vs qe ce fig 3c and qe ce vs qe fig 3d kumar and tamilarasan 2013 8 langmuir l1 ce qe 1 qm kl ce qm 9 l2 1 qe 1 qm kl ce 1 qm 10 l3 qe qm qe kl ce 11 l4 qe ce kl qm kl qe qm is maximum monolayer adsorption capacity mg g of adsorbent and kl l mg is related to the binding energy of fˉ onto the active sites of adsorbent the values of qm and kl were calculated from slope and intercept of all four langmuir isotherms at 298 308 and 318 k are given in table s1 the kl values exhibited the proficient binding capacities of fˉ at all the temperatures the values of qm and other langmuir parameters were tabulated in table 3 the qm calculated by langmuir model also compared with similar biopolymer adsorbent and it is given in table 4 which proves that our synthesized adsorbent has superior adsorption capacity the experimental adsorption capacity found 237 27 235 27 and 232 51 mg l while theoretical value 276 85 286 60 273 51 mg g calculated by l4 langmuir isotherm which is almost similar to the experimental values at 298 308 318 k respectively over the range of 10 1000 mg l fluoride concentration the qm value calculated by l1 isotherm was 312 5 333 312 5 mg g at 298 308 318 k respectively among four langmuir isotherms l1 and l2 fitted better in the adsorption data as compared to l3 and l4 so we consider l1 for further considerations the maximum adsorption capacity found at 308 k temperature so in order to compare the isotherms by r2 analysis the values of r2 were considered at 308 k freundlich isotherm presumes the multilayer as well as monolayer adsorption of the heterogeneous surface the adsorption energies decreased exponentially on the completion of the adsorption phenomenon linear eq 12 for freundlich isotherms is 12 freundlich ln qe ln kf 1 n ln ce kf freundlich constant n relates to the relative adsorption capacities and adsorption intensity of the adsorbent respectively the values of n from 1 10 show favorable adsorption the kf and n values were in the range of 2 81 3 91 and 1 29 1 63 respectively values of n indicating favorable adsorption fig 4 a 13 temkin qe ln qm kϵ2 14 d r ln qe ln qm kε2 15 epsilon ε r t 1 1 ce 16 mean free energy em 1 2k linear eqs 13 16 for temkin and d r isotherm models are temkin isotherm explains the interaction between adsorbent and adsorbate in this isotherm bt and kt constant is related to the heat of adsorption and binding constant fig 4c showed temkin isotherm and the value of bt and kt were 0 85 0 43 and 0 36 l g and 56 51 67 02 and 66 15 at 293 298 and 303 k respectively the value of binding constant supports strong interactions between fluoride and paf and also small variation in the heat of adsorption the d r isotherm can be used to determine the adsorption mechanism the d r isotherm was applied at three different temperatures fig 4b and the em value was 2 75 kj mol if e 8 kj mol the adsorption can be explained by physical interaction which means that fˉ ions were attracted to adsorbent via physical interactions the qm calculated by d r model was 179 46 mg g the other parameters of d r isotherm shown in table 5 the results of all four isotherms suggested that the adsorption of fˉ onto paf agreed well with the langmuir as well as freundlich model based on the values of r2 among the four langmuir curves langmuir type i was the best fit and calculated qm was 333 mg g on the basis of r2 analysis the order of best fitted curve was found freundlich temkin d r langmuir so the adsorption of fluoride on to the paf adsorbent favors multilayer type of adsorption mechanism with maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 333 mg g 3 4 effect of temperature and adsorption thermodynamic parameters analysis the adsorption process was significantly affected by temperature fig s3a on increasing temperature there was a decrease in adsorption of fluoride onto paf which could be attributed to the weakening of adsorptive forces the a increases from 98 2 to 98 6 at 100 mg l fˉ concentration at 298 318 k for paf which suggests that the adsorption of fˉ onto paf was an exothermic process zhu et al 2015a b so the temperature was found unfavorable factor for studied paf and f adsorption system the vital thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption process were calculated by using the van t hoff equation rahman and haseen 2014 vital thermodynamic parameters are changed in gibbs energy change δg entropy δs enthalpy δh and calculated from plots of ln kd vs 1 t fig s3b are presented in table 6 the adsorption process of fˉ ion was exothermic in nature due to the negative values of δh the change in δg value between 20 and 0 kj mol indicates for physisorption 20 to 80 kj mol value indicates that physisorption together with chemisorption and 80 to 400 kj mol indicates chemisorption the values of δg 2 2 to 40 8 kj mol for the adsorption of fˉ onto paf were in the range of the physisorption together with chemisorption and confirm the spontaneous nature and feasibility of the adsorption process xue et al 2017 thus the fˉ adsorption process on paf was promising and reasonable at a lower temperature 298 k and the process became inauspicious as the temperature raised generally adsorption exhibit positive δs value but in this study we observed negative values of entropy and the decrease in entropy δs possibly due to the higher degree of adsorption of fluoride on the paf adsorbents from the all thermodynamic data analysis the adsorption process was found exothermic feasible and indicates physisorption together with chemisorption raghav et al 2019a 2019b 3 5 effect of dose the fˉ adsorption was significantly affected by the change in adsorbent dose to study the effect of an adsorbent dose all parameters of the batch experiment were kept constant and amount of adsorbent dose varies from 1 0 to 6 0 g l fig s1d showed that the a and qe steadily increased with increasing the adsorbent dose up to 5 0 g l and then remained constant this might be due to the increase in the mass of adsorbent increased surface and hence the availability of more adsorption sites for fˉ adsorption liu et al 2016 the a and qe 98 57 was observed for the ci of 1000 mg l the adsorption increased from 88 72 to 98 57 and 177 44 197 54 mg g on increasing the adsorbent dose from 1 0 to 6 0 g l 3 6 co ion effect in view of some anions commonly found in actual groundwater it was important to investigate the effect of co existing ions on the fˉ adsorption chloride bicarbonate phosphate sulfate and nitrate are typically present in fˉ contaminated water which may compete with fˉ for active adsorption sites on the adsorbent and influence the adsorption efficient to investigate the effect of co existing anions to fˉ adsorption on paf clˉ no3ˉ so4 2ˉ hco3ˉ and po4 3ˉ ions concentration 10 mg l were added into the fˉ solution with a fixed ci of 100 mg l the order of a for paf was found to be po4 3ˉ 95 45 so4 2ˉ 96 51 hco3 97 26 no3ˉ 98 45 cl 98 7 shown in fig s3c the affinity of ions to the adsorbent was closely related to the z r ratio charge towards radius the z r values of the anions are in the order of po4 3ˉ 3 0 238 so4 2ˉ 2 0 230 fˉ 1 0 133 hco3ˉ 1 0 156 no3ˉ 1 0 179 cl 1 0 181 po4 3 and so4 2 were easy to compete with fˉ to bond with the adsorbents because of the high z r values hco3ˉ lowers the fˉ adsorption capacity owing to the similar ionic radii to fˉ 0 133 nm and it is recommended that hco3ˉ fitted in place of ohˉ ion as well no noticeable effect was found due to the addition of clˉ and no3ˉ this might be owing to the low affinity of these two ions however both anions have larger ionic size about 0 18 nm than that of fˉ 0 133 nm nie et al 2012 yu et al 2013 3 7 desorption and regeneration seven consecutive adsorption desorption cycles were performed to study the desorption and regeneration of the paf adsorbent for each regeneration cycle the standard fluoride concentration of 100 mg l fˉ was used from fig s3d the a of fˉ was found 98 6 92 94 91 16 89 96 88 87 86 37 and 85 25 respectively for seven regeneration cycles the a adsorption remained almost unchanged during regeneration therefore paf adsorbent was suitable for regeneration 3 8 effects of ph and zeta potential the ph of solution significantly affected the fluoride adsorption due to the competition for active sites by ohˉ the investigation of ph was studied in the ph ranging from 2 to 12 and the results were presented in fig 5 a in strong alkaline condition the fˉ adsorption decreased because of the adsorption competition between fˉ ions and ohˉ ions after fˉ adsorption the ph values increased indicating that the ohˉ groups on adsorbent were exchanged with fˉ ions which was further investigated in the adsorption mechanism however the lower fˉ adsorption rate at higher ph condition might be ascribed to the competition between fˉ and ohˉ the final ph values after adsorption were also measured and shown in fig 5a equilibrium ph values increased as compared to initial ph values it might be due to the ligand exchange between ohˉ and fˉ which might release the ohˉ ion in the solution xu et al 2016 by ph drift method and zeta potential measurement the point of zero charge pzc was studied and it was found to be very close i e 6 5 and 6 3 respectively fig 5b moreover zeta potential as surface charge can greatly influence particle stability in suspension through electrostatic repulsion between particles the surface of adsorbent was positively charged when ph was lower than 6 3 so it is also suggested that with the help of the protonation of hydroxyl groups at lower ph values adsorption by electrostatic attraction promoted the adsorption process haldorai and shim 2014 3 10 factorial analysis fluoride adsorption by an adsorbent in a batch system usually depends on several factors factorial design of experiments was executed by practicing with various levels of factors with all possible permutations minitab 14 statistical software was utilized to examine the results of the experimental design to assess the main and interaction effects as well as the statistical parameters and the plots table 7 showed 8 experiments of 23 factorial design for fˉ adsorption study and a matrix was designed according to high and low levels the anova analysis was used to determine the main and interactions effect independent factors the main effect of fluoride adsorption was assigned by p 95 value the p values is the smallest level of significance which is responsible for the rejection of the null hypothesis when p values less than 0 05 then the main and interaction effect of each factor was found statistically significant a 77 612 12 46a 12 9b 7 12c 9 09ab 0 273ac 5 892bce the main effects of factors a b c and the interaction between factors ab ac ba bc ca and cb were determined and shown in figs s 4 7 the effect of a factor explains the change in response generated by the change in the level of factors which is known as the main effect it showed the primary factor of interest in the adsorption experiment fig s5 shows the interaction plots of three factors which shows the mutual effect of temperature on adsorbent dose and ci and confirms that on going from low level 1 to higher level 1 a increases with increase in adsorbent dose and ci with temperature fig s6 shows the interaction plot of adsorbent dose with the temperature and concertation which confirms the a increase with increase in adsorbent dose with both concertation and temperature the mean changes in the a of fˉ due to the change in the levels of each main factor from low to a high level are presented in fig s7 the length of the vertical line related to the statistical significance of a factor the change in response occurred due to change in vertical line when changing the main factor from level 1 to level 1 so fig s7 showed that adsorbent dose and ci have a positive effect increase in a with increase in the factor on fˉ adsorption and the opposite was found true for the temperature the effective interaction effect was significant only when the lines do not run parallel an interaction is effective when the change in factors from low to high levels was dependent on the second factor fig s 4 7 shows the interaction plots and table 8 shows the statistical parameters of main and interaction effect for fˉ adsorption fig s7 shows strong interactional effect between adsorbent dosage and concentration whereas the interaction effect for other factors is not significant ns as shown in table 8 safaand and bhatti 2011 bingol et al 2010 4 characterization of paf and paf f adsorbent 4 1 bet analysis n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were used to investigate changes in the pore structure of paf adsorbents after fˉ adsorption as shown in fig 6a all isotherms are mainly h3 type hysteresis loop which is characteristic for mesoporous structures the surface area pore diameter and total pore volume of adsorbents before and after fˉ adsorption are summarized in table 9 before adsorption the paf showed the largest specific surface area and pore volume of 122 75 m2 g and 4 03 cm3 g respectively for adsorbents large specific surface area and pore volume can expose more crystal boundaries and adsorption active sites which is beneficial to transmission diffusion and adsorption of adsorbate onto the adsorbent therefore it may be one of the reasons for the better adsorption performance of paf after the adsorption of fˉ the specific surface area and pore volume of the adsorbents obviously decreased as shown in table 9 it suggests that the surface physical adsorption and inner pore filling may exist in the fˉ adsorption process 4 2 ftir ftir spectra study was done to illustrate the functional groups attached to the adsorbent fig 6b the peak at 3748 cm 1 was due to the o h stretching bands and the peaks at 1635and 1527 cm 1 resembled coo anti symmetric and stretching vibration respectively the peak at 1060 cm 1 indicated the presence of c o group after fluoride adsorption peaks at 3744 1635 and 1523 cm 1 shifted to 3748 1645 and 1535 cm 1 respectively this shift in the peaks confirmed that oh and coo groups contributed to the adsorption the peaks at 695 and 599 cm 1 shifted to 705 and 605 cm 1 respectively and a new peak seemed at 418 cm 1 after adsorption indicates the presence of fluoride the whole study of ftir shows that there is an interaction between the metal and fluoride ion which further confirm the adsorption of fluoride on paf 4 3 fesem attach with edax and mapping the morphology of pectin fig s8c polymer and adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorbed was investigated with fesem as shown in figs s8 c g paf surface morphology at different magnifications was shown in figs s8 d and e the morphological images indicated that paf was highly nanoporous and microporous in nature after fluoride adsorption the paf morphology significantly changed figs s8 f and g the pore size gets decreased because a large amount of fluoride adsorbed on the paf surface the spherical shape fluoride ion accumulated in the pores which are clearly shown in fig s8f the same result was interpreted by bet analysis the edx images present the main component of paf before and after fluoride adsorption the element present in paf is c o fe al fig s8h and in paf f fig s8i only one extra element found i e fluoride the mapping images further support the main component of adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorbed each component of adsorbent was represented by different color in the edx mapping images figs s8 a and b 4 4 xps to find out the main mechanism of fˉ adsorption onto paf adsorbent xps was applied to determine binding energy b e and surface chemical composition of paf adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorbed from survey spectra of figs s9a new peak was detected around 684 41 ev after fluoride adsorption this new peak is denoted as f1s which is further confirmed by f 1s spectrum fig s10 xps spectrum of c 1s is comprised of three peaks with differentiating binding energy which corresponded to the c c c oh co sharma et al 2018 band fig s11 a1 and 2 the peaks were shifted towards the lower binding energy after fluoride adsorption further the o1s spectrum divided into three peaks assigned as anion oxide o2 hydroxyl bonded to the metal m oh adsorbed water h2o respectively after fluoride adsorption peaks were shifted toward lower binding energy fig s11 b1 and 2 the content of hydroxyl group after the adsorption of fluoride get decreases from 60 39 to 46 14 this indicates that the fluoride exchanges from hydroxyl groups of m oh the area ratio of anion oxide increased from 31 48 to 33 44 after fluoride adsorption indicating that the amount of organic fluoride bonded to the metal r m f formed after adsorption xps spectrum of al 2p is comprised of two peaks with different binding energy which is inferred to be al oh al h2o fig s12 a1 after fˉ adsorption al 2p spectrum shows shifted peaks which might be due to al bonded with fˉ fig s12 a2 the area of the al associated fˉ was obviously larger than that of the ferric associated which may be due to the high molar ratio of aluminum in the adsorbent fig s13 similarly fe 2p xps spectrum shows three peaks after fluoride adsorption they shifted toward lower binding energy fig s12 1and 2 represents the satellite peaks positioned about 710 21 and 723 92 ev which were caused by the charge transfer screening and can be attributed to the presence of fe iii ions after fˉ adsorption the peaks were shifted which may be due to fe f bonding the binding energy of respective elements of paf adsorbent as well as content on the surface before and after fluoride were tabulated in table 10 which further support the fˉ adsorption onto paf these results further confirmed the fluoride bonding with fe and al yang et al 2017 zhu et al 2015a b 4 5 tga the tga method was utilized to explore the thermal behavior of paf the tga curves were noted in a nitrogen atmosphere for the pyrolysis of paf with a heating rate of 10 c min fig s9b the tga analysis of paf showed three degradation steps in first step the thermal degradation observed about 9 70 at 100 200 c owing to the vaporization of moisture lured onto the adsorbent surface second steep degradation occurred at 200 400 c because of the denaturation of the pectin backbone as well as mixed oxyhydroxides with the weight loss percentage of 9 70 the third step degradation was seen at 400 600 c showed the oxidation of metal ions after 600 c no degradation observed and the tga curve was steady which indicated the thermal stability of the paf after this temperature range from the results we can conclude that the synthesized paf were thermostable enough to be used in fˉ adsorption 4 6 xrd figs s9 c and d shows the xrd pattern of pectin and paf before and after fluoride adsorption the xrd pattern analyzes by using the pcpdfwin software the peaks found in paf xrd pattern resembles the peaks of al2o3 and fe2o3 and in paf f xrd pattern the peaks correspond to alf3 fef3 including al2o3 and fe2o3 the peaks correspond to paf pattern matches with jcpdf file no 82 1467 85 0987 correspond to al2o3 and fe2o3 respectively and peaks correspond to paf f pattern matches with jcpdf file no 77 0252 85 0481 corresponds to alf3 fef3 respectively 5 practical implications and cost analysis to explore the practical consequences of our research the paf was utilized for the treatment of the groundwater with a high fˉ content of banasthali village which has triggered critical adverse effect on the health of local people the features of the underground water samples are shown in table 11 investigating the complication of substances and high concentration of fˉ 10 mg l in the water sample the residual fˉ concentration reduced with improving the adsorbent dose the fˉ concentration in the water sample decreased from 10 mg l to about 1 27 mg l at an adsorbent dose of 5 g l which comes under the permissible limit suggested by who 1 5 mg l this application implied that the adsorbents were able to be used in the practical treatment of drinking water the crucial aspect for the selection of adsorbent used in the industry is their cost the paf was prepared by using ar grade chemicals presently the cost of paf adsorbent is around us 30 79 per kg in the lab but the cost of fluoride removal on paf is rationally good compared with other traditional adsorbents table s2 additionally in future for the fruitful application industrial grade raw materials will take place the ar grade chemicals for the large scale preparation of adsorbent which will low down the cost of adsorbent and increases their application substantially velazquez jimenez et al 2014 ku and chiou 2002 tovar gomez et al 2013 atasoy and sahin 2014 raghav and kumar 2019 6 conclusion the synthesized paf adsorbent was used for fˉ adsorption the factorial design analysis showed that on increasing the temperature decrease in the fˉ adsorption occurred which was also illustrated by van t hoff plot where the increase of adsorbent dosage increases adsorption of fluoride the main effect results showed that the three factors have a marked effect on fˉ adsorption with a 95 confidence level the interaction effects revealed that the interaction between the dose and concentration had the most significant effect on the adsorption of fˉ the effects of ph contact time ci co ions regeneration cycle have also been inspected for the fluoride adsorption experiment in the kinetic model study it was found that pso kinetic models best fitted which implies chemisorption nature of adsorption the adsorption isotherm data fitted well with freundlich isotherm with high r2 i e 0 98 which reveals multilayer adsorption of fluoride the qm and qe for fˉ adsorption was found 243 9 and 333 mg g respectively the thermodynamic parameters revealed that the adsorption process was feasible exothermic and spontaneous competing financial interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests acknowledgment we gratefully
