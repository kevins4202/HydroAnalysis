4545,the return level is an important measure for the extreme precipitation and maps of the return level are used to derive information for the design of hydrological and hydraulic engineering projects the interpolation of hourly extreme precipitation is challenging due to low station density and high inhomogeneity hourly precipitation observations at 232 weather stations in the haihe river basin from 1961 to 2012 were used to evaluate six interpolation methods including inverse distance weighted idw ordinary kriging ok kriging with external drift ked assisted by different covariables and empirical bayesian kriging ebk for generating 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return level maps for the basin leave one out cross validation showed that although there was a high correlation coefficient between hourly extreme precipitation and the elevation dem ked incorporating dem as the covariable ked dem did not improve the interpolation efficiency compared with ok ked with the annual average precipitation as the covariable ked ap which had the largest nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 0 89 0 45 and the smallest root mean square error rmse 2 23 15 05 mm for the six return levels outperformed the other five methods compared the return levels varied from 13 to 46 20 66 24 78 26 89 29 110 and 30 134 mm with mean values of 30 40 48 57 67 and 75 mm for the 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return levels respectively in the haihe river basin the return level maps of extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin were generated based on the ked ap method and showed a spatial distribution of decreasing trend from the southeastern part to the northwestern part of the basin the high value centre moved from the eastern coastal area for smaller return level maps to the southern area for the 50 and 100 year return level maps this study may provide some insights into the spatial interpolation of extreme precipitation on an hourly scale keywords interpolation return level gev extreme hourly precipitation 1 introduction extreme precipitation events can cause important hydrological impacts such as flash floods city waterlogging erosion landslides and debris flows which often result in serious resource destruction economic loss and death forestieri et al 2018 gao et al 2017 maggioni and massari 2019 the return level is a commonly used measure of extreme precipitation and the r year return level is the 1 r 1 th quantile of precipitation series intensity duration frequency idf curves which describe the relationship among the rainfall intensity rainfall duration and return level are often used in the design of hydrologic hydraulic and water resource systems koutsoyiannis et al 1998 extreme precipitation samples the annual maximum am or peaks over the threshold pot of certain durations are first extracted from observed precipitation data and then fitted by an extreme value distribution to further deduce return levels the pearson iii generalized extreme value gev and generalized pareto distribution gpd are commonly used extreme value distributions for estimating return levels li et al 2013 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 willems et al 2007 a longer observation period provides more samples to fit the extreme value distribution and improves the estimation of the return level a minimum of 20 30 years is required in general an increasing number of studies have shown extreme precipitation events are intensified by the climate warming specifically extreme precipitation intensity is expected to increase at a rate of approximately 6 7 per degree of warming according to the clausius clapeyron relationship and sub daily extreme precipitation events may increase at approximately twice this rate given constant relative humidity ban et al 2015 berg et al 2013 prein et al 2017 the intensification of extreme precipitation may change the assumption of stationarity when the return level of extreme precipitation is estimated for example what was once a 100 year return level event may occur every 50 years in the future this shift will pose risks to hydrological and hydraulic projects designed based on the return level estimations from historic observations adapting return levels under a changing climate has become a hot issue in the research area of extreme precipitation cooley 2013 extreme value distributions have been developed for the use under an assumption of non stationarity to provide a more accurate estimation of return levels under a changing climate another method is to use a scaling factor which is defined as the ratio of extreme precipitation change per degree of warming to adjust the return level estimated based on historic observations to warming climate conditions schroeer and kirchengast 2018 another hot issue is the generation and improvement of return level maps which can provide extreme rainfall information within a study region for sites with and without observations many extreme precipitation events are characterized as short duration and high intensity with strong temporal and spatial inhomogeneity these events require sub daily e g hourly precipitation monitoring to be evaluated förster and thiele 2020 westra et al 2014 however hourly precipitation data are collected by siphon rainfall gauges or tipping bucket rainfall gauges due to high cost of the instruments and cumbersome data processing stations with 20 30 years of hourly data have limited spatial density which creates a challenge for the interpolation process and the generation of hourly scale return level maps there are three main approaches to obtain precipitation return level maps szolgay et al 2009 1 using the regional frequency analysis rfa method 2 interpolating at site parameters of the extreme value distribution and 3 interpolating at site estimates of the return levels szolgay et al 2009 concluded that the rfa method outperformed its alternatives however this approach requires a subjective predetermination of homogeneous sub regions and the boundary discontinuity between sub regions is a problem for the rfa yin et al 2018 reported that interpolating return levels of daily precipitation directly resulted in higher accuracy than interpolating parameters of a gev distribution meanwhile the choice of the interpolation method is crucial for the generation of return level maps since extreme precipitation usually has large spatial variability especially over short durations there are a number of spatial interpolation methods which are generally classified into two main groups deterministic and geostatistical methods deterministic methods generate surfaces from points with observations based on the extent of similarity such as nearest neighbor nn and inverse distance weighted idw or the degree of smoothing such as radial basis function rbf hosseini et al 2016 2014 while geostatistical methods utilize the spatial autocorrelations among sample points and create unbiased predictions with minimum variance which include ordinary kriging ok kriging with external drift ked empirical bayesian kriging ebk and so on many studies have performed comparative analyses on the efficiency of different methods for the spatial interpolation of precipitation at various temporal scales berndt and haberlandt 2018 borges et al 2016 haberlandt 2007 li and heap 2011 pellicone et al 2018 verworn and haberlandt 2011 wagner et al 2012 and the general conclusion is that geostatistical methods generally outperform deterministic methods in particularly ked method performs better for the interpolation of hourly scale rainfall than ok method haberlandt 2007 berndt and haberlandt 2018 haberlandt 2007 reported that ked with the radar precipitation daily network rainfall and the elevation as covariables performed better than the other interpolation methods when interpolating the hourly precipitation of extreme events in august 2002 in the elbe river basin germany berndt and haberlandt 2018 investigated the accuracy of various spatial interpolation methods for rainfall from hourly to yearly temporal resolutions and concluded that ked outperformed the other methods nn idw and ok moreover they reported that the ked with radar data as auxiliary information can improve the interpolation of hourly precipitation while incorporating the dem is helpful for weekly to yearly precipitation but cannot improve the interpolation of hourly precipitation semi variogram model depicts the spatial variability in a regionalized variable and its parameters require manual adjustments in gis to receive accurate results for classical kriging methods ebk has been developed recently to build a valid spatial model by automatically searching model parameters through a process of subsetting and simulations from a bayesian standpoint krivoruchko 2012 a few studies have reported ebk had been used for the interpolation of annual and monthly precipitation gupta et al 2017 pellicone et al 2018 studies on the extreme hourly precipitation at different return levels for china have shown 1 the extreme hourly precipitation of the 50 and 100 year return levels in the central and eastern regions of china ranged from 40 to 120 mm and 40 140 mm respectively 2 the median values of the 2 5 10 20 50 100 year return levels were 31 8 42 1 49 0 55 0 64 5 71 3 mm respectively and 3 the high value centres of the return level maps were located in the coastal area of southern china yao et al 2010 li et al 2013 based on about 24 000 hydrological sites in china the hydrology bureau of the ministry of water resources in china hb 2006 released return level maps including 100 year return level maps of 10 min 60 min 6 h 24 h and 3 d precipitation for china however evaluations of the interpolation accuracy have not been presented in those above mentioned studies and whether more sophisticated interpolation methods can decrease the uncertainty of return level maps remains unknown the objective of this study is to compare different spatial interpolation methods for the generation of hourly scale return level maps the haihe river basin is selected as the study area because of its highly variable topography and importance to the economy of china data from 232 stations with hourly precipitation observations during the period 1961 2012 within the haihe river basin were obtained first the extreme hourly precipitation at 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return levels at each site were estimated by the gev distribution and the l moment parameter estimation method second six interpolation methods idw ok ked with the elevation ked dem ked with the annual average precipitation ked ap ked with both elevation and annual average precipitation ked dem ap and ebk were used to interpolate return levels and their efficiencies were compared by the leave one out cross validation finally the optimal interpolation method was chosen to generate return level maps of extreme hourly precipitation for the haihe river basin the results of this study can be used to generate return level maps of extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin which could be helpful for the evaluation of flood hazards and for the design of hydrological and hydraulic engineering projects moreover the results may provide some insights for the spatial interpolation of extreme hourly precipitation in other regions 2 study region and data 2 1 study region the haihe river basin 112 120 e 35 43 n is located in north china and has an area of 38 104 km2 fig 1 it is bordered by the bohai sea to the east and the yellow river basin to the south the taihang mountains which run northeast to southwest are in the western part of the region and have an elevation of 1000 1700 m the yanshan mountains which run east to west are located in the northern part of the region with the elevation ranging from 500 to 1600 m the basin has complex and diverse terrain the topography in the northwestern part of the basin is highly variable while that in the southeastern part is relatively flat as shown in fig 1 plateaus and mountainous areas account for 60 of the basin covering an area of 19 09 104 km2 whereas the plain area accounts for 40 covering an area of 12 73 104 km2 the haihe river basin is located in an area with a temperate monsoon climate the average annual rainfall is about 520 mm and 71 9 88 7 of precipitation occurs in the summer due to the influence of the east asian monsoon system three main rivers the haihe river tuhaimajiahe river and luanne river are vital water sources for north china in which mega cities such as beijing and tianjin are situated 2 2 data pre processing in this study meteorological data from 274 weather stations within the basin for the period 1961 2012 were obtained from the national meteorological information center nmic china meteorological administration cma hourly precipitation data were recorded by siphon rainfall gauges with measurements from 20 00 the previous day to 20 00 the following day beijing time the missing year is defined as follows if there are 4 or more hours missing in a day the day is defined as a missing day if there are 7 or more missing days in a month the month is defined as a missing month since the rainy season in the haihe river basin is may september if any of may june july august or september is missing in a year this year is defined as a missing year and is not used in this study there were 232 stations with at least 30 years of data during the period 1961 2012 fig 1 the basin was divided into the plain area and the mountainous area by the sub region boundary with an elevation of approximately 100 m shown in fig 1 this delineation is used for the discussion about the effect of elevation on the interpolation the frequency of hourly precipitation is defined as the rainy hours 0 1 mm divided by all hours during the period 1961 2012 the mean intensity mm h of hourly precipitation is the summation of precipitation divided by rainy hours the coefficient of variation of the hourly precipitation is the ratio of the standard deviation of hourly precipitation to the mean value the maximum value mm of the hourly precipitation is the maximum hourly precipitation during the period 1961 2012 at each station 3 methods 3 1 workflow to illustrate our methods clearly a workflow chart used in the study is demonstrated in fig 2 based on the hourly precipitation of 232 stations from 1961 to 2012 in haihe river basin we first extracted the annual maximum series of hourly precipitation for each station which was fitted by the gev distribution and l moment method was used for the parameter estimation to obtain at site 2 to 100 year return levels then six different methods idw ok ked dem ked ap ked dem ap ebk were used for the interpolation of return levels and compared by the leave one out cross validation the optimal interpolation method was chosen out for the generation of six return level maps in haihe river basin 3 2 gev distribution and l moment method for the estimation of at site return levels the gev distribution jenkinson 1955 is a commonly used method for simulating the return level of extreme precipitation events its probability density equation is as follows 1 f x σ μ ξ 1 σ exp 1 ξ ϑ e ϑ 2 ϑ ξ 1 log 1 ξ x μ σ ξ 0 x μ σ ξ 0 where σ 0 σ ξ a n d μ are the scale shape and location parameters respectively when ξ 0 the extreme type i or gumbel distribution is used when ξ 0 the extreme type ii or frechet distribution is used and when ξ 0 the extreme type iii or weibull distribution is used the r year return level is the 1 r 1 th quantile of the gev distribution which can be estimated by 3 y 1 r 1 σ μ ξ μ σ ξ 1 log 1 r 1 ξ ξ 0 μ σ log log 1 r 1 ξ 0 the annual maximum hourly precipitation is fitted by the gev distribution and the gev parameters were estimated by the l moment method hosking 1990 hosking and wallis 1997 equation 3 was used to estimate the 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return levels at sites with hourly observations in the haihe river basin 3 3 inverse distance weighted deterministic interpolation method the idw is one of the most frequently used deterministic methods the predicted value at an unknown point can be calculated as a distance weighted average of the values at sample points as follows 4 z x i 1 n 1 d i p z x i i 1 n 1 d i p where z x is the extreme precipitation value to be estimated z x i are the known values d i p d n p are the distances between the ith point and the estimated point with a power of p the idw method was implemented in arcgis with the automatic fitting for p between 0 and 2 3 4 geostatistical interpolation methods 3 4 1 semi variogram estimation exploring the spatial persistence of an interpolation variable is crucial for using geostatistical methods to obtain the estimations for unknown points this investigation is performed by calculating an empirical semi variogram and fitting a theoretical model a semi variogram is defined as follows armstrong 1998 webster and oliver 2007 5 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where γ h is the semi variogram value of the distance class h and n h represents the number of variable pairs which are located a distance vector h apart z xi and z xi h are measured values of the variable at locations xi and xi h separated by approximate h to generate semi variogram values a theoretical model is fitted for any possible lag in h required by the interpolation algorithms oliver and webster 2014 verworn and haberlandt 2011 the commonly used models are the spherical exponential and gaussian models in this study all the semi variogram theoretical models were automatically fitted and selected by the autofit variogram and auto model statements in the gstat package in r 3 4 2 ordinary kriging ordinary kriging ok is the most common and frequently applied interpolation technique in geostatistics verworn and haberlandt 2011 webster and oliver 2007 ordinary kriging ok which uses variogram theory and structural analysis theory performs linear and unbiased optimization on the value of a regionalized variable in a limited area it is classified as a univariate geostatistical approach i e it allows the consideration of only one data source and does not take into account additional information the function of ok is defined as follows 6 z x i 1 n λ i z x i where z x i is the extreme hourly precipitation of any return level at the ith site in the study area and λ i is the weight coefficient which represents the contribution of each known return level sample value z x i to the kriging estimated return level value z x the weight can be determined by the semi variogram model 3 4 3 kriging with external drift ked takes into account one or more additional variables that are used as background information for the interpolation of the primary variable isaaks and srivastava 1990 webster and oliver 2007 ked assumes the expected value of z is linearly related to m additional variables yk x k 1 m 7 e z u y 1 x y 2 x y m x b 0 k 1 m b k y k x where b0 b1 bm are unknown constants two covariates are chosen as additional variables in this study one is the elevation data dem layer of the haihe river basin with a resolution of 1 1 km ranging from 97 to 2975 m which was obtained from the resource and environment science and data centre http www resdc cn data the other is the annual average rainfall ap layer which ranges from 290 to 590 mm and was produced by the ok interpolation of the annual average rainfall of 232 stations in this study region for ked the semi variogram is estimated from residuals as follows z x m x where m x represents the drift of the original data 3 4 4 empirical bayesian kriging ebk considers local characteristics of each different subset and executes simulations by estimating iteratively lots of semi variogram models are produced to increase the reliability of the obtained variograms pellicone et al 2018 unlike other kriging models using weighted least squares semi variogram parameters in ebk are estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood reml gribov and krivoruchko 2020 krivoruchko 2012 to implement the ebk method the input data are first divided into overlapping subsets of a specified size 25 points in this study in each subset semi variogram is estimated in the following steps krivoruchko 2012 1 a semi variogram model is estimated by known input data in the subset 2 using this semi variogram as a model new data is simulated at each input location in the subset 3 simulated data in step 2 are used to estimate a new semi variogram model weights for this semi variogram are then calculated using the bayes rule which measures how likely the observed data can be simulated by the semi variogram step 2 and 3 are repeated a specific number of times 150 in our case during this procedure predictions and their standard errors are evaluated at locations without observations by using the weights obtained in step 3 this process finally creates a group of semi variograms and each of them is an estimate of the true semi variogram from which the spatial process could be simulated at last a weighted sum of all simulated semi variograms creates the true semi variogram model for the subset meanwhile the model uncertainty at 5 and 95 percentile were extracted from the probability distribution produced by 150 runs for each semi variogram model krivoruchko 2012 pellicone et al 2018 3 5 leave one out cross validation the accuracy of different interpolation methods was evaluated by the leave one out cross validation method for observations and predictions of extreme hourly precipitation at different return levels in the haihe river basin only one pair of samples is retained as the test sample set with the remaining samples being classified as the training set since there are 232 stations 232 training and testing events were implemented and 232 return level predictions were obtained furthermore predictions were compared with observations of the return level at the 232 sites to calculate the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse percentage deviation pbias root mean square error rmse and the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of the observed values rsr these metrics are used to comprehensively evaluate the simulation accuracy of the interpolation methods sammut and webb 2010 the formulas of cross validation assessment metrics are as follows 8 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 9 pbias i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 100 10 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n 11 r s r rmse i 1 n o i o 2 n i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi is the observation and pi is the prediction of the extreme hourly precipitation at different return levels in the haihe river basin the maximum value of nse is 1 the larger the value is the better the interpolation method the smaller the absolute value of pbias is the better the simulation a negative pbias value indicates that the simulation is overestimated in contrast a positive pbias value indicates that the simulation is underestimated the minimum value of the rmse and rsr metrics is 0 and the smaller the value is the better the simulation 4 results 4 1 statistical characteristics of hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin the basic statistics and spatial distribution of hourly precipitation are presented in table 1 and fig 3 respectively the frequency of hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin varied from 4 8 to 8 1 with an average of 6 0 the spatial distribution showed high values occurred in the southwestern part of the basin and the transition zone from the plain to the mountainous area of the basin the mean intensity of hourly precipitation ranged from 1 3 to 2 6 mm h with an average of 1 9 mm h decreasing from east to west the coefficient of variation of hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin was between 1 6 and 2 6 with an average value of 2 1 and the spatial distribution showed a decreasing trend from the southeastern part to the northwestern part of the basin the maximum hourly precipitation ranged from 30 to 138 mm with a mean value of 74 mm for all stations the spatial distribution of the maximum value was similar to that of the cv although with more variations notably several stations in the northern mountainous area such as the duolun station in inner mongolia showed a relatively high maximum value in the region which may be due to the intensification of the windward slope of the valley 4 2 comparison of different interpolation methods for extreme hourly precipitation 4 2 1 characteristics of the gev parameters and the return levels of extreme hourly precipitation the at site estimates of the return levels of extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin were calculated by the gev and l moment methods three parameters of gev and six types of return level are showed in fig 4 among the three estimated parameters of the gev distribution for 232 stations fig 4 a the shape parameter ranged from 0 34 to 0 26 with a mean of 0 02 and the frechet with the shape parameter ξ greater than 0 and weibull ξ less than 0 distributions accounted for 46 and 54 respectively the scale parameter ranged from 4 13 to 21 32 with a mean of 10 75 and the location parameter ranged from 13 34 to 38 05 with a mean of 28 53 as illustrated by fig 4 b characteristics of different return levels of extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin were as follows ranges of the 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return levels are 13 46 20 66 24 78 26 89 29 110 and 30 134 mm with average values of 30 40 49 57 67 and 75 mm respectively furthermore as the length of the return period increases the variability in the return level in the haihe river basin becomes larger which is consistent with the results obtained in previous studies li et al 2013 yao et al 2010 hb 2006 4 2 2 correlation of return levels with covariables the return levels of hourly precipitation were negatively correlated with the elevation dem and positively correlated with the annual average rainfall ap fig 5 shows the 2 10 and 100 year return levels of the extreme hourly precipitation as examples elevation had greater correlation coefficients than annual average rainfall in the plain area which was found at low elevations the return level did not correlate well with the elevation the correlation coefficients of the return level with covariables decreased with an increase in the length of the return period 4 2 3 comparison of different spatial interpolation methods with higher values of nse and lower rmse table 2 geostatistical methods generally presented a better performance than idw when interpolating the extreme hourly precipitation in the whole haihe river basin which consists with previous studies berndt and haberlandt 2018 haberlandt 2007 wagner et al 2012 among the geostatistical methods compared with the results of ok ked ap and ked ap dem models had a better performance whereas ked dem did not what is more ebk had a slight improvement than ok when it comes to the return period of more than 20 years meanwhile the cross validation results also illustrated that the model efficiency decreased with the increase in the length of the return period table 2 taking ked ap as an example the nse decreased from 0 89 to 0 45 from the 2 year return level to the 100 year return level it is understood that spatial variation becomes larger with more extreme precipitation which decreases the efficiency of spatial models among the six different methods ked ap had the largest nse value a relatively small pbias value and the smallest rmse and rsr values fig 6 therefore ked ap was the best method among those interpolation methods and was chosen to perform spatial interpolations to create return level maps of extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin in this study note that ked dem performed worse than ked ap and ok although there was a better correlation of the return level with the dem than with the annual average precipitation 4 3 spatial distribution of the return level maps the spatial distribution of the return levels of extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin demonstrated a similar spatial pattern generally decreasing from the southeastern part to the northwestern part of the basin for all the return levels and the high value centres mostly occurred in the eastern and southern plain areas it is interesting that the large high value centres for the 2 5 and 10 year return levels were located in the eastern coastal areas whereas they moved to the southern part of the basin for the 50 and 100 year return levels fig 7 besides there was a small high value centre appearing in the area of beijing in the maps of the 50 and 100 year return levels 5 discussion extreme hourly precipitation has been found to be negatively correlated with the dem and positively correlated with the annual average precipitation in the study area fig 5 which is mainly due to the increasing trend of the dem and the decreasing trend of the moist from the southeastern part to the northwestern part of the basin although hourly extreme precipitation has a greater correlation coefficient with the dem than annual average precipitation ked dem did not outperform ked ap and ok based on the leave one out cross validation evaluation table 2 it was found that there was not a strong correlation between extreme precipitation and dem in the plain area fig 3 to detect whether there is a difference between the plain area and the mountainous area the haihe river basin was divided based on these regions with 163 stations in the plain area and 69 stations in the mountainous area fig 1 and the interpolations were conducted separately table 3 shows a comparison of the cross validation results for the 2 and 100 year return levels first the model efficiency is better for the whole basin than for either the plain area or the mountainous area second ked dem did not improve the interpolation efficiency either for the plain area or for the mountainous area compared with ok finally all interpolation methods performed better in the mountainous area than in the plain area the semi variogram map fig 8 shows that the spatial model fits the variation better in the mountainous area than in the plain area which may be the reason for the better interpolation results for the mountainous area the result of this study is consistent with that obtained by some previous studies berndt and haberlandt 2018 haberlandt 2007 verworn and haberlandt 2011 berndt and haberlandt 2018 stated that in the case of low station density ked incorporating a dem as the covariable may be helpful in the interpolation of precipitation at low temporal resolutions such as a yearly scale but it may not improve the interpolation of precipitation at high temporal resolutions such as an hourly scale the atlas of rainstorms in china released by the hydrology bureau of the ministry of water resources in china hb 2006 includes a contour map of the 100 year return level of rainfall over 60 min which was compared with 100 year return level maps of extreme hourly precipitation within the haihe river basin obtained in this study the two maps of the 100 year return level in the haihe river basin have similar spatial distribution the difference between the maps is that the 100 year return level of 60 min precipitation from hb is 70 160 mm which is larger than the results of this study 30 134 mm this was mainly because the annual maximum 60 min precipitation samples were obtained by a sliding method and based on the accumulation of precipitation data minute by minute whereas the annual maximums of the hourly precipitation were calculated and selected directly from the hourly rainfall data in this study the former is greater than or equal to the latter moreover rather than using the gev distribution and ked interpolation method hb 2006 used the pearson iii distribution to estimate the local return level at sites and a simple spatial method to generate the return level maps which may have led to some of the differences to detect whether a long term change has occurred for extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin an mk trend analysis was carried out on the annual maximum hourly precipitation sequence from 1961 to 2012 for the increasing trend in the annual maximum hourly precipitation seven of the 232 sites passed the significance test at a 95 confidence level accounting for less than 5 of the samples therefore the effects of long term changes in the extreme precipitation on the return levels have not been considered in this study however for areas with a significant trend the gev method needs to be adapted to include long term trends in the estimation of the return level if climate projections show evidence of long term changes in hourly precipitation in future a scaling factor should be applied to the current return level maps before using them for the design of hydrological and hydraulic engineering projects 6 conclusions the choice of the interpolation method is critical for improving the estimation of extreme precipitation without observations based on hourly precipitation data from 232 stations in the haihe river basin for the period from 1961 to 2012 this study compared six different spatial interpolation methods idw ok ked ap ked dem ked ap dem and ebk through the leave one out cross validation evaluation and selected the optimal method to generate return level maps of extreme hourly precipitation within the haihe river basin the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the average values of the frequency mean intensity coefficient of variation and maximum value for hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin are 6 1 9 mm h 2 1 and 74 2 mm respectively the extreme hourly precipitation values of the 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return levels varied from 13 to 46 20 66 24 78 26 89 29 110 and 30 134 mm with mean values of 30 40 48 57 67 and 75 mm respectively 2 kriging with external drift incorporating the annual average precipitation as the covariate ked ap outperformed other interpolation methods such as ok ebk and the other ked methods with dem as the covariable the longer the return period is the worse the interpolation ked ap had nse and rmse values ranging from 0 89 to 0 45 and 2 23 15 05 mm respectively for the 2 to 100 year return level 3 the spatial pattern generally decreases from the southeastern part to the northwestern part of the basin for all the return levels the high value centre moved from the eastern coastal area of the basin for smaller return levels maps to the southern part of the basin for the 50 and 100 year return level maps credit authorship contribution statement wen yue zou formal analysis writing

4545,the return level is an important measure for the extreme precipitation and maps of the return level are used to derive information for the design of hydrological and hydraulic engineering

outperformed the other five methods compared the return levels varied from 13 to 46 20 66 24 78 26 89 29 110 and 30 134 mm with mean values of 30 40 48 57 67 and 75 mm for the 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return levels respectively in the haihe river basin the return level maps of extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin were generated based on the ked ap method and showed a spatial distribution of decreasing trend from the southeastern part to the northwestern part of the basin the high value centre moved from the eastern coastal area for smaller return level maps to the southern area for the 50 and 100 year return level maps this study may provide some insights into the spatial interpolation of extreme precipitation on an hourly scale keywords interpolation return level gev extreme hourly precipitation 1 introduction extreme precipitation events can cause important hydrological impacts such as flash floods city waterlogging erosion landslides and debris flows which often result in serious resource destruction economic loss and death forestieri et al 2018 gao et al 2017 maggioni and massari 2019 the return level is a commonly used measure of extreme precipitation and the r year return level is the 1 r 1 th quantile of precipitation series intensity duration frequency idf curves which describe the relationship among the rainfall intensity rainfall duration and return level are often used in the design of hydrologic hydraulic and water resource systems koutsoyiannis et al 1998 extreme precipitation samples the annual maximum am or peaks over the threshold pot of certain durations are first extracted from observed precipitation data and then fitted by an extreme value distribution to further deduce return levels the pearson iii generalized extreme value gev and generalized pareto distribution gpd are commonly used extreme value distributions for estimating return levels li et al 2013 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 willems et al 2007 a longer observation period provides more samples to fit the extreme value distribution and improves the estimation of the return level a minimum of 20 30 years is required in general an increasing number of studies have shown extreme precipitation events are intensified by the climate warming specifically extreme precipitation intensity is expected to increase at a rate of approximately 6 7 per degree of warming according to the clausius clapeyron relationship and sub daily extreme precipitation events may increase at approximately twice this rate given constant relative humidity ban et al 2015 berg et al 2013 prein et al 2017 the intensification of extreme precipitation may change the assumption of stationarity when the return level of extreme precipitation is estimated for example what was once a 100 year return level event may occur every 50 years in the future this shift will pose risks to hydrological and hydraulic projects designed based on the return level estimations from historic observations adapting return levels under a changing climate has become a hot issue in the research area of extreme precipitation cooley 2013 extreme value distributions have been developed for the use under an assumption of non stationarity to provide a more accurate estimation of return levels under a changing climate another method is to use a scaling factor which is defined as the ratio of extreme precipitation change per degree of warming to adjust the return level estimated based on historic observations to warming climate conditions schroeer and kirchengast 2018 another hot issue is the generation and improvement of return level maps which can provide extreme rainfall information within a study region for sites with and without observations many extreme precipitation events are characterized as short duration and high intensity with strong temporal and spatial inhomogeneity these events require sub daily e g hourly precipitation monitoring to be evaluated förster and thiele 2020 westra et al 2014 however hourly precipitation data are collected by siphon rainfall gauges or tipping bucket rainfall gauges due to high cost of the instruments and cumbersome data processing stations with 20 30 years of hourly data have limited spatial density which creates a challenge for the interpolation process and the generation of hourly scale return level maps there are three main approaches to obtain precipitation return level maps szolgay et al 2009 1 using the regional frequency analysis rfa method 2 interpolating at site parameters of the extreme value distribution and 3 interpolating at site estimates of the return levels szolgay et al 2009 concluded that the rfa method outperformed its alternatives however this approach requires a subjective predetermination of homogeneous sub regions and the boundary discontinuity between sub regions is a problem for the rfa yin et al 2018 reported that interpolating return levels of daily precipitation directly resulted in higher accuracy than interpolating parameters of a gev distribution meanwhile the choice of the interpolation method is crucial for the generation of return level maps since extreme precipitation usually has large spatial variability especially over short durations there are a number of spatial interpolation methods which are generally classified into two main groups deterministic and geostatistical methods deterministic methods generate surfaces from points with observations based on the extent of similarity such as nearest neighbor nn and inverse distance weighted idw or the degree of smoothing such as radial basis function rbf hosseini et al 2016 2014 while geostatistical methods utilize the spatial autocorrelations among sample points and create unbiased predictions with minimum variance which include ordinary kriging ok kriging with external drift ked empirical bayesian kriging ebk and so on many studies have performed comparative analyses on the efficiency of different methods for the spatial interpolation of precipitation at various temporal scales berndt and haberlandt 2018 borges et al 2016 haberlandt 2007 li and heap 2011 pellicone et al 2018 verworn and haberlandt 2011 wagner et al 2012 and the general conclusion is that geostatistical methods generally outperform deterministic methods in particularly ked method performs better for the interpolation of hourly scale rainfall than ok method haberlandt 2007 berndt and haberlandt 2018 haberlandt 2007 reported that ked with the radar precipitation daily network rainfall and the elevation as covariables performed better than the other interpolation methods when interpolating the hourly precipitation of extreme events in august 2002 in the elbe river basin germany berndt and haberlandt 2018 investigated the accuracy of various spatial interpolation methods for rainfall from hourly to yearly temporal resolutions and concluded that ked outperformed the other methods nn idw and ok moreover they reported that the ked with radar data as auxiliary information can improve the interpolation of hourly precipitation while incorporating the dem is helpful for weekly to yearly precipitation but cannot improve the interpolation of hourly precipitation semi variogram model depicts the spatial variability in a regionalized variable and its parameters require manual adjustments in gis to receive accurate results for classical kriging methods ebk has been developed recently to build a valid spatial model by automatically searching model parameters through a process of subsetting and simulations from a bayesian standpoint krivoruchko 2012 a few studies have reported ebk had been used for the interpolation of annual and monthly precipitation gupta et al 2017 pellicone et al 2018 studies on the extreme hourly precipitation at different return levels for china have shown 1 the extreme hourly precipitation of the 50 and 100 year return levels in the central and eastern regions of china ranged from 40 to 120 mm and 40 140 mm respectively 2 the median values of the 2 5 10 20 50 100 year return levels were 31 8 42 1 49 0 55 0 64 5 71 3 mm respectively and 3 the high value centres of the return level maps were located in the coastal area of southern china yao et al 2010 li et al 2013 based on about 24 000 hydrological sites in china the hydrology bureau of the ministry of water resources in china hb 2006 released return level maps including 100 year return level maps of 10 min 60 min 6 h 24 h and 3 d precipitation for china however evaluations of the interpolation accuracy have not been presented in those above mentioned studies and whether more sophisticated interpolation methods can decrease the uncertainty of return level maps remains unknown the objective of this study is to compare different spatial interpolation methods for the generation of hourly scale return level maps the haihe river basin is selected as the study area because of its highly variable topography and importance to the economy of china data from 232 stations with hourly precipitation observations during the period 1961 2012 within the haihe river basin were obtained first the extreme hourly precipitation at 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return levels at each site were estimated by the gev distribution and the l moment parameter estimation method second six interpolation methods idw ok ked with the elevation ked dem ked with the annual average precipitation ked ap ked with both elevation and annual average precipitation ked dem ap and ebk were used to interpolate return levels and their efficiencies were compared by the leave one out cross validation finally the optimal interpolation method was chosen to generate return level maps of extreme hourly precipitation for the haihe river basin the results of this study can be used to generate return level maps of extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin which could be helpful for the evaluation of flood hazards and for the design of hydrological and hydraulic engineering projects moreover the results may provide some insights for the spatial interpolation of extreme hourly precipitation in other regions 2 study region and data 2 1 study region the haihe river basin 112 120 e 35 43 n is located in north china and has an area of 38 104 km2 fig 1 it is bordered by the bohai sea to the east and the yellow river basin to the south the taihang mountains which run northeast to southwest are in the western part of the region and have an elevation of 1000 1700 m the yanshan mountains which run east to west are located in the northern part of the region with the elevation ranging from 500 to 1600 m the basin has complex and diverse terrain the topography in the northwestern part of the basin is highly variable while that in the southeastern part is relatively flat as shown in fig 1 plateaus and mountainous areas account for 60 of the basin covering an area of 19 09 104 km2 whereas the plain area accounts for 40 covering an area of 12 73 104 km2 the haihe river basin is located in an area with a temperate monsoon climate the average annual rainfall is about 520 mm and 71 9 88 7 of precipitation occurs in the summer due to the influence of the east asian monsoon system three main rivers the haihe river tuhaimajiahe river and luanne river are vital water sources for north china in which mega cities such as beijing and tianjin are situated 2 2 data pre processing in this study meteorological data from 274 weather stations within the basin for the period 1961 2012 were obtained from the national meteorological information center nmic china meteorological administration cma hourly precipitation data were recorded by siphon rainfall gauges with measurements from 20 00 the previous day to 20 00 the following day beijing time the missing year is defined as follows if there are 4 or more hours missing in a day the day is defined as a missing day if there are 7 or more missing days in a month the month is defined as a missing month since the rainy season in the haihe river basin is may september if any of may june july august or september is missing in a year this year is defined as a missing year and is not used in this study there were 232 stations with at least 30 years of data during the period 1961 2012 fig 1 the basin was divided into the plain area and the mountainous area by the sub region boundary with an elevation of approximately 100 m shown in fig 1 this delineation is used for the discussion about the effect of elevation on the interpolation the frequency of hourly precipitation is defined as the rainy hours 0 1 mm divided by all hours during the period 1961 2012 the mean intensity mm h of hourly precipitation is the summation of precipitation divided by rainy hours the coefficient of variation of the hourly precipitation is the ratio of the standard deviation of hourly precipitation to the mean value the maximum value mm of the hourly precipitation is the maximum hourly precipitation during the period 1961 2012 at each station 3 methods 3 1 workflow to illustrate our methods clearly a workflow chart used in the study is demonstrated in fig 2 based on the hourly precipitation of 232 stations from 1961 to 2012 in haihe river basin we first extracted the annual maximum series of hourly precipitation for each station which was fitted by the gev distribution and l moment method was used for the parameter estimation to obtain at site 2 to 100 year return levels then six different methods idw ok ked dem ked ap ked dem ap ebk were used for the interpolation of return levels and compared by the leave one out cross validation the optimal interpolation method was chosen out for the generation of six return level maps in haihe river basin 3 2 gev distribution and l moment method for the estimation of at site return levels the gev distribution jenkinson 1955 is a commonly used method for simulating the return level of extreme precipitation events its probability density equation is as follows 1 f x σ μ ξ 1 σ exp 1 ξ ϑ e ϑ 2 ϑ ξ 1 log 1 ξ x μ σ ξ 0 x μ σ ξ 0 where σ 0 σ ξ a n d μ are the scale shape and location parameters respectively when ξ 0 the extreme type i or gumbel distribution is used when ξ 0 the extreme type ii or frechet distribution is used and when ξ 0 the extreme type iii or weibull distribution is used the r year return level is the 1 r 1 th quantile of the gev distribution which can be estimated by 3 y 1 r 1 σ μ ξ μ σ ξ 1 log 1 r 1 ξ ξ 0 μ σ log log 1 r 1 ξ 0 the annual maximum hourly precipitation is fitted by the gev distribution and the gev parameters were estimated by the l moment method hosking 1990 hosking and wallis 1997 equation 3 was used to estimate the 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return levels at sites with hourly observations in the haihe river basin 3 3 inverse distance weighted deterministic interpolation method the idw is one of the most frequently used deterministic methods the predicted value at an unknown point can be calculated as a distance weighted average of the values at sample points as follows 4 z x i 1 n 1 d i p z x i i 1 n 1 d i p where z x is the extreme precipitation value to be estimated z x i are the known values d i p d n p are the distances between the ith point and the estimated point with a power of p the idw method was implemented in arcgis with the automatic fitting for p between 0 and 2 3 4 geostatistical interpolation methods 3 4 1 semi variogram estimation exploring the spatial persistence of an interpolation variable is crucial for using geostatistical methods to obtain the estimations for unknown points this investigation is performed by calculating an empirical semi variogram and fitting a theoretical model a semi variogram is defined as follows armstrong 1998 webster and oliver 2007 5 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where γ h is the semi variogram value of the distance class h and n h represents the number of variable pairs which are located a distance vector h apart z xi and z xi h are measured values of the variable at locations xi and xi h separated by approximate h to generate semi variogram values a theoretical model is fitted for any possible lag in h required by the interpolation algorithms oliver and webster 2014 verworn and haberlandt 2011 the commonly used models are the spherical exponential and gaussian models in this study all the semi variogram theoretical models were automatically fitted and selected by the autofit variogram and auto model statements in the gstat package in r 3 4 2 ordinary kriging ordinary kriging ok is the most common and frequently applied interpolation technique in geostatistics verworn and haberlandt 2011 webster and oliver 2007 ordinary kriging ok which uses variogram theory and structural analysis theory performs linear and unbiased optimization on the value of a regionalized variable in a limited area it is classified as a univariate geostatistical approach i e it allows the consideration of only one data source and does not take into account additional information the function of ok is defined as follows 6 z x i 1 n λ i z x i where z x i is the extreme hourly precipitation of any return level at the ith site in the study area and λ i is the weight coefficient which represents the contribution of each known return level sample value z x i to the kriging estimated return level value z x the weight can be determined by the semi variogram model 3 4 3 kriging with external drift ked takes into account one or more additional variables that are used as background information for the interpolation of the primary variable isaaks and srivastava 1990 webster and oliver 2007 ked assumes the expected value of z is linearly related to m additional variables yk x k 1 m 7 e z u y 1 x y 2 x y m x b 0 k 1 m b k y k x where b0 b1 bm are unknown constants two covariates are chosen as additional variables in this study one is the elevation data dem layer of the haihe river basin with a resolution of 1 1 km ranging from 97 to 2975 m which was obtained from the resource and environment science and data centre http www resdc cn data the other is the annual average rainfall ap layer which ranges from 290 to 590 mm and was produced by the ok interpolation of the annual average rainfall of 232 stations in this study region for ked the semi variogram is estimated from residuals as follows z x m x where m x represents the drift of the original data 3 4 4 empirical bayesian kriging ebk considers local characteristics of each different subset and executes simulations by estimating iteratively lots of semi variogram models are produced to increase the reliability of the obtained variograms pellicone et al 2018 unlike other kriging models using weighted least squares semi variogram parameters in ebk are estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood reml gribov and krivoruchko 2020 krivoruchko 2012 to implement the ebk method the input data are first divided into overlapping subsets of a specified size 25 points in this study in each subset semi variogram is estimated in the following steps krivoruchko 2012 1 a semi variogram model is estimated by known input data in the subset 2 using this semi variogram as a model new data is simulated at each input location in the subset 3 simulated data in step 2 are used to estimate a new semi variogram model weights for this semi variogram are then calculated using the bayes rule which measures how likely the observed data can be simulated by the semi variogram step 2 and 3 are repeated a specific number of times 150 in our case during this procedure predictions and their standard errors are evaluated at locations without observations by using the weights obtained in step 3 this process finally creates a group of semi variograms and each of them is an estimate of the true semi variogram from which the spatial process could be simulated at last a weighted sum of all simulated semi variograms creates the true semi variogram model for the subset meanwhile the model uncertainty at 5 and 95 percentile were extracted from the probability distribution produced by 150 runs for each semi variogram model krivoruchko 2012 pellicone et al 2018 3 5 leave one out cross validation the accuracy of different interpolation methods was evaluated by the leave one out cross validation method for observations and predictions of extreme hourly precipitation at different return levels in the haihe river basin only one pair of samples is retained as the test sample set with the remaining samples being classified as the training set since there are 232 stations 232 training and testing events were implemented and 232 return level predictions were obtained furthermore predictions were compared with observations of the return level at the 232 sites to calculate the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse percentage deviation pbias root mean square error rmse and the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of the observed values rsr these metrics are used to comprehensively evaluate the simulation accuracy of the interpolation methods sammut and webb 2010 the formulas of cross validation assessment metrics are as follows 8 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 9 pbias i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 100 10 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n 11 r s r rmse i 1 n o i o 2 n i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi is the observation and pi is the prediction of the extreme hourly precipitation at different return levels in the haihe river basin the maximum value of nse is 1 the larger the value is the better the interpolation method the smaller the absolute value of pbias is the better the simulation a negative pbias value indicates that the simulation is overestimated in contrast a positive pbias value indicates that the simulation is underestimated the minimum value of the rmse and rsr metrics is 0 and the smaller the value is the better the simulation 4 results 4 1 statistical characteristics of hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin the basic statistics and spatial distribution of hourly precipitation are presented in table 1 and fig 3 respectively the frequency of hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin varied from 4 8 to 8 1 with an average of 6 0 the spatial distribution showed high values occurred in the southwestern part of the basin and the transition zone from the plain to the mountainous area of the basin the mean intensity of hourly precipitation ranged from 1 3 to 2 6 mm h with an average of 1 9 mm h decreasing from east to west the coefficient of variation of hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin was between 1 6 and 2 6 with an average value of 2 1 and the spatial distribution showed a decreasing trend from the southeastern part to the northwestern part of the basin the maximum hourly precipitation ranged from 30 to 138 mm with a mean value of 74 mm for all stations the spatial distribution of the maximum value was similar to that of the cv although with more variations notably several stations in the northern mountainous area such as the duolun station in inner mongolia showed a relatively high maximum value in the region which may be due to the intensification of the windward slope of the valley 4 2 comparison of different interpolation methods for extreme hourly precipitation 4 2 1 characteristics of the gev parameters and the return levels of extreme hourly precipitation the at site estimates of the return levels of extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin were calculated by the gev and l moment methods three parameters of gev and six types of return level are showed in fig 4 among the three estimated parameters of the gev distribution for 232 stations fig 4 a the shape parameter ranged from 0 34 to 0 26 with a mean of 0 02 and the frechet with the shape parameter ξ greater than 0 and weibull ξ less than 0 distributions accounted for 46 and 54 respectively the scale parameter ranged from 4 13 to 21 32 with a mean of 10 75 and the location parameter ranged from 13 34 to 38 05 with a mean of 28 53 as illustrated by fig 4 b characteristics of different return levels of extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin were as follows ranges of the 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return levels are 13 46 20 66 24 78 26 89 29 110 and 30 134 mm with average values of 30 40 49 57 67 and 75 mm respectively furthermore as the length of the return period increases the variability in the return level in the haihe river basin becomes larger which is consistent with the results obtained in previous studies li et al 2013 yao et al 2010 hb 2006 4 2 2 correlation of return levels with covariables the return levels of hourly precipitation were negatively correlated with the elevation dem and positively correlated with the annual average rainfall ap fig 5 shows the 2 10 and 100 year return levels of the extreme hourly precipitation as examples elevation had greater correlation coefficients than annual average rainfall in the plain area which was found at low elevations the return level did not correlate well with the elevation the correlation coefficients of the return level with covariables decreased with an increase in the length of the return period 4 2 3 comparison of different spatial interpolation methods with higher values of nse and lower rmse table 2 geostatistical methods generally presented a better performance than idw when interpolating the extreme hourly precipitation in the whole haihe river basin which consists with previous studies berndt and haberlandt 2018 haberlandt 2007 wagner et al 2012 among the geostatistical methods compared with the results of ok ked ap and ked ap dem models had a better performance whereas ked dem did not what is more ebk had a slight improvement than ok when it comes to the return period of more than 20 years meanwhile the cross validation results also illustrated that the model efficiency decreased with the increase in the length of the return period table 2 taking ked ap as an example the nse decreased from 0 89 to 0 45 from the 2 year return level to the 100 year return level it is understood that spatial variation becomes larger with more extreme precipitation which decreases the efficiency of spatial models among the six different methods ked ap had the largest nse value a relatively small pbias value and the smallest rmse and rsr values fig 6 therefore ked ap was the best method among those interpolation methods and was chosen to perform spatial interpolations to create return level maps of extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin in this study note that ked dem performed worse than ked ap and ok although there was a better correlation of the return level with the dem than with the annual average precipitation 4 3 spatial distribution of the return level maps the spatial distribution of the return levels of extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin demonstrated a similar spatial pattern generally decreasing from the southeastern part to the northwestern part of the basin for all the return levels and the high value centres mostly occurred in the eastern and southern plain areas it is interesting that the large high value centres for the 2 5 and 10 year return levels were located in the eastern coastal areas whereas they moved to the southern part of the basin for the 50 and 100 year return levels fig 7 besides there was a small high value centre appearing in the area of beijing in the maps of the 50 and 100 year return levels 5 discussion extreme hourly precipitation has been found to be negatively correlated with the dem and positively correlated with the annual average precipitation in the study area fig 5 which is mainly due to the increasing trend of the dem and the decreasing trend of the moist from the southeastern part to the northwestern part of the basin although hourly extreme precipitation has a greater correlation coefficient with the dem than annual average precipitation ked dem did not outperform ked ap and ok based on the leave one out cross validation evaluation table 2 it was found that there was not a strong correlation between extreme precipitation and dem in the plain area fig 3 to detect whether there is a difference between the plain area and the mountainous area the haihe river basin was divided based on these regions with 163 stations in the plain area and 69 stations in the mountainous area fig 1 and the interpolations were conducted separately table 3 shows a comparison of the cross validation results for the 2 and 100 year return levels first the model efficiency is better for the whole basin than for either the plain area or the mountainous area second ked dem did not improve the interpolation efficiency either for the plain area or for the mountainous area compared with ok finally all interpolation methods performed better in the mountainous area than in the plain area the semi variogram map fig 8 shows that the spatial model fits the variation better in the mountainous area than in the plain area which may be the reason for the better interpolation results for the mountainous area the result of this study is consistent with that obtained by some previous studies berndt and haberlandt 2018 haberlandt 2007 verworn and haberlandt 2011 berndt and haberlandt 2018 stated that in the case of low station density ked incorporating a dem as the covariable may be helpful in the interpolation of precipitation at low temporal resolutions such as a yearly scale but it may not improve the interpolation of precipitation at high temporal resolutions such as an hourly scale the atlas of rainstorms in china released by the hydrology bureau of the ministry of water resources in china hb 2006 includes a contour map of the 100 year return level of rainfall over 60 min which was compared with 100 year return level maps of extreme hourly precipitation within the haihe river basin obtained in this study the two maps of the 100 year return level in the haihe river basin have similar spatial distribution the difference between the maps is that the 100 year return level of 60 min precipitation from hb is 70 160 mm which is larger than the results of this study 30 134 mm this was mainly because the annual maximum 60 min precipitation samples were obtained by a sliding method and based on the accumulation of precipitation data minute by minute whereas the annual maximums of the hourly precipitation were calculated and selected directly from the hourly rainfall data in this study the former is greater than or equal to the latter moreover rather than using the gev distribution and ked interpolation method hb 2006 used the pearson iii distribution to estimate the local return level at sites and a simple spatial method to generate the return level maps which may have led to some of the differences to detect whether a long term change has occurred for extreme hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin an mk trend analysis was carried out on the annual maximum hourly precipitation sequence from 1961 to 2012 for the increasing trend in the annual maximum hourly precipitation seven of the 232 sites passed the significance test at a 95 confidence level accounting for less than 5 of the samples therefore the effects of long term changes in the extreme precipitation on the return levels have not been considered in this study however for areas with a significant trend the gev method needs to be adapted to include long term trends in the estimation of the return level if climate projections show evidence of long term changes in hourly precipitation in future a scaling factor should be applied to the current return level maps before using them for the design of hydrological and hydraulic engineering projects 6 conclusions the choice of the interpolation method is critical for improving the estimation of extreme precipitation without observations based on hourly precipitation data from 232 stations in the haihe river basin for the period from 1961 to 2012 this study compared six different spatial interpolation methods idw ok ked ap ked dem ked ap dem and ebk through the leave one out cross validation evaluation and selected the optimal method to generate return level maps of extreme hourly precipitation within the haihe river basin the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the average values of the frequency mean intensity coefficient of variation and maximum value for hourly precipitation in the haihe river basin are 6 1 9 mm h 2 1 and 74 2 mm respectively the extreme hourly precipitation values of the 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return levels varied from 13 to 46 20 66 24 78 26 89 29 110 and 30 134 mm with mean values of 30 40 48 57 67 and 75 mm respectively 2 kriging with external drift incorporating the annual average precipitation as the covariate ked ap outperformed other interpolation methods such as ok ebk and the other ked methods with dem as the covariable the longer the return period is the worse the interpolation ked ap had nse and rmse values ranging from 0 89 to 0 45 and 2 23 15 05 mm respectively for the 2 to 100 year return level 3 the spatial pattern generally decreases from the southeastern part to the northwestern part of the basin for all the return levels the high value centre moved from the eastern coastal area of the basin for smaller return levels maps to the southern part of the basin for the 50 and 100 year return level maps credit authorship contribution statement wen yue zou formal analysis writing

cycle ahiablame et al 2017 mekonnen et al 2018 chen et al 2020 climate change directly affects evaporation and streamflow recharge and land use change also balances the processes of interception surface streamflow and groundwater replenishment yira et al 2016 torabi haghighi et al 2020 complex interaction between climate and land use changes may accelerate or slow down the hydrological processes together or separately which makes streamflow simulation more difficult marhaento et al 2018 therefore assessing the impacts of land use and climate changes on hydrological processes is desired for identifying the potential magnitude of these changes as well as improving streamflow simulation and or forecast accuracy previously a number of research works were conducted for investigating the impact of climate change on hydrological processes in a number of river basins such as yangtze river basin su et al 2017 multiple river basins in california grantham et al 2018 mallakpour et al 2018 indus basin hassan et al 2019 ashuelot river basin wang et al 2020 and qu river basin gao et al 2020a in these studies global climate model gcm is useful for simulating climate change vetter et al 2017 kang et al 2019 wang et al 2019a lee et al 2019 due to the complexities of gcm in terms of parameter estimation and model structure there are many uncertainties e g differences caused by various boundary conditions and driving factors in the processes of regional climate simulation zhuang et al 2018 mei et al 2020 the impacts of uncertainties cannot be ignored when using a single gcm while multiple gcms can provide a more reliable climate prediction and reduce the deviation between simulation scenarios and actual conditions wang et al 2018 noor et al 2019 a number of studies have been undertaken to proof that multiple gcms can effectively improve the accuracy of climate simulation and have achieved satisfactory results zhuang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a tegegne et al 2019 hydrological processes are affected not only by climate change but also by land use change over the past decades numerous research works have revealed the effect of land use change on hydrological processes zhang et al 2016b anand et al 2018 li et al 2019 williamson and claggett 2019 luo et al 2020 cellular automata markov ca markov model is widely used for simulating the land use change scenarios which is composed of markov chain model and cellular automata fu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 gomes et al 2020 yulianto et al 2020 markov chain model uses the starting and transferring probability of each state to forecast land use but the prediction ability in the spatial dimension is weak gong et al 2019 cellular automata ca is a local grid dynamic model which can decompose the research area spatially gao et al 2020b combining the two models ca markov has advantages in quantitative prediction and simulation of spatiotemporal change gong et al 2019 fu et al 2018 coupled ca markov model with multiple criteria evaluation mce to simulate land use change and the predicted results had a great fit with the measured data zhao et al 2019 evaluated the impact of ecological engineering on carbon storage in the upper reaches of the heihe river by linking the ca markov model and integrated valuation of ecosystem service and tradeoffs invest model the results showed that the performance of the method is satisfactory due to the low relative error yulianto et al 2020 used the ca markov model to accurately predict future land use change in the upper citarum river basin indonesia through using land use data predicted by ca markov model and climate data simulated by gcms as inputs the future streamflow of the river basin can be precisely predicted based on soil and water assessment tool swat model the swat model is a typical process based hydrological model which can achieve the reliable hydrological simulation and provide the physical description of hydrological processes liu et al 2020 generally most of previous studies effectively considering individual impact of climate change or land use change on hydrological processes where climate variation and human activities have been studied as important influencing factors of the hydrological cycle villamizar et al 2019 aboelnour et al 2020 hung et al 2020 few studies integrated ca markov model multi gcms and swat into a general framework to simulate land use and climate conditions and to analyze hydrological response the amu darya river is located in central asia originating from the pamirs and the hindu kush mountains sun et al 2019 the river is mainly replenished by the alpine glacial melt water and the rainfall climate change has the obvious impacts on glaciers and precipitation which can further affect river streamflow processes the amu darya river flows through arid and semi arid climate regions and water for irrigation and other purposes mainly comes from the river with the development of economy and society the trend of over utilizing the water of the amu darya river is gradually deepening several researchers paid attentions to the factors affecting water resources of the region and separately studied the impacts of climate and irrigation activities on streamflow changes baidya roy et al 2014 white et al 2014 duan et al 2019 su et al 2021 unfortunately no previous study was reported on simultaneously examining the effects of human activity and climate change on the river s streamflow through integrating ca markov model multi gcms and swat within a general framework therefore this study aims to develop a multi scenario ensemble streamflow forecast mesf method for analyzing future streamflow of the upper amu darya river basin under considering land use and climate changes mesf will incorporate ca markov model multi gcms and swat within a general framework in mesf ca markov model will be used for predicting land use scenarios multiple gcms will be used as future climate change scenarios and swat will be used to simulate the streamflow processes under various scenarios then the streamflow processes under each scenario will be compared and analyzed to evaluate the possible variation ranges and impact factors of future streamflow the advantages of mesf are i it can simultaneously examine the effects of land use and climate changes on the river s streamflow ii based on multiple scenario analysis and ensemble forecast it can generate a range of possible streamflow that can reflect the trend of future streamflow change iii by setting extreme scenarios it can assess the impact of key factors e g glacier area on streamflow the mesf method is applied to the upper reaches of the amu darya river basin in central asia where the impacts of human activities and climate changes are urgent to reveal 2 methodology in this study the mesf method is developed through integrating ca markov gcm and swat models into a general framework to assess the impacts of land use and climate changes on streamflow of the amu darya river basin in central asia fig 1 in detail the main steps of mesf include i using streamflow observation data to calibrate and validate the parameters of the swat model ii setting up land use and climate changes scenarios according to the research purpose iii using ca markov model and gcms to predict and simulate land use and climate changes scenarios iv bring the land use and meteorological data representing these scenarios into the swat model for streamflow simulation v processing and analyzing the streamflow forecast results to explore the impacts of land use and climate changes on streamflow and calculating the contribution the swat model is used to simulate daily streamflow the basic driving force of the model is the water balance equation as follows 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r day q suff e a w seep q g w where swt and sw0 are soil water content at the initial and t respectively and t is the calculation period and i is the time point rday qsuff ea wseep and qgw are the amount of precipitation surface streamflow evaporation percolation and groundwater outflow at the time i respectively in swat the basin is divided into several sub basins based on the distribution of river network and further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus according to land use soil type and slope characteristics neitsch et al 2011 first hydrological and environmental factors are simulated in each hru and then weighted to the sub basin level the catchment loads in all sub basins are then aggregated through the river network and converged to the outlet of the basin to enable the swat model to accurately simulate the hydrological processes of the watershed swat cup is selected as a tool for calibrating model parameters abbaspour 2015 the sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 algorithm is the calibration method used in this study the measured flow on a daily scale is the input data of the calibration and validation processes of swat model nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias are used as statistical evaluation criteria to evaluate the simulation results in specific calculations the swat model requires a lot of input data such as digital elevation model dem slope soil type land use meteorological data etc these data can affect the variation range of the swat model simulation results especially the input data that is prone to change such as land use and meteorological data therefore it is necessary to use effective methods to simulate land use and meteorological data separately and then bring them into the swat model to obtain the streamflow forecast results the change of land use is predicted by ca markov model which combines ca filter and markov chain model the ca model is composed of four parts cell and its state cell space neighborhood interaction and transition rules wang et al 2019b the next state of a cell depends on the state of the cell itself and its adjacent cells as well as certain transition rules the process can be expressed as follows 2 s t 1 f s t n where s represents a finite and discrete set of states of cells t and t 1 are the moments of the states and f is the conversion rule n represents the neighborhoods of the cell however ca only describes the interaction of spatial neighborhoods and lacks the influence of time changes the markov model mainly reflects the transition probability between time steps the mathematical model is as follows 3 v t 1 v t p where v t and v t 1 represent the system state at time t and t 1 respectively p represents the transition probability matrix from initial time to termination time which can be expressed as follows 4 p p ij p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 2 n p n 1 p n 2 p nn 0 p ij 1 where pij is the probability of transition from state i to state j in next time but markov model only reflects quantitative changes and has no ability to describe spatial variation combining markov model and ca can reliably simulate land use in quantity and space hamad et al 2018 in this study different social development policies are determined according to the set land use change scenarios shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and glacier melting gm scenario which are explained in section 3 3 based on the development directions the change trends of each land use type can be controlled to meet its scenario settings then the ca markov model is executed in the idrisi software to simulate the land use the accuracy of the land use prediction results needs to be tested using indicator the kappa index introduced by cohen 1960 determines the consistency of the predicted results with the measured data it is a common criterion to judge the relationship between the forecast result and the actual situation of the land use shown in equation 5 5 k p o p c 1 p c where k is kappa index po is proportion of units which agree and pc is proportion of units for expected change agreement according to viera and garrett 2005 kappa index can be considered as substantial between 0 61 and 0 80 and almost perfect between 0 81 and 0 99 gcm is an effective tool for simulating climate change with providing current and future global meteorological data and multiple gcms usually perform better than a single gcm the space scale generated by gcm is much larger than the output required for hydrological model downscaling technology can convert gcm data into more refined small scale data in this study the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp dataset is used as the source of climate data which has been downscaled by nasa using the bias correction spatial decomposition bcsd method this data set contains the daily rainfall and temperature data of 21 climate models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios from 2006 to 2099 the climate change scenarios are set using multiple climate models data bcc csm1 1 canesm2 csiro mk3 6 0 cnrm cm5 ipsl cm5a lr and noresm1 m under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios in the nex gddp dataset to reduce the impact of errors caused by a single gcm after streamflow forecast the impacts of land use and climate changes on streamflow need to be analyzed to quantitatively assess the contribution of land use and climate changes to streamflow the following formulas are used for calculation 6 δ q l c q l

conditions 3 study area and data 3 1 study area as shown in fig 2 the study area is the upper reaches of amu darya river basin the amu daria river is the largest river in the aral sea basin in central asia with a length of 2400 km and an average annual flow of 79 3 km3 ma et al 2020 the pamirs and the hindu kush mountains are the birthplace of the river and the glacier and snow melting are the main source of streamflow recharge sun et al 2019 the climate of the basin is a typical continental feature with relative humidity and annual rainfall at low levels white et al 2014 because the land in this area is mainly dry land climate change may seriously affect the hydrological process for instance the streamflow of amu darya river decreased by 15 5 during 1951 2007 due to the decline in precipitation wang et al 2016 at the same time climate change and economic development have also led to significant changes in land use pattern due to land salinization about 15 20 of the land has degraded to a state unsuitable for planting djumaeva et al 2013 changes in climate and land use have impacts on the streamflow of the amu darya river thereby affecting the local water resources management and socio economic development due to the lack of available data few research works were conducted to disclose such impacts how the streamflow changes in the future and how climate and land use changes will affect the streamflow 3 2 data acquisition and model set up daily measured streamflow data were downloaded from the global runoff data center https www bafg de including continuous discharge data of garm hydrological station from 1957 to 1986 the streamflow data during this period were set as the base period data and the data from 1979 to 1986 were used for calibration and verification of the swat model the 1979 1980 is the model burn in period and 1985 1986 is the validation period meteorological inputs used to calibrate swat model were reanalysis data in 1979 1986

ghaffar 2019 singh et al 2019 even in the highlands and mountains of central asia the accuracy is trustworthy mishra et al 2019 li et al 2020 due to the incomplete data in central asia and the lack of measured meteorological data during the base period for comparison the average of the 1957 1986 daily scale data of the above six climate models in the nex gddp database are used as the baseline meteorological data since the historical weather data were used for bias correction by nasa these data can represent the historical climate of the study area geographic data used in the study include dem soil and land use projections the dem data with 90 m resolution was provided by the consortium on spatial information of consultative group on international agricultural research cgiar http srtm csi cgiar org the soil map and soil properties data were downloaded from harmonized world soil database https daac ornl gov the 1 km resolution land use data of 1990 2000 2010 and 2015 were collected from data sharing and service portal http data casearth cn in this study the 2015 forecast results simulated by ca markov model using 2000 and 2010 land use data are compared with the collected data to calculate the kappa value fig 3 shows the slope projection obtained by processing dem data with arcgis software and the projections of dem land use and soil the resolution of these geographic data has been reset to 100 m for the swat model set up the arcswat 2012 interface in arcgis10 2 is used to parameterize the hydrological simulation processes in this study the basin is divided into 77 sub basins and 216 hrus based on dem map the swat model is used to simulate the daily streamflow process of the river from 1979 to 1986 as the calibration and validation period the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 is used as the calibration method the period of 1979 1980 is the model burn in period 1981 1984 is the calibration period and 1985 1986 is the validation period then the daily streamflow processes under 72 scenarios are simulated by the swat model 3 3 scenario design in this study five ssp scenarios and one glacier melting gm scenario are set to simulate land use change these ssp scenarios are designed based on the five future global development models described in riahi et al 2017 and characterized by sustainability development ssp1 middle of the road trends ssp2 fragmentation ssp3 inequality ssp4 and conventional development ssp5 the five scenarios are summarized as a ssp1 assumes that the world is gradually but pervasively shifting toward a more sustainable path and land use is strictly controlled b ssp2 presumes that the overall trend of the world does not deviate from the historical trend and land use change is not fully controlled c under ssp3 the increase of cultivated land area is caused by the revival of nationalism the aggravation of regional competition the deterioration of environment the increase of population and the decrease of cultivated land yield d ssp4 is characterized by inequality between and within countries high income countries have strict regulations on land use while low income countries have no limitations the development of low income areas is poor e ssp5 assumes that the world is in a period of rapid development but land use is not fully regulated and environmental damage still occurs in addition to the five ssp scenarios gm scenario is added to analyze the impacts of future extreme events on the streamflow caused by changes in the glacier area according to the previous studies the glacier cover in the amu darya river basin may disappear at an accelerated rate under the influence of global warming in the future duan et al 2012 gan et al 2015 huss and hock 2018 assessing the impact of the extreme weather events is necessary in the gm scenario the glacier cover would gradually melt between 2021 and 2050 almost all glaciers would disappear by 2050 and other land use types would not be interfered the above six land use development directions are employed in the upper reaches of the amu darya river basin the land use changes in every decade from 2020 to 2050 are respectively forecasted under each scenario and these data are used as inputs of the land use projections in order to reflect the comprehensive impacts of future climate and land use changes on streamflow land use data in 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 are combined with climate data in 2015 2055 to simulate streamflow for example the land use data in 2020 and the climate data in 2015 2025 are combined as input data and substituted into the swat model to simulate the daily streamflow series from 2015 to 2025 by analogy 2030 land use data is combined with 2026 2035 climate data 2040 land use data is combined with 2036 2045 climate data and 2050 land use data is combined with 2046 2055 climate data the calculated streamflow results for the four time periods are then concatenated together to generate the streamflow series of 2021 2050 under 72 scenarios 6 land use scenarios 6 climate models under 2 rcp scenarios 4 result and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation table 1 presents the 13 parameters calibrated by sufi 2 algorithm in the swat model the parameters are arranged according to the results of sensitivity analysis the results indicate that smfmx and smtmp are the most sensitive parameters for streamflow simulation in this region the proportion of glacier area can reach more than 10 snow melt base temperature and melting rate would significantly affect the glacial area and further affect the amount of glacial melt water recharge to the river therefore these parameters related to ice and snow are more sensitive fig 4 shows the comparison of observed and simulated streamflows the values of nse for calibration and verification are 0 89 and 0 83 and the values of r2 are 0 91 and 0 87 indicating that the streamflow simulation results are satisfactory the corresponding values of pbias would be less than 10 i e 8 4 and 3 9 based on the criteria in moriasi et al 2015 whether in the calibration period or the verification period the simulation results both belong to the very good standard the swat model is feasible for the streamflow simulation in the amu darya river basin 4 2 land use change scenarios according to the land use patterns in 2000 and 2010 the ca markov model was used to predict the land use projection in 2015 kappa value would be 0 78 indicating that the agreement between predicted and measured land use projections is acceptable fig 5 illustrates the land use changes simulated by the ca markov model under six scenarios i e ssp1 ssp2 ssp3 ssp4 ssp5 and gm in 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 the proportions of farmland water urban and bare land under most scenarios would increase while on the contrary the proportions of forest and glacier would decrease for example under natural development condition ssp2 the areas of farmland bare land water and city would increase by 1 07 10 65 2 86 and 0 43 while the areas of forest grassland and glacier would decrease by 1 29 11 09 and 2 64 in 2021 2050 under ssp1 except bare land and glacier the area of other land use types would increase by 0 18 to 1 79 under ssp3 ssp4 and ssp5 the fierce regional competition and rapid economic development would lead to faster growth of cultivated land area and more intense urban expansion land use would undergo tremendous changes under the intervention of different development policies before the increased disturbance to economic development the changes in the proportions of land use types would be relatively small after the increase of human activities the extent of land use change would increase indicating that human activities can significantly affect land use the reduced glacier area indicates that the main water supply would decrease in the future especially under gm scenario the glacier area would reduce from 13 23 to 0 94 which may increase the impact of land use change on streamflow 4 3 climate change scenarios fig 6 shows the projected precipitation and temperature under different gcms and rcps in 2021 2050 table 2 presents the specific values of annual average precipitation and temperature for 12 climate change scenarios the overall temperature would show a significant upward trend compared with the average temperature of 3 14 c in the base period the temperature of various climate scenarios generally would increase by 1 49 c to 3 46 c the temperature rising trend would be the most obvious under the rcp8 5 of the canesm2 model but the trend of change would be almost stable under the same rcp of the cnrm cm5 and noresm1 m models rising temperature may be closely related to global warming and may have a general impact on the streamflow in the study area for precipitation the average annual rainfall compared to the base period 612 36 mm would increase under all climate change scenarios with an increase of 22 87 mm to 127 97 mm however the change trend of rainfall would not be obvious from 2021 to 2050 under the two rcp scenarios of the cnrm cm5 model and the rcp8 5 of the noresm1 m model the precipitation increase trends are slightly larger than other scenarios the mean monthly rainfall and temperature changes are shown in fig 7 the results reflect that compared with the baseline period the trends of the monthly average temperature in all climate models would not change significantly but the monthly average temperature in the base period is lower than the corresponding value in future climate change scenarios the results may be attributed to the global warming that caused the overall increase in temperature of the study area throughout the year for precipitation winter and spring are still the main rainfall seasons while summer rainfall is very low almost close to 0 the rainfall in the base period from january to may is lower than almost every future climate change scenarios while the rainfall in the base period from june to july is greater than the corresponding value in most scenarios the results indicate that the summer rainfall in the study area would have a tendency to shift to spring and winter in the study area there are more rainfall and lower temperature in winter less rainfall and higher temperature in summer the arid and semi arid climate and the distinct monsoon effects may be the main factors causing the unique distribution of precipitation and temperature in the region siegfried et al 2012 however such climate conditions may hinder the cultivation of crops in the area and changes in streamflow are inevitable due to the impact of climate variation 4 4 ensemble prediction of streamflow table 3 and fig 8 show the comparison of ensemble streamflow forecast results under 72 scenarios in fig 8 the average annual streamflow under 72 scenarios would have a downward trend from 2021 to 2050 but the trend is not very obvious in table 3 the future streamflow would vary between 244 32 295 98 m3 s which shows a downward trend compared to the baseline period 317 03 m3 s in the previous study the streamflow in this area decreased after 1985 which is similar to the change trend obtained by the streamflow forecast in the future nezlin et al 2004 comparing the streamflow of different rcp scenarios in the same climate model the streamflow changes under the rcp8 5 scenario would be relatively more severe the characteristics of streamflow changes in various climate models are also different for example the streamflow changes in the ipsl cm5a lr model would be relatively stable while the inter annual streamflow changes in the csiro mk3 6 0 model would be more significant the canesm2 model with the most obvious temperature rise would have a relatively significant decline in streamflow which shows that temperature can affect the year to year change process of streamflow however the difference in annual average streamflow changes under various land use change scenarios is not obvious due to space limitations fig 8 iii only shows the comparison of streamflow under different land use scenarios in the bcc csm1 1 climate model and other climate models have similar results the results in table 3 also show that the impact of land use change on average streamflow is relatively small in june the changes in streamflow supplied by melting glacier can reflect the impacts of temperature and glacier area on streamflow fig 8 iv also shows the average streamflow changes in june from 2021 to 2050 under the gm scenario and the streamflow process in june during the baseline period in 2021 2035 when the decline of glacier area and the increase of temperature are not significant the streamflow of june in the baseline period is basically the same as the streamflow under the future change scenarios between 2036 and 2050 the glacier area would decline severely and the temperature increase would gradually increase compared to the baseline period in most future scenarios the streamflow in june would have a tendency to be higher than the streamflow in the baseline period the results indicate that the premature increase in temperature would lead to the early melting of glaciers and summer streamflow would be reduced due to insufficient supply and the imbalance between water resources distribution and water demand may further increase fig 9 illustrates the monthly average streamflow for each scenario under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively in general the variation trends of the monthly average streamflow under all scenarios are similar to the baseline average streamflow for each scenario in january april would be generally lower while in june the average monthly flow in 2021 2050 would be greater than that in baseline period in the months after august the decline in streamflow in almost all scenarios would become more intense annual maximum flow would tend to move from summer to spring and a previous study also reported similar results hagg et al 2013 mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 and pettitt test pettitt 1979 were also performed on the streamflow under all scenarios according to the results of the m k trend test the streamflow of all scenarios shows a downward trend which is the same as the baseline period but the downward trends are insignificant indicating that the streamflow is relatively stable the mutation test results show that the mutation points of the different rcp scenarios are basically the same under the identical climate model in most cases the mutation points would be around 2040s compared with the land use the climate change has a greater impact on the streamflow mutation points in the study area fig 10 is the comparison of monthly average streamflow under 5 ssps and gm scenarios when the climate scenarios are the same reflecting the impact of land use change on streamflow the text in the upper left corner of each independent figure represents the climate change scenario where change in streamflow is the difference between the predicted value and the base value divided by the base value under the same climate change trend the streamflow changes under different land use scenarios are relatively insignificant and the largest annual average flow gap is only 2 65 m3 s in detail compared with other ssp scenarios the streamflows under ssp1 and ssp5 have a greater degree of reduction combining the results in fig 5 the increase in the area of woodland grassland and farmland would cause a decrease in streamflow the increase in vegetation coverage may lead to higher evapotranspiration rate thereby increasing water consumption and reducing streamflow recharge and the streamflow would have a relatively large change chen et al 2020 the results can also show that the glacier area has a greater impact on the streamflow in study area for example under gm the degree of change streamflow would be more significant and the annual average flow would be 1 05 2 65 m3 s smaller than other scenarios the upper reaches of the amu darya river have a high altitude and the glaciers are the important sources of water supply for the river the reduction in the area of glaciers would directly affect the local hydrological process leading to a decrease in streamflow fig 11 shows the comparison of monthly average streamflow under 12 6 climate models under 2 rcp scenarios climate change scenarios when the land use scenarios are the same reflecting the impact of climate change on streamflow the text in the upper left corner of each figure is the climate change scenario under all climate scenarios the monthly streamflow except may june and july would largely reduce compared to that in the baseline and the largest drop up to 60 27 occurs in september under the rcp8 5 scenario of ipsl cm5a lr model the results show that the time of peak flow would gradually advance and during the baseline period the peak flow in the study area appeared in july and august with the increase of temperature under all climate change scenarios melting glaciers would affect the supply of the river and the time of peak flow would also shift the increase in temperature would cause the glaciers to melt earlier thereby the melted water would be supplied to the river in advance temperature and rainfall have significant independent and combined effects on streamflow by comparing the streamflow changes under various climate scenarios the trend of future climate change may lead to a decrease in the monthly average streamflow for instance under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 of the cnrm cm5 model the annual average rainfall would increase by 97 36 mm and 107 35 mm the temperature would also increase by 1 49 c and 1 86 c respectively the monthly average streamflow under cnrm cm5 model would decrease throughout the year the temperature difference of noresm1 m model under the two rcps is not very obvious only 0 13 c but the annual average rainfall difference is 75 29 mm under the rcp4 5 the streamflow reduction is more serious the results reveal that when the temperature changes are similar a small amount of rainfall increase cannot adequately replenish the streamflow resulting in a decrease in streamflow for csiro mk3 6 0 climate model under rcp8 5 the rainfall would increase by 22 87 mm and the temperature would increase by 2 31 c the streamflow would decrease to a large extent fig 10 which shows that when the rainfall changed little the increase of temperature would significantly lead to the decrease of streamflow according to the results in figs 9 11 and tables 1 3 under the combined influence of climate and land use changes streamflow would generally show a downward trend the average annual streamflow under 72 scenarios would be between 244 32 m3 s and 295 98 m3 s compared to 317 03 m3 s in the baseline period among the results the streamflow would decrease the most when the climate scenario is rcp8 5 of the ipsl cm5a lr model and the land use is the gm scenario from the results the streamflow in study area is more sensitive to glacier area and temperature rise compared with the baseline period the future streamflow would increase in may june and july but would shrink significantly in other months the future peak flow would advance and increase the uneven distribution of water resources throughout the year which may cause serious conflicts in water demand table 4 presents the contribution of climate and land use changes to streamflow variability compared with the baseline the results indicate that climate change has a more significant impact on streamflow than land use climate contributes 78 76 to 98 66 of streamflow change in each scenario while the contribution of land use only accounts for 1 34 to 21 24 in detail the reduction of glacier area can increase the impact of land use on streamflow under gm the contribution of land use change to streamflow decline would be greater than that under other land use change scenarios and would even reach 21 24 under rcp8 5 of ipsl cm5a lr model the results show that the glacier area is very important in the snowmelt dominated hydrological system of the study area temperature also has a large impact on the contribution rate which mainly affects streamflow indirectly by changing the glacier area for example in the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the ipsl cm5a lr model the difference in precipitation is only 3 05 mm and the difference in temperature is 0 50 c under the warmer rcp8 5 scenario the contribution of land use to streamflow changes has increased significantly thus temperature also plays a vital role in the change of streamflow in the study area 5 conclusions in this study a multi scenario ensemble streamflow forecast mesf method has been developed to analyze the streamflow processes under land use and climate changes in mesf multiple scenarios concerned future land use and climate changes are examined where ca markov model and multiple gcm are used to simulate these scenarios the swat model is employed to analyze the streamflow variation based on different inputs of land use and meteorological data the streamflow prediction results under each scenario are compared and analyzed to disclose the key factors affecting the hydrological processes mesf has the following advantages i the independent and comprehensive impacts of land use and climate changes on streamflow can be explored ii through the analysis of multiple scenarios and ensemble forecast results it can obtain a certain range of possible flow to reflect the trend of future flow changes iii according to the set extreme scenarios it can analyze future streamflow changes under the impacts of special factors the developed mesf is applied to the upper amu darya river basin central asia to analyze the individual and combined impacts of land use and climate changes on the streamflow the results indicate that i in the future period 2021 2050 the glacier area under the ssp1 5 scenarios would reduce by 2 64 5 90 while the glacier area under the gm scenario would decrease from 13 23 to 0 94 ii under all land use change scenarios cultivated land and urban area would increase by 1 08 2 51 and 0 43 0 85 respectively iii compared with the base period 1957 1986 the average annual rainfall and temperature would increase by 66 99 mm and 2 37 c in 2021 2050 respectively iv the streamflow from 2021 to 2050 would decrease by 21 05 72 71 m3 s compared with the base period with a range of 244 32 295 98 m3 s v in the future the peak flow within a year would gradually shift from summer to spring vi for land use change the streamflow under the gm scenario is 1 05 2 65 m3 s smaller than other scenarios demonstrating that the glacier area reduction would have a greater impact on streamflow vii the decrease in streamflow is more affected by temperature change than rainfall change which also shows that the melting of glaciers caused by climate warming may be the main reason for the decrease of streamflow viii compared to the impact of land use change climate change is the primary reason affecting streamflow variation in the future

4546,land use and climate changes have impacts on hydrological processes for river basin in this study a multi scenario ensemble streamflow forecast mesf method is developed for analyzing the streamflow variation under considering climate and land use changes through incorporating ca markov model global climate model gcm and soil and water assessment tool swat model within a general framework the advantages of mesf are as follows i it can simultaneously assess the impacts of land use and climate changes on streamflow ii it can obtain the possible trend and the range of future streamflows through ensemble forecast under multiple scenarios iii based on analysis of streamflow processes under extreme scenarios it can examine the effects of key factors on streamflow the mesf method is applied to the upper reaches of the amu darya river basin in central asia totally 72 scenarios under different land use patterns gcms and representative concentration pathways rcps are analyzed ensemble forecast results reveal that i during 2021 2050 the average annual precipitation and the average annual temperature would both increase but the mean annual streamflow would decrease ii compared to the impact of land use change climate change has more obvious effects on the streamflow with contribution of 78 8 98 7 iii among all factors of land use change glacier melting triggered by climate warming is the most prominent factor iv the peak flow in one year would have a tendency to shift from summer to spring due to the rising temperature and the speeding up snow melt keywords ca markov climate change ensemble forecast land use change multiple scenarios swat 1 introduction hydrological models have been widely used for simulating hydrological processes and responses at various scales and regions which use input parameters and refined mathematical models to simplify the natural hydrological processes abbaspour et al 2015 liu et al 2017 li et al 2017 woldesenbet et al 2017 for most hydrological models climate and land use changes can greatly affect the accuracy of parameters and these changes are also the two most critical influencing factors in the hydrological cycle ahiablame et al 2017 mekonnen et al 2018 chen et al 2020 climate change directly affects evaporation and streamflow recharge and land use change also balances the processes of interception surface streamflow and groundwater replenishment yira et al 2016 torabi haghighi et al 2020 complex interaction between climate and land use changes may accelerate or slow down the hydrological processes together or separately which makes streamflow simulation more difficult marhaento et al 2018 therefore assessing the impacts of land use and climate changes on hydrological processes is desired for identifying the potential magnitude of these changes as well as improving streamflow simulation and or forecast accuracy previously a number of research works were conducted for investigating the impact of climate change on hydrological processes in a number of river basins such as yangtze river basin su et al 2017 multiple river basins in california grantham et al 2018 mallakpour et al 2018 indus basin hassan et al 2019 ashuelot river basin wang et al 2020 and qu river basin gao et al 2020a in these studies global climate model gcm is useful for simulating climate change vetter et al 2017 kang et al 2019 wang et al 2019a lee et al 2019 due to the complexities of gcm in terms of parameter estimation and model structure there are many uncertainties e g differences caused by various boundary conditions and driving factors in the processes of regional climate simulation zhuang et al 2018 mei et al 2020 the impacts of uncertainties cannot be ignored when using a single gcm while multiple gcms can provide a more reliable climate prediction and reduce the deviation between simulation scenarios and actual conditions wang et al 2018 noor et al 2019 a number of studies have been undertaken to proof that multiple gcms can effectively improve the accuracy of climate simulation and have achieved satisfactory results zhuang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a tegegne et al 2019 hydrological processes are affected not only by climate change but also by land use change over the past decades numerous research works have revealed the effect of land use change on hydrological processes zhang et al 2016b anand et al 2018 li et al 2019 williamson and claggett 2019 luo et al 2020 cellular automata markov ca markov model is widely used for simulating the land use change scenarios which is composed of markov chain model and cellular automata fu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 gomes et al 2020 yulianto et al 2020 markov chain model uses the starting and transferring probability of each state to forecast land use but the prediction ability in the spatial dimension is weak gong et al 2019 cellular automata ca is a local grid dynamic model which can decompose the research area spatially gao et al 2020b combining the two models ca markov has advantages in quantitative prediction and simulation of spatiotemporal change gong et al 2019 fu et al 2018 coupled ca markov model with multiple criteria evaluation mce to simulate land use change and the predicted results had a great fit with the measured data zhao et al 2019 evaluated the impact of ecological engineering on carbon storage in the upper reaches of the heihe river by linking the ca markov model and integrated valuation of ecosystem service and tradeoffs invest model the results showed that the performance of the method is satisfactory due to the low relative error yulianto et al 2020 used the ca markov model to accurately predict future land use change in the upper citarum river basin indonesia through using land use data predicted by ca markov model and climate data simulated by gcms as inputs the future streamflow of the river basin can be precisely predicted based on soil and water assessment tool swat model the swat model is a typical process based hydrological model which can achieve the reliable hydrological simulation and provide the physical description of hydrological processes liu et al 2020 generally most of previous studies effectively considering individual impact of climate change or land use change on hydrological processes where climate variation and human activities have been studied as important influencing factors of the hydrological cycle villamizar et al 2019 aboelnour et al 2020 hung et al 2020 few studies integrated ca markov model multi gcms and swat into a general framework to simulate land use and climate conditions and to analyze hydrological response the amu darya river is located in central asia originating from the pamirs and the hindu kush mountains sun et al 2019 the river is mainly replenished by the alpine glacial melt water and the rainfall climate change has the obvious impacts on glaciers and precipitation which can further affect river streamflow processes the amu darya river flows through arid and semi arid climate regions and water for irrigation and other purposes mainly comes from the river with the development of economy and society the trend of over utilizing the water of the amu darya river is gradually deepening several researchers paid attentions to the factors affecting water resources of the region and separately studied the impacts of climate and irrigation activities on streamflow changes baidya roy et al 2014 white et al 2014 duan et al 2019 su et al 2021 unfortunately no previous study was reported on simultaneously examining the effects of human activity and climate change on the river s streamflow through integrating ca markov model multi gcms and swat within a general framework therefore this study aims to develop a multi scenario ensemble streamflow forecast mesf method for analyzing future streamflow of the upper amu darya river basin under considering land use and climate changes mesf will incorporate ca markov model multi gcms and swat within a general framework in mesf ca markov model will be used for predicting land use scenarios multiple gcms will be used as future climate change scenarios and swat will be used to simulate the streamflow processes under various scenarios then the streamflow processes under each scenario will be compared and analyzed to evaluate the possible variation ranges and impact factors of future streamflow the advantages of mesf are i it can simultaneously examine the effects of land use and climate changes on the river s streamflow ii based on multiple scenario analysis and ensemble forecast it can generate a range of possible streamflow that can reflect the trend of future streamflow change iii by setting extreme scenarios it can assess the impact of key factors e g glacier area on streamflow the mesf method is applied to the upper reaches of the amu darya river basin in central asia where the impacts of human activities and climate changes are urgent to reveal 2 methodology in this study the mesf method is developed through integrating ca markov gcm and swat models into a general framework to assess the impacts of land use and climate changes on streamflow of the amu darya river basin in central asia fig 1 in detail the main steps of mesf include i using streamflow observation data to calibrate and validate the parameters of the swat model ii setting up land use and climate changes scenarios according to the research purpose iii using ca markov model and gcms to predict and simulate land use and climate changes scenarios iv bring the land use and meteorological data representing these scenarios into the swat model for streamflow simulation v processing and analyzing the streamflow forecast results to explore the impacts of land use and climate changes on streamflow and calculating the contribution the swat model is used to simulate daily streamflow the basic driving force of the model is the water balance equation as follows 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r day q suff e a w seep q g w where swt and sw0 are soil water content at the initial and t respectively and t is the calculation period and i is the time point rday qsuff ea wseep and qgw are the amount of precipitation surface streamflow evaporation percolation and groundwater outflow at the time i respectively in swat the basin is divided into several sub basins based on the distribution of river network and further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus according to land use soil type and slope characteristics neitsch et al 2011 first hydrological and environmental factors are simulated in each hru and then weighted to the sub basin level the catchment loads in all sub basins are then aggregated through the river network and converged to the outlet of the basin to enable the swat model to accurately simulate the hydrological processes of the watershed swat cup is selected as a tool for calibrating model parameters abbaspour 2015 the sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 algorithm is the calibration method used in this study the measured flow on a daily scale is the input data of the calibration and validation processes of swat model nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias are used as statistical evaluation criteria to evaluate the simulation results in specific calculations the swat model requires a lot of input data such as digital elevation model dem slope soil type land use meteorological data etc these data can affect the variation range of the swat model simulation results especially the input data that is prone to change such as land use and meteorological data therefore it is necessary to use effective methods to simulate land use and meteorological data separately and then bring them into the swat model to obtain the streamflow forecast results the change of land use is predicted by ca markov model which combines ca filter and markov chain model the ca model is composed of four parts cell and its state cell space neighborhood interaction and transition rules wang et al 2019b the next state of a cell depends on the state of the cell itself and its adjacent cells as well as certain transition rules the process can be expressed as follows 2 s t 1 f s t n where s represents a finite and discrete set of states of cells t and t 1 are the moments of the states and f is the conversion rule n represents the neighborhoods of the cell however ca only describes the interaction of spatial neighborhoods and lacks the influence of time changes the markov model mainly reflects the transition probability between time steps the mathematical model is as follows 3 v t 1 v t p where v t and v t 1 represent the system state at time t and t 1 respectively p represents the transition probability matrix from initial time to termination time which can be expressed as follows 4 p p ij p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 2 n p n 1 p n 2 p nn 0 p ij 1 where pij is the probability of transition from state i to state j in next time but markov model only reflects quantitative changes and has no ability to describe spatial variation combining markov model and ca can reliably simulate land use in quantity and space hamad et al 2018 in this study different social development policies are determined according to the set land use change scenarios shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and glacier melting gm scenario which are explained in section 3 3 based on the development directions the change trends of each land use type can be controlled to meet its scenario settings then the ca markov model is executed in the idrisi software to simulate the land use the accuracy of the land use prediction results needs to be tested using indicator the kappa index introduced by cohen 1960 determines the consistency of the predicted results with the measured data it is a common criterion to judge the relationship between the forecast result and the actual situation of the land use shown in equation 5 5 k p o p c 1 p c where k is kappa index po is proportion of units which agree and pc is proportion of units for expected change agreement according to viera and garrett 2005 kappa index can be considered as substantial between 0 61 and 0 80 and almost perfect between 0 81 and 0 99 gcm is an effective tool for simulating climate change with providing current and future global meteorological data and multiple gcms usually perform better than a single gcm the space scale generated by gcm is much larger than the output required for hydrological model downscaling technology can convert gcm data into more refined small scale data in this study the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp dataset is used as the source of climate data which has been downscaled by nasa using the bias correction spatial decomposition bcsd method this data set contains the daily rainfall and temperature data of 21 climate models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios from 2006 to 2099 the climate change scenarios are set using multiple climate models data bcc csm1 1 canesm2 csiro mk3 6 0 cnrm cm5 ipsl cm5a lr and noresm1 m under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios in the nex gddp dataset to reduce the impact of errors caused by a single gcm after streamflow forecast the impacts of land use and climate changes on streamflow need to be analyzed to quantitatively assess the contribution of land use and climate changes to streamflow the following formulas are used for calculation 6 δ q l c q l

asia with a length of 2400 km and an average annual flow of 79 3 km3 ma et al 2020 the pamirs and the hindu kush mountains are the birthplace of the river and the glacier and snow melting are the main source of streamflow recharge sun et al 2019 the climate of the basin is a typical continental feature with relative humidity and annual rainfall at low levels white et al 2014 because the land in this area is mainly dry land climate change may seriously affect the hydrological process for instance the streamflow of amu darya river decreased by 15 5 during 1951 2007 due to the decline in precipitation wang et al 2016 at the same time climate change and economic development have also led to significant changes in land use pattern due to land salinization about 15 20 of the land has degraded to a state unsuitable for planting djumaeva et al 2013 changes in climate and land use have impacts on the streamflow of the amu darya river thereby affecting the local water resources management and socio economic development due to the lack of available data few research works were conducted to disclose such impacts how the streamflow changes in the future and how climate and land use changes will affect the streamflow 3 2 data acquisition and model set up daily measured streamflow data were downloaded from the global runoff data center https www bafg de including continuous discharge data of garm hydrological station from 1957 to 1986 the streamflow data during this period were set as the base period data and the data from 1979 to 1986 were used for calibration and verification of the swat model the 1979 1980 is the model burn in period and 1985 1986 is the validation period meteorological inputs used to calibrate swat model were reanalysis data in 1979 1986

ghaffar 2019 singh et al 2019 even in the highlands and mountains of central asia the accuracy is trustworthy mishra et al 2019 li et al 2020 due to the incomplete data in central asia and the lack of measured meteorological data during the base period for comparison the average of the 1957 1986 daily scale data of the above six climate models in the nex gddp database are used as the baseline meteorological data since the historical weather data were used for bias correction by nasa these data can represent the historical climate of the study area geographic data used in the study include

csi cgiar org the soil map and soil properties data were downloaded from harmonized world soil database https daac ornl gov the 1 km resolution land use data of 1990 2000 2010 and 2015 were collected from data sharing and service portal http data casearth cn in this study the 2015 forecast results simulated by ca markov model using 2000 and 2010 land use data are compared with the collected data to calculate the kappa value fig 3 shows the slope projection obtained by processing dem data with arcgis software and the projections of dem land use and soil the resolution of these geographic data has been reset to 100 m for the swat model set up the arcswat 2012 interface in arcgis10 2 is used to parameterize the hydrological simulation processes in this study the basin is divided into 77 sub basins and 216 hrus based on dem map the swat model is used to simulate the daily streamflow process of the river from 1979 to 1986 as the calibration and validation period the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 is used as the calibration method the period of 1979 1980 is the model burn in period 1981 1984 is the calibration period and 1985 1986 is the validation period then the daily streamflow processes under 72 scenarios are simulated by the swat model 3 3 scenario design in this study five ssp scenarios and one glacier melting gm scenario are set to simulate land use change these ssp scenarios are designed based on the five future global development models described in riahi et al 2017 and characterized by sustainability development ssp1 middle of the road trends ssp2 fragmentation ssp3 inequality ssp4 and conventional development ssp5 the five scenarios are summarized as a ssp1 assumes that the world is gradually but pervasively shifting toward a more sustainable path and land use is strictly controlled b ssp2 presumes that the overall trend of the world does not deviate from the historical trend and land use change is not fully controlled c under ssp3 the increase of cultivated land area is caused by the revival of nationalism the aggravation of regional competition the deterioration of environment the increase of population and the decrease of cultivated land yield d ssp4 is characterized by inequality between and within countries high income countries have strict regulations on land use while low income countries have no limitations the development of low income areas is poor e ssp5 assumes that the world is in a period of rapid development but land use is not fully regulated and environmental damage still occurs in addition to the five ssp scenarios gm scenario is added to analyze the impacts of future extreme events on the streamflow caused by changes in the glacier area according to the previous studies the glacier cover in the amu darya river basin may disappear at an accelerated rate under the influence of global warming in the future duan et al 2012 gan et al 2015 huss and hock 2018 assessing the impact of the extreme weather events is necessary in the gm scenario the glacier cover would gradually melt between 2021 and 2050 almost all glaciers would disappear by 2050 and other land use types would not be interfered the above six land use development directions are employed in the upper reaches of the amu darya river basin the land use changes in every decade from 2020 to 2050 are respectively forecasted under each scenario and these data are used as inputs of the land use projections in order to reflect the comprehensive impacts of future climate and land use changes on streamflow land use data in 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 are combined with climate data in 2015 2055 to simulate streamflow for example the land use data in 2020 and the climate data in 2015 2025 are combined as input data and substituted into the swat model to simulate the daily streamflow series from 2015 to 2025 by analogy 2030 land use data is combined with 2026 2035 climate data 2040 land use data is combined with 2036 2045 climate data and 2050 land use data is combined with 2046 2055 climate data the calculated streamflow results for the four time periods are then concatenated together to generate the streamflow series of 2021 2050 under 72 scenarios 6 land use scenarios 6 climate models under 2 rcp scenarios 4 result and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation table 1 presents the 13 parameters calibrated by sufi 2 algorithm in the swat model the parameters are arranged according to the results of sensitivity analysis the results indicate that smfmx and smtmp are the most sensitive parameters for streamflow simulation in this region the proportion of glacier area can reach more than 10 snow melt base temperature and melting rate would significantly affect the glacial area and further affect the amount of glacial melt water recharge to the river therefore these parameters related to ice and snow are more sensitive fig 4 shows the comparison of observed and simulated streamflows the values of nse for calibration and verification are 0 89 and 0 83 and the values of r2 are 0 91 and 0 87 indicating that the streamflow simulation results are satisfactory the corresponding values of pbias would be less than 10 i e 8 4 and 3 9 based on the criteria in moriasi et al 2015 whether in the calibration period or the verification period the simulation results both belong to the very good standard the swat model is feasible for the streamflow simulation in the amu darya river basin 4 2 land use change scenarios according to the land use patterns in 2000 and 2010 the ca markov model was used to predict the land use projection in 2015 kappa value would be 0 78 indicating that the agreement between predicted and measured land use projections is acceptable fig 5 illustrates the land use changes simulated by the ca markov model under six scenarios i e ssp1 ssp2 ssp3 ssp4 ssp5 and gm in 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 the proportions of farmland water urban and bare land under most scenarios would increase while on the contrary the proportions of forest and glacier would decrease for example under natural development condition ssp2 the areas of farmland bare land water and city would increase by 1 07 10 65 2 86 and 0 43 while the areas of forest grassland and glacier would decrease by 1 29 11 09 and 2 64 in 2021 2050 under ssp1 except bare land and glacier the area of other land use types would increase by 0 18 to 1 79 under ssp3 ssp4 and ssp5 the fierce regional competition and rapid economic development would lead to faster growth of cultivated land area and more intense urban expansion land use would undergo tremendous changes under the intervention of different development policies before the increased disturbance to economic development the changes in the proportions of land use types would be relatively small after the increase of human activities the extent of land use change would increase indicating that human activities can significantly affect land use the reduced glacier area indicates that the main water supply would decrease in the future especially under gm scenario the glacier area would reduce from 13 23 to 0 94 which may increase the impact of land use change on streamflow 4 3 climate change scenarios fig 6 shows the projected precipitation and temperature under different gcms and rcps in 2021 2050 table 2 presents the specific values of annual average precipitation and temperature for 12 climate change scenarios the overall temperature would show a significant upward trend compared with the average temperature of 3 14 c in the base period the temperature of various climate scenarios generally would increase by 1 49 c to 3 46 c the temperature rising trend would be the most obvious under the rcp8 5 of the canesm2 model but the trend of change would be almost stable under the same rcp of the cnrm cm5 and noresm1 m models rising temperature may be closely related to global warming and may have a general impact on the streamflow in the study area for precipitation the average annual rainfall compared to the base period 612 36 mm would increase under all climate change scenarios with an increase of 22 87 mm to 127 97 mm however the change trend of rainfall would not be obvious from 2021 to 2050 under the two rcp scenarios of the cnrm cm5 model and the rcp8 5 of the noresm1 m model the precipitation increase trends are slightly larger than other scenarios the mean monthly rainfall and temperature changes are shown in fig 7 the results reflect that compared with the baseline period the trends of the monthly average temperature in all climate models would not change significantly but the monthly average temperature in the base period is lower than the corresponding value in future climate change scenarios the results may be attributed to the global warming that caused the overall increase in temperature of the study area throughout the year for precipitation winter and spring are still the main rainfall seasons while summer rainfall is very low almost close to 0 the rainfall in the base period from january to may is lower than almost every future climate change scenarios while the rainfall in the base period from june to july is greater than the corresponding value in most scenarios the results indicate that the summer rainfall in the study area would have a tendency to shift to spring and winter in the study area there are more rainfall and lower temperature in winter less rainfall and higher temperature in summer the arid and semi arid climate and the distinct monsoon effects may be the main factors causing the unique distribution of precipitation and temperature in the region siegfried et al 2012 however such climate conditions may hinder the cultivation of crops in the area and changes in streamflow are inevitable due to the impact of climate variation 4 4 ensemble prediction of streamflow table 3 and fig 8 show the comparison of ensemble streamflow forecast results under 72 scenarios in fig 8 the average annual streamflow under 72 scenarios would have a downward trend from 2021 to 2050 but the trend is not very obvious in table 3 the future streamflow would vary between 244 32 295 98 m3 s which shows a downward trend compared to the baseline period 317 03 m3 s in the previous study the streamflow in this area decreased after 1985 which is similar to the change trend obtained by the streamflow forecast in the future nezlin et al 2004 comparing the streamflow of different rcp scenarios in the same climate model the streamflow changes under the rcp8 5 scenario would be relatively more severe the characteristics of streamflow changes in various climate models are also different for example the streamflow changes in the ipsl cm5a lr model would be relatively stable while the inter annual streamflow changes in the csiro mk3 6 0 model would be more significant the canesm2 model with the most obvious temperature rise would have a relatively significant decline in streamflow which shows that temperature can affect the year to year change process of streamflow however the difference in annual average streamflow changes under various land use change scenarios is not obvious due to space limitations fig 8 iii only shows the comparison of streamflow under different land use scenarios in the bcc csm1 1 climate model and other climate models have similar results the results in table 3 also show that the impact of land use change on average streamflow is relatively small in june the changes in streamflow supplied by melting glacier can reflect the impacts of temperature and glacier area on streamflow fig 8 iv also shows the average streamflow changes in june from 2021 to 2050 under the gm scenario and the streamflow process in june during the baseline period in 2021 2035 when the decline of glacier area and the increase of temperature are not significant the streamflow of june in the baseline period is basically the same as the streamflow under the future change scenarios between 2036 and 2050 the glacier area would decline severely and the temperature increase would gradually increase compared to the baseline period in most future scenarios the streamflow in june would have a tendency to be higher than the streamflow in the baseline period the results indicate that the premature increase in temperature would lead to the early melting of glaciers and summer streamflow would be reduced due to insufficient supply and the imbalance between water resources distribution and water demand may further increase fig 9 illustrates the monthly average streamflow for each scenario under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively in general the variation trends of the monthly average streamflow under all scenarios are similar to the baseline average streamflow for each scenario in january april would be generally lower while in june the average monthly flow in 2021 2050 would be greater than that in baseline period in the months after august the decline in streamflow in almost all scenarios would become more intense annual maximum flow would tend to move from summer to spring and a previous study also reported similar results hagg et al 2013 mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 and pettitt test pettitt 1979 were also performed on the streamflow under all scenarios according to the results of the m k trend test the streamflow of all scenarios shows a downward trend which is the same as the baseline period but the downward trends are insignificant indicating that the streamflow is relatively stable the mutation test results show that the mutation points of the different rcp scenarios are basically the same under the identical climate model in most cases the mutation points would be around 2040s compared with the land use the climate change has a greater impact on the streamflow mutation points in the study area fig 10 is the comparison of monthly average streamflow under 5 ssps and gm scenarios when the climate scenarios are the same reflecting the impact of land use change on streamflow the text in the upper left corner of each independent figure represents the climate change scenario where change in streamflow is the difference between the predicted value and the base value divided by the base value under the same climate change trend the streamflow changes under different land use scenarios are relatively insignificant and the largest annual average flow gap is only 2 65 m3 s in detail compared with other ssp scenarios the streamflows under ssp1 and ssp5 have a greater degree of reduction combining the results in fig 5 the increase in the area of woodland grassland and farmland would cause a decrease in streamflow the increase in vegetation coverage may lead to higher evapotranspiration rate thereby increasing water consumption and reducing streamflow recharge and the streamflow would have a relatively large change chen et al 2020 the results can also show that the glacier area has a greater impact on the streamflow in study area for example under gm the degree of change streamflow would be more significant and the annual average flow would be 1 05 2 65 m3 s smaller than other scenarios the upper reaches of the amu darya river have a high altitude and the glaciers are the important sources of water supply for the river the reduction in the area of glaciers would directly affect the local hydrological process leading to a decrease in streamflow fig 11 shows the comparison of monthly average streamflow under 12 6 climate models under 2 rcp scenarios climate change scenarios when the land use scenarios are the same reflecting the impact of climate change on streamflow the text in the upper left corner of each figure is the climate change scenario under all climate scenarios the monthly streamflow except may june and july would largely reduce compared to that in the baseline and the largest drop up to 60 27 occurs in september under the rcp8 5 scenario of ipsl cm5a lr model the results show that the time of peak flow would gradually advance and during the baseline period the peak flow in the study area appeared in july and august with the increase of temperature under all climate change scenarios melting glaciers would affect the supply of the river and the time of peak flow would also shift the increase in temperature would cause the glaciers to melt earlier thereby the melted water would be supplied to the river in advance temperature and rainfall have significant independent and combined effects on streamflow by comparing the streamflow changes under various climate scenarios the trend of future climate change may lead to a decrease in the monthly average streamflow for instance under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 of the cnrm cm5 model the annual average rainfall would increase by 97 36 mm and 107 35 mm the temperature would also increase by 1 49 c and 1 86 c respectively the monthly average streamflow under cnrm cm5 model would decrease throughout the year the temperature difference of noresm1 m model under the two rcps is not very obvious only 0 13 c but the annual average rainfall difference is 75 29 mm under the rcp4 5 the streamflow reduction is more serious the results reveal that when the temperature changes are similar a small amount of rainfall increase cannot adequately replenish the streamflow resulting in a decrease in streamflow for csiro mk3 6 0 climate model under rcp8 5 the rainfall would increase by 22 87 mm and the temperature would increase by 2 31 c the streamflow would decrease to a large extent fig 10 which shows that when the rainfall changed little the increase of temperature would significantly lead to the decrease of streamflow according to the results in figs 9 11 and tables 1 3 under the combined influence of climate and land use changes streamflow would generally show a downward trend the average annual streamflow under 72 scenarios would be between 244 32 m3 s and 295 98 m3 s compared to 317 03 m3 s in the baseline period among the results the streamflow would decrease the most when the climate scenario is rcp8 5 of the ipsl cm5a lr model and the land use is the gm scenario from the results the streamflow in study area is more sensitive to glacier area and temperature rise compared with the baseline period the future streamflow would increase in may june and july but would shrink significantly in other months the future peak flow would advance and increase the uneven distribution of water resources throughout the year which may cause serious conflicts in water demand table 4 presents the contribution of climate and land use changes to streamflow variability compared with the baseline the results indicate that climate change has a more significant impact on streamflow than land use climate contributes 78 76 to 98 66 of streamflow change in each scenario while the contribution of land use only accounts for 1 34 to 21 24 in detail the reduction of glacier area can increase the impact of land use on streamflow under gm the contribution of land use change to streamflow decline would be greater than that under other land use change scenarios and would even reach 21 24 under rcp8 5 of ipsl cm5a lr model the results show that the glacier area is very important in the snowmelt dominated hydrological system of the study area temperature also has a large impact on the contribution rate which mainly affects streamflow indirectly by changing the glacier area for example in the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the ipsl cm5a lr model the difference in precipitation is only 3 05 mm and the difference in temperature is 0 50 c under the warmer rcp8 5 scenario the contribution of land use to streamflow changes has increased significantly thus temperature also plays a vital role in the change of streamflow in the study area 5 conclusions in this study a multi scenario ensemble streamflow forecast mesf method has been developed to analyze the streamflow processes under land use and climate changes in mesf multiple scenarios concerned future land use and climate changes are examined where ca markov model and multiple gcm are used to simulate these scenarios the swat model is employed to analyze the streamflow variation based on different inputs of land use and meteorological data the streamflow prediction results under each scenario are compared and analyzed to disclose the key factors affecting the hydrological processes mesf has the following advantages i the independent and comprehensive impacts of land use and climate changes on streamflow can be explored ii through the analysis of multiple scenarios and ensemble forecast results it can obtain a certain range of possible flow to reflect the trend of future flow changes iii according to the set extreme scenarios it can analyze future streamflow changes under the impacts of special factors the developed mesf is applied to the upper amu darya river basin central asia to analyze the individual and combined impacts of land use and climate changes on the streamflow the results indicate that i in the future period 2021 2050 the glacier area under the ssp1 5 scenarios would reduce by 2 64 5 90 while the glacier area under the gm scenario would decrease from 13 23 to 0 94 ii under all land use change scenarios cultivated land and urban area would increase by 1 08 2 51 and 0 43 0 85 respectively iii compared with the base period 1957 1986 the average annual rainfall and temperature would increase by 66 99 mm and 2 37 c in 2021 2050 respectively iv the streamflow from 2021 to 2050 would decrease by 21 05 72 71 m3 s compared with the base period with a range of 244 32 295 98 m3 s v in the future the peak flow within a year would gradually shift from summer to spring vi for land use change the streamflow under the gm scenario is 1 05 2 65 m3 s smaller than other scenarios demonstrating that the glacier area reduction would have a greater impact on streamflow vii the decrease in streamflow is more affected by temperature change than rainfall change which also shows that the melting of glaciers caused by climate warming may be the main reason for the decrease of streamflow viii compared to the impact of land use change climate change is the primary reason affecting streamflow variation in the future

4547,sediment deposition has already been considered to be a potential risk to the general running of the three gorges reservoir tgr identifying the sediment sources and their contributions to the tgr is of great significance for the sustainable management of reservoir operation in this study surface sediments of the tgr and its main tributaries were sampled in the flood june to september dry november to next february and even march to may october seasons 2017 2018 together with surrounding upland soils and analyzed for sr nd isotopes and rare earth elements ree the geochemical results showed that εnd 0 values and 87sr 86sr ratios of surface sediments from the tgr mainstream varied from 12 21 to 9 75 and from 0 720241 to 0 726655 respectively all sediment and upland soil samples generally showed the lree enrichment and significant eu depletions three potential sources were identified for the tgr sediments and ranked in the order regional source adjacent tributaries distal source upstream tributaries proximal source upland soil based on the sr nd isotopes and ree parameters isotopic mixing model coupled with monte carlo simulations was firstly applied to quantify source contributions to the tgr sediments among different seasons through monte carlo model simulations the regional source contributed approximately 40 to the tgr sediments during the flood and even seasons but approximately 50 during the dry season the contribution from distal sources arrived at about 30 in the three seasons and 30 from proximal sources during flood and even seasons and 20 in the dry season dam construction was the primary factor affecting the sediment deposition in the tgr and it would further reduce sediment supply from the distal source with the operation of new increasing dams in the upper yangtze river basin hence more attention should be paid to the regional sediment supply of the tgr in the future keywords sr nd isotope compositions rare earth elements surface sediments sediment sources three gorges reservoir 1 introduction sediment accumulation is a common problem faced by many mega dams around world under normal operation gu et al 2011 fan et al 2015 munoz et al 2019 dams are built worldwide to supply multiple services such as flood control hydropower generation water storage for agricultural domestic industrial uses navigation and recreation li et al 2011 tang et al 2016 guo et al 2018 as the significant disturbance by human activities to global rivers dams alter river morphology and geomorphology biogeochemical sequestration and river ecosystem syvitski et al 2005 li et al 2011 fan et al 2015 guo et al 2020 excessive sediment deposition under dam operation leads to the river channel modification sediment transportation tardiness water quality deterioration walling and fang 2003 skalak et al 2013 fan et al 2015 provenance analysis enables us to detect the source areas of sediments and to establish connections between source and sink walsh et al 2016 awasthi et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a therefore it is crucial to determine the provenance of sediment for reservoir system management and operation li et al 2011 yang et al 2014 guo et al 2020 the three gorges reservoir tgr is the world s largest hydropower project and the most important water conservancy regulation scheme bao et al 2015 the total water storage capacity and the flood regulation capacity of this reservoir are 39 3 km3 and 22 1 km3 respectively enabling it to provide hydropower generation disaster reduction navigation improvement fu et al 2010 zhang and lou 2011 since the tgr impoundment in 2003 numerous studies have been undertaken on meteorological change sediment load and river discharge yang et al 2014 2018 tang et al 2016 it was reported that the upper tributaries including jinshajiang minjiang and jialingjiang were a main sediment source zone contributing approximately 80 of the sediment load at yichang fig 1 li et al 2011 wei et al 2014 however a significant change emerged since 2013 when new large dams were putting into operation in jinshajiang river e g xiangjiaba and xiluodu dams guo et al 2019 2020 as the second and third largest hydropower stations of the yangtze river basin xiangjiaba xjb and xiluodu xld dams curtail the sediment deposition to the tgr xu et al 2013 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 concluded that almost 90 of the sediment load can be trapped as the consequence of the operation of these two huge dams the mean annual concentration and flux of sediments dropped by 99 since 2013 due to the successive constructions of mega reservoirs such as jinping 1 xjb and xld yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 peng et al 2020 in addition climate change soil water conservation engineering construction and fluvial sand mining also affect sediment production and transport in the tgr guo et al 2019 chen et al 2019 peng et al 2020 the current status of sediment deposition of the tgr has changed so it is necessary to recognize the source of sediment in the tgr up to now many studies have examined the sediment provenance in the tgr cwrc changjiang water resource commission 2003 2017 yang et al 2007 2014 chen et al 2008 cwrc changjiang water resource commission 2003 2017 calculated the sediment inflow from upstream tributaries but ignored the sediments derived from the ungauged areas within the tgr watershed yang et al 2007 and chen et al 2008 took into account the ungauged areas but they assumed that the ratio of ungauged sediment inflow to gauged sediment inflow remained stable yang et al 2014 estimated the ungauged sediment inflow separately however it was based on the assumption that the larger sediment discharge of sources the larger sediment deposition in the tgr without considering that a part of sediment transported to the downstream the conclusions of the previous studies were drawn only on the basis of hydrological data yang et al 2007 2014 chen et al 2008 moreover most of the previous studies have concentrated on the inter annual variations of river discharge and sediment load whereas intra annual seasonal sediment fluxes are highly variable few attempts have been made to detect the seasonal variations which are also essential to river management and protection xu and milliman 2009 li et al 2011 zhao et al 2015 guo et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to track and quantify the sediment yield and sediment transport at a watershed scale using other ways in different seasons strontium sr and neodymium nd isotopic ratios 87sr 86sr and 143nd 144nd have proven as powerful tracers of sediment provenance water mass and dust transport grousset and biscaye 2005 clinger et al 2016 awasthi et al 2018 hu et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 nd isotopes have no obvious fractionation in the geological process of continental weathering and deposition and is less affected by chemical weathering sediment migration and diagenesis its variation mainly depends on the lithology and geological age of source rocks goldstein et al 1984 grousset and biscaye 2005 bayon et al 2015 compared with nd isotopes sr isotopic methods is not reliable for provenance interpretations because the 87sr 86sr ratios can be affected by mineral sorting during fluvial transport walter et al 2000 garçon et al 2014 awasthi et al 2018 however sr isotopes can still be used to distinguish sediment sources if appropriate grain size 63 μm and silicate fraction are used walter et al 2000 wu et al 2010 deng et al 2019 rare earth elements ree have similar chemical behavior because of their similar ionic radii i e they have low solubility and strong stability in the surficial processes do not easily experience fractionation and are chiefly controlled by source characteristics and therefore have widely been applied to determine the source transport and sink of sediments rao et al 2011 2017 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 nd sr isotopes and ree have been used to the studies of sediments in the upper reaches the delta and even throughout the yangtze river basin and have proven to be a reliable method for studying sediment provenance yang et al 2007 meng et al 2008 wu et al 2010 he et al 2015 bi et al 2017 however few researches have been conducted specifically for the tgr small watershed liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2020b in this study the sr nd isotopes and rare earth elements were examined for mainstream and tributary sediments and upland soils in the tgr basin during the flood dry and even seasons 2017 2018 the main goals were to 1 identify the sediment provenance during different seasons 2 quantify the contribution of each potential source to the tgr sediment and 3 explore the driving force on sediment deposition in the tgr 2 study area 2 1 geological and hydrological settings the tgr is located at the end of the upper yangtze river basin fig 1a this region is characterized by arrays of rolling hills and valleys fig 1c clastic and carbonate rocks are extensively distributed with sporadic outcrops of magmatic and metamorphic rocks in this basin two different subregions depend on regional landform and geology in this region fig 1a the upper middle section is dominated by hilly landscape and underlain by purple and red rocks comprised of sandstone and mudstone the lower section is a mountainous land scape with high mountains and deep incised channels and carbonate rocks composed of limestone and dolomite soils are mainly developed based on weathered rocks in this basin bao et al 2015 the upper yangtze river basin is dominated by a humid subtropical monsoon climate with annual precipitation varying from 200 to 1500 mm tang et al 2016 it is cold in winter with an average temperature of 10 and hot in summer with an average temperature of 28 30 c cnemc china national environmental monitoring centre 1997 2017 june to september is regarded as the flood season while november to next february is considered as the dry season and other months are seen as the even season lou and yin 2016 a great amount of annual precipitation concentrates in the flood seasons and as a result a major portion of streamflow 75 and sediment loads 85 are discharged in the flood seasons xu et al 2010 2 2 tgr operation the tgr was constructed from 1993 to 2009 the tgr lies 185 m above sea level with a bulk volume of 2 67 107 m3 yang et al 2014 the normal water level of the tgr is designed to be 175 m at which the tgr covers the 660 km portion of the original river channel with a surface area of 1084 million m2 fu et al 2010 bao et al 2015 the tgr has a storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 and a flood control capacity of 22 15 billion m3 at a high pool level of 175 m bao et al 2015 guo et al 2018 a strategy of drawing down the reservoir and flushing sediment during the flood season is adopted to prevent flooding and minimize reservoir sediment deposition i e the tgr is designed to draw down the water level from 175 m to 145 m before the arrival of the flood peak and then rise back to 175 m to maximize power generation in the dry season yang et al 2014 this strategy involves the tgr impounding clear water at a peak level of 175 m during the dry season for generating electricity and discharging turbid water at a base level of 145 m during the wet season for flood alleviation fig 2 tgr began to impound water in june 2003 and the water level rose to 139 m by october 2003 it was not until 2006 the initial stage that the water level changed between 136 and 143 m during the second transition period october 2006 to october 2008 the water level fluctuated seasonally between 145 and 156 m fig 2 during the normal stage the water level rose to 173 m in november 2008 and then to 175 m in october 2010 fu et al 2010 morgan et al 2012 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling three field investigations were conducted in the flood jul 2017 dry dec 2017 and even apr 2018 seasons respectively in the three gorges reservoir tgr basin surface sediment samples were collected from the top 5 cm thick layers of the sediment columns taken with a stratified sampler 100 cm in length 5 cm in diameter 5 in weight in the three seasons except that the two samples from the wujiang and longhe were only taken in the even season 2018 fig 1c the upland soil samples were taken from the 10 cm thick surface soil layers with a shovel in the even season 2018 fig 1c all samples were put into polyethylene self sealing bags for preservation in total 23 mainstream sediment samples 29 tributary sediment samples the samples from the second one near the dam during the even season are missing and the samples were collected from the longhe and wujiang only during even season and 10 upland soil samples were collected each sample was divided into two parts one was stored without any treatments for grain size analysis and the other was treated as follows for isotopic and geochemical analyses 3 2 analytical methods for grain size measurement removal of carbonate and organic matter was performed as follows firstly 0 2 g bulk samples 23 tgr mainstream sediment samples 29 tgr tributary sediment samples and 10 upland soil samples was dissolved with 10 ml 10 h2o2 and boiled dry secondly dissolved with 10 ml 0 1 mol l of hcl and boiled dry thirdly distilled water about 200 ml was added and left for 24 h and the upper suspension was poured off then the samples were fully dispersed by the addition of napo3 6 the grain size analysis was measured using a malvern mastersizer 2000 laser instrument malvern co uk at the institute of surficial geochemistry nanjing university china the measuring range of this instrument is 0 02 2000 μm with a size resolution of 0 01φ and the measuring error is 3 before isotope measurement the bulk sediment samples were first sieved to 63 μm for removing grain size and hydraulic sorting which represented the main parts silt and clay fractions these parts were preferentially transported as suspended sediments in riverine lacustrine estuarine and coastal systems laceby et al 2017 then all of the 63 μm samples were pretreated by 1 mol l acetic acid for 24 h at room temperature and thus carbonate compositions and adsorptive components including weakly bound or non detrital fractions can be removed from the bulk samples and then concentrated in the leachates rao et al 2015 bi et al 2015 the residue was heated to dryness weighed burned in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h to remove organic matter deng et al 2019 the mineral composition of the 63 μm residual sample was qualitatively determined with an arl x tra boston massachusetts usa powder x ray diffractometer with cuka radiation a voltage of 40 kv a current intensity of 40 ma and continuous scans of 3 65 2θ at the center of modern analysis nanjing university china the identification of mineral compositions was determined based on the specific diffraction angle of the mineral under x ray diffraction cook et al 1975 rare earth element ree analysis was performed using an agilent 7500a inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms at the university of queensland rif uq australia each sample was dissolved with acid mix 1 1 of distilled hf and hno3 in a high pressure jacket equipped teflon beaker in an oven for 48 h to ensure complete digestion dissolution this procedure was repeated using larger amounts of acids for a further 24 h after digestion the sample was evaporated to incipient dryness refluxed with 6 n hno3 and heated again to incipient dryness the sample was then dissolved in 2 ml 3 n hno3 and diluted with milli q water 18 mω to a final dilution factor of 2000 rock standards w 2 bir 1 and bhvo 2 were used to monitor the analytical accuracy and precision analytical accuracy as indicated by relative difference between measured and recommended values is better than 6 the chemical compositions of the upper continental crust ucc were from taylor and mclennan 1995 respectively ree

anton paar gmbh then diluted to 50 ml with 3 v v hno3 for routine sr nd isotope analysis a tailored column separation protocol involving the use of sr spec tru spec and ln spec resins was used allowing for a large number of samples to be processed in one batch without the need for evaporation in the intermediate stages upon screening of sr nd concentrations in the final separates using the

uncertainties such variability has recently been shown to affect not only the precision of the source apportionment calculations but also the estimated central values e g mean and median of the source fractions to overcome this defect a bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach was implemented in which the end member distributions are modeled as normal distributions with mean and standard

gee and or 2002 the clay 4μm and silt 4 63 μm fractions possessed 17 8 39 4 and 59 9 76 9 respectively the sand fraction 63 μm was as low as below 5 in most of sediment samples most of tgr sediments in the flood and dry season distributed in the area were silty clay loam fig 3 most of tgr sediments in the even season distributed in the area were silt loam fig 3 the upland soil of the tgr was all distributed in the area were silt loam fig 3 x ray powder diffraction xrd analyses showed that common minerals present in the tgr mainstream and tributary sediments included quartz k feldspar plagioclase and clay minerals fig s1 carbonate minerals were not detected by xrd because of the acid pretreatment used in this study 4 2 rare earth elements the total ree concentrations in tgr sediments ranged between 91 30 and 326 48 μg g table s1 the mainstream sediments in the even season had higher ree 182 43 44 51 μg g than those of the other two seasons similarly ree of the tributary sediment in the even season 213 14 49 83 μg g was the highest among three seasons except in the even season the ree concentrations in the mainstream sediments were higher than those in the tributaries compared with sediment samples the upland soil samples had far higher ree concentrations 247 60 120 48 μg g fig 4 ucc normalized ree distribution patterns of the sediment and soil samples were quite homogeneous with enriched light rare earth elements lrees from la to eu relatively flat heavy rare earth elements hrees from gd to lu fig 4 all sediment and upland soil samples generally showed the lree enriched chondrite normalized patterns which was very similar to the whole yangtze river he et al 2015 ucc normalized ree patterns showed hree depleted forms with significant eu depletions the eu

normalized ree distribution patterns of the sediment and soil samples in the tgr also showed significant eu depletions fig 4 which indicated that the intensive weathering eu3 should be transported from sediments at the oxidizing conditions li et al 2017 in addition some elements with similar atomic number of eu also displayed obvious negative anomalies fig 4 eu depletion of the tgr sediments were more significant compared to the whole yangtze river yellow river and taiwanese fluvial sediments yang et al 2002 li et al 2013 this might be because the tgr sediments were finer than the sediments of the entire yangtze river yellow river and taiwanese rivers fig 3 and the fine grains lead to enhanced weathering as evidenced by massive weathering of feldspar resulting in a relative

season 0 7242 0 0016 was a little higher than that of the other two seasons the εnd 0 values in the flood season 11 17 0 66 was the highest among three seasons in general the 87sr 86sr ratios and εnd

and finally uplifting trend in the flood and dry seasons a decrease and uplifting trend in the even season fig 5 the εnd 0 values exhibited a decrease then uplifting and finally decrease trend in the flood dry and even seasons from upper to lower reaches of the tgr fig 5 for the tributary sediments the εnd 0 values and 87sr 86sr ratios ranged from 18 05 to 10 72 and from 0 7190 to 0 7315 respectively table 1 the 87sr 86sr ratios in the flood season 0 7252 0 0023 was higher than those of the other two seasons the εnd 0 values in the dry season 11 83 0 72 was the highest among three

sediments were lower than those of the tributary sediments but were higher than those of the upland soil the εnd 0 values of the mainstream sediments were far lower than those of the tributary sediments and were a bit lower than those of the upland soil table 1 5 discussion 5 1 sr nd isotopic and ree geochemical constraints on the provenance of the tgr sediments according to the analyses of topography and river migration in the tgr the tgr sediments have three main potential sources distal sources the upstream input such as jinshajiang yalongjiang and jialingjiang regional sources adjacent tributaries flowing into the tgr proximal sources upland soils in the tgr basin tang et al 2016 spatial differences of geological and climatic settings throughout the yangtze river basin caused variable sr nd isotopic compositions yang et al 2007 he et al 2015 the distal source showed lower 87sr 86sr ratios than those of the regional and proximal sources table s2 geologically the yangtze river basin consists of variable strata from the archean to the quaternary periods erosions of emeishan basalts from late middle permian to early late permian and younger igneous rocks resulted in low 87sr 86sr ratios of the upstream sediments while more radiogenic sr isotopes of the sediments occurred due to wide outcrops of old metamorphic rocks in the tgr basin yang et al 2007 he et al 2015 the sediments from the upstream jinshajiang yalongjiang daduhe and minjiang whose bedrock include mesozoic and cenozoic igneous rocks and intrusive rock e g emeishan basalts have higher εnd 0 higher than 8 54 yang et al 2007 in particular the emeishan basalt was widely distributed in the yunnan sichuan reach of the yangtze river in humid and warm climate it experienced rapid chemical weathering and its higher nd ratios determine the high εnd 0 value in river sediments yang et al 2007 in contrast the sediments from regional and proximal sources have lower εnd 0 due to the widespread of carbonate rocks from early triassic to middle triassic and quaternary sediments fig 1 the emeishan basalt of distal source were strongly enriched in light ree lree relative to heavy ree hree and displayed moderately sloping hree on chondrite normalized patterns and the light rare earth elements lree enrichment of the basalts preferred a mantle plume origin li et al 2017 compared to emeishan basalt the ree contents in sediments from regional and proximal source were generally lower than that of distal source fig 4 compare to the proximal source quaternary sediments with a weathering velocity of 76 9 mm ka the distal source had a larger 87sr 86sr εnd 0 field as displayed in fig 6 the sediments of the tgr mainstream were located on the right edge of the two source fields the 87sr 86sr εnd 0 range of the regional source varied seasonally fig 6 especially in the dry season the sediments of the tgr mainstream fell in the middle 87sr 86sr εnd 0 range of the regional source implying that the regional source contributed more to the sediment in the tgr in the dry season than in the other two seasons fig 6 in general the sediments of the tgr mainstream were isotopically closer to the range of the regional source suggesting that the regional source could contribute more sediment to the tgr compared to the other two sources fractionation parameters such as la yb ucc gd yb ucc and eu eu were good proxies for identifying the sources of the fluvial sediments rao et al 2011 2017 li et al 2013 during the flood season the tgr mainstream sediments fell on the edge of the three potential source areas which indicated that the three sources contributed to the sediment in the tgr fig 7 during the dry and even season the tgr mainstream sediments were mainly in the ranges of regional and proximal sources fig 7 compared with the proximal source the regional source showed a more restricted range which made it closer to the tgr mainstream sediments range in general the ree results showed that the tgr sediments fell in the range of the three sources indicating that the three sources all contributed to the tgr sediments and the contribution apportionment was not significant 5 2 quantitative evaluation of source apportionment using a mixing model based on a monte carlo approach as discussed in the former paragraph sr nd and ree results showed that there was a large heterogeneity of sediment sources among different seasons in this case in order to deepen the understanding of sediment sources under the tgr operations it was worthwhile to quantitatively calculate the contribution of different potential sources to the tgr sediments based on the monte carlo simulations the sr nd isotope mixing model combined with the monte carlo simulations has been proved to be a powerful tool for quantifying the contributions of sediment sources awasthi et al 2018 deng et al 2019 in this study the average εnd 0 and 87sr 86sr values of seven tributaries jinshajiang yalongjiang minjiang daduhe tuojiang fujiang and jialingjiang in the upper reach of the yangtze river were used to estimate the proportional contribution for the distal source these rivers are characterized by the rugged terrain and fast water flow the quaternary loess deposits outcrop in the upper yangtze river where supply most of sandy sediments into the yangtze river yang et al 2007 those of the eleven tributaries nearby the tgr for the regional source and those of the ten upland soils nearby the tgr for the proximal source fig 8 the εnd 0 and 87sr 86sr of a1 to a8 in the tgr mainstream were averaged to characterize the sediments accumulating in the tgr fig 8 as shown in fig 9 and table 2 the proportional contributions of three potential sources roughly decreased in the following order regional source regional tributaries distal source upstream tributaries proximal source upland soils in detail isotopic mixing model coupled with monte carlo simulations suggested 40 sediment contributions from regional sources to the tgr sediments during flood and even seasons and 50 in the dry season accordingly 30 is contributed from distal sources during three seasons to tgr 30 from proximal sources during flood and even seasons and 20 in the dry season table 2 the εnd 0 and ree parameter la yb ucc were used to check the result of the sr nd calculation and similar results were obtained table s4 the results of cross validation proved the reliability of the results however it should be noted that due to the numbers of source apportionment are stretched too much which cannot be simply replaced by the average value yang et al 2014 estimated that sediment inflow from upstream rivers distal source contributed 86 8 of the total sediment load of the tgr in 2003 2012 based on the hydrological data both the sediment input of the upstream rivers and the sediment deposition of the tgr have decreased sharply since 2013 table s4 and fig s2 the reduction of sediment deposition in the tgr was mainly due to the completion of other mega reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river in recent years yang et al 2018 peng et al 2020 guo et al 2020 a recent study demonstrated that the xiangjiaba dam reduced the sediment flux to 1 7 0 7 mt yr 1 at pingshan in 2013 2017 guo et al 2019 as a result the rates of contribution of regional and proximal sources to the tgr relatively increased seasonally the regional source was slightly higher than the other two sources during the flood period and was evidently higher than the other two sources during the dry and even seasons fig 9 and table 2 the large discharge with the fast flow subsequently carried a large quantity of sediments to the tgr from during the flood season which caused the increasing contribution of distal source nevertheless the distal source was still not the largest sediment contributor due to the obstruction of the upstream dam the frequent occurrence of rainstorm events during flood season brought a large amount of upland soil to the tgr which increased the contribution of proximal source to the tgr 5 3 driving forces of sediment deposition in the tgr the production transport and deposition of fluvial sediments could be affected by geogenic and anthropogenic factors geogenic factors include climate change geology and geomorphology and soil and vegetation anthropogenic factors include reservoir retention land use change soil and water conservation engineering construction and sand mining chen and wang 2019 peng et al 2020 some studies suggested that dam construction climate change and water soil reservation were the important causes of sediment load change in the yangtze river yang et al 2015 peng et al 2020 as shown in fig 10 the influences of precipitation temperature and soil loss on the sediment deposition were small while reservoir capacity had a significant effect on sediment deposition in the tgr sediment deposition reached 1669 1 mt with a mean deposition flux of around 111 3 mt a in the tgr during 2003 2017 cwrc changjiang water resource commission 2003 2017 especially the tgr sediment deposition rate had reduced from 184 3 mt a in 2003 2013 to 41 0 mt a in 2014 2017 table s4 the sharp decline of the sediment deposition since 2014 was mainly attributed to the decreasing sediment load in the distal source such as the jinshajiang and the jialingjiang rivers guo et al 2020 14 624 dams have constructed in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and their total storage capacity increased to approximately 10 000 m3 guo et al 2020 the large reservoirs distributed broadly in the tributaries of the upper yangtze river and their total storage capacity accounted for 86 6 of the total storage capacity of the tgr fig s5 besides many dams constructed in the upper yangtze river since the impoundment of the tgr in 2003 it altered thesediment deposition patterns deeply table 3 among the tributaries of the distal source the jinshajiang river was heavily dammed with some mega reservoirs such as xiangjiaba xiluodu baihetan and wudongde table 3 the total storage capacity of these reservoirs was 44 3 km3 which was even larger than that of the tgr table 3 the sediment supply from the distal source declined sharply after the constructions of these reservoirs therefore the reservoir constructions in the uppestream of the yangtze river play an important role in affecting sediment deposition in the tgr the land use change had implemented widely in the tgr and the upper yangtze river since 2003 particularly in the high sediment yield regions guo et al 2019 huang et al 2019 teng et al 2019 96 200 km2 of the land area subject to serious soil erosion was effectively restored in 1989 2008 147 300 km2 was reforested in 2006 2015 the forest coverage was recovered from 33 8 in 1980 s to 56 2 in 2005 which contributed to the soil conservation and sediment production wei et al 2011 huang et al 2019 consequently the annual amount of soil loss decreased distinctly from 2 44 1010 t to 1 72 1010 t from 2003 to 2015 teng et al 2019 however the poor relationship between total soil loss and tgr sedimentation showed that the land use change was not the driving force on sediment deposition in the tgr some scholars considered that climate change was the important cause of sediment load change in the yangtze river at the decadal time scales yang et al 2015 dai and lu 2014 zhao et al 2015 however the precipitation temperature and runoff in the tgr did not change significantly yang et al 2014 for example the annual average precipitation in wujiang was 1 120 mm during 1987 to 2007 and 1 078 mm during 2008 to 2016 chen et al 2019 the correlation analyses also showed that precipitation temperature did not affect significantly the tgr sediment load in 2003 2017 therefore climate change was not also a major factor controlling the sediment deposition in the tgr with the operation of some mega reservoirs like wudongde and baihetan dams the sediment supply from the upper yangtze river would be further reduced in the coming decades in contrast surface erosion of nearby tributaries and upland soils could gradually become more and more important sources to the tgr sediment deposition 6 conclusion sr nd isotopic and ree geochemical compositions of the fluvial sediments in the tgr mainstream and nearby tributaries together with upland soils in the flood dry and even seasons were systematically investigated the results showed that the 87sr 86sr ratios of the mainstream sediments were lower than those of the nearby tributary sediments but were higher than those of the upland soils the εnd 0 values of the mainstream sediments were far lower than those of the nearby tributary sediments and were a bit lower than those of the upland soils the mainstream and nearby tributary sediments in the even season had a higher rees value than those of the other two seasons while the upland soil had far a higher rees concentration than those of the sediments by comparison with potential sources the tgr sediments originated mainly from the nearby tributaries regional source and partly from the upstream tributaries distal source and the upland soil proximal source in terms of the sr nd isotopic and ree geochemical compositions further the quantitative assessments by the sr nd isotopic mixing model coupled with monte carlo simulations showed the regional source contributed approximately 40 to the tgr sediments during the flood and even seasons but approximately 50 during the dry season the contribution from distal sources arrived at about 30 in the three seasons and 30 from proximal sources during flood and even seasons and 20 in the dry season the sediment supplies from the distal source declined sharply due to the construction of large reservoirs the reservoir constructions of the upstream rivers were the major driving force for the decreasing sediment deposition in the tgr but land use change and climate change were not with the new reservoirs were subsequently put into operation such as wudongde and baihetai the sediment deposition in the tgr could further decrease in the coming decades however surface erosion of nearby tributaries and upland soils is relatively strengthening the sediment deposition in the tgr it is thus critical how to control the water soil loss of the nearby tributaries and upland soils in the tgr from now on credit authorship contribution statement shuai wang conceptualization

4547,sediment deposition has already been considered to be a potential risk to the general running of the three gorges reservoir tgr identifying the sediment sources and their contributions to the tgr

november to next february and even march to may october seasons 2017 2018 together with surrounding upland soils and analyzed for sr nd isotopes and rare earth elements ree the geochemical results showed that εnd 0 values and 87sr 86sr ratios of surface sediments from the tgr mainstream varied from 12 21 to 9 75 and from 0 720241 to 0 726655 respectively all sediment and upland soil samples generally showed the lree enrichment and significant eu depletions three potential sources were identified for the tgr sediments and ranked in the order regional source adjacent tributaries distal source upstream tributaries proximal source upland soil based on the sr nd isotopes and ree parameters isotopic mixing model coupled with monte carlo simulations was firstly applied to quantify source contributions to the tgr sediments among different seasons through monte carlo model simulations the regional source contributed approximately 40 to the tgr sediments during the flood and even seasons but approximately 50 during the dry season the contribution from distal sources arrived at about 30 in the three seasons and 30 from proximal sources during flood and even seasons and 20 in the dry season dam construction was the primary factor affecting the sediment deposition in the tgr and it would further reduce sediment supply from the distal source with the operation of new increasing dams

al 2020 the three gorges reservoir tgr is the world s largest hydropower project and the most important water conservancy regulation scheme bao et al 2015 the total water storage capacity and the

2011 since the tgr impoundment in 2003 numerous studies have been undertaken on meteorological change sediment load and river discharge yang et al 2014 2018 tang et al 2016 it was reported that the upper tributaries including jinshajiang minjiang and jialingjiang were a main sediment source zone contributing approximately 80 of the sediment load at yichang fig 1 li et al 2011 wei et al 2014 however a significant change emerged since 2013 when new large dams were putting into operation in jinshajiang river e g xiangjiaba and xiluodu dams guo et al 2019 2020 as the second and third largest hydropower stations of the yangtze river basin xiangjiaba xjb and xiluodu xld dams curtail the sediment deposition to the tgr xu et al 2013 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 concluded that almost 90 of the sediment load can be trapped as the consequence of the operation of these two huge dams the mean annual concentration and flux of sediments dropped by 99 since 2013 due to the successive constructions of mega reservoirs such as jinping 1 xjb and xld yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 peng et al 2020 in addition climate change soil water conservation engineering construction and fluvial sand mining also affect sediment production and transport in the tgr guo et al 2019 chen et al 2019 peng et al 2020 the current status of sediment deposition of the tgr has changed so it is necessary to recognize the source of sediment in the tgr up to now many studies have examined the sediment provenance in the tgr cwrc changjiang water resource commission 2003 2017 yang et al 2007 2014 chen et al 2008 cwrc changjiang water resource commission 2003 2017 calculated the sediment inflow from upstream tributaries but ignored the sediments derived from the ungauged areas within the tgr watershed yang et al 2007 and chen et al 2008 took into account the ungauged areas but they assumed that the ratio of ungauged sediment inflow to gauged sediment inflow remained stable yang et al 2014 estimated the ungauged sediment inflow separately however it was based on the assumption that the larger sediment discharge of sources the larger sediment deposition in the tgr without considering that a part of sediment transported to the downstream the conclusions of the previous studies were drawn only on the basis of hydrological data yang et al 2007 2014 chen et al 2008 moreover most of the previous studies have concentrated on the inter annual variations of river discharge and sediment load whereas intra annual seasonal sediment fluxes are highly variable few attempts have been made to detect the seasonal variations which are also essential to river management and protection xu and milliman 2009 li et al 2011 zhao et al 2015 guo et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to track and quantify the sediment yield and sediment transport at a watershed scale using other ways in different seasons strontium sr and neodymium nd isotopic ratios 87sr 86sr and 143nd 144nd have proven as powerful

the geological process of continental weathering and deposition and is less affected by chemical weathering sediment migration and diagenesis its variation mainly depends on the lithology and geological age of source rocks goldstein et al 1984 grousset and biscaye 2005 bayon et al 2015 compared with nd isotopes sr isotopic methods is not reliable for provenance interpretations because the 87sr 86sr ratios can be affected by mineral sorting during fluvial transport walter et al 2000 garçon et al 2014 awasthi et al 2018 however sr isotopes can still be used to distinguish sediment sources if appropriate grain size 63 μm and silicate fraction are used walter et al 2000 wu et al 2010 deng et al 2019 rare earth elements ree have similar chemical behavior because of their similar ionic radii i e they have low solubility and strong stability in the surficial processes do not easily experience fractionation and are chiefly controlled by source characteristics and therefore have widely been applied to determine the source transport and sink of sediments rao et al 2011 2017 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 nd sr isotopes and ree have been used to the studies of sediments in the upper reaches the delta and even throughout the yangtze river basin and have proven to be a reliable method for studying sediment provenance yang et al 2007 meng et al 2008 wu et al 2010 he et al 2015 bi et al 2017 however few researches have been conducted specifically for the tgr small watershed liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2020b in this study the sr nd isotopes and rare earth elements were examined for mainstream and tributary sediments and upland soils in the tgr basin during the flood dry and even seasons 2017 2018 the main goals were to 1 identify the sediment provenance during different seasons 2 quantify the contribution of each potential source to the tgr sediment and 3 explore the driving force on sediment deposition in the tgr 2 study area 2 1 geological and hydrological settings the tgr is located at the end of the upper yangtze river basin fig 1a this region is characterized by arrays of rolling hills and valleys fig 1c clastic and carbonate rocks are extensively distributed with sporadic outcrops of magmatic and metamorphic rocks in this basin two different subregions depend on regional landform and geology in this region fig 1a the upper middle section is dominated by hilly landscape and underlain by purple and red rocks comprised of sandstone and mudstone the lower section is a mountainous land scape with high mountains and deep incised channels and carbonate rocks composed of limestone and dolomite soils are mainly developed based on weathered rocks in this basin bao et al 2015 the upper yangtze river basin is dominated by a humid subtropical monsoon climate with annual precipitation varying from 200 to 1500 mm tang et al 2016 it is cold in winter with an average temperature of 10 and hot in summer with an average temperature of 28 30 c cnemc china national environmental monitoring centre 1997 2017 june to september is regarded as the flood season while november to next february is considered as the dry season and other months are seen as the even season lou and yin 2016 a great amount of annual precipitation concentrates in the flood seasons and as a result a major portion of streamflow 75 and sediment loads 85 are discharged in the flood seasons xu et al 2010 2 2 tgr operation the tgr was constructed from 1993 to 2009 the tgr lies 185 m above sea level with a bulk volume of 2 67 107 m3 yang et al 2014 the normal water level of the tgr is designed to be 175 m at which the tgr covers the 660 km portion of the original river channel with a surface area of 1084 million m2 fu et al 2010 bao et al 2015 the tgr has a storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 and a flood control capacity of 22 15 billion m3 at a high pool level of 175 m bao et al 2015 guo et al 2018 a strategy of drawing down the reservoir and flushing sediment during the flood season is adopted to prevent flooding and minimize reservoir sediment deposition i e the tgr is designed to draw down the water level from 175 m to 145 m before the arrival of the flood peak and then rise back to 175 m to maximize power generation in the dry season yang et al 2014 this strategy involves the tgr impounding clear water at a peak level of 175 m during the dry season for generating electricity and discharging turbid water at a base level of 145 m during the wet season for flood alleviation fig 2 tgr began to impound water in june 2003 and the water level rose to 139 m by october 2003 it was not until 2006 the initial stage that the water level changed between 136 and 143 m during the second transition period october 2006 to october 2008 the water level fluctuated seasonally between 145 and 156 m fig 2 during the normal stage the water level rose to 173 m in november 2008 and then to 175 m in october 2010 fu et al 2010 morgan et al 2012 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling three field investigations were conducted in the flood jul 2017 dry dec 2017 and even apr 2018 seasons respectively in the three gorges reservoir tgr basin surface sediment samples were collected from the top 5 cm thick layers of the sediment columns taken with a stratified sampler 100 cm in length 5 cm in diameter 5 in weight in the three seasons except that the two samples from the wujiang and longhe were only taken in the even season 2018 fig 1c the upland soil samples were taken from the 10 cm thick surface soil layers with a shovel in the even season 2018 fig 1c all samples were put into polyethylene self sealing bags for preservation in total 23 mainstream sediment samples 29 tributary sediment samples the samples from the second one near the dam during the even season are missing and the samples were collected from the longhe and wujiang only during even season and 10 upland soil samples were collected each sample was divided into two parts one was stored without any treatments for grain size analysis and the other was treated as follows for isotopic and geochemical analyses 3 2 analytical methods for grain size measurement removal of carbonate and organic matter was performed as follows firstly 0 2 g bulk samples 23 tgr mainstream sediment samples 29 tgr tributary sediment samples and 10 upland soil samples was dissolved with 10 ml 10 h2o2 and boiled dry secondly dissolved with 10 ml 0 1 mol l of hcl and boiled dry thirdly distilled water about 200 ml was added and left for 24 h and the upper suspension was poured off then the samples were fully dispersed by the addition of napo3 6 the grain size analysis was measured using a malvern mastersizer 2000 laser instrument malvern co uk at the institute of surficial geochemistry nanjing university china the measuring range of this instrument is 0 02 2000 μm with a size resolution of 0 01φ and the measuring error is 3 before isotope measurement the bulk sediment samples were first sieved to 63 μm for removing grain size and hydraulic sorting which represented the main parts silt and clay fractions these parts were preferentially transported as suspended sediments in riverine lacustrine estuarine and coastal systems laceby et al 2017 then all of the 63 μm samples were pretreated by 1 mol l acetic acid for 24 h at room temperature and thus carbonate compositions and adsorptive components including weakly bound or non detrital fractions can be removed from the bulk samples and then concentrated in the leachates rao et al 2015 bi et al 2015 the

gee and or 2002 the clay 4μm and silt 4 63 μm fractions possessed 17 8 39 4 and 59 9 76 9 respectively the sand fraction 63 μm was as low as below 5 in most of sediment samples most of tgr sediments in the flood and dry season distributed in the area were silty clay loam fig 3 most of tgr sediments in the even season distributed in the area were silt loam fig 3 the upland soil of the tgr was all distributed in the area were silt loam fig 3 x ray powder diffraction xrd analyses showed that common minerals present in the tgr mainstream and tributary sediments included quartz k feldspar plagioclase and clay minerals fig s1 carbonate minerals were not detected by xrd because of the acid pretreatment used in this study 4 2 rare earth elements the total ree concentrations in tgr sediments ranged between 91 30 and 326 48 μg g table s1 the mainstream sediments in the even season had higher ree 182 43 44 51 μg g than those of the other two seasons similarly ree of the tributary sediment in the even season 213 14 49 83 μg g was the highest among three seasons except in the even season the ree concentrations in the mainstream sediments were higher than those in the tributaries compared with sediment samples the upland soil samples had far higher ree concentrations 247 60 120 48 μg g fig 4 ucc normalized ree distribution patterns of the sediment and soil samples were quite homogeneous with enriched light rare earth elements lrees from la to eu relatively flat heavy rare earth elements hrees from gd to lu fig 4 all sediment and upland soil samples generally showed the lree enriched chondrite normalized patterns which was very similar to the whole yangtze river he et al 2015 ucc normalized ree patterns showed hree depleted forms with significant eu depletions the eu

normalized ree distribution patterns of the sediment and soil samples in the tgr also showed significant eu depletions fig 4 which indicated that the intensive weathering eu3 should be transported from sediments at the oxidizing conditions li et al 2017 in addition some elements with similar atomic number of eu also displayed obvious negative anomalies fig 4 eu depletion of the tgr sediments were more significant compared to the whole yangtze river yellow river and taiwanese fluvial sediments yang et al 2002 li et al 2013 this might be because the tgr sediments were finer than the sediments of the entire yangtze river yellow river and taiwanese rivers fig 3 and the fine grains lead to enhanced weathering as evidenced by massive weathering of feldspar resulting in a relative enrichment of quartz fig s1 taylor and mclennan 1985 suggested that the higher the quartz content the more pronounced the eu negative anomaly of the sediments la yb ucc la sm ucc and gd yb ucc are the

for the mainstream sediments the εnd 0 values and 87sr 86sr ratios vary from 12 21 to 9 75 and from 0 7202 to 0 7267 respectively table 1 as shown in fig 5 a and c the 87sr 86sr ratios in the dry season 0 7242 0 0016 was a little higher than that of the other two seasons the εnd 0 values in the flood season 11 17 0 66 was the highest among three seasons in general the 87sr 86sr ratios and εnd

and finally uplifting trend in the flood and dry seasons a decrease and uplifting trend in the even season fig 5 the εnd 0 values exhibited a decrease then uplifting and finally decrease trend in the flood dry and even seasons from upper to lower reaches of the tgr fig 5 for the tributary sediments the εnd 0 values and 87sr 86sr ratios ranged from 18 05 to 10 72 and from 0 7190 to 0 7315 respectively table 1 the 87sr 86sr ratios in the flood season 0 7252 0 0023 was higher than those of the other two seasons the εnd 0 values in the dry season 11 83 0 72 was the highest among three seasons fig 5 from upper to lower reaches of the tgr the 87sr 86sr ratios showed a gradual increase in the flood season a stable and then uplifting trend in the dry season a decreasing and then increasing trend in the even season fig 5 the εnd 0 values exhibited a stable and then decreasing trend in the flood season uplifting and gradually decreasing trend in the dry season a gradually increasing trend in the even season fig 5 for upland soil the εnd 0 values showed a uplifting then decrease gradually and finally increasing trend from upper to lower reaches of the tgr with the range of between 15 25 and 8 96 and the 87sr 86sr ratios showed a decreasing then uplifting and finally decreasing trend with a range of 0 7160 to 0 7242 fig 5 overall the 87sr 86sr ratios of the mainstream sediments were lower than those of the tributary sediments but were higher than those of the upland soil the εnd 0 values of the mainstream sediments were far lower than those of the tributary sediments and were a bit lower than those of the upland soil table 1 5 discussion 5 1 sr nd isotopic and ree geochemical constraints on the provenance of the tgr sediments according to the analyses of topography and river migration in the tgr the tgr sediments have three main potential sources distal sources the upstream input such as jinshajiang yalongjiang and jialingjiang regional sources adjacent tributaries flowing into the tgr proximal sources upland soils in the tgr basin tang et al 2016 spatial differences of geological and climatic settings throughout the yangtze river basin caused variable sr nd isotopic compositions yang et al 2007 he et al 2015 the distal source showed lower 87sr 86sr ratios than those of the regional and proximal sources table s2 geologically the yangtze river basin consists of variable strata from the archean to the quaternary periods erosions of emeishan basalts from late middle permian to early late permian and younger igneous rocks resulted in low 87sr 86sr ratios of the upstream sediments while more radiogenic sr isotopes of the sediments occurred due to wide outcrops of old metamorphic rocks in the tgr basin yang et al 2007 he et al 2015 the sediments from the upstream jinshajiang yalongjiang daduhe and minjiang whose bedrock include mesozoic and cenozoic igneous rocks and intrusive rock e g emeishan basalts have higher εnd 0 higher than 8 54 yang et al 2007 in particular the emeishan basalt was widely distributed in the yunnan sichuan reach of the yangtze river in humid and warm climate it experienced rapid chemical weathering and its higher nd ratios determine the high εnd 0 value in river sediments yang et al 2007 in contrast the sediments from regional and proximal sources have lower εnd 0 due to the widespread of carbonate rocks from early triassic to middle triassic and quaternary sediments fig 1 the emeishan basalt of distal source were strongly enriched in light ree lree relative to heavy ree hree and displayed moderately sloping hree on chondrite normalized patterns and the light rare earth elements lree enrichment of the basalts preferred a mantle plume origin li et al 2017 compared to emeishan basalt the ree contents in sediments from regional and proximal source were generally lower than that of distal source fig 4 compare to the proximal source quaternary sediments with a weathering velocity of 76 9 mm ka the distal source had a larger 87sr 86sr εnd 0 field as displayed in fig 6 the sediments of the tgr mainstream were located on the right edge of the two source fields the 87sr 86sr εnd 0 range of the regional source varied seasonally fig 6 especially in the dry season the sediments of the tgr mainstream fell in the middle 87sr 86sr εnd 0 range of the regional source implying that the regional source contributed more to the sediment in the tgr in the dry season than in the other two seasons fig 6 in general the sediments of the tgr mainstream were isotopically closer to the range of the regional source suggesting that the regional source could contribute more sediment to the tgr compared to the other two sources fractionation parameters such as la yb ucc gd yb ucc and eu eu were good proxies for identifying the sources of the fluvial sediments rao et al 2011 2017 li et al 2013 during the flood season the tgr mainstream sediments fell on the edge of the three potential source areas which indicated that the three sources contributed to the sediment in the tgr fig 7 during the dry and even season the tgr mainstream sediments were mainly in the ranges of regional and proximal sources fig 7 compared with the proximal source the regional source showed a more restricted range which made it closer to the tgr mainstream sediments range in general the ree results showed that the tgr sediments fell in the range of the three sources indicating that the three sources all contributed to the tgr sediments and the contribution apportionment was not significant 5 2 quantitative evaluation of source apportionment using a mixing model based on a monte carlo approach as discussed in the former paragraph sr nd and ree results showed that there was a large heterogeneity of sediment sources among different seasons in this case in order to deepen the understanding of sediment sources under the tgr operations it was worthwhile to quantitatively calculate the contribution of different potential sources to the tgr sediments based on the monte carlo simulations the sr nd isotope mixing model combined with the monte carlo simulations has been proved to be a powerful tool for quantifying the contributions of sediment sources awasthi et al 2018 deng et al 2019 in this study the average εnd 0 and 87sr 86sr values of seven tributaries jinshajiang yalongjiang minjiang daduhe tuojiang fujiang and jialingjiang in the upper reach of the yangtze river were used to estimate the proportional contribution for the distal source these rivers are characterized by the rugged terrain and fast water flow the quaternary loess deposits outcrop in the upper yangtze river where supply most of sandy sediments into the yangtze river yang et al 2007 those of the eleven tributaries nearby the tgr for the regional source and those of the ten upland soils nearby the tgr for the proximal source fig 8 the εnd 0 and 87sr 86sr of a1 to a8 in the tgr mainstream were averaged to characterize the sediments accumulating in the tgr fig 8 as shown in fig 9 and table 2 the proportional contributions of three potential sources roughly decreased in the following order regional source regional tributaries distal source upstream tributaries proximal source upland soils in detail isotopic mixing model coupled with monte carlo simulations suggested 40 sediment contributions from regional sources to the tgr sediments during flood and even seasons and 50 in the dry season accordingly 30 is contributed from distal sources during three seasons to tgr 30 from proximal sources during flood and even seasons and 20 in the dry season table 2 the εnd 0 and ree parameter la yb ucc were used to check the result of the sr nd calculation and similar results were obtained table s4 the results of cross validation proved the reliability of the results however it should be noted that due to the numbers of source apportionment are stretched too much which cannot be simply replaced by the average value yang et al 2014 estimated that sediment inflow from upstream rivers distal source contributed 86 8 of the total sediment load of the tgr in 2003 2012 based on the hydrological data both the sediment input of the upstream rivers and the sediment deposition of the tgr have decreased sharply since 2013 table s4 and fig s2 the reduction of sediment deposition in the tgr was mainly due to the completion of other mega reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river in recent years yang et al 2018 peng et al 2020 guo et al 2020 a recent study demonstrated that the xiangjiaba dam reduced the sediment flux to 1 7 0 7 mt yr 1 at pingshan in 2013 2017 guo et al 2019 as a result the rates of contribution of regional and proximal sources to the tgr relatively increased seasonally the regional source was slightly higher than the other two sources during the flood period and was evidently higher than the other two sources during the dry and even seasons fig 9 and table 2 the large discharge with the fast flow subsequently carried a large quantity of sediments to the tgr from during the flood season which caused the increasing contribution of distal source nevertheless the distal source was still not the largest sediment contributor due to the obstruction of the upstream dam the frequent occurrence of rainstorm events during flood season brought a large amount of upland soil to the tgr which increased the contribution of proximal source to the tgr 5 3 driving forces of sediment deposition in the tgr the production transport and deposition of fluvial sediments could be affected by geogenic and anthropogenic factors geogenic factors include climate change geology and geomorphology and soil and vegetation anthropogenic factors include reservoir retention land use change soil and water conservation engineering construction and sand mining chen and wang 2019 peng et al 2020 some studies suggested that dam construction climate change and water soil reservation were the important causes of sediment load change in the yangtze river yang et al 2015 peng et al 2020 as shown in fig 10 the influences of precipitation temperature and soil loss on the sediment deposition were small while reservoir capacity had a significant effect on sediment deposition in the tgr sediment deposition reached 1669 1 mt with a mean deposition flux of around 111 3 mt a in the tgr during 2003 2017 cwrc changjiang water resource commission 2003 2017 especially the tgr sediment deposition rate had reduced from 184 3 mt a in 2003 2013 to 41 0 mt a in 2014 2017 table s4 the sharp decline of the sediment deposition since 2014 was mainly attributed to the decreasing sediment load in the distal source such as the jinshajiang and the jialingjiang rivers guo et al 2020 14 624 dams have constructed in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and their total storage capacity increased to approximately 10 000 m3 guo et al 2020 the large reservoirs distributed broadly in the tributaries of the upper yangtze river and their total storage capacity accounted for 86 6 of the total storage capacity of the tgr fig s5 besides many dams constructed in the upper yangtze river since the impoundment of the tgr in 2003 it altered thesediment deposition patterns deeply table 3 among the tributaries of the distal source the jinshajiang river was heavily dammed with some mega reservoirs such as xiangjiaba xiluodu baihetan and wudongde table 3 the total storage capacity of these reservoirs was 44 3 km3 which was even larger than that of the tgr table 3 the sediment supply from the distal source declined sharply after the constructions of these reservoirs therefore the reservoir constructions in the uppestream of the yangtze river play an important role in affecting sediment deposition in the tgr the land use change had implemented widely in the tgr and the upper yangtze river since 2003 particularly in the high sediment yield regions guo et al 2019 huang et al 2019 teng et al 2019 96 200 km2 of the land area subject to serious soil erosion was effectively restored in 1989 2008 147 300 km2 was reforested in 2006 2015 the forest coverage was recovered from 33 8 in 1980 s to 56 2 in 2005 which contributed to the soil conservation and sediment production wei et al 2011 huang et al 2019 consequently the annual amount of soil loss decreased distinctly from 2 44 1010 t to 1 72 1010 t from 2003 to 2015 teng et al 2019 however the poor relationship between total soil loss and tgr sedimentation showed that the land use change was not the driving force on sediment deposition in the tgr some scholars considered that climate change was the important cause of sediment load change in the yangtze river at the decadal time scales yang et al 2015 dai and lu 2014 zhao et al 2015 however the precipitation temperature and runoff in the tgr did not change significantly yang et al 2014 for example the annual average precipitation in wujiang was 1 120 mm during 1987 to 2007 and 1 078 mm during 2008 to 2016 chen et al 2019 the correlation analyses also showed that precipitation temperature did not affect significantly the tgr sediment load in 2003 2017 therefore climate change was not also a major factor controlling the sediment deposition in the tgr with the operation of some mega reservoirs like wudongde and baihetan dams the sediment supply from the upper yangtze river would be further reduced in the coming decades in contrast surface erosion of nearby tributaries and upland soils could gradually become more and more important sources to the tgr sediment deposition 6 conclusion sr nd isotopic and ree geochemical compositions of the fluvial sediments in the tgr mainstream and nearby tributaries together with upland soils in the flood dry and even seasons were systematically investigated the results showed that the 87sr 86sr ratios of the mainstream sediments were lower than those of the nearby tributary sediments but were higher than those of the upland soils the εnd 0 values of the mainstream sediments were far lower than those of the nearby tributary sediments and were a bit lower than those of the upland soils the mainstream and nearby tributary sediments in the even season had a higher rees value than those of the other two seasons while the upland soil had far a higher rees concentration than those of the sediments by comparison with potential sources the tgr sediments originated mainly from the nearby tributaries regional source and partly from the upstream tributaries distal source and the upland soil proximal source in terms of the sr nd isotopic and ree geochemical compositions further the quantitative assessments by the sr nd isotopic mixing model coupled with monte carlo simulations showed the regional source contributed approximately 40 to the tgr sediments during the flood and even seasons but approximately 50 during the dry season the contribution from distal sources arrived at about 30 in the three seasons and 30 from proximal sources during flood and even seasons and 20 in the dry season the sediment supplies from the distal source declined sharply due to the construction of large reservoirs the reservoir constructions of the upstream rivers were the major driving force for the decreasing sediment deposition in the tgr but land use change and climate change were not with the new reservoirs were subsequently put into operation such as wudongde and baihetai the sediment deposition in the tgr could further decrease in the coming decades however surface erosion of nearby tributaries and upland soils is relatively strengthening the sediment deposition in the tgr it is thus critical how to control the water soil loss of the nearby tributaries and upland soils in the tgr from now on credit authorship contribution statement shuai wang conceptualization

4548,this study proposes a complex networks based method to determine the connections among the stations in a streamflow monitoring network and assess the importance of the individual stations for implementation 13 streamflow stations in the pyeongchang river basin in south korea are studied and daily flow discharge data are analyzed three different centrality measures are employed to identify the connections in the streamflow network degree centrality closeness centrality and betweenness centrality the links between the nodes can significantly change depending upon the centrality method used and the threshold considered therefore an integrated centrality method is proposed using a bayesian network the integrated centrality results show that stations situated along the main stream in the middle of the basin have high centrality while the tributary stations have low centrality to assess the importance of stations the integrated centrality is used with community based clusters this assessment on the importance of the individual streamflow stations through their centrality is useful to establish strategies for their effective and efficient maintenance keywords streamflow monitoring network complex networks bayesian network integrated centrality community structure 1 introduction streamflow data are important for a wide range of purposes in hydrology and water resources including for flood forecasting and warning reservoir operation and water resources assessment streamflow monitoring stations have and continue to be installed for measuring streamflow at high spatial and temporal resolutions as much as possible however consistent and continuous maintenance of the stations is highly challenging due to issues related to the measurement technology and estimation techniques installation and maintenance costs and loss of stations due to severe floods among others many countries around the world are now gradually reducing the number of streamflow stations due to difficulties in maintaining the stations on a regular basis or for economic reasons pearson 1998 world meteorological organization 2008 reliable assessment of the importance of the individual streamflow stations is required for managing them and the resulting hydrological data in an economic and efficient way strategies that fully reflect the relative importance of a given station in a network of stations are necessary and such strategies should also have practical relevance wahl and crippen 1984 proposed one of the most well known methods for assessing the importance of streamflow stations which is widely applied throughout the world with appropriate modifications for different situations in different countries they introduced six categories for the assessment of streamflow stations characteristics of site existing and potential beneficial uses of water magnitude of water resource problems data uses for planning data uses for management and economics they conducted a quantitative assessment for target stations assigned with relative scores their approach however clearly has some limitations for example since streamflow values at a station are directly influenced by events in upstream station s streamflow stations in a basin are very much interlinked to one another at least in the direction of flow of water consequently instead of considering the stations individually a holistic approach to basin management should be used to measure the relative importance of stations in a streamflow network such an approach to measure the relative importance of stations should obviously take into account the interconnections among the stations in this context the concepts of network theory especially the recent developments of complex networks can be particularly useful a network is a set of points nodes or vertices joined together by a set of lines links or edges in the specific context of streamflow many studies have applied networks based approaches to find the spatial or temporal relationship of streamflow malik et al 2012 sivakumar 2015 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2015 halverson and fleming 2015 jha et al 2015 braga et al 2016 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 fang et al 2017 konapala and mishra 2017 jha and sivakumar 2017 naufan et al 2018 tiwari et al 2019 the approaches evolved into the complex networks concepts to identify the topology and characteristics of the streamflow network in a basin level han et al 2018 yasmin and sivakumar 2018 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 alarcón and lozano 2019 these studies have shown that the concepts of network theory especially complex networks are useful and effective for understanding the complex nonlinear and dynamically evolving hydrologic systems and the associated processes for instance the many centrality estimation methods developed within the context of network theory can be useful for identifying stations with higher importance in a complex streamflow network however centrality may differ with the structural attributes of a network e g due to the various scenarios and environments appearing in complex networks therefore different results can be created with different criteria for similar streamflow data as is clear from many past studies sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 halverson and fleming 2015 fang et al 2017 han et al 2018 yasmin and sivakumar 2018 therefore the decision to select the optimal centrality result is very difficult resolving this issue is an important and yet a challenging problem the present study addresses this issue using a bayesian network to measure the integrated centrality the bayesian network provides a representative stochastic graph model network and supports efficient and optimal decision making in integrating different information castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 henriksen and barlebo 2008 the approach adopted in this study is to solve the problems as follows first the concepts of complex networks are used to analyze the complex structure of a streamflow network centrality of streamflow data from each streamflow station is measured based on three representative centrality estimation methods degree centrality closeness centrality and betweenness centrality then a bayesian network is used to combine the centrality scores to produce the integrated centrality finally a method is also proposed to determine the importance of each station through clustering using community detection of complex network theory for maintenance management the proposed approach for the efficient management of the streamflow stations is implemented on the streamflow monitoring network of 13 stations located in the pyeongchang river south korea 2 basic theories 2 1 network and centrality a network or graph is a set of points called nodes or vertices that are joined together via connections called links or edges as shown in fig 1 mathematically a network can be represented as g p e where p is a set of n nodes

graph is determined by whether or not a direction is given saber and murray 2003 a binary graph and valued graph are determined by the relation between connecting lines rajkumar et al 2015 and a connected or disconnected graph is determined by link connectivity ray 2013 a range of methods can be used for the analysis of network characteristics in consideration of such complex networks see newman 2010 and estrada 2012 for more details centrality can be defined as an indicator of closeness of a node e g streamflow station to the center of a network centrality analysis is used to identify the nodes that play an important or more prominent role in a given network as well as the different closeness levels of nodes to the center in short the meaning of centrality are indicators of the importance of nodes high centrality of stations in streamflow network means that the importance is also high because they have key positions within the river basin the value of centrality is greater than or equal to 0 as a dimensionless value there are several types of centrality however the basic indicators used for centrality analysis are degree centrality closeness centrality and betweenness centrality freeman 1979 these indicators are defined in table 1 and are described next 1 degree centrality degree centrality is a measure of the number of links of a node to all the other nodes in a network this type of centrality is based on the assumption that more autonomy and power are assigned to a node with more connections degree centrality includes two types of measures one for absolute centrality and the other for relative centrality the absolute centrality is basically the number of connections to a node while the absolute centrality as a measure of network connections is useful it has certain limitations since different networks may have different number of nodes for instance if a network with 100 nodes has a node a with an absolute degree centrality of 30 and another network with 50 nodes has a node b with an absolute degree centrality of 20 then one cannot simply say that the connectivity of a is stronger than that of b based only on the number of connections without giving due consideration to the network size to overcome this problem the relative degree centrality is more useful for relative centrality the absolute values are normalized and measured in an interval of 0 to 1 in the present study the relative degree centrality is used the relative degree centrality of node i can be calculated as follows 1 dc d i n 1 where di is the degree to which a node is connected to another absolute degree centrality and n is the total number of nodes in the network 2 closeness centrality the closeness centrality of a node is its adjacency to another node based on their distance a node has a higher closeness score when the sum of its distances to all the other nodes in a network is lower this means that the node with the highest closeness value has the shortest connection distances to all the other nodes in the network like degree centrality closeness centrality includes absolute closeness centrality and relative closeness centrality however as the absolute measure does not consider the number of nodes in a network relative closeness centrality i e with normalization is more useful and thus is used in this study it can be expressed as follows 2 cc d i j 1 n d ij where d i j is the sum of the distances to node i and node j and n is the total number of nodes 3 betweenness centrality betweenness centrality is the extent to which one node lies on paths between the other nodes in a network vectors on paths can have a great influence on the control of information flow the betweenness centrality shows how much a node acts as an intermediary or a bridge in constructing a network with the other nodes such nodes can ensure strong connectivity of the whole network for example when node y lies on the shortest path geodesic between two non neighboring nodes the betweenness centrality of the node becomes higher because the node plays the role of a vector for node x and node z however if there are multiple geodesics between node x and node z node y can have a lower betweenness centrality because it is calculated as one of the shortest paths as a result the betweenness centrality of node y can be defined as the percentage of geodesics that passes through node y to the total number of geodesics between node x and node y this is expressed as follows 3 bc j k g jk i g jk j k i j k i n this equation represents a set of n nodes node j and node k are a pair that has the shortest path except for any pairs with node i in the network the term g j k is the number of geodesics that lie on the paths between node j and node k and g j k i is the number of geodesics between the two nodes that passes through node i 2 2 bayesian network a bayesian network bn is a type of probabilistic graphical model that can represent relationships among variables even when there is uncertainty between them the network is a directed acyclic graph dag made up of nodes and links and is useful in that it can integrate diverse sources and types of variables into a uniform structure relations among nodes can be explained with the conditional probability distribution cpd which considers the dependency between them jensen 1996 pearl 2014 kim et al 2018 joo et al 2019a 2019b 2021 let us consider a graph with three nodes x 1 x 2 x 3 that follow a conditional probability distribution as shown in fig 2 the prior probability or parent nodes x 1 x 2 depend on the conditional probability of the posterior probability or child nodes x 2 x 3 the overall joint probability distribution can be presented as follows 4 p x 1 x 2 x 3 p x 3 x 1 x 2 p x 2 x 1 p x 1 unlike the case shown in fig 2 nodes without a connection cannot be applied to eq 4 as a result a joint probability distribution with variables x 1 x 2 x n can be represented as 5 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i α i where α i is a set of parent nodes of x i and p x 1 x 2 x n remains normalized due to the normalized prior distribution importantly a node in a bayesian network corresponds to a single variable therefore a set of correlated random variables and vector valued variables that are represented by nodes in a graph are treated equal and this sequence of steps can be implemented by a graphical model bishop 2006 in other words a graph can show different types of event and can be optimized and integrated decision making with the formation of a single model using these characteristics it is possible to derive the integrated centrality post probability according to the frequency conditional probability of various centralities prior probabilities assigned to streamflow stations 3 application and results 3 1 study area and materials in this study the pyeongchang river basin in gangwon do south korea see fig 3 a major tributary of flowing into the han river is considered for implementation of the network methodology the pyeongchang river is situated in the central east of the korean peninsula at longitude 128 02 129 01 e and latitude 37 41 37 48 n due to frequent flood damage in the pyeongchang river basin reliable assessment of streamflow has been required the pyeongchang river has a drainage area of 1774 32 km2 and stream length of 146 86 km there are 13 streamflow stations in the area eight of the 13 stations are located in the main stream of the river along with one at the heungjeong stream tributary one at the daehwa stream tributary and three at the jucheon stream tributary fig 3 a shows the locations of these 13 streamflow stations and fig 3 b shows a schematic diagram of these stations with stream connections i e network representation in the pyeongchang river basin 3 2 calculation of centrality of streamflow stations 3 2 1 steps for calculating centrality and setting of data period streamflow stations are installed along a water system however the system does not have any absolute influence on the centrality of the stations in the context of a complex network thus the water system can serve as a vector to locate a node or streamflow station but cannot be considered as a link by itself thus a network should be constructed from the correlation of streamflow data among stations to calculate their centrality this requires particular focus on network formation with varying thresholds for data similarity to calculate the changing centrality reliable outcomes of streamflow analysis require high quality long term data 30 years is recommended for hydrological analysis in general world meteorological organization 2008 this however is oftentimes difficult to meet in practice for example not all stations in a river basin may have data that span a long period of time and data collection periods may often vary from station to station furthermore most streamflow stations experience missing data and data errors are generally unavoidable for some periods and stations however to assess the similarity of streamflow data among the stations data for the same period for all stations is required for the analysis fang et al 2017 keeping all these in mind in the present study daily flow discharge data over a 5 year period january 2012 december 2016 are considered for analysis fig 4 shows the distributions of the daily streamflow data at each of the above 13 stations through box plots as seen the variability is very high from flow as low as less than 5 m3 s to as high as over 3000 m3 s most outliers observed at each station can be attributed to a rapid rise in the discharge caused by localized heavy rainfall events during the rainy season 3 2 2 construction of streamflow network by similarity threshold value of streamflow data prior to calculating centrality the characteristics of networks constructed for different threshold values i e correlations in streamflows between stations of 0 1 to 0 9 with an interval of 0 1 are examined as mentioned earlier the pyeongchang river basin streamflow network has 13 stations as shown in fig 5 based on daily flow data the number of links and characteristics of these 13 stations vary with the correlation thresholds in the complex network theory if the number of nodes is constant the structure of the network is determined by changes in the presence or absence of links between nodes however the number of links does not significantly change when t 0 3 or lower and similarly when t 0 6 or higher this indicates that the change in centrality is insignificant when similar networks are constructed des pite the different threshold values therefore only the four threshold values that lead to significant changes i e t 0 3 t 0 4 t 0 5 and t 0 6 are used when constructing the networks fig 6 in addition as seen from figs 5 and 6 the higher the threshold value the less the number of links and vice versa as generally expected 3 2 3 calculation of centrality by similarity threshold value of streamflow data the centrality of each station is calculated for each of the above four threshold values 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 and the three centrality methods degree closeness and betweenness are also considered therefore there is a total of 12 cases four threshold values and three centrality measures fig 7 presents the results of the degree closeness and betweenness centrality values for each of the streamflow stations for each of the four thresholds considered as seen the centrality scores vary with the threshold values for the different stations as the threshold increases from 0 3 to 0 6 the number of connections decreases which tends to decrease the overall centrality especially station 8 has a low centrality score in all cases as most of it has no connection with others however station 6 has a relatively high centrality score due to the many connections with others in all cases despite the increasing threshold the decreasing degree centrality with increasing threshold value can be attributed to the unique characteristics of the centrality estimation method which is influenced by the intensity of connections for the case of closeness centrality stations 6 9 10 11 and 13 show a centrality value of 1 for a threshold value of 0 6 this occurs because these stations form their own independent network with all these stations connected among themselves in the case of betweenness centrality lower centrality scores are obtained in general because there is only a small number of stations serving as vectors this means that the nodes structuring the network have similar betweenness centrality as is mainly found in small world networks it is important to note however that centrality is a relative value within the scope of each method which means that comparison among the three methods is not practically necessary or appropriate in other words they are different in terms of centrality measurements and produce relative values that are only valid in each case therefore centrality should be compared only method by method 3 3 calculation of integrated centrality for streamflow stations using a bayesian network if the centrality measures obtained from the different methods are consistent then it becomes easier to make decisions on prioritizing the stations by their importance the opposite is true for cases where there are significant differences in the results obtained from the different methods in addition it would be confusing to determine which threshold value s should be taken out of the different results to address these an attempt is made here to find the possible cause and effect relationship among the different levels of centrality obtained from each method using a bayesian network which is to combine the centralities as a new approach the bayesian network is constructed in agenarisk version 10 with 17 nodes boxes and 16 links arrows to build the network the criteria for the unit are redefined therefore each centrality is converted into a probability unit based on a cumulative percentage fig 8 the prior probability each centrality given to each parent node can be directly estimated by a conditional probability the posterior probability of the child nodes integrated centrality is determined by a deviation of probability thus the 12 cases generated by applying each threshold value four thresholds in total to each centrality estimation method three centrality methods in total are integrated by priority to produce four cases which are again integrated to identify the final centrality all the centrality scores obtained by this integration are shown in fig 9 and table 2 as seen from table 2 the centrality scores for each threshold value for each station first centrality range from 0 to 0 50 and show an even distribution these scores are integrated again second centrality or final centrality which produce weights of 0 to 0 290 among all the 13 stations station 6 has the highest final centrality 0 290 for each threshold value and method this indicates that station 6 is the most important streamflow station hub in the pyeongchang river basin the first integrated centralities of station 4 and station 10 are 0 062 and 0 081 with a threshold value of 0 6 but the final centralities are 0 103 and 0 091 respectively this may be attributed to station 4 having the highest values for all other threshold values except for the case of t 0 6 in addition station 8 has a centrality score of 0 023 for the threshold value of 0 3 however the centrality values are zero for the other thresholds which lead to a final centrality value approaching zero in addition several stations do not show a significant difference in centrality scores for degree centrality and closeness centrality but they have integrated centrality scores with higher deviations due to betweenness centrality station 4 6 10 etc this indicates that the prior probabilities that represent the betweenness centrality contribute to the posterior probability integrated centrality via the conditional probabilities 3 4 integrated centrality and determination of importance of streamflow stations the higher the centrality value a station has the higher its relative importance is the centrality scores can be listed in descending order to indicate the relative importance of the stations fig 10 shows the centrality scores and orders by station larger circles indicate higher integrated centrality and thus higher relative importance the results indicate that station 6 which is situated in the middle part of the basin has the highest centrality 0 290 when a station is situated in the middle of a basin and in the middle of other stations it has a high probability of having a closer relation with other stations in the upper and lower streams and higher similarity in streamflow data this also indicates that it has better connections links with the other stations therefore it is considered a reasonable result that station 6 can well represent the river system and also the streamflows in the other stations stations 4 and 10 show the second and third highest relative centrality scores respectively the higher score of station 4 can be attributed to its location around the upper stream and midstream of the basin while the close connection of station 10 with the other stations in the lower stream is the reason for its high score stations 11 12 and 13 which are situated near the outlet of the basin have somewhat similar centrality scores of 0 064 0 068 and 0 076 respectively these scores are relatively high due to the connection with the other stations installed at the main stream stations 1 2 3 5 and 8 have lower scores of centrality because they are not located at the basin s main stream but at the tributaries in particular station 8 located at the outer part of the basin shows significant separation distances from the other stations this leads to this station not being included in the network s boundary and thus having the lowest score a different approach is required to assess the importance of streamflow stations in terms of their maintenance for example when similar streamflow data are generated from stations x and y in a basin the installation of both stations is not necessary because data from only one of them is enough to represent streamflow in the basin this issue can be addressed through formation of communities or groups or classes of stations in this study since high similarity among streamflow data is obtained when the threshold value is 0 6 communities are formed with t 0 6 for community formation the multi level modularity optimization methodology a community structure method proposed by blondel et al 2008 is used the analysis yields a total of 8 communities as shown in fig 11 as seen stations 1 2 3 5 and 8 each without any link with any other station forms its own independent community station 4 has the second highest centrality in the pyeongchang river basin however stations 4 and 6 produce similar streamflow data and are grouped under the same community which means the importance of station 4 decreases the same occurs for stations 7 and 12 under one community in addition station 10 third place and station 9 fourth place are also grouped under one community therefore the importance of station 9 decreases as a result a station with the highest importance in each community becomes a high priority for the importance when a station has relatively high importance compared to others in the network but is not the most important in the same community it becomes less important compared to those with higher importance in other communities this process of ranking stations by importance continues until all the stations are listed table 3 shows the results of the estimated importance rank for the streamflow stations in the basin it was confirmed from the result that this approach as a new trial is applicable to assess the importance of the streamflow stations 3 5 discussion this study focus directed toward addressing the challenges surrounding identifying flow measurement locations with respect to measurement technology estimation techniques and installation maintenance costs the outcomes could serve as a reasonable basis for assessing the importance of streamflow stations for the effective and efficient management in a basin however there were four issues regarding the proposed method first the centrality values were quite different from each method and each threshold value therefore bayesian network was applied and integrated bayesian network is clearly a scientific and advanced technique when multiple alternatives exist and decision making is required jensen 1996 pearl 2014 kim et al 2018 however decision making issues remain challenging and are not limited to hydrological phenomena a more accurate method for estimating the centrality of stations should be derived and followed by verification it could be a new methodology for estimating centrality or a new methodology integrating multiple centralities second the community based approach as a grouping method was applied to estimate the final importance of the stations for grouping we can also use other approaches such as cluster analysis cluster analysis is formed only by the similarity of data while community analysis is formed by data similarity and by network theory and structure community analysis identified highly cohesive gauging stations in most stream links compared to cluster analysis joo et al 2021 streamflows in the same watershed generally exhibit a high degree of hydrological similarity persistence and connectivity this indicates that the measuring stations are not independent and are closely related to each other therefore network based community analysis methods dealing with highly cohesive communities will be a better alternative to cluster analysis methods based simply on data correlation third the final importance of stations depended only on daily flow discharge data the importance of streamflow stations defined in this study is limited to hydrological flows and can include a variety of hydrological factors therefore a more accurate and complete assessment requires studying the influence of the major variables e g flood control water use hydrogic environment contributions from other stations that determine the importance of streamflow stations the six categories proposed by wahl and crippen 1984 can also be considered however these analyzes are much broader and are beyond the scope of the present study we aimed to measure the relative importance of stations in a streamflow network using a holistic approach to watershed management rather than considering stations individually in the past study an attempt was made to combine network based importance of streamflow stations and the importance of each streamflow station joo et al 2019a 2019b we will examine this further in the future fourth there is a problem with the size of the study area early network theory was limited to small graph theory however with the rise of the complex phenomenon in modern society it has developed into a complex network theory therefore complex network theory including community analysis is very useful in large networks compared to other approaches the generality of the proposed method for any river basin needs to be verified by studying large basins around the world e g the mississippi river in the united states the nile river in africa and the yangtze river in china our future studies will focus more on these areas 4 conclusions this study attempted to assess the importance of streamflow stations in a streamflow monitoring network using the concepts of complex networks the pyeongchang river basin in south korea was considered as a case study basin and a total of 13 streamflow stations in the basin was used to construct the streamflow network three most widely used centrality estimation methods within the context of complex networks were employed centrality scores were produced for 12 different cases i e four streamflow correlation threshold values and three centrality estimation methods the centrality values were found to be different from the 12 cases due both to the threshold values and to the estimation method leading to difficulties in assessing the importance of the stations to resolve this issue a bayesian network was used to integrate the centrality from each case to produce a representative one the results suggested that stations located in the main stream in the middle part of the basin had higher centrality scores based on this outcome the importance of streamflow stations was measured by constructing communities in the network with appropriate threshold values the approach of this study to assess the importance of the individual streamflow stations through their centrality is useful to establish strategies for their effective and efficient maintenance in the future study in order to improve the accuracy of the importance of streamflow stations a better methodology for calculating centrality should be derived and various hydrological factors should be considered and it is necessary to verify

4548,this study proposes a complex networks based method to determine the connections among the stations in a streamflow monitoring network and assess the importance of the individual stations for implementation 13 streamflow stations in the pyeongchang river basin in south korea are studied and daily flow discharge data are analyzed three different centrality measures are employed to identify the connections in the streamflow network degree centrality closeness centrality and betweenness centrality the links between the nodes can significantly change depending upon the centrality method used and the threshold considered therefore an integrated centrality method is proposed using a bayesian network the integrated centrality results show that stations situated along the main stream in the middle of the basin have high centrality while the tributary stations have low centrality to assess the importance of stations the integrated centrality is used with community based clusters this assessment on the importance of the individual streamflow stations through their centrality is useful to establish strategies for their effective and efficient maintenance keywords streamflow monitoring network complex networks bayesian network integrated centrality community structure 1 introduction streamflow data are important for a wide range of purposes in hydrology and water resources including for flood forecasting and warning reservoir operation and water resources assessment streamflow monitoring stations have and continue to be installed for measuring streamflow at high spatial and temporal resolutions as much as possible however consistent and continuous maintenance of the stations is highly challenging due to issues related to the measurement technology and estimation techniques installation and maintenance costs and loss of stations due to severe floods among others many countries around the world are now gradually reducing the number of streamflow stations due to difficulties in maintaining the stations on a regular basis or for economic reasons pearson 1998 world meteorological organization 2008 reliable assessment of the importance of the individual streamflow stations is required for managing them and the resulting hydrological data in an economic and efficient way strategies that fully reflect the relative importance of a given station in a network of stations are necessary and such strategies should also have practical relevance wahl and crippen 1984 proposed one of the most well known methods for assessing the importance of streamflow stations which is widely applied throughout the world with appropriate modifications for different situations in different countries they introduced six categories for the assessment of streamflow stations characteristics of site existing and potential beneficial uses of water magnitude of water resource problems data uses for planning data uses for management and economics they conducted a quantitative assessment for target stations assigned with relative scores their approach however clearly has some limitations for example since streamflow values at a station are directly influenced by events in upstream station s streamflow stations in a basin are very much interlinked to one another at least in the direction of flow of water consequently instead of considering the stations individually a holistic approach to basin management should be used to measure the relative importance of stations in a streamflow network such an approach to measure the relative importance of stations should obviously take into account the interconnections among the stations in this context the concepts of network theory especially the recent developments of complex networks can be particularly useful a network is a set of points nodes or vertices joined together by a set of lines links or edges in the specific context of streamflow many studies have applied networks based approaches to find the spatial or temporal relationship of streamflow malik et al 2012 sivakumar 2015 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2015 halverson and fleming 2015 jha et al 2015 braga et al 2016 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 fang et al 2017 konapala and mishra 2017 jha and sivakumar 2017 naufan et al 2018 tiwari et al 2019 the approaches evolved into the complex networks concepts to identify the topology and characteristics of the streamflow network in a basin level han et al 2018 yasmin and sivakumar 2018 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 alarcón and lozano 2019 these studies have shown that the concepts of network theory especially complex networks are useful and effective for understanding the complex nonlinear and dynamically evolving hydrologic systems and the associated processes for instance the many centrality estimation methods developed within the context of network theory can be useful for identifying stations with higher importance in a complex streamflow network however centrality may differ with the structural attributes of a network e g due to the various scenarios and environments appearing in complex networks therefore different results can be created with different criteria for similar streamflow data as is clear from many past studies sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 halverson and fleming 2015 fang et al 2017 han et al 2018 yasmin and sivakumar 2018 therefore the decision to select the optimal centrality result is very difficult resolving this issue is an important and yet a challenging problem the present study addresses this issue using a bayesian network to measure the integrated centrality the bayesian network provides a representative stochastic graph model network and supports efficient and optimal decision making in integrating different information castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 henriksen and barlebo 2008 the approach adopted in this study is to solve the problems as follows first the concepts of complex networks are used to analyze the complex structure of a streamflow network centrality of streamflow data from each streamflow station is measured based on three representative centrality estimation methods degree centrality closeness centrality and betweenness centrality then a bayesian network is used to combine the centrality scores to produce the integrated centrality finally a method is also proposed to determine the importance of each station through clustering using community detection of complex network theory for maintenance management the proposed approach for the efficient management of the streamflow stations is implemented on the streamflow monitoring network of 13 stations located in the pyeongchang river south korea 2 basic theories 2 1 network and centrality a network or graph is a set of points called nodes or vertices that are joined together via connections called links or edges as shown in fig 1 mathematically a network can be represented as g p e where p is a set of n nodes p1 p2 pn and e is a set of n links the term graph is used to explain networks when classifying them into more microscopic units according to the connection types of links for instance an undirected graph is determined by whether or not a direction is given saber and murray 2003 a binary graph and valued graph are determined by the relation between connecting lines rajkumar et al 2015 and a connected or disconnected graph is determined by link connectivity ray 2013 a range of methods can be used for the analysis of network characteristics in consideration of such complex networks see newman 2010 and estrada 2012 for more details centrality can be defined as an indicator of closeness of a node e g streamflow station to the center of a network centrality analysis is used to identify the nodes that play an important or more prominent role in a given network as well as the different closeness levels of nodes to the center in short the meaning of centrality are indicators of the importance of nodes high centrality of stations in streamflow network means that the importance is also high because they have key positions within the river basin the value of centrality is greater than or equal to 0 as a dimensionless value there are several types of centrality however the basic indicators used for centrality analysis are degree centrality closeness centrality and betweenness centrality freeman 1979 these indicators are defined in table 1 and are described next 1 degree centrality degree centrality is a measure of the number of links of a node to all the other nodes in a network this type of centrality is based on the assumption that more autonomy and power are assigned to a node with more connections degree centrality includes two types of measures one for absolute centrality and the other for relative centrality the absolute centrality is basically the number of connections to a node while the absolute centrality as a measure of network connections is useful it has certain limitations since different networks may have different number of nodes for instance if a network with 100 nodes has a node a with an absolute degree centrality of 30 and another network with 50 nodes has a node b with an absolute degree centrality of 20 then one cannot simply say that the connectivity of a is stronger than that of b based only on the number of connections without giving due consideration to the network size to overcome this problem the relative degree centrality is more useful for relative centrality the absolute values are normalized and measured in an interval of 0 to 1 in the present study the relative degree centrality is used the relative degree centrality of node i can be calculated as follows 1 dc d i n 1 where di is the degree to which a node is connected to another absolute degree centrality and n is the total number of nodes in the network 2 closeness centrality the closeness centrality of a node is its adjacency to another node based on their distance a node has a higher closeness score when the sum of its distances to all the other nodes in a network is lower this means that the node with the highest closeness value has the shortest connection distances to all the other nodes in the network like degree centrality closeness centrality includes absolute closeness centrality and relative closeness centrality however as the absolute measure does not consider the number of nodes in a network relative closeness centrality i e with normalization is more useful and thus is used in this study it can be expressed as follows 2 cc d i j 1 n d ij where d i j is the sum of the distances to node i and node j and n is the total number of nodes 3 betweenness centrality betweenness centrality is the extent to which one node lies on paths between the other nodes in a network vectors on paths can have a great influence on the control of information flow the betweenness centrality shows how much a node acts as an intermediary or a bridge in constructing a network with the other nodes such nodes can ensure strong connectivity of the whole network for example when node y lies on the shortest path geodesic between two non neighboring nodes the betweenness centrality of the node becomes higher because the node plays the role of a vector for node x and node z however if there are multiple geodesics between node x and node z node y can have a lower betweenness centrality because it is calculated as one of the shortest paths as a result the betweenness centrality of node y can be defined as the percentage of geodesics that passes through node y to the total number of geodesics between node x and node y this is expressed as follows 3 bc j k g jk i g jk j k i j k i n this equation represents a set of n nodes node j and node k are a pair that has the shortest path except for any pairs with node i in the network the term g j k is the number of geodesics that lie on the paths between node j and node k and g j k i is the number of geodesics between the two nodes that passes through node i 2 2 bayesian network a bayesian network bn is a type of probabilistic graphical model that can represent relationships among variables even when there is uncertainty between them the network is a directed acyclic graph dag made up of nodes and links and is useful in that it can integrate diverse sources and types of variables into a uniform structure relations among nodes can be explained with the conditional probability distribution cpd which considers the dependency between them jensen 1996 pearl 2014 kim et al

depend on the conditional probability of the posterior probability or child nodes x 2 x 3 the overall joint probability distribution can be presented as follows 4 p x 1 x 2 x 3 p x 3 x 1 x 2 p x 2 x 1 p x 1 unlike the case shown in fig 2 nodes without a connection cannot be applied to eq 4 as a result a joint probability distribution with variables x 1 x 2 x n can be represented as 5 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i α i where α i is a set of parent nodes of x i and p x 1 x 2 x n remains normalized due to the normalized prior distribution importantly a node in a bayesian network corresponds to a single

are 13 streamflow stations in the area eight of the 13 stations are located in the main stream of the river along with one at the heungjeong stream tributary one at the daehwa stream tributary and three at the jucheon stream tributary fig 3 a shows the locations of these 13 streamflow stations and fig 3 b shows a schematic diagram of these stations with stream connections i e network representation in the pyeongchang river basin 3 2 calculation of centrality of streamflow stations 3 2 1 steps for calculating centrality and setting of data period streamflow stations are installed along a water system however the system does not have any absolute influence on the centrality of the stations in the context of a complex network thus the water system can serve as a vector to locate a node or streamflow station but cannot be considered as a link by itself thus a network should be constructed from the correlation of streamflow data among stations to calculate their centrality this requires particular focus on network formation with varying thresholds for data similarity to calculate the changing centrality reliable outcomes of streamflow analysis require high quality long term data 30 years is recommended for hydrological analysis in general world meteorological organization 2008 this however is oftentimes difficult to meet in practice for example not all stations in a river basin may have data that span a long period of time and data collection periods may often vary from station to station furthermore most streamflow stations experience missing data and data errors are generally unavoidable for some periods and stations however to assess the similarity of streamflow data among the stations data for the same period for all stations is required for the analysis fang et al 2017 keeping all these in mind in the present study daily flow discharge data over a 5 year period january 2012 december 2016 are considered for analysis fig 4 shows the distributions of the daily streamflow data at each of the above 13 stations through box plots as seen the variability is very high from flow as low as less than 5 m3 s to as high as over 3000 m3 s most outliers observed at each station can be attributed to a rapid rise in the discharge caused by localized heavy rainfall events during the rainy season 3 2 2 construction of streamflow network by similarity threshold value of streamflow data prior to calculating centrality the characteristics of networks constructed for different threshold values i e correlations in streamflows between stations of 0 1 to 0 9 with an interval of 0 1 are examined as mentioned earlier the pyeongchang river basin streamflow network has 13 stations as shown in fig 5 based on daily flow data the number of links and characteristics of these 13 stations vary with the correlation thresholds in the complex network theory if the number of nodes is constant the structure of the network is determined by changes in the presence or absence of links between nodes however the number of links does not significantly change when t 0 3 or lower and similarly when t 0 6 or higher this indicates that the change in centrality is insignificant when similar networks are constructed des pite the different threshold values therefore only the four threshold values that lead to significant changes i e t 0 3 t 0 4 t 0 5 and t 0 6 are used when constructing the networks fig 6 in addition as seen from figs 5 and 6 the higher the threshold value the less the number of links and vice versa as generally expected 3 2 3 calculation of centrality by similarity threshold value of streamflow data the centrality of each station is calculated for each of the above four threshold values 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 and the three centrality methods degree closeness and betweenness are also considered therefore there is a total of 12 cases four threshold values and three centrality measures fig 7 presents the results of the degree closeness and betweenness centrality values for each of the streamflow stations for each of the four thresholds considered as seen the centrality scores vary with the threshold values for the different stations as the threshold increases from 0 3 to 0 6 the number of connections decreases which tends to decrease the overall centrality especially station 8 has a low centrality score in all cases as most of it has no connection with others however station 6 has a relatively high centrality score due to the many connections with others in all cases despite the increasing threshold the decreasing degree centrality with increasing threshold value can be attributed to the unique characteristics of the centrality estimation method which is influenced by the intensity of connections for the case of closeness centrality stations 6 9 10 11 and 13 show a centrality value of 1 for a threshold value of 0 6 this occurs because these stations form their own independent network with all these stations connected among themselves in the case of betweenness centrality lower centrality scores are obtained in general because there is only a small number of stations serving as vectors this means that the nodes structuring the network have similar betweenness centrality as is mainly found in small world networks it is important to note however that centrality is a relative value within the scope of each method which means that comparison among the three methods is not practically necessary or appropriate in other words they are different in terms of centrality measurements and produce relative values that are only valid in each case therefore centrality should be compared only method by method 3 3 calculation of integrated centrality for streamflow stations using a bayesian network if the centrality measures obtained from the different methods are consistent then it becomes easier to make decisions on prioritizing the stations by their importance the opposite is true for cases where there are significant differences in the results obtained from the different methods in addition it would be confusing to determine which threshold value s should be taken out of the different results to address these an attempt is made here to find the possible cause and effect relationship among the different levels of centrality obtained from each method using a bayesian network which is to combine the centralities as a new approach the bayesian network is constructed in agenarisk version 10 with 17 nodes boxes and 16 links arrows to build the network the criteria for the unit are redefined therefore each centrality is converted into a probability unit based on a cumulative percentage fig 8 the prior probability each centrality given to each parent node can be directly estimated by a conditional probability the posterior probability of the child nodes integrated centrality is determined by a deviation of probability thus the 12 cases generated by applying each threshold value four thresholds in total to each centrality estimation method three centrality methods in total are integrated by priority to produce four cases which are again integrated to identify the final centrality all the centrality scores obtained by this integration are shown in fig 9 and table 2 as seen from table 2 the centrality scores for each threshold value for each station first centrality range from 0 to 0 50 and show an even distribution these scores are integrated again second centrality or final centrality which produce weights of 0 to 0 290 among all the 13 stations station 6 has the highest final centrality 0 290 for each threshold value and method this indicates that station 6 is the most important streamflow station hub in the pyeongchang river basin the first integrated centralities of station 4 and station 10 are 0 062 and 0 081 with a threshold value of 0 6 but the final centralities are 0 103 and 0 091 respectively this may be attributed to station 4 having the highest values for all other threshold values except for the case of t 0 6 in addition station 8 has a centrality score of 0 023 for the threshold value of 0 3 however the centrality values are zero for the other thresholds which lead to a final centrality value approaching zero in addition several stations do not show a significant difference in centrality scores for degree centrality and closeness centrality but they have integrated centrality scores with higher deviations due to betweenness centrality station 4 6 10 etc this indicates that the prior probabilities that represent the betweenness centrality contribute to the posterior probability integrated centrality via the conditional probabilities 3 4 integrated centrality and determination of importance of streamflow stations the higher the centrality value a station has the higher its relative importance is the centrality scores can be listed in descending order to indicate the relative importance of the stations fig 10 shows the centrality scores and orders by station larger circles indicate higher integrated centrality and thus higher relative importance the results indicate that station 6 which is situated in the middle part of the basin has the highest centrality 0 290 when a station is situated in the middle of a basin and in the middle of other stations it has a high probability of having a closer relation with other stations in the upper and lower streams and higher similarity in streamflow data this also indicates that it has better connections links with the other stations therefore it is considered a reasonable result that station 6 can well represent the river system and also the streamflows in the other stations stations 4 and 10 show the second and third highest relative centrality scores respectively the higher score of station 4 can be attributed to its location around the upper stream and midstream of the basin while the close connection of station 10 with the other stations in the lower stream is the reason for its high score stations 11 12 and 13 which are situated near the outlet of the basin have somewhat similar centrality scores of 0 064 0 068 and 0 076 respectively these scores are relatively high due to the connection with the other stations installed at the main stream stations 1 2 3 5 and 8 have lower scores of centrality because they are not located at the basin s main stream but at the tributaries in particular station 8 located at the outer part of the basin shows significant separation distances from the other stations this leads to this station not being included in the network s boundary and thus having the lowest score a different approach is required to assess the importance of streamflow stations in terms of their maintenance for example when similar streamflow data are generated from stations x and y in a basin the installation of both stations is not necessary because data from only one of them is enough to represent streamflow in the basin this issue can be addressed through formation of communities or groups or classes of stations in this study since high similarity among streamflow data is obtained when the threshold value is 0 6 communities are formed with t 0 6 for community formation the multi level modularity optimization methodology a community structure method proposed by blondel et al 2008 is used the analysis yields a total of 8 communities as shown in fig 11 as seen stations 1 2 3 5 and 8 each without any link with any other station forms its own independent community station 4 has the second highest centrality in the pyeongchang river basin however stations 4 and 6 produce similar streamflow data and are grouped under the same community which means the importance of station 4 decreases the same occurs for stations 7 and 12 under one community in addition station 10 third place and station 9 fourth place are also grouped under one community therefore the importance of station 9 decreases as a result a station with the highest importance in each community becomes a high priority for the importance when a station has relatively high importance compared to others in the network but is not the most important in the same community it becomes less important compared to those with higher importance in other communities this process of ranking stations by importance continues until all the stations are listed table 3 shows the results of the estimated importance rank for the streamflow stations in the basin it was confirmed from the result that this approach as a new trial is applicable to assess the importance of the streamflow stations 3 5 discussion this study focus directed toward addressing the challenges surrounding identifying flow measurement locations with respect to measurement technology estimation techniques and installation maintenance costs the outcomes could serve as a reasonable basis for assessing the importance of streamflow stations for the effective and efficient management in a basin however there were four issues regarding the proposed method first the centrality values were quite different from each method and each threshold value therefore bayesian network was applied and integrated bayesian network is clearly a scientific and advanced technique when multiple alternatives exist and decision making is required jensen 1996 pearl 2014 kim et al 2018 however decision making issues remain challenging and are not limited to hydrological phenomena a more accurate method for estimating the centrality of stations should be derived and followed by verification it could be a new methodology for estimating centrality or a new methodology integrating multiple centralities second the community based approach as a grouping method was applied to estimate the final importance of the stations for grouping we can also use other approaches such as cluster analysis cluster analysis is formed only by the similarity of data while community analysis is formed by data similarity and by network theory and structure community analysis identified highly cohesive gauging stations in most stream links compared to cluster analysis joo et al 2021 streamflows in the same watershed generally exhibit a high degree of hydrological similarity persistence and connectivity this indicates that the measuring stations are not independent and are closely related to each other therefore network based community analysis methods dealing with highly cohesive communities will be a better alternative to cluster analysis methods based simply on data correlation third the final importance of stations depended only on daily flow discharge data the importance of streamflow stations defined in this study is limited to hydrological flows and can include a variety of hydrological factors therefore a more accurate and complete assessment requires studying the influence of the major variables e g flood control water use hydrogic environment contributions from other stations that determine the importance of streamflow stations the six categories proposed by wahl and crippen 1984 can also be considered however these analyzes are much broader and are beyond the scope of the present study we aimed to measure the relative importance of stations in a streamflow network using a holistic approach to watershed management rather than considering stations individually in the past study an attempt was made to combine network based importance of streamflow stations and the importance of each streamflow station joo et al 2019a 2019b we will examine this further in the future fourth there is a problem with the size of the study area early network theory was limited to small graph theory however with the rise of the complex phenomenon in modern society it has developed into a complex network theory therefore complex network theory including community analysis is very useful in large networks compared to other approaches the generality of the proposed method for any river basin needs to be verified by studying large basins around the world e g the mississippi river in the united states the nile river in africa and the yangtze river in china our future studies will focus more on these areas 4 conclusions this study attempted to assess the importance of streamflow stations in a streamflow monitoring network using the concepts of complex networks the pyeongchang river basin in south korea was considered as a case study basin and a total of 13 streamflow stations in the basin was used to construct the streamflow network three most widely used centrality estimation methods within the context of complex networks were employed centrality scores were produced for 12 different cases i e four streamflow correlation threshold values and three centrality estimation methods the centrality values were found to be different from the 12 cases due both to the threshold values and to the estimation method leading to difficulties in assessing the importance of the stations to resolve this issue a bayesian network was used to integrate the centrality from each case to produce a representative one the results suggested that stations located in the main stream in the middle part of the basin had higher centrality scores based on this outcome the importance of streamflow stations was measured by constructing communities in the network with appropriate threshold values the approach of this study to assess the importance of the individual streamflow stations through their centrality is useful to establish strategies for their effective and efficient maintenance in the future study in order to improve the accuracy of the importance of streamflow stations a better methodology for calculating centrality should be derived and various hydrological factors should be considered and it is necessary to verify

4549,as an important freshwater resource groundwater is of great significance to agriculture industry and daily life the investigation of groundwater storage gws in different regions of china is critical for water resource management and conservation however previous studies used different methods and data to monitor gws in different regions of china which made their results difficult to compare and cross validate here we used a unified method by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data and global models to study the variations of gws in 10 major basins in china from april 2002 to december 2016 results showed that gws in the i songhua river basin srb liao river basin lrb haihe river basin hrb yellow river basin yrb huaihe river basin hhrb and southeast basin seb exhibited decreasing trends ii yangtze river basin yzrb and pearl river basin prb presented increasing trends and iii southwest basin swb and continental basin cb displayed both decreasing and increasing trends during the study period these results were validated by comparing them with a large number of previous studies which revealed that they were accurate and reliable comparing with the climate data and bulletin data the analysis of causes for these trends indicated that drought and irrigation water use led to a decline in gws in several basins of northern china the decreasing trend of gws in the seb was related to water use for production whereas groundwater recharge from precipitation drove the increasing trends of gws in the yzrb and prb in contrast the wide geographical areas and complex factors of the swb and cb led to the increasing decreasing trends of gws this study enriches the gws for china over the past decade especially for seb prb and cb with rare gws information it will be helpful for the country s groundwater resource management and systematic water conservation keywords grace hydrological models groundwater storage basin china 1 introduction as an important freshwater resource groundwater is important for agriculture industry and daily life aeschbach hertig gleeson 2012 approximately 43 of the total consumptive irrigation water use is from groundwater siebert et al 2010 moreover groundwater supplies 50 of drinking water and 40 of industrial water globally zektser and everett 2004 thus maintaining the development of industry and households in many parts of the world alley et al 2002 the massive exploitation of groundwater due to extreme weather events and population growth among other factors has led to chronic groundwater depletion in many regions of the world examples include northwest india chatterjee et al 2020 chen et al 2014 long et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 iran joodaki et al 2014 california s central valley famiglietti et al 2011 scanlon et al 2012 and the north china plain feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 groundwater depletion not only poses a serious challenge to the sustainable supply of water resources jia et al 2020 yi et al 2016 but also causes a range of ecological and social problems for example sea level rise soil salinization and ground settlement lu et al 2015 scanlon et al 2007 shah et al 2001 monitoring dynamic variations in groundwater storage gws is of great significance for the sustainable use of regional water resources as well as the prevention of natural ecological and human social problems caused by groundwater depletion the traditional method for monitoring changes in gws is mainly based on groundwater well observations this method has high requirements for the number of monitoring points and their representativeness moreover it requires a lot of manpower to complete the preliminary work e g site selection and its distribution it is difficult to accurately reflect the variations in regional gws and realize the monitoring of large scale groundwater level changes using well data ren et al 2014 the estimation of water storage changes based on remote sensing is gradually being applied to monitor regional gws the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite is a cooperative project of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german aerospace center deutsches zentrum für luft und raumfahrt dlr this approach provides techniques to assess global terrestrial water storage tws by measuring variations in earth s gravity field the use of grace satellite data with other hydrological information provides an effective way to monitor changes in gws on a large scale and in uninformed areas li et al 2018 many studies have successfully used grace data to estimate regional gws changes including in the middle east voss et al 2013 the high plain in the united states longuevergne et al 2010 rodell famiglietti 2002 the mississippi river basin in the united states rodell et al 2006 southern murray darling basin in australia chen et al 2015 and in tasmania yin et al 2020 in china some studies have monitored the gws variation using grace by focusing on typical regions with chronic groundwater depletion e g the north china plain tangdamrongsub et al 2018 wang et al 2020a 2020b yin et al 2018 other studies have been applied to single regional basins with smaller areas such as the west liaohe river basin zhong et al 2018 loess plateau xie et al 2018a xie et al 018b hexi corridor

inter annual variation characteristics of gws in china using grace products and global models and provided a meaningful discussion on the regional gws variation in china however owing to different i versions of grace satellite data ii global models iii specific calculation methods for groundwater and iv study periods it is difficult to compare the results of these studies with each other in addition although some researchers spotlighted on the tws variation at basin scale throughout china xu et al 2019 the spatiotemporal changes of gws involving each basin and the analysis of their causes are still rare thus there is a need to comprehensively and systematically obtain and verify gws data in each basin for china as a whole this study uses grace satellite data and multi source global models to retrieve gws changes in 10 major basins of china from april 2002 to december 2016 through unified methods and processes accordingly we aim to determine the spatiotemporal variations of gws in different regions of china we analyzed the main causes of gws changes in 10 basins from both natural and anthropogenic perspectives using precipitation evapotranspiration and other data while enriching the information on gws variation in the traditional study regions of china this study complements the gws changes over the past decade in southeast basin pearl river basin and continental basin which are not covered by the previous studies it provides new reliable gws information at basin scale by local scale validation and systematically comparing the spatial and temporal variations of gws in the major basins of china with previous research results based on deep discussion this study reveals the important drivers of gws variation in different basins e g precipitation and overexploitation which will provide a scientific basis and reference for the formulation of policies and projects on groundwater resource management water conservancy and inter regional water transport the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly introduce the principle and method of the grace based estimation of gws variations along with the data used in this study section 3 presents the spatial and temporal variations as well as the causes of gws in 10 basins of china we compared the reliability of our results with those of previous studies and then summarized sources of error and uncertainty finally section 4 presents the conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area to better study the spatial and temporal variations of gws in different regions of china we used the 1 250 000 scale basin classification datasets of the national earth system science data center national science and technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn

space research csr at the university of texas at austin the grace products included several levels 0 1a 1b and 2 level 2 products provide a spherical harmonic sh coefficient for the convenience of users to study mass anomalies some teams offer level 3 products that are generated from level 2 with geophysical corrections the mass concentration block mascon is other kind of product regional grace mascon solutions have a much higher signal to noise ratio than traditional spherical harmonic solutions because of reduced leakage save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 sun et al 2020 current providers of mascon solutions include jpl csr and nasa goddard space flight center gsfc however the time mean removal of mascons from the three institutions is not consistent jpl and csr

lead to a difference in the tws anomalies twsa calculated by different mascons and it is difficult to compare them with each other therefore we used the grace level 3 rl06 and water equivalent

time range of available data provided by the global models we set the study period from april 2002 to december 2016 the grace level 3 rl06 products from three institutions were resized to facilitate calculation with global models then the terrestrial equivalent water thickness variation values were extracted and the values 19 missing months of grace in the grace gridded data were filled by linear interpolation the seasonal and trend decomposition using loess stl method was used to decompose the time series and remove the seasonal cycle the inter annual variation trends of the twsa in each basin were obtained by fitting the remaining part long term and residual according to the least squares method scanlon et al 2018 the average of the equivalent water thickness change values from the csr jpl and gfz were used as the final grace monitored twsa fig 2 due to differences in the processing strategies and tuning parameters of the respective research centers for three grace level 3 rl06 products averaging these products is beneficial for reducing the noise of the gravity field sakumura et al 2014 in order to reduce the random errors and to fuse these datasets more reliably this study used a merging scheme based on the generalized three cornered hat tch method to weighted average the three grace products mccoll et al 2014 xu et al 2020a 2020b the uncertainty among the three grace level 3 rl06 products was calculated using standard deviation xu et al 2019 considering the availability of data and consistency with the processing of grace solutions monthly data of noah and wghm from april 2002 to december 2016 and pcr globwb from april 2002 to december 2015 were selected these datasets were resized and then the monthly values were processed into anomaly values by subtracting the average for the period from january 2005 to december 2010 the seasonal cycle was removed subsequently using the stl method to obtain a time series of water storage changes in the 10 basins fig 2 similarly the precipitation and evapotranspiration data from april 2002 to december 2016 were selected and resized then the monthly values were extracted and the average for the period from january 2005 to december 2010 was removed for each month finally to facilitate the subsequent comparison with the trend of gws changes the seasonal variations in the long time series of precipitation and evapotranspiration for each basin were removed using the stl method fig 2 here we derived gwsa from twsa by subtracting the snow water equivalent anomalies swea surface water storage anomalies swsa including rivers lakes reservoirs and wetlands soil moisture storage anomalies smsa and canopy water storage anomalies cwsa according to the water balance principle chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 as shown in eq 1 gwsa twsa swea swsa smsa cwsa 1 the twsa were provided by the grace satellite products and the swea swsa smsa and cwsa were obtained from the global models fig 2 the gwsa were estimated as the residual fields between the grace tws changes and available non groundwater water changes from i noah hereafter grace noah ii pcr globwb hereafter grace pcr globwb or iii wghm hereafter grace wghm then we analyzed the causes of the gws changes in each basin finally sources of error and uncertainty were calculated which are discussed in section 3 4 moreover this study used local scale validation method yin et al 2017 to compare the gws changes by datasets in the hrb hhrb yzrb and cb from bulletins with gwsa retrieved by grace and three global models the annual values from gws datasets were extracted and the average for the period from 2005 to 2010 was removed for each year to consistent with grace solutions the results of grace combined with global models were integrated and their average annual values were compared with the results of gws datasets fig 3 it is worth noting that grace derived gws usually represents the change of mass in the entire depth of aquifer which probably does not coincide with the depth of aquifer in the water resources bulletin yin et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal changes of gws the gws changes of the srb lrb hrb yrb hhrb and seb clearly exhibited declining trends the yzrb and prb displayed increasing trends while the swb and cb presented both increasing and decreasing trends that spanned a wide geographical area fig 4 b 3d specifically the regions where gws decreased significantly included most areas of the hrb the middle and lower reaches of the yrb the tibetan part of the swb and the northwest part of the cb with the most severe declines found in the hrb and northern part of the swb among the regions where gws trends increased the middle and lower reaches of the yzrb the yunnan part of the swb and the southwest of the cb most of qinghai province and southern xinjiang exhibited the most obvious increasing trends among these basins the maximum decreasing trend of gws during the study period was observed in the hrb average rate of 10 30 mm yr whereas the minimum decreasing trend was found in the srb average rate of 1 90 mm yr in the lrb yrb hhrb seb swb and cb gws decreased by average rates of 5 54 mm yr 5 50 mm yr 2 52 mm yr 2 45 mm yr 9 06 mm yr and 2 76 mm yr respectively whereas gws increased by average rates of 1 55 mm yr and 1 57 mm yr in the yzrb and prb respectively fig 5 the estimated gwsa results of these 10 basins were influenced by differences in the driving data structure and attributes of the three global models specifically 1 although the gwsa reflected by three global models combined with grace data differed they generally exhibited consistent trends in most basins spatially the gws retrieved by grace noah and grace pcr globwb presented more obvious increasing trends in the seb and southwest part of the cb than the gws retrieved by grace wghm in the northwest part of the cb the gws retrieved by grace noah presented more dramatic decline trends than the gws retrieved by the other two models the gws retrieved by grace pcr globwb showed a more significant increase in the southern part of the swb yunnan province moreover grace noah reflected a more continuous trend of gwsa in spatial whereas individual extremes were often present in the regional gws change trends of grace wghm and grace pcr globwb fig 4b 3d temporally we found that the inter annual trends of gwsa across the basins by linear fitting using least squares were not always consistent the gws retrieved by grace wghm displayed the largest increasing or decreasing trends for the srb lrb hrb yrb hhrb and prb while showed the smallest increasing trend in yzrb the gws retrieved by grace pcr globwb reflected the most significant change trends in the yzrb and swb but showed the slightest gws change trends in srb lrb yrb hhrb prb and cb the gws retrieved by grace noah displayed the largest declining trend in the cb while the smallest in the hrb and swb fig 5 in addition although the time series curves of gwsa shown by the three global models combined with grace data were generally similar in most regions but there are significant differences in some basins for individual time periods in the srb the gws retrieved by i grace wghm and grace pcr globwb showed obvious upward trends from august 2003 to march 2004 while grace noah decreased and then increased ii grace wghm and grace pcr globwb displayed increasing trends in january to february 2010 but grace noah was declining steadily during this period iii grace wghm and grace pcr globwb reflected significant increasing trends from may 2013 to may 2014 while grace noah increased slightly and then decreased fig 5a in the lrb the gws retrieved by grace noah was significantly lower than that of grace wghm and grace pcr globwb from 2005 to 2006 but was obviously higher than them in june 2009 to june 2010 fig 5b in the hhrb the gws retrieved by grace noah was much higher than that of grace wghm and grace pcr globwb in 2015 2016 fig 5e the curve shapes of the three global models combined with grace data were quite different in 2010 2016 of the seb and 2011 of the yzrb fig 5f g in the cb the gws retrieved by grace noah was significantly lower than that of the other two global models during 2016 fig 5j 2 differences were detected in the adaptability and retrieval ability of the three global models for different regions which were directly related to the calculation accuracy and precision of the gwsa for example both the gws retrieved by grace wghm and grace pcr globwb presented decreasing trends in the seb over the last 15 years grace wghm 3 38 mm yr grace pcr globwb 1 52 mm yr but the gws retrieved by grace noah in this area showed an increasing trend of 1 45 mm yr this discrepancy may be due to the fact that noah does not contain surface water attributes e g rivers lakes and reservoirs while the seb has a dense water network and many rivers 3 2 cause analysis of gws changes in different basins the characteristics and causes of gws changes in different basins between april 2002 and december 2016 were analyzed table 2 according to the trends of gws variations fig 5 the 10 basins were divided into three types 1 the srb lrb hrb yrb hhrb and seb decreasing trends of gws 2 the yzrb and prb increasing trends of gws and 3 the swb and cb both increasing and decreasing trends of gws 3 2 1 basins with decreasing gws change trends and analysis of causes songhua river basin the results showed that gws in the srb decreased at an average rate of 1 90 mm yr fig 5a between april 2002 and december 2016 when the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration were 495 93 mm and 713 91 mm respectively i e a difference of 217 98 mm fig 6 a therefore the reduction of gws in the srb related to insufficient groundwater recharge resulting from low precipitation and high evapotranspiration in fig 5a it can be seen that gws increased significantly in 2013 when the basin experienced the largest annual precipitation 659 44 mm which exceeds average by 33 and smallest annual evapotranspiration 647 20 mm 9 less than average of the study period in addition to natural factors the decline of gws in the srb was also influenced by human factors the srb is one of the most important commercial grain production bases in china and its middle and lower reaches are agriculturally intensive li et al 2016a 2016b according to the water resource bulletin the srb has an average annual proportion of groundwater consumption of 42 from 2002 to 2016 and agricultural production accounts for 75 of total water use with the expansion of arable land irrigation sources have shifted from surface water to groundwater and groundwater now plays a crucial role in irrigation during the growing season chen et al 2019 thus anthropogenic water use was an important cause of the observed gws decline in the srb during the study period it should be noted that the impact of precipitation on gws may have a lag period whereby gws increased temporarily 1 2 months after heavy precipitation i e august 2013 in fig 5a and figure s1a this may have been influenced by geological formations topography and human factors which can slow groundwater recharge liaohe river basin gws in the lrb decreased at an average rate of 5 54 mm yr between april 2002 and december 2016 fig 5b the trend of gwsa in the lrb was closely related to precipitation and evapotranspiration the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration in the lrb were 539 70 mm and 942 99 mm respectively i e a difference of 403 29 mm fig 6b therefore inadequate groundwater recharge in the basin caused by the perennial precipitation deficit and high evapotranspiration would have contributed to the continued groundwater depletion in addition the overexploitation of groundwater was also an important factor influencing the observed decreasing trend of gws in the lrb the average annual groundwater supply in the lrb is 54 with 68 of the total water use for agriculture surface water pollution due to industrial development has shifted the use of water resources to groundwater in the lrb and groundwater has become the main source of water resources in the lrb zhang et al 2012 based on groundwater well observations feng et al 2018 found that groundwater depletion occurred mainly in the western area of the lrb zhong et al 2018 attributed the groundwater depletion this area to decreased groundwater recharge reduced precipitation infiltration and increased groundwater exploitation due to irrigation haihe river basin this basin experienced severe groundwater depletion between april 2002 and december 2016 with gws exhibiting a continuous decline at an average rate of 10 30 mm yr fig 5c the average annual evapotranspiration 1053 56 mm was twice the average annual precipitation 502 54 mm during the study period in the hrb fig 6c thus a serious shortage of groundwater recharge from precipitation likely contributed to the decreasing trend of gws at the same time a dry climate and low precipitation mean that people exploit more groundwater to compensate for the shortage of surface water numerous studies have shown that groundwater overextraction due to irrigation as well as industrial and domestic water use is an important cause of groundwater decline in the hrb long et al 2020 pan et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 as the hrb is highly irrigated agriculture accounts for 68 of the total water use in the region of which 37 comes from groundwater extraction xu et al 2019 hence intensive irrigation has accelerated groundwater depletion yellow river basin this basin is a typical semiarid area in northern china the results showed that gws in the yrb decreased at an average rate of 5 50 mm yr between april 2002 and december 2016 fig 5d when the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration in the yrb were 419 12 mm and 938 81 mm respectively i e a difference of 519 69 mm fig 6d thus a lack of groundwater recharge due to low precipitation and high evapotranspiration contributed to the observed decline of gws in the yrb however gws in the yrb increased from 2003 to 2004 fig 5d which probably related to the fact that 2003 experienced the highest precipitation 522 30 mm above average by 25 and lowest evapotranspiration 880 92 mm 6 less than average of the study period fig 6d the decline of gws in this basin was also the result of excessive groundwater exploitation groundwater in the yrb is mainly used for agricultural irrigation followed by industrial and domestic water use the yrb is an important agricultural area for wheat and corn in china where irrigation extraction accounts for most of the total water extraction xie et al 2019 according to statistics the average annual groundwater supply in the yrb is 33 from 2002 to 2016 with agriculture accounting for 72 of total water use finally coal mining also affects gws in the yrb chen et al 2020 found that coal mining was directly related to the reduction of gws in ordos northern shaanxi including yan an and yulin cities and shanxi huaihe river basin the results showed that gws in the hhrb decreased at an average rate of 2 52 mm yr between april 2002 and december 2016 fig 5e when the average annual evapotranspiration 1034 00 mm exceeded the average annual precipitation 854 54 mm i e a difference of 179 46 mm fig 6e thus insufficient groundwater recharge was one reason for the detected decrease in gws in the hhrb from fig 5e it can be seen that gws increased briefly in 2003 when the basin experienced the highest annual precipitation 1145 69 mm above average by 34 of the study period fig 6e as the hhrb covers jiangsu province shandong province anhui province and other densely areas human factors cannot be ignored the average annual groundwater supply in the hhrb from 2002 to 2016 was 169 01 108 m3 29 of total water supply which was less than that in the srb 183 45 108 m3 but more than that in the yrb 129 39 108 m3 table 3 therefore human water consumption was probably an important cause of the decline of gws in these three basins furthermore groundwater extraction in the hhrb is mainly used for irrigation whereby irrigation of farmland accounts for 69 of the total water consumption in the basin according to the huaihe river water resources report southeast basin gws in the seb presented a decreasing trend between april 2002 and december 2016 and was mainly reflected in the gwsa retrieved by grace wghm 3 38 mm yr and grace pcr globwb 1 52 mm yr with the average trend of these two methods being 2 45 mm yr fig 5f the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration in the seb were 1663 51 mm and 951 16 mm during the study period respectively i e a difference of 712 35 mm fig 6f the primary cause of the detected gws decline was human water use mainly that for production the seb includes southern zhejiang province fujian province and northern guangdong province which are well developed urbanized areas where surface water is polluted to some extent groundwater has been used to compensate for the lack of suitable surface water li et al 2016a li et al 2016b found a large number of funnel shaped settlements in the coastal area of zhejiang province where maximum settlement rates were typically below 30 mm yr they considered that this was mainly due to the overexploitation of groundwater by factories in summary the decreasing trends of gws in five basins of northern china srb lrb hrb yrb and hhrb could be attributed both to natural factors i e insufficient groundwater recharge due to low precipitation and high evapotranspiration and human factors i e overexploitation for irrigation conversely increased precipitation in specific years was an influencing factor for the increased gwsa the decreasing trend of gws in the seb was mainly due to human water use primarily that for production 3 2 2 basins with increasing gws change trend and analysis of causes yangtze river basin gws in the yzrb increased at an average rate of 1 55 mm yr from april 2002 to december 2016 fig 5g when the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration were 995 97 mm and 875 17 mm respectively i e a difference of 120 80 mm fig 6g thus the increasing trend of gws in the yzrb would have been partly due to the fact that precipitation exceeded evapotranspiration ferreira et al 2020 in addition to groundwater recharge from precipitation permeation in the upper reaches of the yzrb could have also led to an increase in gws some evidence has shown that groundwater seepage flow from the endorheic basin of the tibetan plateau to the water source area of the yzrb occurs through fault tunnels in deep aquifers jin feng 2013 xiang et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 the yzrb experienced a severe drought from may 2006 to august 2008 zhang et al 2016 our data revealed that the monthly average evapotranspiration during this period 74 65 mm exceeded the monthly average evapotranspiration for the entire study period 72 98 mm and that the monthly average precipitation 78 28 mm of this period was less than the monthly average precipitation for the entire study period 83 00 mm figure s1 however gws did not show a significant downward trend from may 2006 to august 2008 due to permeation pearl river basin gws in the prb increased at an average rate of 1 57 mm yr during the study period fig 5h when the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration were 1500 57 mm and 980 26 mm respectively i e a difference of 520 31 mm fig 6h recharge from precipitation contributed to the increasing trend of gws in the prb the prb includes guangxi and guangdong provinces the karstic landscape and developed underground pores in guangxi have created a large number of underground rivers huang et al 2019 as a result the large drainage of underground rivers offsets some precipitation recharge and probably led to a slight increase in groundwater levels in this area during the study period the prb experienced severe droughts in 2009 and 2011 with a monthly average evapotranspiration of 85 82 mm and 83 25 mm respectively which were greater than the average monthly evapotranspiration of 81 77 mm for the entire study period figure s1 after these extreme droughts the prb underwent a significant recovery of gws in 2010 and 2012 due to increased precipitation coupled with the efficient pore infiltration huang et al 2019 in summary the increasing trends in gws in the yzrb and prb between april 2002 and december 2016 were considered to be mainly due to precipitation recharge it is likely that permeation in the upper reaches of the yzrb also made an important contribution to the gws increase in the yzrb underground rivers in the karst areas of the prb would have caused a loss of groundwater that slowed the increasing trend of gws although the yzrb and prb have experienced severe droughts precipitation recharge permeation and pore infiltration accelerated the recovery of groundwater during the study period 3 2 3 basins with increasing and decreasing gws change trends and analysis of causes the swb and cb cover wide geographical areas and presented both increasing and decreasing trends of gws in different regions a detailed analysis of the gws trends within these two basins is as follows southwest basin gws in the swb decreased at an average rate of 9 06 mm yr from april 2002 to december 2016 fig 5i when the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration were 842 20 mm and 821 86 mm respectively i e a difference of 20 34 mm fig 6i the swb includes yunnan province and the southern tibetan plateau fig 4 shows that gws in yunnan exhibited an increasing trend at a rate that was mostly between 5 mm yr and 15 mm yr whereas this was between 10 mm yr and 20 mm yr on the southern tibetan plateau the magnitude of the decreasing trend of gws on the southern tibetan plateau was greater than the increasing trend of gws in yunnan therefore the total gws in the swb presented a declining trend the gws changes in yunnan province and the southern tibetan plateau were separately analyzed as follows a great swath of karst covers much of yunnan province long et al 2014 huang et al 2019 studied groundwater changes in yunnan province by classifying it into low karst regions the authors reported that groundwater recharge in this region comes primarily from precipitation and attributed the main loss of groundwater to underground channels created by karst geology there are fewer known underground channels in yunnan 96 in comparison to guangxi 374 hence less groundwater is lost via underground channels in yunnan these factors would have led to an increasing trend of gws in yunnan between april 2002 and december 2016 a reason for the observed decreasing trend in gws on the southern tibetan plateau was the overexploitation of groundwater the tibetan plateau is bordered by afghanistan india and bangladesh xiang et al 2016 showed that a decreased gws in the wider area of the tibetan plateau was mainly caused by excessive exploitation and use of groundwater in addition snowmelt means that soil water tends to be saturated which prevents the infiltration of precipitation most of the precipitation associated with strong monsoons recharges runoff directly rather than groundwater during the monsoon season on the southern tibetan plateau kong et al 2019 insufficient precipitation also contributed to the decreasing trend of gws during the study period continental basin gws in the cb decreased at an average rate of 2 76 mm yr between april 2002 and december 2016 fig 5j when the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration were 193 04 mm and 990 15 mm respectively i e a difference of 797 11 mm fig 6j thus high evapotranspiration and very low precipitation were the primary factors influencing the gws decline in the cb based on the trend of gws change over time the cb was divided into two parts for analysis the northern tibet plateau and the qaidam basin where gws showed an increasing trend and the area to the northwest of xinjiang and northern inner mongolia where gws showed a decreasing trend fig 4 precipitation glacier meltwater and snowmelt due to climate change were probably the main contributors to the increasing gws trend on the northern tibetan plateau and in the qaidam basin feng et al 2018 concluded that the main reason for the increasing trend of gws on the northern tibet plateau was glacier meltwater and snowmelt from the tien shan mountains and pamir mountains regarding the increasing trend of gws in the qaidam basin bibi et al 2019 considered that groundwater recharge in this closed basin is mainly due precipitation but with inputs from other sources such as permafrost and snow meltwater due to global warming the primary reason for the decreasing gws trend in the area to the northwest of xinjiang and northern inner mongolia during the study period was extensive irrigation xie et al 2018a xie et al 2018b found that the decline of gws in xinjiang gansu shaanxi and ningxia was largely due to agricultural irrigation and the continuous expansion of agricultural in these regions wang et al 2019 studied the alxa plateau in northwest inner mongolia and reported that the decrease in gws was mainly related to irrigation and domestic water use zhang et al 2014 found that the governing factor for groundwater depletion in the dunhuang oasis between 1987 and 2007 was a significant increase in the area used for cash crops especially cotton which increased the amount of irrigation water overall for the swb the observed increasing trend of gws in yunnan was largely associated with increased recharge from precipitation and reduced groundwater loss in low karst areas the decreasing trend of gws on the southern tibetan plateau between april 2002 and december 2016 was related to the overexploitation and insufficient recharge of groundwater for the cb increased precipitation glacier meltwater and snowmelt due to global warming were likely the main reasons for the increasing trends of gws on the northern tibet plateau and in the qaidam basin the declining gws trends in the area to the northwest of xinjiang and northern inner mongolia were primarily related to the expansion of agricultural land and extensive irrigation 3 3 comparison of gwsa with previous studies table 4 summarizes previous studies on the evaluation of gwsa using grace data in combination with global models and other information five basins of our study srb lrb hrb yrb and yzrb were included these previous studies whereby the study areas were roughly the same or consistent in size with these five basins four other basins of our study hhrb prb swb and cb have been lesser reported in previous studies whereby the study areas were either similar to or smaller than these four basins hence limited comparison can be made for these four basins to date there have been no studies on gws changes in the seb using grace data in combination with other data 3 3 1 direct comparison of five basins songhua river basin chen et al 2019 estimated the gws change of the srb using two mascons and three sh products from the csr jpl and gfz in combination with lsms from gldas their results showed that gws in the srb increased significantly between 1998 and 2008 at a rate of 3 91 1 06 mm yr whereas it subsequently decreased dramatically between 2009 and 2013 at a rate of 5 51 3 46 mm yr the trend of gws in the srb was decreasing during 1998 2013 in our study the gws change of the srb also exhibited a decreasing trend average rate of 1 90 mm yr between 2002 and 2016 which was higher during 2009 2013 4 65 mm yr liaohe river basin zhong et al 2018 studied the gws change in the western lrb area of 13 6 104 km2 using a mascon of csr combined with four lsms of gldas 1 their results showed that gws decreased at a rate of 0 43 0 26 km3 yr between 2005 and 2015 which approximately equates to 3 16 1 80 mm yr there was a higher rate of 0 92 0 49 km3 yr for the period from 2005 to 2011 which approximately equates to 6 76 3 60 mm yr feng et al 2018 evaluated the gws change in the aquifer of the songliao basin in northeast china based on rl05 sh data of the csr in combination with global models their results revealed that gws in the lrb for an area of 26 104 km2 experienced a pronounced decline during 2005 2009 at a rate of 5 0 1 2 km3 yr which equates to 19 2 4 6 mm yr we also found that gws decreased significantly in the lrb area of 34 42 104 km2 during the slightly longer period of 2005 2011 but at an average rate of 9 58 mm yr subsequently the gws trend increased at a rate of 6 48 mm yr during 2012 2014 fig 5b which is consistent with the trends reported by zhong et al 2018 and feng et al 2018 haihe river basin many studies have focused on the hrb feng et al 2013 used rl05 sh data of the csr to monitor gws changes in north china the authors found that the rate of groundwater depletion in an area of 370 000 km2 which included the municipalities of beijing and tianjin as well as hebei and shanxi provinces was 8 3 1 1 km3 yr during 2003 2010 which approximately equates to 22 4 3 0 mm yr shen et al 2015 used grace solutions to calculate the gws change in the hrb area of 32 104 km2 and reported a declining trend at a rate of 17 0 4 3 mm yr during 2003 2012 zhao et al 2019 used the csr jpl and gsfc mascons in combination with four lsms of gldas 1 to retrieve the gws change of the north china plain area of 14 104 km2 during 2004 2016 and determined a decreasing gws trend at a rate of 1 7 0 1 cm yr the rates reported by these three previous studies were relatively larger in comparison to our results for the gws change in the hrb average rate of 10 30 mm yr during 2002 2016 fig 5c for an area of 33 15 104 km2 the differences between our results and those of feng et al 2013 and shen et al 2015 relate to the various study periods used as well as the different grace data global models and processing methods the difference between our results and those of zhao et al 2019 mainly relates to the study area although zhao et al 2019 had a similar research period and processing method to our study their study area covered the typical plain region from the taihang mountains to the yellow river which was half of the area used in our study moreover long et al 2020 showed that the decreasing gws trend in the hrb had weakened they found that gws in beijing i e the central part of the north china plain had obviously increased due to increased precipitation in 2012 and the south to north diversion of water since 2015 yellow river basin zhang et al 2019 found that the gws depletion rate derived from grace for the yrb area of 73 104 km2 during 2005 2013 was 3 11 mm yr similarly xie et al 2019 concluded that gws decreased at a rate of 4 2 1 0 mm yr in the yrb area of 79 5 104 km2 during 2003 2015 the findings of both of these studies generally agree with our rate of decline 5 50 mm yr fig 5d for the yrb during 2002 2016 area of 80 24 104 km2 yangtze river basin ferreira et al 2020 used grace and the csr s rl06 sh products combined with noah gldas 2 1 to estimate the gws changes in the yzrb area of 180 104 km2 which indicated that gws increased at a rate of 1 76 mm yr during 2003 2016 in our study the increasing rate of gws in the yzrb area of 166 84 104 km2 calculated by grace level 3 products and noah was 2 04 mm yr during 2002 2016 whereas the average of grace noah grace wghm and grace pcr globwb was 1 55 mm yr fig 5g which are both similar to the results of ferreira et al 2020 3 3 2 partial comparison of four basins huaihe river basin su et al 2020 used the jpl s rl06 mascon and gldas simulated data to estimate the spatiotemporal changes of gws and analyzed the driving factors of gws changes in the huang huai hai plain from 2003 to 2015 the authors found that gws increased at a rate of 0 1 cm yr for most areas of the huang huai hai plain which includes only parts of the central and northern hhrb in contrast we found that gws in the hhrb decreased at a rate of 2 52 mm yr during 2002 2016 fig 5e these different findings relate to differences in the study areas grace solutions global models and data processing methods however fig 4b shows that gws in the central and northern hhrb as retrieved by grace and noah presented increasing trends which agree with the results of su et al 2020 pearl river basin han et al 2019 proposed a standardized drought severity index gwsa dsi to identify groundwater drought in the prb the region of the prb in their study was consistent with that in our study except that hainan island was included in our study the overall trend of the gwsa dsi in the prb from april 2002 to december 2015 was consistent with the gwsa trend in our study specifically the authors found that groundwater drought mainly occurred during 2003 2006 and 2009 2010 our results also revealed a significant declining gws trend in these two periods fig 5h southwest basin shamsudduha and panda 2019 determined a deficit state of gws over recent decades in most of the himalayan river basins in the southern tibetan plateau which includes the brahmaputra ganges indus irrawaddy and meghna river systems in the same area we found that gws presented a decreasing trend rate of 20 10 mm yr during the study period continental basin the gws variation trends of the alxa plateau hexi corridor qaidam basin and the southern and northern part of the tarim river basin in the cb reported in previous studies were consistent with our study wang et al 2019 revealed the temporal and spatial changes of gws on the alxa plateau by using grace level 3 products and global models for the period from 2003 to 2016 and reported that gws decreased at a rate of 0 12 mm month 1 44 mm yr while we found a gws change rate of 5 0 mm yr fig 4 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b proposed that gws increased significantly in the hexi corridor due to earthquakes or other factors during 2002 2004 after which it decreased slightly until 2016 in our study gws in this area displayed a decreasing trend from 2002 to 2016 with a rate of 5 0 mm yr fig 4 bibi et al 2019 conducted a study on gws and groundwater recharge in the qaidam basin and found that gws increased at a rate of 21 2 mm yr during 2002 2012 but decreased by 32 1 mm yr during 2013 2016 these results correspond to an increasing gws trend at an average rate of 7 mm yr during 2002 2016 while we found 0 10 mm yr fig 4 feng et al 2018 attributed the mass loss to the northern part of the tarim river basin to glacier mass loss in the tien shan mountains while that in the southern part of the tarim river basin was explained by lake volume increase on the northern tibet plateau in our study gws decreased by approximately 15 0 mm yr near the tien shan mountains whereas it increased by 0 10 mm yr in the kunlun mountains of the northern tibetan plateau in summary the results of this study on gws changes of major basins in china are basically consistent with those of previous studies by extensive comparative validation with them differences in some basins are due to different versions of grace satellite data global models specific calculation methods for groundwater size of study area and study periods it also shows that it is necessary to use a unified method to conduct a comprehensive and systematic study of gws in each basin for china as a whole thus this study provides a new idea to get verified gws information through a lot of comparison with previous studies when the observation wells data are difficult to obtain 3 4 sources of error and uncertainty there are multiple sources of error associated with the joint reconstruction of gwsa using grace data and global models the uncertainty of the level 3 gridded surface mass change products includes measurement errors and signal leakage errors measurement errors include systematic and random errors which are reduced by applying decorrelation and gaussian smoothing filters respectively landerer swenson 2012 although decorrelation and gaussian smoothing filters can successfully eliminate correlation errors they also remove real geophysical signals from north south strip data with analog errors to compensate for this this study used a set of global gain factors limited to continental hydrological applications to restore the amplitude of the signal removed during the filtering process in order to evaluate the error value of the global gain factors the estimated measurement and leakage errors of each grace grid were obtained from the jpl s tellus website to estimate the errors associated with the tws time series of each basin the error covariance was considered as the errors of nearby pixels the total monthly error in tws for each basin during the study period table 5 was calculated using eq 2 banerjee et al 2020 2 σ total σ measurement 2 σ leakage 2 the average of different grace products is beneficial for reducing the noise of the gravity field sakumura et al 2014 in this study the weighted average values of the equivalent water thickness changes of the csr gfz and jpl based on the generalized tch method were used as the twsa monitored by grace xu et al 2020a according to the error propagation law the standard deviation calculated by the variance covariance matrix of the error on the time series of the three grace products and weight matrix is used to represent the uncertainty of the twsa in each basin table 5 as shown in eq 3 3 s d wr w t w is the weight matrix of the three grace products r is variance covariance matrix of the error calculated by the generalized tch method in addition differences in the driving data and attributes between different global models will also bring uncertainty to the retrieval of gwsa for example noah only has three attributes soil moisture content snow water equivalent and canopy water storage however wghm and pcr globwb also simulate surface water industrial water use and other anthropogenic water use in the arid inland region or in some special years the gwsa reconstructed by grace with the three models were in good agreement however in regions with many rivers dense surface water networks and dominant anthropogenic water use the gwsa reconstructed by grace with the three models will be significantly different 4 conclusions this study used grace level 3 rl06 land water equivalent thickness surface mass anomaly datasets from the csr gfz and jpl in combination with three global models gldas noah wghm and pcr globwb to retrieve the spatial and temporal gws changes over 10 major basins in china from april 2002 to december 2016 through a unified method the results showed that gws changes in the srb lrb hrb yrb hhrb and seb exhibited decreasing trends in contrast gws changes in the yzrb and prb presented increasing trends while those in the swb and cb both increased and decreased these results are basically consistent with those of previous studies by extensive comparative validation with them differences in some basins are due to different versions of grace satellite data global models specific calculation methods for groundwater size of study area and study periods the causes of gws changes in different basins were analyzed in terms of natural factors and human factors based on precipitation evapotranspiration and other data it was found that decreasing trends in gws were mainly associated with an insufficient groundwater supply due to low precipitation and high evapotranspiration decreasing trends were also related to groundwater exploitation for irrigation in the five northern basins srb lrb hrb yrb and hhrb the declining trend of gws in the seb was primarily due to water use for production water groundwater recharge from precipitation was the main factor influencing the increasing trends of gws in the yzrb and prb during the study period in addition permeation in the upper yzrb also contributed to the increasing trend of gws in the yzrb the underground rivers in the karst area of the prb facilitated the loss of groundwater and slowed the increase of gws in the prb the factors influencing the gws changes in the swb and cb were more complex because these are wide geographical areas for the swb the increasing trend in gws in yunnan was largely due to increased recharge from precipitation and a reduced groundwater loss in low karst areas the decreasing trend in gws on the southern tibetan plateau was considered to be related to groundwater overexploitation and insufficient groundwater recharge for the cb increasing precipitation glacier meltwater and snowmelt caused by global warming were the main reasons for the increasing trends of gws on the northern tibetan plateau and in the qaidam basin the declining trends of gws in the area to the northwest of xinjiang and in northern inner mongolia were primarily due to the expansion of agricultural land and extensive irrigation this study not only enriches the research on gws variation in the traditional study regions of china but also supplements the gws changes over the past decade in southeast basin pearl river basin and continental basin which are not covered by the previous studies and with rare gws information the results were verified to be accurate and reliable by local scale validation and comparison with a large number of previous gws change studies in different basins the reliable gws information could provide reference for the policy planning of groundwater resource management and economic development in different regions credit authorship

4549,as an important freshwater resource groundwater is of great significance to agriculture industry and daily life the investigation of groundwater storage gws in different regions of china is critical for water resource management and conservation however previous studies used different methods and data to monitor gws in different regions of china which made their results difficult to compare and cross validate here we used a unified method by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data and global models to study the variations of gws in 10 major basins in china from april 2002 to december 2016 results showed that gws in the i songhua river basin srb liao river basin lrb haihe river basin hrb yellow river basin yrb huaihe river basin hhrb and southeast basin seb exhibited decreasing trends ii yangtze river basin yzrb and pearl river basin prb presented increasing trends and iii southwest basin swb and continental basin cb displayed both decreasing and increasing trends during the study period these results were validated by comparing them with a large number of previous studies which revealed that they were accurate and reliable comparing with the climate data and bulletin data the analysis of causes for these trends indicated that drought and irrigation water use led to a decline in gws in several basins of northern china the decreasing trend of gws in the seb was related to water use for production whereas groundwater recharge from precipitation drove the increasing trends of gws in the yzrb and prb in contrast the wide geographical areas and complex factors of the swb and cb led to the increasing decreasing trends of gws this study enriches the gws for china over the past decade especially for seb prb and cb with rare gws information it will be helpful for the country s groundwater resource management and systematic water conservation keywords grace hydrological models groundwater storage basin china 1 introduction as an important freshwater resource groundwater is important for agriculture industry and daily life aeschbach hertig gleeson 2012 approximately 43 of the total consumptive irrigation water use is from groundwater siebert et al 2010 moreover groundwater supplies 50 of drinking water and 40 of industrial water globally zektser and everett 2004 thus maintaining the development of industry and households in many parts of the world alley et al 2002 the massive exploitation of groundwater due to extreme weather events and population growth among other factors has led to chronic groundwater depletion in many regions of the world examples include northwest india chatterjee et al 2020 chen et al 2014 long et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 iran joodaki et al 2014 california s central valley famiglietti et al 2011 scanlon et al 2012 and the north china plain feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 groundwater depletion not only poses a serious challenge to the sustainable supply of water resources jia et al 2020 yi et al 2016 but also causes a range of ecological and social problems for example sea level rise soil salinization and ground settlement lu et al 2015 scanlon et al 2007 shah et al 2001 monitoring dynamic variations in groundwater storage gws is of great significance for the sustainable use of regional water resources as well as the prevention of natural ecological and human social problems caused by groundwater depletion the traditional method for monitoring changes in gws is mainly based on groundwater well observations this method has high requirements for the number of monitoring points and their representativeness moreover it requires a lot of manpower to complete the preliminary work e g site selection and its distribution it is difficult to accurately reflect the variations in regional gws and realize the monitoring of large scale groundwater level changes using well data ren et al 2014 the estimation of water storage changes based on remote sensing is gradually being applied to monitor regional gws the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite is a cooperative project of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german aerospace center deutsches zentrum für luft und raumfahrt dlr this approach provides techniques to assess global terrestrial water storage tws by measuring variations in earth s gravity field the use of grace satellite data with other hydrological information provides an effective way to monitor changes in gws on a large scale and in uninformed areas li et al 2018 many studies have successfully used grace data to estimate regional gws changes including in the middle east voss et al 2013 the high plain in the united states longuevergne et al 2010 rodell famiglietti 2002 the mississippi river basin in the united states rodell et al 2006 southern murray darling basin in australia chen et al 2015 and in tasmania yin et al 2020 in china some studies have monitored the gws variation using grace by focusing on typical regions with chronic groundwater depletion e g the north china plain tangdamrongsub et al 2018 wang et al 2020a 2020b yin et al 2018 other studies have been applied to single regional basins with smaller areas such as the west liaohe river basin zhong et al 2018 loess plateau xie et al 2018a xie et al 018b hexi corridor wang et al 2020a 2020b alxa plateau wang et al 2019 qaidam basin hu jiao 2015 jinsha river basin chao et al 2019 and southwest karst area huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 analyzed the seasonal and inter annual variation characteristics of gws in china using grace products and global models and provided a meaningful discussion on the regional gws variation in china however owing to different i versions of grace satellite data ii global models iii specific calculation methods for groundwater and iv study periods it is difficult to compare the results of these studies with each other in addition although some researchers spotlighted on the tws variation at basin scale throughout china xu et al 2019 the spatiotemporal changes of gws involving each basin and the analysis of their causes are still rare thus there is a need to comprehensively and systematically obtain and verify gws data in each basin for china as a whole this study uses grace satellite data and multi source global models to retrieve gws changes in 10 major basins of china from april 2002 to december 2016 through unified methods and processes accordingly we aim to determine the spatiotemporal variations of gws in different regions of china we analyzed the main causes of gws changes in 10 basins from both natural and anthropogenic perspectives using precipitation evapotranspiration and other data while enriching the information on gws variation in the traditional study regions of china this study complements the gws changes over the past decade in southeast basin pearl river basin and continental basin which are not covered by the previous studies it provides new reliable gws information at basin scale by local scale validation and systematically comparing the spatial and temporal variations of gws in the major basins of china with previous research results based on deep discussion this study reveals the important drivers of gws variation in different basins e g precipitation and overexploitation which will provide a scientific basis and reference for the formulation of policies and projects on groundwater resource management water conservancy and inter regional water transport the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly introduce the principle and method of the grace based estimation of gws variations along with the data used in this study section 3 presents the spatial and temporal variations as well as the causes of gws in 10 basins of china we compared the reliability of our results with those of previous studies and then summarized sources of error and uncertainty finally section 4 presents the conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area to better study the spatial and temporal variations of gws in different regions of china we used the 1 250 000 scale basin classification datasets of the national earth system science data center national science and technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn these datasets divide china into 10 basins songhua river basin srb liaohe river basin lrb haihe river basin hrb yellow river basin yrb huaihe river basin hhrb southeast basin seb yangtze river basin yzrb pearl river basin prb southwest basin swb and continental basin cb fig 1 the groundwater in china mainly includes loose sediment pore water karst fissure cave water bedrock fissure water and perennial permafrost pore fissure water most areas in srb lrb hrb and hhrb have pore water in the sand and gravel layers of the sedimentary plain loess pore water is mainly distributed in the yrb karst fissure cave water is mostly distributed in the swb yunnan province the western part of the prb and the middle and lower reaches of yzrb pore water from alluvial plains and deserts is found in the northwest of the cb while in the southern part of the basin pore water from permafrost pores and fissures is found on the tibetan plateau according to the degree of gws capacity the 10 basins can be divided into three types strong srb lrb yzrb and prb medium hrb hhrb swb and cb and weak yrb and seb chinese academy of geological sciences http www geoscience cn swdz swdzt index htm 2 2 data and processing 2 2 1 grace data the processing distribution and management of grace satellite data are jointly undertaken by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl german research center gfz and center for space research csr at the university of texas at austin the grace products included several levels 0 1a 1b and 2 level 2 products provide a spherical harmonic sh coefficient for the convenience of users to study mass anomalies some teams offer level 3 products that are generated from level 2 with geophysical corrections the mass concentration block mascon is other kind of product regional grace mascon solutions have a much higher signal to noise ratio than traditional spherical harmonic solutions because of reduced leakage save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 sun et al 2020 current providers of mascon solutions include jpl csr and nasa goddard space flight center gsfc however the time mean removal of mascons from the three institutions is not consistent jpl and csr january 2004 to december 2009 gsfc january 2004 to december 2016 and the spatial resolutions of these mascons also differ csr 0 25 0 25 jpl native resolution of 3 gsfc native resolution of 1 this will lead to a difference in the tws anomalies twsa calculated by different mascons and it is difficult to compare them with each other therefore we used the grace level 3 rl06 and water equivalent thickness surface mass anomaly datasets produced by the jpl gfz and csr in this study https podaac tools jpl nasa gov drive files alldata tellus l3 grace land mass rl06 level 3 products use gaussian smoothing with a radius of 300 km and decorrelation filtering to reduce correlation errors swenson wahr 2006 these datasets were returned to the background model and a glacial isostatic adjustment gia correction was applied all processed data are presented as anomalies relative to the time mean baseline of the period from january 2005 to december 2010 and the time variable gravity field is shown in the form of the equivalent water thickness that represents the twsa 2 2 2 global models this study used two global hydrology models ghms and a global land surface model lsm to extract gws anomalies

2002 2015 to validate the results of gws changes in some basins 2 3 methods considering the long data gaps between grace and grace follow on grace fo a continuation of the mission products and the time range of available data provided by the global models we set the study period from april 2002 to december 2016 the grace level 3 rl06 products from three institutions were resized to facilitate calculation with global models then the terrestrial equivalent water thickness variation values were extracted and the values 19 missing months of grace in the grace gridded data were filled by linear interpolation the seasonal and trend decomposition using loess stl method was used to decompose the time series and remove the seasonal cycle the inter annual variation trends of the twsa in each basin were obtained by fitting the remaining part long term and residual according to the least squares method scanlon et al 2018 the average of the equivalent water thickness change values from the csr jpl and gfz were used as the final grace monitored twsa fig 2 due to differences in the processing strategies and tuning parameters of the respective research centers for three grace level 3 rl06 products averaging these products is beneficial for reducing the noise of the gravity field sakumura et al 2014 in order to reduce the random errors and to fuse these datasets more reliably this study used a merging scheme based on the generalized three cornered hat tch method to weighted average the three grace products mccoll et al 2014 xu et al 2020a 2020b the uncertainty among the three grace level 3 rl06 products was calculated using standard deviation xu et al 2019 considering the availability of data and consistency with the processing of grace solutions monthly data of noah and wghm from april 2002 to december 2016 and pcr globwb from april 2002 to december 2015 were selected these datasets were resized and then the monthly values were processed into anomaly values by subtracting the average for the period from january 2005 to december 2010 the seasonal cycle was removed subsequently using the stl method to obtain a time series of water storage changes in the 10 basins fig 2 similarly the precipitation and evapotranspiration data from april 2002 to december 2016 were selected and resized then the monthly values were extracted and the average for the period from january 2005 to december 2010 was removed for each month finally to facilitate the subsequent comparison with the trend of gws changes the seasonal variations in the long time series of precipitation and evapotranspiration for each basin were removed using the stl method fig 2 here we derived gwsa from twsa by subtracting the snow water equivalent anomalies swea surface water storage anomalies swsa including rivers lakes reservoirs and wetlands soil moisture storage anomalies smsa and canopy water storage anomalies cwsa according to the water balance principle chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 as shown in eq 1 gwsa twsa swea swsa smsa cwsa 1 the twsa were provided by the grace satellite products and the swea swsa smsa and cwsa were obtained from the global models fig 2 the gwsa were estimated as the residual fields between the grace tws changes and available non groundwater water changes from i noah hereafter grace noah ii pcr globwb hereafter grace pcr globwb or iii wghm hereafter grace wghm then we analyzed the causes of the gws changes in each basin finally sources of error and uncertainty were calculated which are discussed in section 3 4 moreover this study used local scale validation method yin et al 2017 to compare the gws changes by datasets in the hrb hhrb yzrb and cb from bulletins with gwsa retrieved by grace and three global models the annual values from gws datasets were extracted and the average for the period from 2005 to 2010 was removed for each year to consistent with grace solutions the results of grace combined with global models were integrated and their average annual values were compared with the results of gws datasets fig 3 it is worth noting that grace derived gws usually represents the change of mass in the entire depth of aquifer which probably does not coincide with the depth of aquifer in the water resources bulletin yin et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal changes of gws the gws changes of the srb lrb hrb yrb hhrb and seb clearly exhibited declining trends the yzrb and prb displayed increasing trends while the swb and cb presented both increasing and decreasing trends that spanned a wide geographical area fig 4 b 3d specifically the regions where gws decreased significantly included most areas of the hrb the middle and lower reaches of the yrb the tibetan part of the swb and the northwest part of the cb with the most severe declines found in the hrb and northern part of the swb among the regions where gws trends increased the middle and lower reaches of the yzrb the yunnan part of the swb and the southwest of the cb most of qinghai province and southern xinjiang exhibited the most obvious increasing trends among these basins the maximum decreasing trend of gws during the study period was observed in the hrb average rate of 10 30 mm yr whereas the minimum decreasing trend was found in the srb average rate of 1 90 mm yr in the lrb yrb hhrb seb swb and cb gws decreased by average rates of 5 54 mm yr 5 50 mm yr 2 52 mm yr 2 45 mm yr 9 06 mm yr and 2 76 mm yr respectively whereas gws increased by average rates of 1 55 mm yr and 1 57 mm yr in the yzrb and prb respectively fig 5 the estimated gwsa results of these 10 basins were influenced by differences in the driving data structure and attributes of the three global models specifically 1 although the gwsa reflected by three global models combined with grace data differed they generally exhibited consistent trends in most basins spatially the gws retrieved by grace noah and grace pcr globwb presented more obvious increasing trends in the seb and southwest part of the cb than the gws retrieved by grace wghm in the northwest part of the cb the gws retrieved by grace noah presented more dramatic decline trends than the gws retrieved by the other two models the gws retrieved by grace pcr globwb showed a more significant increase in the southern part of the swb yunnan province moreover grace noah reflected a more continuous trend of gwsa in spatial whereas individual extremes were often present in the regional gws change trends of grace wghm and grace pcr globwb fig 4b 3d temporally we found that the inter annual trends of gwsa across the basins by linear fitting using least squares were not always consistent the gws retrieved by grace wghm displayed the largest increasing or decreasing trends for the srb lrb hrb yrb hhrb and prb while showed the smallest increasing trend in yzrb the gws retrieved by grace pcr globwb reflected the most significant change trends in the yzrb and swb but showed the slightest gws change trends in srb lrb yrb hhrb prb and cb the gws retrieved by grace noah displayed the largest declining trend in the cb while the smallest in the hrb and swb fig 5 in addition although the time series curves of gwsa shown by the three global models combined with grace data were generally similar in most regions but there are significant differences in some basins for individual time periods in the srb the gws retrieved by i grace wghm and grace pcr globwb showed obvious upward trends from august 2003 to march 2004 while grace noah decreased and then increased ii grace wghm and grace pcr globwb displayed increasing trends in january to february 2010 but grace noah was declining steadily during this period iii grace wghm and grace pcr globwb reflected significant increasing trends from may 2013 to may 2014 while grace noah increased slightly and then decreased fig 5a in the lrb the gws retrieved by grace noah was significantly lower than that of grace wghm and grace pcr globwb from 2005 to 2006 but was obviously higher than them in june 2009 to june 2010 fig 5b in the hhrb the gws retrieved by grace noah was much higher than that of grace wghm and grace pcr globwb in 2015 2016 fig 5e the curve shapes of the three global models combined with grace data were quite different in 2010 2016 of the seb and 2011 of the yzrb fig 5f g in the cb the gws retrieved by grace noah was significantly lower than that of the other two global models during 2016 fig 5j 2 differences were detected in the adaptability and retrieval ability of the three global models for different regions which were directly related to the calculation accuracy and precision of the gwsa for example both the gws retrieved by grace wghm and grace pcr globwb presented decreasing trends in the seb over the last 15 years grace wghm 3 38 mm yr grace pcr globwb 1 52 mm yr but the gws retrieved by grace noah in this area showed an increasing trend of 1 45 mm yr this discrepancy may be due to the fact that noah does not contain surface water attributes e g rivers lakes and reservoirs while the seb has a dense water network and many rivers 3 2 cause analysis of gws changes in different basins the characteristics and causes of gws changes in different basins between april 2002 and december 2016 were analyzed table 2 according to the trends of gws variations fig 5 the 10 basins were divided into three types 1 the srb lrb hrb yrb hhrb and seb decreasing trends of gws 2 the yzrb and prb increasing trends of gws and 3 the swb and cb both increasing and decreasing trends of gws 3 2 1 basins with decreasing gws change trends and analysis of causes songhua river basin the results showed that gws in the srb decreased at an average rate of 1 90 mm yr fig 5a between april 2002 and december 2016 when the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration were 495 93 mm and 713 91 mm respectively i e a difference of 217 98 mm fig 6 a therefore the reduction of gws in the srb related to insufficient groundwater recharge resulting from low precipitation and high evapotranspiration in fig 5a it can be seen that gws increased significantly in 2013 when the basin experienced the largest annual precipitation 659 44 mm which exceeds average by 33 and smallest annual evapotranspiration 647 20 mm 9 less than average of the study period in addition to natural factors the decline of gws in the srb was also influenced by human factors the srb is one of the most important commercial grain production bases in china and its middle and lower reaches are agriculturally intensive li et al 2016a 2016b according to the water resource bulletin the srb has an average annual proportion of groundwater consumption of 42 from 2002 to 2016 and agricultural production accounts for 75 of total water use with the expansion of arable land irrigation sources have shifted from surface water to groundwater and groundwater now plays a crucial role in irrigation during the growing season chen et al 2019 thus anthropogenic water use was an important cause of the observed gws decline in the srb during the study period it should be noted that the impact of precipitation on gws may have a lag period whereby gws increased temporarily 1 2 months after heavy precipitation i e august 2013 in fig 5a and figure s1a this may have been influenced by geological formations topography and human factors which can slow groundwater recharge liaohe river basin gws in the lrb decreased at an average rate of 5 54 mm yr between april 2002 and december 2016 fig 5b the trend of gwsa in the lrb was closely related to precipitation and evapotranspiration the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration in the lrb were 539 70 mm and 942 99 mm respectively i e a difference of 403 29 mm fig 6b therefore inadequate groundwater recharge in the basin caused by the perennial precipitation deficit and high evapotranspiration would have contributed to the continued groundwater depletion in addition the overexploitation of groundwater was also an important factor influencing the observed decreasing trend of gws in the lrb the average annual groundwater supply in the lrb is 54 with 68 of the total water use for agriculture surface water pollution due to industrial development has shifted the use of water resources to groundwater in the lrb and groundwater has become the main source of water resources in the lrb zhang et al 2012 based on groundwater well observations feng et al 2018 found that groundwater depletion occurred mainly in the western area of the lrb zhong et al 2018 attributed the groundwater depletion this area to decreased groundwater recharge reduced precipitation infiltration and increased groundwater exploitation due to irrigation haihe river basin this basin experienced severe groundwater depletion between april 2002 and december 2016 with gws exhibiting a continuous decline at an average rate of 10 30 mm yr fig 5c the average annual evapotranspiration 1053 56 mm was twice the average annual precipitation 502 54 mm during the study period in the hrb fig 6c thus a serious shortage of groundwater recharge from precipitation likely contributed to the decreasing trend of gws at the same time a dry climate and low precipitation mean that people exploit more groundwater to compensate for the shortage of surface water numerous studies have shown that groundwater overextraction due to irrigation as well as industrial and domestic water use is an important cause of groundwater decline in the hrb long et al 2020 pan et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 as the hrb is highly irrigated agriculture accounts for 68 of the total water use in the region of which 37 comes from groundwater extraction xu et al 2019 hence intensive irrigation has accelerated groundwater depletion yellow river basin this basin is a typical semiarid area in northern china the results showed that gws in the yrb decreased at an average rate of 5 50 mm yr between april 2002 and december 2016 fig 5d when the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration in the yrb were 419 12 mm and 938 81 mm respectively i e a difference of 519 69 mm fig 6d thus a lack of groundwater recharge due to low precipitation and high evapotranspiration contributed to the observed decline of gws in the yrb however gws in the yrb increased from 2003 to 2004 fig 5d which probably related to the fact that 2003 experienced the highest precipitation 522 30 mm above average by 25 and lowest evapotranspiration 880 92 mm 6 less than average of the study period fig 6d the decline of gws in this basin was also the result of excessive groundwater exploitation groundwater in the yrb is mainly used for agricultural irrigation followed by industrial and domestic water use the yrb is an important agricultural area for wheat and corn in china where irrigation extraction accounts for most of the total water extraction xie et al 2019 according to statistics the average annual groundwater supply in the yrb is 33 from 2002 to 2016 with agriculture accounting for 72 of total water use finally coal mining also affects gws in the yrb chen et al 2020 found that coal mining was directly related to the reduction of gws in ordos northern shaanxi including yan an and yulin cities and shanxi huaihe river basin the results showed that gws in the hhrb decreased at an average rate of 2 52 mm yr between april 2002 and december 2016 fig 5e when the average annual evapotranspiration 1034 00 mm exceeded the average annual precipitation 854 54 mm i e a difference of 179 46 mm fig 6e thus insufficient groundwater recharge was one reason for the detected decrease in gws in the hhrb from fig 5e it can be seen that gws increased briefly in 2003 when the basin experienced the highest annual precipitation 1145 69 mm above average by 34 of the study period fig 6e as the hhrb covers jiangsu province shandong province anhui province and other densely areas human factors cannot be ignored the average annual groundwater supply in the hhrb from 2002 to 2016 was 169 01 108 m3 29 of total water supply which was less than that in the srb 183 45 108 m3 but more than that in the yrb 129 39 108 m3 table 3 therefore human water consumption was probably an important cause of the decline of gws in these three basins furthermore groundwater extraction in the hhrb is mainly used for irrigation whereby irrigation of farmland accounts for 69 of the total water consumption in the basin according to the huaihe river water resources report southeast basin gws in the seb presented a decreasing trend between april 2002 and december 2016 and was mainly reflected in the gwsa retrieved by grace wghm 3 38 mm yr and grace pcr globwb 1 52 mm yr with the average trend of these two methods being 2 45 mm yr fig 5f the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration in the seb were 1663 51 mm and 951 16 mm during the study period respectively i e a difference of 712 35 mm fig 6f the primary cause of the detected gws decline was human water use mainly that for production the seb includes southern zhejiang province fujian province and northern guangdong province which are well developed urbanized areas where surface water is polluted to some extent groundwater has been used to compensate for the lack of suitable surface water li et al 2016a li et al 2016b found a large number of funnel shaped settlements in the coastal area of zhejiang province where maximum settlement rates were typically below 30 mm yr they considered that this was mainly due to the overexploitation of groundwater by factories in summary the decreasing trends of gws in five basins of northern china srb lrb hrb yrb and hhrb could be attributed both to natural factors i e insufficient groundwater recharge due to low precipitation and high evapotranspiration and human factors i e overexploitation for irrigation conversely increased precipitation in specific years was an influencing factor for the increased gwsa the decreasing trend of gws in the seb was mainly due to human water use primarily that for production 3 2 2 basins with increasing gws change trend and analysis of causes yangtze river basin gws in the yzrb increased at an average rate of 1 55 mm yr from april 2002 to december 2016 fig 5g when the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration were 995 97 mm and 875 17 mm respectively i e a difference of 120 80 mm fig 6g thus the increasing trend of gws in the yzrb would have been partly due to the fact that precipitation exceeded evapotranspiration ferreira et al 2020 in addition to groundwater recharge from precipitation permeation in the upper reaches of the yzrb could have also led to an increase in gws some evidence has shown that groundwater seepage flow from the endorheic basin of the tibetan plateau to the water source area of the yzrb occurs through fault tunnels in deep aquifers jin feng 2013 xiang et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 the yzrb experienced a severe drought from may 2006 to august 2008 zhang et al 2016 our data revealed that the monthly average evapotranspiration during this period 74 65 mm exceeded the monthly average evapotranspiration for the entire study period 72 98 mm and that the monthly average precipitation 78 28 mm of this period was less than the monthly average precipitation for the entire study period 83 00 mm figure s1 however gws did not show a significant downward trend from may 2006 to august 2008 due to permeation pearl river basin gws in the prb increased at an average rate of 1 57 mm yr during the study period fig 5h when the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration were 1500 57 mm and 980 26 mm respectively i e a difference of 520 31 mm fig 6h recharge from precipitation contributed to the increasing trend of gws in the prb the prb includes guangxi and guangdong provinces the karstic landscape and developed underground pores in guangxi have created a large number of underground rivers huang et al 2019 as a result the large drainage of underground rivers offsets some precipitation recharge and probably led to a slight increase in groundwater levels in this area during the study period the prb experienced severe droughts in 2009 and 2011 with a monthly average evapotranspiration of 85 82 mm and 83 25 mm respectively which were greater than the average monthly evapotranspiration of 81 77 mm for the entire study period figure s1 after these extreme droughts the prb underwent a significant recovery of gws in 2010 and 2012 due to increased precipitation coupled with the efficient pore infiltration huang et al 2019 in summary the increasing trends in gws in the yzrb and prb between april 2002 and december 2016 were considered to be mainly due to precipitation recharge it is likely that permeation in the upper reaches of the yzrb also made an important contribution to the gws increase in the yzrb underground rivers in the karst areas of the prb would have caused a loss of groundwater that slowed the increasing trend of gws although the yzrb and prb have experienced severe droughts precipitation recharge permeation and pore infiltration accelerated the recovery of groundwater during the study period 3 2 3 basins with increasing and decreasing gws change trends and analysis of causes the swb and cb cover wide geographical areas and presented both increasing and decreasing trends of gws in different regions a detailed analysis of the gws trends within these two basins is as follows southwest basin gws in the swb decreased at an average rate of 9 06 mm yr from april 2002 to december 2016 fig 5i when the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration were 842 20 mm and 821 86 mm respectively i e a difference of 20 34 mm fig 6i the swb includes yunnan province and the southern tibetan plateau fig 4 shows that gws in yunnan exhibited an increasing trend at a rate that was mostly between 5 mm yr and 15 mm yr whereas this was between 10 mm yr and 20 mm yr on the southern tibetan plateau the magnitude of the decreasing trend of gws on the southern tibetan plateau was greater than the increasing trend of gws in yunnan therefore the total gws in the swb presented a declining trend the gws changes in yunnan province and the southern tibetan plateau were separately analyzed as follows a great swath of karst covers much of yunnan province long et al 2014 huang et al 2019 studied groundwater changes in yunnan province by classifying it into low karst regions the authors reported that groundwater recharge in this region comes primarily from precipitation and attributed the main loss of groundwater to underground channels created by karst geology there are fewer known underground channels in yunnan 96 in comparison to guangxi 374 hence less groundwater is lost via underground channels in yunnan these factors would have led to an increasing trend of gws in yunnan between april 2002 and december 2016 a reason for the observed decreasing trend in gws on the southern tibetan plateau was the overexploitation of groundwater the tibetan plateau is bordered by afghanistan india and bangladesh xiang et al 2016 showed that a decreased gws in the wider area of the tibetan plateau was mainly caused by excessive exploitation and use of groundwater in addition snowmelt means that soil water tends to be saturated which prevents the infiltration of precipitation most of the precipitation associated with strong monsoons recharges runoff directly rather than groundwater during the monsoon season on the southern tibetan plateau kong et al 2019 insufficient precipitation also contributed to the decreasing trend of gws during the study period continental basin gws in the cb decreased at an average rate of 2 76 mm yr between april 2002 and december 2016 fig 5j when the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration were 193 04 mm and 990 15 mm respectively i e a difference of 797 11 mm fig 6j thus high evapotranspiration and very low precipitation were the primary factors influencing the gws decline in the cb based on the trend of gws change over time the cb was divided into two parts for analysis the northern tibet plateau and the qaidam basin where gws showed an increasing trend and the area to the northwest of xinjiang and northern inner mongolia where gws showed a decreasing trend fig 4 precipitation glacier meltwater and snowmelt due to climate change were probably the main contributors to the increasing gws trend on the northern tibetan plateau and in the qaidam basin feng et al 2018 concluded that the main reason for the increasing trend of gws on the northern tibet plateau was glacier meltwater and snowmelt from the tien shan mountains and pamir mountains regarding the increasing trend of gws in the qaidam basin bibi et al 2019 considered that groundwater recharge in this closed basin is mainly due precipitation but with inputs from other sources such as permafrost and snow meltwater due to global warming the primary reason for the decreasing gws trend in the area to the northwest of xinjiang and northern inner mongolia during the study period was extensive irrigation xie et al 2018a xie et al 2018b found that the decline of gws in xinjiang gansu shaanxi and ningxia was largely due to agricultural irrigation and the continuous expansion of agricultural in these regions wang et al 2019 studied the alxa plateau in northwest inner mongolia and reported that the decrease in gws was mainly related to irrigation and domestic water use zhang et al 2014 found that the governing factor for groundwater depletion in the dunhuang oasis between 1987 and 2007 was a significant increase in the area used for cash crops especially cotton which increased the amount of irrigation water overall for the swb the observed increasing trend of gws in yunnan was largely associated with increased recharge from precipitation and reduced groundwater loss in low karst areas the decreasing trend of gws on the southern tibetan plateau between april 2002 and december 2016 was related to the overexploitation and insufficient recharge of groundwater for the cb increased precipitation glacier meltwater and snowmelt due to global warming were likely the main reasons for the increasing trends of gws on the northern tibet plateau and in the qaidam basin the declining gws trends in the area to the northwest of xinjiang and northern inner mongolia were primarily related to the expansion of agricultural land and extensive irrigation 3 3 comparison of gwsa with previous studies table 4 summarizes previous studies on the evaluation of gwsa using grace data in combination with global models and other information five basins of our study srb lrb hrb yrb and yzrb were included these previous studies whereby the study areas were roughly the same or consistent in size with these five basins four other basins of our study hhrb prb swb and cb have been lesser reported in previous studies whereby the study areas were either similar to or smaller than these four basins hence limited comparison can be made for these four basins to date there have been no studies on gws changes in the seb using grace data in combination with other data 3 3 1 direct comparison of five basins songhua river basin chen et al 2019 estimated the gws change of the srb using two mascons and three sh products from the csr jpl and gfz in combination with lsms from gldas their results showed that gws in the srb increased significantly between 1998 and 2008 at a rate of 3 91 1 06 mm yr whereas it subsequently decreased dramatically between 2009 and 2013 at a rate of 5 51 3 46 mm yr the trend of gws in the srb was decreasing during 1998 2013 in our study the gws change of the srb also exhibited a decreasing trend average rate of 1 90 mm yr between 2002 and 2016 which was higher during 2009 2013 4 65 mm yr liaohe river basin zhong et al 2018 studied the gws change in the western lrb area of 13 6 104 km2 using a mascon of csr combined with four lsms of gldas 1 their results showed that gws decreased at a rate of 0 43 0 26 km3 yr between 2005 and 2015 which approximately equates to 3 16 1 80 mm yr there was a higher rate of 0 92 0 49 km3 yr for the period from 2005 to 2011 which approximately equates to 6 76 3 60 mm yr feng et al 2018 evaluated the gws change in the aquifer of the songliao basin in northeast china based on rl05 sh data of the csr in combination with global models their results revealed that gws in the lrb for an area of 26 104 km2 experienced a pronounced decline during 2005 2009 at a rate of 5 0 1 2 km3 yr which equates to 19 2 4 6 mm yr we also found that gws decreased significantly in the lrb area of 34 42 104 km2 during the slightly longer period of 2005 2011 but at an average rate of 9 58 mm yr subsequently the gws trend increased at a rate of 6 48 mm yr during 2012 2014 fig 5b which is consistent with the trends reported by zhong et al 2018 and feng et al 2018 haihe river basin many studies have focused on the hrb feng et al 2013 used rl05 sh data of the csr to monitor gws changes in north china the authors found that the rate of groundwater depletion in an area of 370 000 km2 which included the municipalities of beijing and tianjin as well as hebei and shanxi provinces was 8 3 1 1 km3 yr during 2003 2010 which approximately equates to 22 4 3 0 mm yr shen et al 2015 used grace solutions to calculate the gws change in the hrb area of 32 104 km2 and reported a declining trend at a rate of 17 0 4 3 mm yr during 2003 2012 zhao et al 2019 used the csr jpl and gsfc mascons in combination with four lsms of gldas 1 to retrieve the gws change of the north china plain area of 14 104 km2 during 2004 2016 and determined a decreasing gws trend at a rate of 1 7 0 1 cm yr the rates reported by these three previous studies were relatively larger in comparison to our results for the gws change in the hrb average rate of 10 30 mm yr during 2002 2016 fig 5c for an area of 33 15 104 km2 the differences between our results and those of feng et al 2013 and shen et al 2015 relate to the various study periods used as well as the different grace data global models and processing methods the difference between our results and those of zhao et al 2019 mainly relates to the study area although zhao et al 2019 had a similar research period and processing method to our study their study area covered the typical plain region from the taihang mountains to the yellow river which was half of the area used in our study moreover long et al 2020 showed that the decreasing gws trend in the hrb had weakened they found that gws in beijing i e the central part of the north china plain had obviously increased due to increased precipitation in 2012 and the south to north diversion of water since 2015 yellow river basin zhang et al 2019 found that the gws depletion rate derived from grace for the yrb area of 73 104 km2 during 2005 2013 was 3 11 mm yr similarly xie et al 2019 concluded that gws decreased at a rate of 4 2 1 0 mm yr in the yrb area of 79 5 104 km2 during 2003 2015 the findings of both of these studies generally agree with our rate of decline 5 50 mm yr fig 5d for the yrb during 2002 2016 area of 80 24 104 km2 yangtze river basin ferreira et al 2020 used grace and the csr s rl06 sh products combined with noah gldas 2 1 to estimate the gws changes in the yzrb area of 180 104 km2 which indicated that gws increased at a rate of 1 76 mm yr during 2003 2016 in our study the increasing rate of gws in the yzrb area of 166 84 104 km2 calculated by grace level 3 products and noah was 2 04 mm yr during 2002 2016 whereas the average of grace noah grace wghm and grace pcr globwb was 1 55 mm yr fig 5g which are both similar to the results of ferreira et al 2020 3 3 2 partial comparison of four basins huaihe river basin su et al 2020 used the jpl s rl06 mascon and gldas simulated data to estimate the spatiotemporal changes of gws and analyzed the driving factors of gws changes in the huang huai hai plain from 2003 to 2015 the authors found that gws increased at a rate of 0 1 cm yr for most areas of the huang huai hai plain which includes only parts of the central and northern hhrb in contrast we found that gws in the hhrb decreased at a rate of 2 52 mm yr during 2002 2016 fig 5e these different findings relate to differences in the study areas grace solutions global models and data processing methods however fig 4b shows that gws in the central and northern hhrb as retrieved by grace and noah presented increasing trends which agree with the results of su et al 2020 pearl river basin han et al 2019 proposed a standardized drought severity index gwsa dsi to identify groundwater drought in the prb the region of the prb in their study was consistent with that in our study except that hainan island was included in our study the overall trend of the gwsa dsi in the prb from april 2002 to december 2015 was consistent with the gwsa trend in our study specifically the authors found that groundwater drought mainly occurred during 2003 2006 and 2009 2010 our results also revealed a significant declining gws trend in these two periods fig 5h southwest basin shamsudduha and panda 2019 determined a deficit state of gws over recent decades in most of the himalayan river basins in the southern tibetan plateau which includes the brahmaputra ganges indus irrawaddy and meghna river systems in the same area we found that gws presented a decreasing trend rate of 20 10 mm yr during the study period continental basin the gws variation trends of the alxa plateau hexi corridor qaidam basin and the southern and northern part of the tarim river basin in the cb reported in previous studies were consistent with our study wang et al 2019 revealed the temporal and spatial changes of gws on the alxa plateau by using grace level 3 products and global models for the period from 2003 to 2016 and reported that gws decreased at a rate of 0 12 mm month 1 44 mm yr while we found a gws change rate of 5 0 mm yr fig 4 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b proposed that gws increased significantly in the hexi corridor due to earthquakes or other factors during 2002 2004 after which it decreased slightly until 2016 in our study gws in this area displayed a decreasing trend from 2002 to 2016 with a rate of 5 0 mm yr fig 4 bibi et al 2019 conducted a study on gws and groundwater recharge in the qaidam basin and found that gws increased at a rate of 21 2 mm yr during 2002 2012 but decreased by 32 1 mm yr during 2013 2016 these results correspond to an increasing gws trend at an average rate of 7 mm yr during 2002 2016 while we found 0 10 mm yr fig 4 feng et al 2018 attributed the mass loss to the northern part of the tarim river basin to glacier mass loss in the tien shan mountains while that in the southern part of the tarim river basin was explained by lake volume increase on the northern tibet plateau in our study gws decreased by approximately 15 0 mm yr near the tien shan mountains whereas it increased by 0 10 mm yr in the kunlun mountains of the northern tibetan plateau in summary the results of this study on gws changes of major basins in china are basically consistent with those of previous studies by extensive comparative validation with them differences in some basins are due to different versions of grace satellite data global models specific calculation methods for groundwater size of study area and study periods it also shows that it is necessary to use a unified method to conduct a comprehensive and systematic study of gws in each basin for china as a whole thus this study provides a new idea to get verified gws information through a lot of comparison with previous studies when the observation wells data are difficult to obtain 3 4 sources of error and uncertainty there are multiple sources of error associated with the joint reconstruction of gwsa using grace data and global models the uncertainty of the level 3 gridded surface mass change products includes measurement errors and signal leakage errors measurement errors include systematic and random errors which are reduced by applying decorrelation and gaussian smoothing filters respectively landerer swenson 2012 although decorrelation and gaussian smoothing filters can successfully eliminate correlation errors they also remove real geophysical signals from north south strip data with analog errors to compensate for this this study used a set of global gain factors limited to continental hydrological applications to restore the amplitude of the signal removed during the filtering process in order to evaluate the error value of the global gain factors the estimated measurement and leakage errors of each grace grid were obtained from the jpl s tellus website to estimate the errors associated with the tws time series of each basin the error covariance was considered as the errors of nearby pixels the total monthly error in tws for each basin during the study period table 5 was calculated using eq 2 banerjee et al 2020 2 σ total σ measurement 2 σ leakage 2 the average of different grace products is beneficial for reducing the noise of the gravity field sakumura et al 2014 in this study the weighted average values of the equivalent water thickness changes of the csr gfz and jpl based on the generalized tch method were used as the twsa monitored by grace xu et al 2020a according to the error propagation law the standard deviation calculated by the variance covariance matrix of the error on the time series of the three grace products and weight matrix is used to represent the uncertainty of the twsa in each basin table 5 as shown in eq 3 3 s d wr w t w is the weight matrix of the three grace products r is variance covariance matrix of the error calculated by the generalized tch method in addition differences in the driving data and attributes between different global models will also bring uncertainty to the retrieval of gwsa for example noah only has three attributes soil moisture content snow water equivalent and canopy water storage however wghm and pcr globwb also simulate surface water industrial water use and other anthropogenic water use in the arid inland region or in some special years the gwsa reconstructed by grace with the three models were in good agreement however in regions with many rivers dense surface water networks and dominant anthropogenic water use the gwsa reconstructed by grace with the three models will be significantly different 4 conclusions this study used grace level 3 rl06 land water equivalent thickness surface mass anomaly datasets from the csr gfz and jpl in combination with three global models gldas noah wghm and pcr globwb to retrieve the spatial and temporal gws changes over 10 major basins in china from april 2002 to december 2016 through a unified method the results showed that gws changes in the srb lrb hrb yrb hhrb and seb exhibited decreasing trends in contrast gws changes in the yzrb and prb presented increasing trends while those in the swb and cb both increased and decreased these results are basically consistent with those of previous studies by extensive comparative validation with them differences in some basins are due to different versions of grace satellite data global models specific calculation methods for groundwater size of study area and study periods the causes of gws changes in different basins were analyzed in terms of natural factors and human factors based on precipitation evapotranspiration and other data it was found that decreasing trends in gws were mainly associated with an insufficient groundwater supply due to low precipitation and high evapotranspiration decreasing trends were also related to groundwater exploitation for irrigation in the five northern basins srb lrb hrb yrb and hhrb the declining trend of gws in the seb was primarily due to water use for production water groundwater recharge from precipitation was the main factor influencing the increasing trends of gws in the yzrb and prb during the study period in addition permeation in the upper yzrb also contributed to the increasing trend of gws in the yzrb the underground rivers in the karst area of the prb facilitated the loss of groundwater and slowed the increase of gws in the prb the factors influencing the gws changes in the swb and cb were more complex because these are wide geographical areas for the swb the increasing trend in gws in yunnan was largely due to increased recharge from precipitation and a reduced groundwater loss in low karst areas the decreasing trend in gws on the southern tibetan plateau was considered to be related to groundwater overexploitation and insufficient groundwater recharge for the cb increasing precipitation glacier meltwater and snowmelt caused by global warming were the main reasons for the increasing trends of gws on the northern tibetan plateau and in the qaidam basin the declining trends of gws in the area to the northwest of xinjiang and in northern inner mongolia were primarily due to the expansion of agricultural land and extensive irrigation this study not only enriches the research on gws variation in the traditional study regions of china but also supplements the gws changes over the past decade in southeast basin pearl river basin and continental basin which are not covered by the previous studies and with rare gws information the results were verified to be accurate and reliable by local scale validation and comparison with a large number of previous gws change studies in different basins the reliable gws information could provide reference for the policy planning of groundwater resource management and economic development in different regions credit authorship
