12040,the bhuj sandstone a lithostratigraphic unit of late mesozoic early cretaceous age forms a prolific aquifer system in the kachchh region of gujarat state known for acute water shortage and groundwater dependence the region forms a part of the great arid zone of western india marked with low rainfall annual average 376 mm which is erratic in space and time the present research for the first time has dealt on the groundwater regime and aquifer configuration of the bhuj sandstone also referred as bhuj aquifer a detailed inventory of water levels in post monsoon 2018 and its comparison with 2014 reveals an average fall of 20 62 m during the period the area is experiencing intensive groundwater mining between 2014 and 2018 the net volume of groundwater mined annually is 955 mcm considering 104 mcm as annual recharge in 2018 the total groundwater extraction comes out as 1059 mcm which is more than 10 times of the annual recharge to tackle such a dismal scenario a host of interventions are urgently needed which are mentioned in the paper graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquifer kachchh india overexploitation water level decline groundwater resource 1 introduction india is critically groundwater dependent country so far as irrigation and drinking water security are concerned vijay shankar et al 2011 presently groundwater contributes about 62 irrigation demand of the country besides catering to 85 of rural water need and more than 50 of urban water consumption saha et al 2018 as the population increases the annual per capita water availability in india has gone down considerably from 5177 m3 in 1951 to a likely availability of 1140 m3 in 2051 mowr 2015 as per the latest estimate carried out by a joint effort of central and state governments annual groundwater extraction of india is staggering 253 109 m3 which is highest as a country in the world saha and ray 2018 irrigation sector is the main consumer of groundwater consuming about 90 of annual extraction the irrigation in india is hugely dependent on groundwater with about 25 million wells working for the sector saha et al 2019 kulkarni et al 2015 in large swaths of the country unplanned and unsustainable groundwater exploitation is creating an adverse impact on the aquifer systems overexploitation of groundwater resource is the most high pitched issue in water sector of india saha et al 2019 as per the latest assessment of replenishable groundwater resources recharged every year out of 6548 assessment units about 20 are either already overexploited or on the brink of overexploitation cgwb 2017a these areas also suffer from long term water level decline drying up of shallow wells and diminishing well yield the hot spots of overexploitation are located in northwestern india underlain by thick fluvial aquifer systems belonging to the indo gangetic plain the areas severely affected are located in intensely irrigated states of punjab and haryana where about 65 of the assessment units are overexploited multiple studies have taken place on overexploitation of these two states and also the adjoining states of rajasthan gujarat and western uttar pradesh mukherjee et al 2015 rodell et al 2009 gleeson et al 2016 has categorised the upper ganga upper indus basin as one of the most depleted aquifer systems in the world the overexploitation of groundwater resource has spread in the hard rock aquifers of peninsular india also invading the states of karnataka tamil nadu telangana and maharashtra saha et al 2019 groundwater stresses are also reported from arid areas of india which suffer both from scanty rainfall resulting in inadequate recharge and saline aquifers limiting the fresh water resources about 12 of the geographical area of the country is marked as arid agro ecosystem government of india 2016 the largest chunk of arid zone covers about 286000 km2 spread over the states of rajasthan and gujarat also covering parts of adjoining haryana and punjab the average annual rainfall ranges from 100 to 400 mm national average 1426 mm and that is highly erratic and unpredictable in space and time government of india 2016 the hydrogeology is complex because of a wide variation in geological formation and tectonic history of the area the average stage of groundwater development or sod sod gross groundwater draft for all uses net groundwater availability x 100 is 121 55 of the assessment units in arid areas are overexploited where the sod reaches up to 451 government of india 2016 the kachchh area of gujarat where the present research is located falls in the southwestern part of the arid zone the geological formations represent a wide variety of sedimentary and igneous suite of rocks ranging in age from pre cambrian to recent the central part of the kachchh region is marked as kachchh mainland fig 1 the most interesting landform is the huge expanse of tidal flats known as the great and little rann of kachchh fig 1 the eastern part of the elevated kachchh mainland is also known as wagad uplift wu there are four isolated elevated landforms marked in the rann of kachchh pachchham uplift pu khadir uplift ku bela uplift bu and chorar uplift cu fig 1 the kachchh mainland is surrounded by rann of kachchh in the north and east and the arabian sea and the gulf of kachchh in the south and west fig 1 the kachchh region has one of the most tectonically active zones in indian subcontinent bodin and horton 2004 antolik and dreger 2003 karanth and gadhavi 2007 within the last 75 years the area has been struck twice by major earthquakes the first one was on 21st july 1956 and the second hit was on 26th january 2001 with the epicenter at about 60 km from bhuj city chandrasekhara et al 2012 the 2001 earthquake was of 7 6 intensity in richter scale and occurred when the community was preparing for india s republic day celebrations resulting in huge casualty and destruction the bhuj earthquake was the largest continental intra plate earthquake globally in more than 100 years bodin and horton 2004 mandal and hurton 2007 interestingly though the area is criss crossed with numbers of faults the rocks have not undergone high degree of metamorphism and lateral compression biswas 2016 as commonly observed in arid regions perennial water shortage is the major socio economic issue of the area the surface water resource is constrained by low rainfall while aquifers are traditionally looked as a dependable source of water keesari et al 2014 the human population is 2 24 million and the reported livestock population is 1 88 million after the 2001 earthquake the area witnessed a development spree in terms of revamping of urban areas creating transport infrastructure and mushrooming of industries two large sea ports on the gulf of kachchh located at kandla and mundra have also come up and boosted the trading and industrial activities the advent of cheap drilling technology and well assembly has pushed up aquifer exploitation in the last two decades in particular the area under agriculture shows marginal increase from 0 825 mha in 2001 02 to 0 934 mha in 2017 18 directorate of agriculture gujarat 2019 however the horticulture has increased threefold from 11 200 ha during the same period joint inspection team report gujarat 2015 ministry of agriculture and farmer welfare the thick jurassic cretaceous tertiary and quaternary sediments hold good aquifers in the kachchh mainland but often the aquifers are marred with brackish saline groundwater cgwb 2013 the major fresh groundwater reservoir of the area is the bhuj sandstone a lithostratigraphic unit of early cretaceous age this unit is exposed as an east west elongated band in the study region fig 2 as witnessed in different parts of india and particularly in the arid zone bhuj sandstone is experiencing rapid decline of water levels cgwb 2013 government of india 2016 no research or systematic study is available on the hydrogeology groundwater resource availability and utilization issues however in some reports the water levels in the borewells have gone down from 2 to 21 m below ground level bgl in 1960 to more than 100 m bgl at places in the year 2000 down to earth 2015 shah 2014 has discussed acute groundwater stress in gujarat state with a mention of the kachchh region and the socio economic benefit if artificial recharge schemes are adopted the efforts of the community based groundwater management by sensitizing and imparting basic hydrogeological sciences in parts of arid areas have been detailed by y jadeja et al 2018 keesari et al 2014 studied the extent of tds in groundwater and its possible sources in kachchh area whereas trivedi et al 2012 has studied the hydrochemistry of groundwater in coastal aquifer of kachchh district which is affected by fluoride contamination the present research for the first time studied in detail the bhuj sandstone aquifers referred to collectively as the bhuj aquifer the hydrogeological framework spatio temporal change in groundwater regime recharge to groundwater system and extraction have been investigated rapid desaturation of the aquifer has been captured which would be an eye opener as a test case on the depleting aquifers in arid regions of india and urgent need for sustainable management of groundwater resources 2 study area the kachchh region fig 1 lies between latitudes 220 44 11 and 240 41 25 and between longitudes 680 09 46 and 710 54 47 geographically bounded by pakistan and rajasthan state in the north banaskantha and patan districts of gujarat in the east and gulf of kachchh in the south and west the bhuj sandstone is exposed in the central and western part of the kachchh mainland as a 5 50 km wide east west elongated belt covering an area of 2316 km2 fig 2 the altitude of land surface generally ranges between 30 and 80 m above mean sea level msl numerous ephemeral rivers drain the area mostly debouching in gulf of kachchh some of the rivers flow northward and feed the rann of kachchh april may and june are the hottest months when the temperature shoots up to 48 c cgwb 2013 during winter november to february the temperature remains between 20 c and 8 c monsoon period june august experiences higher humidity 70 while during november to march it remains below 45 the average annual rainfall 1961 2018 of the six administrative blocks of the kachchh district which are partially or fully covered by bhuj sandstone is 371 mm spatially the mean annual rainfall varies within 10 from block to block considering the long term trend 1961 to 2018 does not indicate any significant change in rainfall 3 geology of kachchh and study area the stratigraphy of kachchh region is comprised of rocks ranging in age from pre cambrian to recent biswas 1982 the pre cambrian rocks are exposed in the uplands within the rann of kachchh in kachchh mainland the entire middle jurassic to recent sequence is sedimentary sequences excluding the deccan trap which is basic lava flows biswas 2016 fig 2 table 1 periods of non deposition were reported between the bhuj and deccan trap and again between the maniyara fort and khari nadi formations table 1 fig 3 shows the general nne ssw geological cross section of kachchh district along with fault locations further research is needed to study and assess the impacts of faults on groundwater flow in the area fig 4 depicts the subsurface lithology of the bhuj sandstone from east to west the subsurface lithology data were collected during well inventory the maximum total depth observed at both kukma and nakhtrana is 244 m bgl 3 1 bhuj sandstone the bhuj sandstone is a non marine deposit with its thickness increasing from east to west having maximum reported as 650 m biswas 1986 lithology is marked by thick current bedded soft friable feldspathic medium to coarse grained sandstone also seen are thin bands of white grey and bluish kaolinitic and sandy shale and thin hard bands of reddish brown ferruginous sandstone pebbly laterite and iron stone this formation weathered out easily forming gently undulating low lying sandy plains vast stretches of agricultural land occur on bhuj sandstone thus the outcrops are comparatively rare the lower part of this unit is characterized by occasional layers of hard iron stone and laterite bands capping the shale and fissile sandstone in its southern limits at many places it has been found from the lithological logs of the bore wells that the bhuj sandstone extends below the deccan trap or younger tertiary sediments 3 2 deccan trap this thick formation of extrusive basic rock of basaltic composition unconformably overlies the bhuj sandstone these lava flows represent an extension of the extensive terrestrial flow of plateau basalt in peninsular india krishnan 1949 it consists mainly of dark green and greenish black fine grained basalt and is exposed in the southern part of kachchh mainland and is presumably continuous below the tertiary sequence towards the gulf of kachchh fig 2 it is again exposed in the kathiawar peninsula in saurashtra the thickness of the trap is reported to be 400 500 m in south and southwest thinning to 30 m towards west northwest and northeast merh 1995 4 water supply scenario the kachchh region is considered as a remote and backward area in the state of gujarat as rainfall is scanty the area traditionally depends on groundwater resources for its societal needs the community has traditionally adopted rainwater harvesting to store monsoon rainfall and to recharge aquifers for centuries an excellent example of continual effort of 450 years in this effect is still observed in bhuj city the headquarters of the kachchh district the rulers with the support of the local population have developed an elaborate water harvesting system where three large tanks viz hamirsar umasar and desalsar were created within the settlement areas the cumulative storage capacity of these tanks located in khari river catchment is 15 million m3 mcm the tributaries of the river are interconnected through a network of canals natural courses of stream and even tunnels so that the runoff is ultimately brought into the tanks which are still the major source of recharge to the local aquifers newer artificial recharge structures are mostly in dilapidated condition and have very insignificant impact on recharge the organized water supply in the region was initiated in 1965 in bhuj city by the municipality through a system of pumping from a network of 14 dug wells 20 25 m deep and put to an interconnected pipe system and stand posts at different locations gradually as the water level went down the dug well based supply gave way to deep tube wells by 1971 72 two well fields at bhujodi and kukma 15 km from bhuj city tapping the bhuj aquifer started operation to meet the growing demands presently two depth 180 m and 14 deep tube wells depth 180 214 m are in operation in bhujodi and kukma well fields respectively water pumped from these two well fields is mixed with imported water from sardar sarovar dam located about 400 km southeast for city water supply 4 1 extraction for domestic use at present a total of 751 deep tube wells are operational in kachchh mainland for domestic use out of which 676 tube wells tap bhuj aquifer the remaining 75 wells tap the sandstone layers within the jhuran and sandhan formations the deep tube wells are generally accompanied by overhead tanks and a network of pipelines to the stand posts and household connections no authentic data is available but local interaction indicated that about 40 of the total domestic demand is catered from the sardar sarovar dam supply however for the settlements underlain by bhuj aquifer 80 of the domestic demand is catered by groundwater even for the settlements away from the bhuj aquifer water is transported for tens of kilometers from the wells for example for the kandla port city drinking water is brought from the nagalpar village cluster of 17 wells located 40 km away social unrests are being reported against export of groundwater beyond village boundary as noted during the field work in fringe areas the bhuj aquifer extends under the cover of tertiary sediments holding saline brackish water or deccan traps poor aquifer the wells pierce the overlying formations to tap the bhuj aquifer at some locations the depths of the wells are increasing over the years as the water levels are declining during 1980 to 1990 the depths of wells were in 60 80 m bgl range which has increased to 150 250 m in last five years a large number of wells are getting defunct every year because of various reasons like water level decline dwindling yield increasing salinity clogging of strainer etc out of 751 wells in operation in kachchh area about 75 wells have been replaced in 2018 about 60 of the wells are fitted with 30 horsepower hp pumps and the remaining 40 operate with 40 hp pumps the average discharge of 30 hp and 40 hp pumps are found as 400 and 700 l minute lpm respectively the pumps average running 20 h day and they pump year round the total extraction for domestic use from the bhuj aquifer by 677 wells was 153 96 mcm in 2018 4 2 irrigation extraction irrigation is the major groundwater use in the area the net cropped area in the kachchh region is 917 6 thousand ha moa 2015 of which about 19 area falls on bhuj sandstone terrain all irrigation wells are electrically operated with power provided by paschim gujarat vij company ltd the number of wells for each block have been collected which reveals that 24 799 wells tapping the bhuj aquifer are in operation in 2018 for irrigation use table 2 the depth range of the wells is 79 543 m bgl the wells are fitted with pumps of different capacities 5 75 hp based on various factors like demand of water depth of pumping water level etc average discharge of different hp pumps table 3 is worked out after a sample survey at 10 sites for each hp category the discharge is measured by running the pump and yield is measured with the help of 200 l capacity drum the volume of water extracted for irrigation in 2018 has been worked out as below 1 q n x d x pd x ph where q volume of water extracted in mcm n number of pumps in hp category d average discharge in m3 day pd pumping days in a year ph pumping hours in a day under a scheme of government of gujarat named jyotigram yojana the irrigation feeder line is kept separated and provided with electric supply of 8 h a day whereas the other feeder line is dedicated for domestic use with 24 h electricity supply the objective of the scheme is to reduce wasteful pumping and motivate the farmers for drip sprinkler irrigation based on the field survey the ph is considered as 8 h day and pd as 120 day yr the total extraction of 7 5 hp 7 5 15 hp 15 30 hp and 30 60 hp pumps have been worked out as 4 39 mcm yr 39 39 mcm yr 232 40 mcm yr and 572 09 mcm yr respectively the total extraction for irrigation for the year 2018 has come out as 841 27 mcm 5 spatiotemporal behavior of water level a field campaign was conducted during december post monsoon 2018 when 59 wells were visited to monitor water levels it has been ascertained that the wells tap bhuj sandstone a few wells apparently located on post bhuj tertiary formations or on deccan trap were also investigated and it was confirmed that the wells are drawing water from underlying bhuj sandstone the yield of the wells was also collected during field campaign water levels are measured by a chalked steel tape using hold cut method the depth of the wells varied from 120 to 410 m bgl with the water levels ranging widely from 50 48 to 148 39 m bgl average 70 03 m the level in 37 of the wells falls within 60 70 m bgl while in 27 of the wells levels are between 50 and 60 m bgl in 15 of the wells levels are deeper than 100 m bgl table 4 spatially in 2018 the water levels in the central part of the bhuj sandstone remain between 70 and 80 m bgl fig 5 deeper levels 80 100 m bgl or more are observed in the southeastern part around anjar and in the west central part south of nakhatrana shallow levels are observed in the western part of bhachau and extreme northwestern part around mundhan water level data of 34 wells for post monsoon 2014 have been collected from gujarat water resource development corporation gwrdc during the research in 2014 the levels remained between 20 and 60 m bgl in the central part of the bhuj sandstone this part has experienced a fall of 20 40 m between 2014 and 2018 in the west of nakhatrana and the western part of bhachau the fall is less generally 10 20 m during the period hydraulic heads were calculated relative to the mean sea level msl to prepare water level contour maps and deciphering groundwater flow directions during 2018 the general flow direction is from south to north fig 6 groundwater depressions are observed around anjar chandiya and east of vadva in the eastern part around bhachau anjar region the water levels have exceeded 30 m below msl during 2014 the flow was more controlled by the topography with a groundwater divide along nakhatrana anjar zone fig 7 coinciding with the topographic high only one groundwater depression was observed around bhachau where levels went below 10 m msl fig 7 the long term water level data for pre and post monsoon periods for the monitoring well at sanyra is available from gwrdc for the period 2001 2018 the water level trend analysis indicates a decline of 2 86 m yr fig 8 6 groundwater recharge and extraction rainfall is the main source of recharge the rainfall in 2018 was acutely deficient when only about 30 of the normal rainfall 1961 2018 was received to discount the deficit rainfall in 2018 average recharge from rainfall has been worked out for 2014 2018 period in the six blocks where bhuj sandstone is exposed the average annual rainfall 2014 2018 of the six stations varies from 121 0 to 556 6 mm with a mean of 353 0 mm in the annual rainfall monsoon contributes 317 mm on average directorate of agriculture 2019 15 of the monsoon rainfall is considered as infiltration factor while the recharge from scanty non monsoon rainfall is considered as nil following the methodology prescribed by groundwater estimation committee gec 2015 cgwb 2017b following the recommendations by the gec the recharge is considered as negligible for areas with slope more than 20 in the study region 2090 km2 is found with a slope less than 20 fig 2 and thus recharge worthy the volume of recharge from monsoon rainfall based is worked out as below 2 δ s ri a r where δs volume of recharge in mcm a area in m2 ri rainfall infiltration factor r monsoon rainfall in m the annual volume of monsoon recharge during 2014 18 period is worked out as 99 37 mcm the mean monsoon rainfall considering six blocks varies from 500 94 mm in 2015 to 108 9 mm in 2018 considering that 15 of this will contribute to recharge as groundwater the quantum of recharge from monsoon in different years in the period 2014 18 varies within 15 96 the other source of recharge in the area is return seepage from irrigation major part of the area is under drip sprinkler irrigation which does not contribute to return seepage the 2011 irrigation census data reveals that for the six blockswhere bhuj sandstone is exposed table 2 the tanks and canals irrigate 424 69 km2 and wells irrigate 839 39 km2 the surface water based irrigation has stagnated during last decade because the farmers prefer groundwater based irrigation based on the field visits and interaction with the farmers 1 area increase per annum has been considered for groundwater based irrigation which results in 906 54 km2 irrigated by wells in 2018 as the groundwater potential is good the bhuj aquifer areas are not generally covered by canals and tanks 85 of the irrigated area in the six blocks 770 56 km2 is found to be covered by wells tapping bhuj sandstone and the remaining 15 area draws groundwater from jhuran deccan trap and sandhan formations out of this 770 56 km2 about 55 of the area is under flood irrigation whereas remaining 45 is covered by drip sprinkler irrigation based on deep water levels and low crop water requirement of the area 20 cm the return seepage factor is taken as 5 for flood irrigated area cgwb 2017b no return seepage is considered for drip sprinkler irrigated areas the volume of return seepage from irrigation is worked out as 4 24 mcm taking the total recharge in 2018 as 103 61 mcm by comparison in 2018 the extraction is found to be 995 23 mcm domestic 153 96 mcm irrigation 841 27 mcm besides there is substantial use of groundwater for industries for which no data is available 7 discussion of results substantial groundwater mining is taking place from the bhuj aquifer causing irreparable damage to the groundwater system average water level of bhuj aquifer declined from 49 41 m bgl in 2014 to 70 03 m bgl in 2018 no recent pumping test data is available however the specific yield determined by pumping tests in wells tapping bhuj sandstone at 6 locations have been collected gwrdc 1984 the average specific yield of six locations is 8 02 which has been considered in working out groundwater extraction of the area the specific yield values collected from the six sites table 5 vary from 6 16 to 10 46 considering the variation the net groundwater mined volume has been worked out using all six specific yield values and has been found to vary within 10 07 the net groundwater mined between 2014 and 2018 works out area x sp yield x water level difference as 3820 52 mcm revealing a net loss of 955 23 mcm yr if we add 103 61 mcm as recharge during the same year the total volume of groundwater extracted is 1058 84 mcm groundwater extraction for drinking and irrigation for 2018 is worked out as 995 23 mcm the kachchh region is dotted with a large number of industries of various sizes which largely depend on groundwater in absence of any reliable data on industrial abstraction we assume that the balance of extraction 63 51 mcm is done by the industries in 2018 8 conclusions this research unveils for the first time the rapidly deteriorating groundwater situation of an important freshwater aquifer of the arid region of india because of reckless overexploitation the recharge is low because of scanty rainfall a groundwater recharge and extraction account of bhuj aquifer for 2018 indicated a recharge from rainfall as 99 39 mcm which is merely 9 4 of total extraction irrigation drinking and industrial uses about 85 of total extraction is for irrigation the government is trying to tackle the problem by promoting drip irrigation and restricting power supply through jyotigram yojana the farmers are rapidly adopting drip irrigation and 45 of the irrigated area is presently covered strict compliance of the 8 h of electricity supply is also under way even these measures are grossly inadequate for the acutely overexploited bhuj aquifer the annual recharge from rainfall constitutes 11 8 of the annual groundwater extracted only for irrigation in 2018 though several cases of land subsidence related to decline of water level are reported from different parts of the world galloway and burbey 2011 chaudhury et al 2018 no such incident is documented from the study area further research may be carried out to study this aspect solution to such a desperate situation lies in regulating the extraction of groundwater for irrigation through a combination of community awareness and government action the depth of wells is increasing and higher capacity pumps are installed in last five years there is a threefold increase in selling of 60 hp pumps to farmers and now even 75 hp pumps are being sold which are installed in deeper wells actions are needed for i prohibiting selling of higher capacity pumps ii further tightening the jyotigram yojana and restricting the pumping hours below 8 h day iii depth restriction of irrigation wells the extraction for industries should be accounted and restricted massive artificial recharge and rain water harvesting campaign is needed involving the communities a mega aquifer recharge scheme targeting the depleted bhuj aquifer should be taken up where the source water can be the flood water during excess monsoon events declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

kachchh fig 1 the eastern part of the elevated kachchh mainland is also known as wagad uplift wu there are four isolated elevated landforms marked in the rann of kachchh pachchham uplift pu khadir uplift ku bela uplift bu and chorar uplift cu fig 1 the kachchh mainland is surrounded by rann of kachchh in the north and east and the arabian sea and the gulf of kachchh in the south and west fig 1 the kachchh region has one of the most tectonically active zones in indian subcontinent bodin and horton 2004 antolik and dreger 2003 karanth and gadhavi 2007 within the last 75 years the area has been struck twice by major earthquakes the first one was on 21st july 1956 and the second hit was on 26th january 2001 with the epicenter at about 60 km from bhuj city chandrasekhara et al 2012 the 2001 earthquake was of 7 6 intensity in richter scale and occurred when the community was preparing for india s republic day celebrations resulting in huge casualty and destruction the bhuj earthquake was the largest continental intra plate earthquake globally in more than 100 years bodin and horton 2004 mandal and hurton 2007 interestingly though the area is criss crossed with numbers of faults the rocks have not undergone high degree of metamorphism and lateral compression biswas 2016 as commonly observed in arid regions perennial water shortage is the major socio economic issue of the area the surface water resource is constrained by low rainfall while aquifers are traditionally looked as a dependable source of water keesari et al 2014 the human population is 2 24 million and the reported livestock population is 1 88 million after the 2001 earthquake the area witnessed a development spree in terms of revamping of urban areas creating transport infrastructure and mushrooming of industries two large sea ports on the gulf of kachchh located at kandla and mundra have also come up and boosted the trading and industrial activities the advent of cheap drilling technology and well assembly has pushed up aquifer exploitation in the last two decades in particular the area under agriculture shows marginal increase from 0 825 mha in 2001 02 to 0 934 mha in 2017 18 directorate of agriculture gujarat 2019 however the horticulture has increased threefold from 11 200 ha during the same period joint inspection team report gujarat 2015 ministry of agriculture and farmer welfare the thick jurassic cretaceous tertiary and quaternary sediments hold good aquifers in the kachchh mainland but often the aquifers are marred with brackish saline groundwater cgwb 2013 the major fresh groundwater reservoir of the area is the bhuj sandstone a lithostratigraphic unit of early cretaceous age this unit is exposed as an east west elongated band in the study region fig 2 as witnessed in different parts of india and particularly in the arid zone bhuj sandstone is experiencing rapid decline of water levels cgwb 2013 government of india 2016 no research or systematic study is available on the hydrogeology groundwater resource availability and utilization issues however in some reports the water levels in the borewells have gone down from 2 to 21 m below ground level bgl in 1960 to more than 100 m bgl at places in the year 2000 down to earth 2015 shah 2014 has discussed acute groundwater stress in gujarat state with a mention of the kachchh region and the socio economic benefit if artificial recharge schemes are adopted the efforts of the community based groundwater management by sensitizing and imparting basic hydrogeological sciences in parts of arid areas have been detailed by y jadeja et al 2018 keesari et al 2014 studied the extent of tds in groundwater and its possible sources in kachchh area whereas trivedi et al 2012 has studied the hydrochemistry of groundwater in coastal aquifer of kachchh district which is affected by fluoride contamination the present research for the first time studied in detail the bhuj sandstone aquifers referred to collectively as the bhuj aquifer the hydrogeological framework spatio temporal change in groundwater regime recharge to groundwater system and extraction have been investigated rapid desaturation of the aquifer has been captured which would be an eye opener as a test case on the depleting aquifers in arid regions of india and urgent need for sustainable management of groundwater resources 2 study area the kachchh region fig 1 lies between latitudes 220 44 11 and 240 41 25 and between longitudes 680 09 46 and 710 54 47 geographically bounded by pakistan and rajasthan state in the north banaskantha and patan districts of gujarat in the east and gulf of kachchh in the south and west the bhuj sandstone is exposed in the central and western part of the kachchh mainland as a 5 50 km wide east west elongated belt covering an area of 2316 km2 fig 2 the altitude of land surface generally ranges between 30 and 80 m above mean sea level msl numerous ephemeral rivers drain the area mostly debouching in gulf of kachchh some of the rivers flow northward and feed the rann of kachchh april may and june are the hottest months when the temperature shoots up to 48 c cgwb 2013 during winter november to february the temperature remains between 20 c and 8 c monsoon period june august experiences higher humidity 70 while during november to march it remains below 45 the average annual rainfall 1961 2018 of the six administrative blocks of the kachchh district which are partially or fully covered by bhuj sandstone is 371 mm spatially the mean annual rainfall varies within 10 from block to block considering the long term trend 1961 to 2018 does not indicate any significant change in rainfall 3 geology of kachchh and study area the stratigraphy of kachchh region is comprised of rocks ranging in age from pre cambrian to recent biswas 1982 the pre cambrian rocks are exposed in the uplands within the rann of kachchh in kachchh mainland the entire middle jurassic to recent sequence is sedimentary sequences excluding the deccan trap which is basic lava flows biswas 2016 fig 2 table 1 periods of non deposition were reported between the bhuj and deccan trap and again between the maniyara fort and khari nadi formations table 1 fig 3 shows the general nne ssw geological cross section of kachchh district along with fault locations further research is needed to study and assess the impacts of faults on groundwater flow in the area fig 4 depicts the subsurface lithology of the bhuj sandstone from east to west the subsurface lithology data were collected during well inventory the maximum total depth observed at both kukma and nakhtrana is 244 m bgl 3 1 bhuj sandstone the bhuj sandstone is a non marine deposit with its thickness increasing from east to west having maximum reported as 650 m biswas 1986 lithology is marked by thick current bedded soft friable feldspathic medium to coarse grained sandstone also seen are thin bands of white grey and bluish kaolinitic and sandy shale and thin hard bands of reddish brown ferruginous sandstone pebbly laterite and iron stone this formation weathered out easily forming gently undulating low lying sandy plains vast stretches of agricultural land occur on bhuj sandstone thus the outcrops are comparatively rare the lower part of this unit is characterized by occasional layers of hard iron stone and laterite bands capping the shale and fissile sandstone in its southern limits at many places it has been found from the lithological logs of the bore wells that the bhuj sandstone extends below the deccan trap or younger tertiary sediments 3 2 deccan trap this thick formation of extrusive basic rock of basaltic composition unconformably overlies the bhuj sandstone these lava flows represent an extension of the extensive terrestrial flow of plateau basalt in peninsular india krishnan 1949 it consists mainly of dark green and greenish black fine grained basalt and is exposed in the southern part of kachchh mainland and is presumably continuous below the tertiary sequence towards the gulf of kachchh fig 2 it is again exposed in the kathiawar peninsula in saurashtra the thickness of the trap is reported to be 400 500 m in south and southwest thinning to 30 m towards west northwest and northeast merh 1995 4 water supply scenario the kachchh region is considered as a remote and backward area in the state of gujarat as rainfall is scanty the area traditionally depends on groundwater resources for its societal needs the community has traditionally adopted rainwater harvesting to store monsoon rainfall and to recharge aquifers for centuries an excellent example of continual effort of 450 years in this effect is still observed in bhuj city the headquarters of the kachchh district the rulers with the support of the local population have developed an elaborate water harvesting system where three large tanks viz hamirsar umasar and desalsar were created within the settlement areas the cumulative storage capacity of these tanks located in khari river catchment is 15 million m3 mcm the tributaries of the river are interconnected through a network of canals natural courses of stream and even tunnels so that the runoff is ultimately brought into the tanks which are still the major source of recharge to the local aquifers newer artificial recharge structures are mostly in dilapidated condition and have very insignificant impact on recharge the organized water supply in the region was initiated in 1965 in bhuj city by the municipality through a system of pumping from a network of 14 dug wells 20 25 m deep and put to an interconnected pipe system and stand posts at different locations gradually as the water level went down the dug well based supply gave way to deep tube wells by 1971 72 two well fields at bhujodi and kukma 15 km from bhuj city tapping the bhuj aquifer started operation to meet the growing demands presently two depth 180 m and 14 deep tube wells depth 180 214 m are in operation in bhujodi and kukma well fields respectively water pumped from these two well fields is mixed with imported water from sardar sarovar dam located about 400 km southeast for city water supply 4 1 extraction for domestic use at present a total of 751 deep tube wells are operational in kachchh mainland for domestic use out of which 676 tube wells tap bhuj aquifer the remaining 75 wells tap the sandstone layers within the jhuran and sandhan formations the deep tube wells are generally accompanied by overhead tanks and a network of pipelines to the stand posts and household connections no authentic data is available but local interaction indicated that about 40 of the total domestic demand is catered from the sardar sarovar dam supply however for the settlements underlain by bhuj aquifer 80 of the domestic demand is catered by groundwater even for the settlements away from the bhuj aquifer water is transported for tens of kilometers from the wells for example for the kandla port city drinking water is brought from the nagalpar village cluster of 17 wells located 40 km away social unrests are being reported against export of groundwater beyond village boundary as noted during the field work in fringe areas the bhuj aquifer extends under the cover of tertiary sediments holding saline brackish water or deccan traps poor aquifer the wells pierce the overlying formations to tap the bhuj aquifer at some locations the depths of the wells are increasing over the years as the water levels are declining during 1980 to 1990 the depths of wells were in 60 80 m bgl range which has increased to 150 250 m in last five years a large number of wells are getting defunct every year because of various reasons like water level decline dwindling yield increasing salinity clogging of strainer etc out of 751 wells in operation in kachchh area about 75 wells have been replaced in 2018 about 60 of the wells are fitted with 30 horsepower hp pumps and the remaining 40 operate with 40 hp pumps the average discharge of 30 hp and 40 hp pumps are found as 400 and 700 l minute lpm respectively the pumps average running 20 h day and they pump year round the total extraction for domestic use from the bhuj aquifer by 677 wells was 153 96 mcm in 2018 4 2 irrigation extraction irrigation is the major groundwater use in the area the net cropped area in the kachchh region is 917 6 thousand ha moa 2015 of which about 19 area falls on bhuj sandstone terrain all irrigation wells are electrically operated with power provided by paschim gujarat vij company ltd the number of wells for each block have been collected which reveals that 24 799 wells tapping the bhuj aquifer are in operation in 2018 for irrigation use table 2 the depth range of the wells is 79 543 m bgl the wells are fitted with pumps of different capacities 5 75 hp based on various factors like demand of water depth of pumping water level etc average discharge of different hp pumps table 3 is worked out after a sample survey at 10 sites for each hp category the discharge is measured by running the pump and yield is measured with the help of 200 l capacity drum the volume of water extracted for irrigation in 2018 has been worked out as below 1 q n x d x pd x ph where q volume of water extracted in mcm n number of pumps in hp category d average discharge in m3 day pd pumping days in a year ph pumping hours in a day under a scheme of government of gujarat named jyotigram yojana the irrigation feeder line is kept separated and provided with electric supply of 8 h a day whereas the other feeder line is dedicated for domestic use with 24 h electricity supply the objective of the scheme is to reduce wasteful pumping and motivate the farmers for drip sprinkler irrigation based on the field survey the ph is considered as 8 h day and pd as 120 day yr the total extraction of 7 5 hp 7 5 15 hp 15 30 hp and 30 60 hp pumps have been worked out as 4 39 mcm yr 39 39 mcm yr 232 40 mcm yr and 572 09 mcm yr respectively the total extraction for irrigation for the year 2018 has come out as 841 27 mcm 5 spatiotemporal behavior of water level a field campaign was conducted during december post monsoon 2018 when 59 wells were visited to monitor water levels it has been ascertained that the wells tap bhuj sandstone a few wells apparently located on post bhuj tertiary formations or on deccan trap were also investigated and it was confirmed that the wells are drawing water from underlying bhuj sandstone the yield of the wells was also collected during field campaign water levels are measured by a chalked steel tape using hold cut method the depth of the wells varied from 120 to 410 m bgl with the water levels ranging widely from 50 48 to 148 39 m bgl average 70 03 m the level in 37 of the wells falls within 60 70 m bgl while in 27 of the wells levels are between 50 and 60 m bgl in 15 of the wells levels are deeper than 100 m bgl table 4 spatially in 2018 the water levels in the central part of the bhuj sandstone remain between 70 and 80 m bgl fig 5 deeper levels 80 100 m bgl or more are observed in the southeastern part around anjar and in the west central part south of nakhatrana shallow levels are observed in the western part of bhachau and extreme northwestern part around mundhan water level data of 34 wells for post monsoon 2014 have been collected from gujarat water resource development corporation gwrdc during the research in 2014 the levels remained between 20 and 60 m bgl in the central part of the bhuj sandstone this part has experienced a fall of 20 40 m between 2014 and 2018 in the west of nakhatrana and the western part of bhachau the fall is less generally 10 20 m during the period hydraulic heads were calculated relative to the mean sea level msl to prepare water level contour maps and deciphering groundwater flow directions during 2018 the general flow direction is from south to north fig 6 groundwater depressions are observed around anjar chandiya and east of vadva in the eastern part around bhachau anjar region the water levels have exceeded 30 m below msl during 2014 the flow was more controlled by the topography with a groundwater divide along nakhatrana anjar zone fig 7 coinciding with the topographic high only one groundwater depression was observed around bhachau where levels went below 10 m msl fig 7 the long term water level data for pre and post monsoon periods for the monitoring well at sanyra is available from gwrdc for the period 2001 2018 the water level trend analysis indicates a decline of 2 86 m yr fig 8 6 groundwater recharge and extraction rainfall is the main source of recharge the rainfall in 2018 was acutely deficient when only about 30 of the normal rainfall 1961 2018 was received to discount the deficit rainfall in 2018 average recharge from rainfall has been worked out for 2014 2018 period in the six blocks where bhuj sandstone is exposed the average annual rainfall 2014 2018 of the six stations varies from 121 0 to 556 6 mm with a mean of 353 0 mm in the annual rainfall monsoon contributes 317 mm on average directorate of agriculture 2019 15 of the monsoon rainfall is considered as infiltration factor while the recharge from scanty non monsoon rainfall is considered as nil following the methodology prescribed by groundwater estimation committee gec 2015 cgwb 2017b following the recommendations by the gec the recharge is considered as negligible for areas with slope more than 20 in the study region 2090 km2 is found with a slope less than 20 fig 2 and thus recharge worthy the volume of recharge from monsoon rainfall based is worked out as below 2 δ s ri a r where δs volume of recharge in mcm a area in m2 ri rainfall infiltration factor r monsoon rainfall in m the annual volume of monsoon recharge during 2014 18 period is worked out as 99 37 mcm the mean monsoon rainfall considering six blocks varies from 500 94 mm in 2015 to 108 9 mm in 2018 considering that 15 of this will contribute to recharge as groundwater the quantum of recharge from monsoon in different years in the period 2014 18 varies within 15 96 the other source of recharge in the area is return seepage from irrigation major part of the area is under drip sprinkler irrigation which does not contribute to return seepage the 2011 irrigation census data reveals that for the six blockswhere bhuj sandstone is exposed table 2 the tanks and canals irrigate 424 69 km2 and wells irrigate 839 39 km2 the surface water based irrigation has stagnated during last decade because the farmers prefer groundwater based irrigation based on the field visits and interaction with the farmers 1 area increase per annum has been considered for groundwater based irrigation which results in 906 54 km2 irrigated by wells in 2018 as the groundwater potential is good the bhuj aquifer areas are not generally covered by canals and tanks 85 of the irrigated area in the six blocks 770 56 km2 is found to be covered by wells tapping bhuj sandstone and the remaining 15 area draws groundwater from jhuran deccan trap and sandhan formations out of this 770 56 km2 about 55 of the area is under flood irrigation whereas remaining 45 is covered by drip sprinkler irrigation based on deep water levels and low crop water requirement of the area 20 cm the return seepage factor is taken as 5 for flood irrigated area cgwb 2017b no return seepage is considered for drip sprinkler irrigated areas the volume of return seepage from irrigation is worked out as 4 24 mcm taking the total recharge in 2018 as 103 61 mcm by comparison in 2018 the extraction is found to be 995 23 mcm domestic 153 96 mcm irrigation 841 27 mcm besides there is substantial use of groundwater for industries for which no data is available 7 discussion of results substantial groundwater mining is taking place from the bhuj aquifer causing irreparable damage to the groundwater system average water level of bhuj aquifer declined from 49 41 m bgl in 2014 to 70 03 m bgl in 2018 no recent pumping test data is available however the specific yield determined by pumping tests in wells tapping bhuj sandstone at 6 locations have been collected gwrdc 1984 the average specific yield of six locations is 8 02 which has been considered in working out groundwater extraction of the area the specific yield values collected from the six sites table 5 vary from 6 16 to 10 46 considering the variation the net groundwater mined volume has been worked out using all six specific yield values and has been found to vary within 10 07 the net groundwater mined between 2014 and 2018 works out area x sp yield x water level difference as 3820 52 mcm revealing a net loss of 955 23 mcm yr if we add 103 61 mcm as recharge during the same year the total volume of groundwater extracted is 1058 84 mcm groundwater extraction for drinking and irrigation for 2018 is worked out as 995 23 mcm the kachchh region is dotted with a large number of industries of various sizes which largely depend on groundwater in absence of any reliable data on industrial abstraction we assume that the balance of extraction 63 51 mcm is done by the industries in 2018 8 conclusions this research unveils for the first time the rapidly deteriorating groundwater situation of an important freshwater aquifer of the arid region of india because of reckless overexploitation the recharge is low because of scanty rainfall a groundwater recharge and extraction account of bhuj aquifer for 2018 indicated a recharge from rainfall as 99 39 mcm which is merely 9 4 of total extraction irrigation drinking and industrial uses about 85 of total extraction is for irrigation the government is trying to tackle the problem by promoting drip irrigation and restricting power supply through jyotigram yojana the farmers are rapidly adopting drip irrigation and 45 of the irrigated area is presently covered strict compliance of the 8 h of electricity supply is also under way even these measures are grossly inadequate for the acutely overexploited bhuj aquifer the annual recharge from rainfall constitutes 11 8 of the annual groundwater extracted only for irrigation in 2018 though several cases of land subsidence related to decline of water level are reported from different parts of the world galloway and burbey 2011 chaudhury et al 2018 no such incident is documented from the study area further research may be carried out to study this aspect solution to such a desperate situation lies in regulating the extraction of groundwater for irrigation through a combination of community awareness and government action the depth of wells is increasing and higher capacity pumps are installed in last five years there is a threefold increase in selling of 60 hp pumps to farmers and now even 75 hp pumps are being sold which are installed in deeper wells actions are needed for i prohibiting selling of higher capacity pumps ii further tightening the jyotigram yojana and restricting the pumping hours below 8 h day iii depth restriction of irrigation wells the extraction for industries should be accounted and restricted massive artificial recharge and rain water harvesting campaign is needed involving the communities a mega aquifer recharge scheme targeting the depleted bhuj aquifer should be taken up where the source water can be the flood water during excess monsoon events declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

12041,ground water is an important source of water to any economy however ground water can be vulnerable to a series of factors and activities both on and within the surface of the earth this study explored the vulnerability of the groundwater to pollution in the ga sengonyana municipality area of the northern cape province the study adopted an exploratory research design that includes both quantitative and qualitative research approaches the groundwater vulnerability assessment conducted using the drastic index revealed a drastic score of 140 implying that there is moderate to high vulnerability of aquifers in the ga sengonyana district municipality both natural and anthropegenic factors contribute to ground water pollution in the study area the unconsolidated material of sand embedded dolomite and limestone that forms the vadose zone unsaturated zone and aquifer media contributed to high vulnerability of underground water to pollutants the aquifer in the municipality area is highly vulnerable to both point and diffuse source of pollutants emanating from different land use systems it is therefore necessary for disaster management agencies and local municipality authorities to plan carefully on different land uses and eliminate activities that provides the source of pollutants such as pit latrines and sewage leakages keywords groundwater vulnerability pollution drastic index 1 introduction groundwater is a vital water source because about two billion people depend directly upon aquifers for drinking water and 40 of the world s food is produced by irrigated agriculture that relies largely on groundwater thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 as a result of extensive increases in urbanization climate change and industrialization groundwater contamination has been termed a widespread problem wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 as posited by causapé et al 2006 yu et al 2010 and supported by wang et al 2012 irreversible process of groundwater contamination may limit effort in improving groundwater condition due to the high cost and time requirement the nature of the aquifer influences the susceptibility to contamination problem morris et al 2003 a widespread contamination occurs when a fractured aquifer allows easier water infiltration at a relatively rapid rate the soil thickness and extent of strata consolidation coupled with the nature of fracture and rock types influence the aquifer s vulnerability in relation to pathogens morris et al 2003 therefore the groundwater in a mature karst aquifer system or a shallow sand and gravel alluvial aquifer is highly vulnerable to contamination mostaza colado et al 2018 some areas are more vulnerable to contamination by pollutants as compared to others with the groundwater being the main source of water in ga sengonyana municipal area there is a concern associated with its vulnerability for instance the groundwater aquifers are composed of dolomite rocks that are prone to fractures and caves and may provide a destructive pathway for contaminants dochartaigh et al 2005 pit latrines and sewage leakages are commonplace in the area water related problems that could eventually result to biological disasters is imminent in the future if appropriate measures are not taken immediately although many aquifers possess natural capacity of attenuation of microbial contaminants of pollutant nature this capacity should be capitalised to mitigate adverse effects to groundwater morris et al 2003 some pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli pseudomonas and vibrio cholerae may persist in groundwater sources momba and theoren 2006 outbreaks of water borne diseases such as cholera and gastroenteritis reported from 2000 in south african provinces of kwazulu natal eastern cape and mpumalanga could be linked to drinking groundwater contamination department of national health and population development 2001 department of health 2005 empirical studies have shown that viruses move from the subsurface through the unsaturated zone to the saturated zone to contaminate aquifers schijven 2001 xiao et al 2018 clague et al 2019 this study sought to find ways to preserve groundwater in the region land use is a problem that necessitates continuous thorough evaluation of groundwater vulnerability in some villages in the study area substandard environment and sanitation facilities such as pit latrines which have high risk levels of polluting groundwater are used therefore the need for this study to investigate the exposure of the community to polluted groundwater hazard this will lead to reduced reported cases of contaminated groundwater health related problems the aquifer characteristics also have the propensity to change over time rendering it susceptible to pollution it is against this background that close monitoring is necessary especially given that hydrogeo chemical evolution of groundwater is a dynamic process which constantly changes tiwari et al 2009 the main objective of the study is to evaluate vulnerability properties of the aquifer to pollution in ga sengonyana municipality s local urban area of kuruman and villages farming areas this study is just a step to look for solutions to ground water vulnerability to pollutants in the area 2 groundwater vulnerability assessment the recognition by scientists that some areas are more likely to become contaminated than others has led to terminology and practice of groundwater vulnerability to contamination while in some areas groundwater is more vulnerable to contamination than others are it follows that all groundwater is vulnerable groundwater vulnerability refers to the relative easiness with which a contaminant applied on or near the land surface can migrate to the aquifer of interest under a given set of its exposure characteristics and hydrogeological sensitivity conditions ashton et al 2001 department of water affairs 2015 the quality of groundwater is influenced partially by weathering products length of residence time depth of the water aquifer landscape that in turn is highly vulnerable to anthropogenic activities through land use david et al 2009 srivastava et al 2012 in the same vein the factor that influences the quality of water also has impact on its vulnerability vulnerability to contamination of groundwater depends on many factors including the following depth of water table composition of soils and geologic materials in unsaturated zone environmental management influencing biodegradation and the recharge rate the national academies of sciences engineering medicine 1993 2 1 contaminant pathways vulnerability assessment only considers the contaminant that percolates downwards to the water table contaminants can enter the aquifer by many channels as illustrated in fig 1 it is not only through percolation from the ground surface that contaminants reach the water table there are other means that can be aggressive pathways of contaminants dochartaigh et al 2005 these can be in the form of solution channels in the vadose zone cracks bio channels root holes and wormholes and joints in some cases cross contamination may occur between the two aquifers where a shallow contaminated aquifer is connected to a deeper aquifer via existing or improperly sealed or abandoned wells dochartaigh et al 2005 in some vulnerability approaches overlay information on potential cross contamination of deeper aquifers by shallow aquifers is depicted on traditional maps the discharge of water from groundwater by human use of boreholes may result in changing the flow regime of groundwater while most vulnerability to contamination is treated as static pumpage induced movement of water from a shallow aquifer to deeper aquifer may be a significant consideration in some cases umar and ahmed 2009 2 2 groundwater vulnerability assessment methods according to al zabet 2002 groundwater vulnerability assessment can be classified into two broad categories as specific vulnerability and intrinsic vulnerability assessments while specific vulnerability is referenced to a specific contaminant intrinsic vulnerability refers to vulnerability determined without referring to a specific contaminant three major methods of vulnerability assessment used are overlay and index method that gives a score on combining specific physical vulnerability characteristics process based methods using mathematical models that predict substance behaviour in subsurface environment statistical methods drawing associations from the source of contamination national research council 1993 the summary of methods in each classification is shown in table 1 below 2 3 weighted index overlay methods following aller and bannet 1987 drastic method and modification was used such as modified drastic land pattern umar and ahmed 2009 and modified drastic klug 2009 started the technique of groundwater vulnerability assessment modified drastic methods include the parameters that were not considered before modified drastic by klug 2009 incorporates local hydrological settings and gis to create a visual tool representing the risk areas the modified drastic land pattern model sometimes referred to as drastica adds another factor a called impact of anthropogenic activities anjali et al 2015 it is used to assess vulnerability in urbanised areas where anthropogenic activities alter the ecology and play a major role in groundwater contamination the anthropogenic activities factor has recently become important to consider in groundwater vulnerability assessment with increase of urbanisation in developing countries the method is well recognised and widely used as a modeling process in assessing aquifer vulnerability armengol et al 2014 variables commonly used in this method include water table depth groundwater recharge rate and unsaturated and aquifer properties e g geology and soil klug 2009 the overlay and index methods are mainly driven by available data with less emphasis on processes controlling the groundwater contamination common variables used in the overlay and index method and an example of drastic carried out in iowa region of united states is shown in table 2 drastic method tries to be universally applicable by incorporating parameters available virtually anywhere the overlay and index method can obtain the information from available soil maps topographic maps geological maps and local land use planning maps foster and hirata 1988 rahman 2008 2 3 1 land use land cover lulc specific land use land cover lulc types such as urban agriculture and urban sprawl are linked to human activities and their physical characteristics affect water quality mukherjee et al 2009 high rate of urbanisation agricultural water demand coupled with demand for domestic water use from groundwater has major influence on changing recharge rates poor management of land use is linked to deteriorating water quality through making available point source hazardous chemicals and acceleration of flow into the saturated zone in lucl agricultural activities are marked as major non point source of groundwater pollution followed by industrial and residential area respectively basnyat et al 2000 poor agriculture activities contribute to high leaching of nitrates and heavy metals on cleared land for agriculture and salt accumulation in irrigated areas in this research vulnerability of aquifers and land use activities leading to groundwater pollution in ga sengonyana municipality area is investigated 2 3 2 depth of groundwater the depth to groundwater affects its vulnerability short distance is more vulnerable than longer distance as the contaminants travel in less time in the former in deep water tables there is transit time for biodegradation and physical degradation of contaminants as compared to shallow water tables with lesser time for decontamination before percolating water reaches underground saturation zone epa 1992 the drawback of the overlay and index method is the use of a single depth of groundwater yet fluctuations of water tables are common with seasons the deep and less active aquifers have generally low levels of mineralisation than shallow active aquifers that have higher levels of mineralisation pietersen 2004 besides the effect of depth of water aquifers land use activities affect groundwater resources through changes in recharge and influences pollutants reaching the saturated zone 2 3 3 recharge and discharge of groundwater recharge of the ground water varies in time in both seasonal and annual periods and over a region estimates of the recharge rate values account for inputs in the form of average monthly or annual rainfall wastewater irrigation artificial recharge and losses of water in form of evapo transpiration and runoff hoyer and hallgerg 1991 rahman 2008 the locating of recharge and discharge zones in an area helps to predict the movement of contaminants to the groundwater zone the prediction of recharge and discharge can be complicated where groundwater flow systems occur at different scales although the prediction of recharge and discharge may be difficult in itself this variable is more important in groundwater assessment the water basin of this area is typical kalahari basin which is an endorheic basin meaning that no natural discharge occurs except through evaporation saayman et al 2007 2 3 4 impact of vadose unsaturated and saturated zone unsaturated and aquifer properties are at times incorporated into overlay and index methods the unsaturated zone usually influences the vertical movement of contaminants towards ground water while aquifer properties have the potential to affect the lateral movement of contaminants foster and hirata 1988 shirazi et al 2012 however the aquifer material may form part of the unsaturated zone making it difficult to distinguish the two it is for this reason that the reference location of this variable may be in any part of the groundwater flow system movement of water in the aquifer is considered slower than on the land surface the flow rate means pollutants can be effectively measured in years decades or even centuries greswell 1994 unconsolidated rocks forming part of the unsaturated zone commonly contributes to intergranular and slow flow of percolation water while unconsolidated aquifers may have slow water movement consolidated aquifers are typically fractured thereby increasing the speed of water flow keesstra et al 2012 3 study area ga sengonyana local municipality s area covers 4 495 km2 and has about 104 408 residents in kuruman town its surrounding villages and the farming area statistics south africa 2011 according to rutherford 1996 the vegetation of the area is kalahari thorn veld in which trees such as acacia erioloba and acacia mellifera are common underlying the area are 190 million year old volcanic dolomite dykes that thrust up forming dissolution channels in fractures therefore allowing direct recharge and groundwater flow pavelic et al 2012 this is evidenced by the common eyes water springs in the area which serve as a tourist attraction the aquifers are composed of dolomite with an average water level depth of 30m saayman et al 2007 concretised sediments classified as the kalahari group cover kuruman area it comprises of unlithified sand which unconformably overlies calcified sand and gravel thomas and shaw 1991 municipal and private boreholes are common in the urban area villages and surrounding farms 4 methodology 4 1 data sources and collection technique primary data was collected through in depth interviews with prelisted questions guiding the process twenty four 24 participants utilized were from sedibeng waters geo science and local municipality health department the sample utilized for in depth interview was purposively selected secondary data was obtained from the journals on groundwater vulnerability and from the department of water affairs dwa drastic values were collected from sedibeng technicians and council of geosciences thus past studies values of elements of drastic were used to compute groundwater vulnerability assessment 4 2 aquifer vulnerability assessments drastic vulnerability index was used in this study to evaluate the aquifer vulnerability as advised in aller and bannet 1987 the information required to compute the index was obtained from past studies on factors related to drastic index and from sedibeng water specialists and council of geoscience technicians vulnerability index is the weighted sum of ratings of the parameters under consideration the drastic index computes the factors according to the following equation d r a s t i c i n d e x d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where d r a s t i and c are seven parameters depth to water level net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and conductivity abdullahi 2009 hydraulic conductivity refers to the volume of water that passes through the unsaturated zone to the water table per unit of time the subscripts r and w are the corresponding ratings and weights respectively the rating table was used to evaluate the drastic score of the ga sengonyana municipality area following aller and bannet 1987 as shown in table 3 the rating of each drastic parameter is multiplied by the given weight of that parameter the relative weights that were used corresponded with the drastic parameters by aller and bannet 1987 as shown in table 4 the vulnerability range used was drastic index as recommended in commonly referenced literature corniello et al 1997 de regibus and civita 1995 table 5 below shows the recommended drastic ranges the final index obtained is divided into vulnerability classes of low moderate high and very high drastic index ranges from 23 to 230 with higher drastic index value indicating higher potential of groundwater pollution and aquifer vulnerability drastic index is relatively inexpensive with little requirements on field data inputs easy interpretation and usefulness in decision making abdullahi 2009 shirazi et al 2012 shares the same sentiment that the method easily computes extensive volume of data in semi arid arid regions as well as in regions with basaltic rocks 5 results and discussion 5 1 groundwater vulnerability assessment the drastic ranges for drastic index scoring were obtained from past studies of similar factors in the same area the relative weights that were used corresponded with the drastic parameters by aller and bannet 1987 as given in table 4 under methodology table 3 4 and 5 under methodology were used to estimate aquifer vulnerability using drastic index the drastic score for ga sengonyana municipality was evaluated at 140 as shown in table 6 an average depth of 30 m to the water table was obtained through measuring borehole samples the depth of other boreholes for the whole area was supplied from sedibeng waters which have the mandate to extract and supply borehole water in the municipality the average depth to the water was close to the one obtained in the research carried out by sililo and saayman 2001 net recharge estimates were obtained in sililo and saayman 2001 report to the water research commission the area has arid to semi arid characteristics with recharge rate as high as 102 178 mm per year though the area is arid and receives an average annual rainfall of 250 mm rutherford 1996 the vadose zone unsaturated zone consists of unconsolidated material of sand that allows rapid infiltration furthermore the catchment area is considered an endorheic basin in which there is no natural discharge in the basin other than evaporation saayman et al 2007 the water recharge rate is influenced by groundwater use and groundwater regimes the high urban population growth coupled by rural urban migration in kuruman town and periphery villages necessitates more groundwater extraction by authorities to serve the population as the sole source of water in the area the high groundwater extraction often changes the water regime and increases hydraulic conductivity rate of water infiltration the high demand and extraction of groundwater could have led to dolomite dissolution leading to formation of fractured channels in the aquifer fractured channels in the aquifer allow direct aquifer recharge and groundwater flow thereby increasing vulnerability sililo and tellam 2000 pavelic et al 2012 besides the high groundwater extraction rate having an effect on recharge rate clearance of the natural biomes to establish both formal and informal houses modifies the natural hydrological patterns high surface water flows often lead to drainage pathways that are directly connected to the aquifers increasing the recharge rate overgrazing commonly occurs in the veld of the district area limited vegetation reduces rainfall interception and thereby increases recharge rates the topography in terms of the slope was obtained from rutherford 1996 in the study of vegetation in southern africa the average slope of the ga sengonyana is 0 2 signifying that it is relatively flat and allows relatively higher infiltration of rainwater compared to steep slopes information on hydraulic conductivity values of the region was obtained from water research commission report saayman et al 2007 there is considerable high hydraulic conductivity due to the soil media nature of sand and gravel in vadose zone the hydraulic conductivity was ranked at 40 7 81 5 data relating to lithology and soil was obtained from sililo and saayman 2001 thomas and shaw 1991 from a report of deposition and development of kalahari group sediments in central southern africa the area is composed of calcified sand gravel limestone and shale meaning there is a high vulnerability range of aquifer media at 4 9 it is at the edge of the kalahari desert to the east and is composed mainly of soil media of kalahari sands making it very vulnerable with a rating of eight a drastic index of 140 obtained implies that the groundwater in the area ranges from moderate to high vulnerability the score agrees with the drastic score of 124 192 obtained by wilcox 1995 in sandstone aquifers however the drastic score of 140 given in this study is lower than the higher vulnerability figure of the aquifers obtained for the whole region of northern cape by hewitson et al 2005 6 conclusion and recommendations groundwater is a vital water source because about two billion people depend directly upon aquifers for drinking water and 40 of the world s food is produced by irrigated agriculture that relies largely on groundwater this study evaluated vulnerability properties of the aquifer to pollution in ga sengonyana municipality s local urban area of kuruman and villages farming areas the results of the study revealed that groundwater vulnerability assessment conducted using the drastic index revealed the drastic score of 140 implying that there is moderate to high vulnerability of aquifers in the ga sengonyana district municipality groundwater in ga sengonyana municipality area is vulnerable to pollution due to natural aquifer formation and anthropogenic factors gentle terrain allows ample time for water to sink thereby increasing the net recharge of the aquifer furthermore the soil media in unsaturated zone consisting largely of sand soils contributes to high recharge rate and renders high vulnerability of the subsurface water to pollutants the recharge rate is exacerbated by existing dissolution fractures in dolomite rocks that are evidenced by common water springs in the area the existence of the fractures in the vadose zone and aquifer media increases the aquifer s vulnerability by allowing direct aquifer recharge within a short time the catchment area is endorheic in nature no natural catchment discharge except only by evaporation rutherford 1996 this implies that naturally no pollutants can be removed from this aquifer making it highly vulnerable to pollution the high groundwater vulnerability score obtained in the studies coupled with presence of point source of human waste from pit latrines points to a high groundwater pollution risk in the municipal area the findings obtained can be projected to the regional level in areas that share similar hydro geological and land use patterns consequently this study calls for the urgent involvement of the local authority to prevent and mitigate the groundwater pollution declaration of competing interest the authors of this study declare that there exists no conflict of interest among them appendix a

12041,ground water is an important source of water to any economy however ground water can be vulnerable to a series of factors and activities both on and within the surface of the earth this study explored the vulnerability of the groundwater to pollution in the ga sengonyana municipality area of the northern cape province the study adopted an exploratory research design that includes both quantitative and qualitative research approaches the groundwater vulnerability assessment conducted using the drastic index revealed a drastic score of 140 implying that there is moderate to high vulnerability of aquifers in the ga sengonyana district municipality both natural and anthropegenic factors contribute to ground water pollution in the study area the unconsolidated material of sand embedded dolomite and limestone that forms the vadose zone unsaturated zone and aquifer media contributed to high vulnerability of underground water to pollutants the aquifer in the municipality area is highly vulnerable to both point and diffuse source of pollutants emanating from different land use systems it is therefore necessary for disaster management agencies and local municipality authorities to plan carefully on different land uses and eliminate activities that provides the source of pollutants such as pit latrines and sewage leakages keywords groundwater vulnerability pollution drastic index 1 introduction groundwater is a vital water source because about two billion people depend directly upon aquifers for drinking water and 40 of the world s food is produced by irrigated agriculture that relies largely on groundwater thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 as a result of extensive increases in urbanization climate change and industrialization groundwater contamination has been termed a widespread problem wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 as posited by causapé et al 2006 yu et al 2010 and supported by wang et al 2012 irreversible process of groundwater contamination may limit effort in improving groundwater condition due to the high cost and time requirement the nature of the aquifer influences the susceptibility to contamination problem morris et al 2003 a widespread contamination occurs when a fractured aquifer allows easier water infiltration at a relatively rapid rate the soil thickness and extent of strata consolidation coupled with the nature of fracture and rock types influence the aquifer s vulnerability in relation to pathogens morris et al 2003 therefore the groundwater in a mature karst aquifer system or a shallow sand and gravel alluvial aquifer is highly vulnerable to contamination mostaza colado et al 2018 some areas are more vulnerable to contamination by pollutants as compared to others with the groundwater being the main source of water in ga sengonyana municipal area there is a concern associated with its vulnerability for instance the groundwater aquifers are composed of dolomite rocks that are prone to fractures and caves and may provide a destructive pathway for contaminants dochartaigh et al 2005 pit latrines and sewage leakages are commonplace in the area water related problems that could eventually result to biological disasters is imminent in the future if appropriate measures are not taken immediately although many aquifers possess natural capacity of attenuation of microbial contaminants of pollutant nature this capacity should be capitalised to mitigate adverse effects to groundwater morris et al 2003 some pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli pseudomonas and vibrio cholerae may persist in groundwater sources momba and theoren 2006 outbreaks of water borne diseases such as cholera and gastroenteritis reported from 2000 in south african provinces of kwazulu natal eastern cape and mpumalanga could be linked to drinking groundwater contamination department of national health and population development 2001 department of health 2005 empirical studies have shown that viruses move from the subsurface through the unsaturated zone to the saturated zone to contaminate aquifers schijven 2001 xiao et al 2018 clague et al 2019 this study sought to find ways to preserve groundwater in the region land use is a problem that necessitates continuous thorough evaluation of groundwater vulnerability in some villages in the study area substandard environment and sanitation facilities such as pit latrines which have high risk levels of polluting groundwater are used therefore the need for this study to investigate the exposure of the community to polluted groundwater hazard this will lead to reduced reported cases of contaminated groundwater health related problems the aquifer characteristics also have the propensity to change over time rendering it susceptible to pollution it is against this background that close monitoring is necessary especially given that hydrogeo chemical evolution of groundwater is a dynamic process which constantly changes tiwari et al 2009 the main objective of the study is to evaluate vulnerability properties of the aquifer to pollution in ga sengonyana municipality s local urban area of kuruman and villages farming areas this study is just a step to look for solutions to ground water vulnerability to pollutants in the area 2 groundwater vulnerability assessment the recognition by scientists that some areas are more likely to become contaminated than others has led to terminology and practice of groundwater vulnerability to contamination while in some areas groundwater is more vulnerable to contamination than others are it follows that all groundwater is vulnerable groundwater vulnerability refers to the relative easiness with which a contaminant applied on or near the land surface can migrate to the aquifer of interest under a given set of its exposure characteristics and hydrogeological sensitivity conditions ashton et al 2001 department of water affairs 2015 the quality of groundwater is influenced partially by weathering products length of residence time depth of the water aquifer landscape that in turn is highly vulnerable to anthropogenic activities through land use david et al 2009 srivastava et al 2012 in the same vein the factor that influences the quality of water also has impact on its vulnerability vulnerability to contamination of groundwater depends on many factors including the following depth of water table composition of soils and geologic materials in unsaturated zone environmental management influencing biodegradation and the recharge rate the national academies of sciences engineering medicine 1993 2 1 contaminant pathways vulnerability assessment only considers the contaminant that percolates downwards to the water table contaminants can enter the aquifer by many channels as illustrated in fig 1 it is not only through percolation from the ground surface that contaminants reach the water table there are other means that can be aggressive pathways of contaminants dochartaigh et al 2005 these can be in the form of solution channels in the vadose zone cracks bio channels root holes and wormholes and joints in some cases cross contamination may occur between the two aquifers where a shallow contaminated aquifer is connected to a deeper aquifer via existing or improperly sealed or abandoned wells dochartaigh et al 2005 in some vulnerability approaches overlay information on potential cross contamination of deeper aquifers by shallow aquifers is depicted on traditional maps the discharge of water from groundwater by human use of boreholes may result in changing the flow regime of groundwater while most vulnerability to contamination is treated as static pumpage induced movement of water from a shallow aquifer to deeper aquifer may be a significant consideration in some cases umar and ahmed 2009 2 2 groundwater vulnerability assessment methods according to al zabet 2002 groundwater vulnerability assessment can be classified into two broad categories as specific vulnerability and intrinsic vulnerability assessments while specific vulnerability is referenced to a specific contaminant intrinsic vulnerability refers to vulnerability determined without referring to a specific contaminant three major methods of vulnerability assessment used are overlay and index method that gives a score on combining specific physical vulnerability characteristics process based methods using mathematical models that predict substance behaviour in subsurface environment statistical methods drawing associations from the source of contamination national research council 1993 the summary of methods in each classification is shown in table 1 below 2 3 weighted index overlay methods following aller and bannet 1987 drastic method and modification was used such as modified drastic land pattern umar and ahmed 2009 and modified drastic klug 2009 started the technique of groundwater vulnerability assessment modified drastic methods include the parameters that were not considered before modified drastic by klug 2009 incorporates local hydrological settings and gis to create a visual tool representing the risk areas the modified drastic land pattern model sometimes referred to as drastica adds another factor a called impact of anthropogenic activities anjali et al 2015 it is used to assess vulnerability in urbanised areas where anthropogenic activities alter the ecology and play a major role in groundwater contamination the anthropogenic activities factor has recently become important to consider in groundwater vulnerability assessment with increase of urbanisation in developing countries the method is well recognised and widely used as a modeling process in assessing aquifer vulnerability armengol et al 2014 variables commonly used in this method include water table depth groundwater recharge rate and unsaturated and aquifer properties e g geology and soil klug 2009 the overlay and index methods are mainly driven by available data with less emphasis on processes controlling the groundwater contamination common variables used in the overlay and index method and an example of drastic carried out in iowa region of united states is shown in table 2 drastic method tries to be universally applicable by incorporating parameters available virtually anywhere the overlay and index method can obtain the information from available soil maps topographic maps geological maps and local land use planning maps foster and hirata 1988 rahman 2008 2 3 1 land use land cover lulc specific land use land cover lulc types such as urban agriculture and urban sprawl are linked to human activities and their physical characteristics affect water quality mukherjee et al 2009 high rate of urbanisation agricultural water demand coupled with demand for domestic water use from groundwater has major influence on changing recharge rates poor management of land use is linked to deteriorating water quality through making available point source hazardous chemicals and acceleration of flow into the saturated zone in lucl agricultural activities are marked as major non point source of groundwater pollution followed by industrial and residential area respectively basnyat et al 2000 poor agriculture activities contribute to high leaching of nitrates and heavy metals on cleared land for agriculture and salt accumulation in irrigated areas in this research vulnerability of aquifers and land use activities leading to groundwater pollution in ga sengonyana municipality area is investigated 2 3 2 depth of groundwater the depth to groundwater affects its vulnerability short distance is more vulnerable than longer distance as the contaminants travel in less time in the former in deep water tables there is transit time for biodegradation and physical degradation of contaminants as compared to shallow water tables with lesser time for decontamination before percolating water reaches underground saturation zone epa 1992 the drawback of the overlay and index method is the use of a single depth of groundwater yet fluctuations of water tables are common with seasons the deep

12042,seawater intrusion is a major threat to the water quality in the coastal aquifers a hydrogeochemical survey was conducted in and around the point calimere wetland with an objective to delineating the impact and sources of groundwater salinization these objectives were met by a combined hydrochemical and multivariate statistical approach groundwater samples showed an alkaline nature throughout the area it was substantiated by the observed positive correlation of tds with na mg and cl and a negative correlation with hco3 ionic changes during the saline water freshwater mixing were analyzed it was detected that the mixing rate of seawater with the fresh groundwater was 31 a negative e change was observed for the samples collected near the coast as well as salt pans the sources of salinity identified through factor analysis exhibited a clear segregation between freshwater and saline water the presence of ca and so4 in the factor 2 shows the dissolution of gypsum minerals the dendrogram generated through cluster analysis classified the total groundwater samples into two groups which agrees with the results obtained from the hydrochemical and factor analysis the wells that are near the coast and salt pans which are grouped under cluster 1 have influence of saline intrusion graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater salinization ionic ratio ionic change factor analysis cluster analysis point calimere 1 introduction water is considered as one of the most important components of human life and development it is used almost in all the sectors such as agricultural industrial environmental and domestic however water resources are getting depleted because of both natural and anthropogenic activities most of the coastal aquifers are sandy aquifer with high permeability which leads to seawater intrusion higher hydrostatic pressure and low density of freshwater column play significant role in maintaining the saline fresh water balance excessive pumping of wells in and around the coastal areas may disturb this balance and results in movement of seawater into coastal aquifers possible zones of salinization their origin and associated geochemical processes in the transition zone between salt and fresh water can be explained by analyses of groundwater chemistry panteleit et al 2001 geophysical hydrochemical isotopes and statistical methods are the most common tools available in the literature for analyzing the saline intrusion senthil kumar et al 2011 reported that vertical electrical sounding ves is well suited in the investigation of alluvial aquifers with large resistivity contacts hydrochemical and isotopic methods have been applied by various researchers for study the seawater intrusion phenomena in the coastal aquifers said 2006 de montety et al 2008 eleonora carol et al 2009 julie gattacceca et al 2009 bennettsa et al 2006 sridharan and senthil nathan 2017 maurya et al 2019 geophysical and geochemical investigations were carried out to study the subsurface geologic features and seawater intrusion at central godavari delta in india this study reported the seawater contaminated zones and influence of in situ salinity in the upstream of the study area gurunadha rao et al 2011 mondal et al 2010 applied the values of groundwater major ions to determine the interaction between fresh groundwater and seawater and proved that there exists a relationship between total dissolved solids with chloride sodium magnesium and sulphate concentrations of groundwater tanvir rahman 2011 analyzed the sources of deep groundwater salinity in the southwestern zone of bangladesh the major source of dissolved ions was identified as silicate weathering wen et al 2011 studied the hydrochemical characteristics and

point calimere wetland is located in the vedaranyam block of nagapattinam district tamil nadu fig 1 this area is bounded by thalainayar in the north bay of bengal in the east muthupet block of thiruvarur district in the west and bay of bengal in the south the climate is monsoonal but is not typical of monsoonal climates due to its asymmetrical rainfall regime the main contribution to the

the northern portion of the area comes under coastal plain with inter figuring beach ridges the southern portion adjoining the bay of bengal is of muddy salt marsh called vedaranyam marsh as point calimere is the seaward apex of the cauvery river delta the soil deposits are essentially of fluvial origin besides sand dunes in most of the places pedologic horizons are inseparable still the surface zones are exhibiting more or less individualized surface the surface soil mainly consists of clayey sand with pebbles gravel or concretions with little organic matter the average depth of this

the soils are halomorphic with a muddy structure in a moistened state and a compact structure in dry state a saline efflorescence is often formed at the surface due to the capillary rise of salt mainly sodium chloride favored by the proximity to the sea and the length of the dry season the sand on the dunes is fine yellowish white and is continuously altered by aeolian erosion whenever exposed fresh water is available in beach ridge and due to high extraction they turned into saline these areas are shallow medium and deep aquifers are saline the depth of water level varies from 1 20

identifies the underlying hidden relationship between the variables by computing the matrix of correlations for the entire data set and summarizes the data set without losing much information rao et al 2006 as the first step the correlation between all the observed and analyzed water quality parameters is determined the correlation coefficient is given as 1b r x y x xm y y m x x m 2 y y m 2 ᄀ where r x y is the sum over all samples of the products of the deviations of the x measurements and the y measurements on each parameter of the sample liu et al 2003 the factors responsible for the high variance of water quality parameters are obtained through factor loading scree plot and the eigenvalues the extraction of factors was based on the variances and co variances of the variables the factors with eigenvalues greater than one has higher variance among other factors thilagavathi1 et al 2017 adhikari and mal 2019 finally by the process of rotation to make the factor structure simple the loading of each variable on one of the extracted factors is maximized and the loadings on all the other factors are minimized guo et al 2017 these factor loadings are useful in identifying the source of polluting water quality parameters the variables for factor analysis were ph ec th na k ca mg cl hco3 and so4 statistical package spss 16 was used for the analysis cluster analysis is an unsupervised pattern recognition technique that classifies the wells into homogenous groups based on the nearness or similarity of the quality of water in the wells by uncovering intrinsic structure without making a priori assumptions about the data vega et al 1998 hierarchical agglomerative ca was performed on the normalized data set by means of the ward s method using euclidean distances as a measure of similarity a dendrogram was created for the 9 sample locations based on the hydrochemical parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater chemistry the values of water quality of the sampled wells are given in table 1 the range of ph was observed between 7 7 and 8 2 with an average of 7 6 which were within the permissible limit of 6 5 8 5 who 2011 the electrical conductivity and tds of the samples in the study area is in the range of 830 μs cm to 18700 μs cm 281 11 968 mg l respectively concentration of tds was highly influenced by the salt pans as well as the seawater impact of saline water on tds has reported by sylus and ramesh 2015 from netravati basin india however samples from the salt pan showed twice the concentration of seawater collected from bay of bengal the industries located in the surrounding area were pumping the groundwater for the production of salt without any control the analysis of water samples collected from the bore well situated in the salt pan depicted the chances of paleomarine deposits of underground brine similar observations were made by larsen et al 2017 in the red river delta plain sodium was found to be the dominant cations in the study area and it is ranged between 20 and 3720 mg l the geogenic origins of na can be listed as weathering of silicate minerals evaporates dissolution of halites and also from the seawater intrusions panno et al 2002a b high na concentration near the coastal areas and salt pans indicates the saltwater intrusion calcium is one of the major constituents of groundwater showed a range of 20 110 mg l the probable origins for the calcium in the groundwater are dissolution of calcium bearing minerals such as calcite dolomite and gypsum luo et al 2018 magnesium is the eighth most abundant mineral in the earth crust the occurrence of magnesium in groundwater is mainly controlled by magnesium rich minerals like dolomite magnetite and olivine yousif and el aassar 2018 in the study area the magnesium concentration was in the range of 24 534 mg l potassium of the study area ranged from 3 to 86 mg l the possible origin is the weathering of potash feldspars a relatively less concentration of k in groundwater is mainly due to its high resistance to weathering as well as the adsorption by clay minerals alaya et al 2014 chloride is the most abundant anions in the groundwater in the present study chloride was in the range of 138 4650 mg l the principle origin of chloride can be from the saline intrusion as well as domestic sewages the high concentration of cl was observed near the coast as well as saltpans indicates the possibility of seawater intrusion comparable results were reported from la paz aquifer system mexico mahlknechta et al 2017 carbonates was absent in many samples and varied from 0 to 120 mg l bicarbonates were in the range of 30 600 mg l hco3 is a representative of natural fresh water primarily originated from carbonate rocks concentration of sulphate ranged between 12 and 490 mg l the variation of the chemical parameters of the study area is shown in a boxplot fig 2 3 2 hydrochemical facies and water types from hydrogeochemical analysis the type of water with dominating ions was represented using piper diagram after piper 1944 as shown in fig 3 most of the groundwater samples show na cl type 83 the remaining samples were plotted under ca na hco3 groundwater samples collected near the coast as well as the salt pans were mainly nacl type this suggests the significant influence of seawater intrusion ca na hco3 type of water was seen in the samples collected from the wells in the villages which are away from the sea and saltpans the study area is sandwiched between bay of bengal in the east palk strait in the south and salt pans in the west the results showed that the hydrochemistry is largely controlled by the saline intrusion from seawater as well as the salt pan water 3 3 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry a gibbs diagram after gibbs 1970 was plotted to identify the different processes influencing groundwater chemistry fig 4 shows the gibbs diagram indicate that the groundwater in point calimere is are mainly controlled by the evaporation and rock water interaction those samples collected near the sea and saltpans undergo more evaporation than those samples that are collected from the villages which are largely controlled by rock water interaction none of the samples fall under the region of precipitation 3 4 chemical correlations and ionic ratios ionic ratios of groundwater have been often used to evaluate seawater intrusion in coastal areas sánchez martos et al 2002 kim et al 2003 abdalla 2016 the correlation between all the chemical parameters were analyzed and a correlation matrix was generated see table 2 considering the importance of each of these ions in delineating seawater intrusion cross plots were made between the selected ions and tds chloride is considered to be the most common and effective tracer of saline water freshwater mixing from the cross plot between cl and tds shown in fig 5 a perfect correlation with the dissolved solids was observed almost the same ratio was exhibited by the tds vs na k plot fig 5 meanwhile a weak correlation was observed between tds and hco3 fig 5 this suggests the marginal contribution of this ion in the total ionic concentration the results of cross plot between ca and mg with tds showed a high positive correlation fig 5 in normal circumstances the magnesium ions will be dominating over calcium in the coastal aquifers this is proved by a feeble relation between tds and so4 fig 5 which is due to the deposition of ca and so4 as gypsum a highly linear relation of tds with na and cl and a weak relation with hco3 suggest the possibility of seawater intrusion nevertheless the origins of these ions have been considered in a detailed manner in the coming sections the na cl relationship often has been used an indicator for mechanisms controlling the salinity and saline intrusions in coastal regions kim et al 2003 shammas and jacks 2007 wen et al 2011 the na cl ratio of the seawater is 0 86 a value below and above 0 86 is considered as seawater intrusion and anthropogenic sources respectively sherif et al 2011 if the origin is from the seawater the relation between the na and cl must be strongly correlated as shown in fig 6 most of the values of the parameters are on or near the seawater freshwater mixing line which indicate the mixing of seawater with the freshwater few values are in the chloride zone which may be due to the cation exchange between ca and na the plot of na cl ratio with the sample location showed that majority of the samples were below the line of seawater ratio suggesting the influence of seawater fig 7 however those samples collected near the salt pans have ratio more than 1 which represents the anthropogenic inputs mg cl can be used in the identification of salinization process a ratio of mg cl above 0 5 fig 7 in all the samples indicates the seawater intrusion bo 1996 shammas and jacks 2007 the relation between ca mg and cl was drawn to assess the behavior of these ions with salinity fig 8 a linear relation between these ions with chloride suggests the reverse ion exchange process wen et al 2011 the concentration of calcium and bicarbonate ions is high in freshwater and magnesium and chlorides ions are abundant in saline water if the ratio of cl hco3and mg ca exceeded 1 suggesting the excess of cl and mg in groundwater eventually indicate the seawater intrusion phenomena mondal et al 2011 the relation between cl hco3 and mg ca are presented in fig 9 the samples showed a slight variation in both of these ratios which can be attributed to the geochemical process like cation exchange 3 5 ionic changes the ionic changes were calculated to determine the behavior of each ion during the salinization process and the geochemical processes that change the theoretical content of ions the chemical reactions occurring during the seawater fresh water can be effectively analyzed by comparing the fraction of seawater in fresh water seawater and in the mixed water with the actual groundwater sample each of these parameters was calculated using equation 1 table 3 shows the theoretical concentration of seawater and freshwater the seawater fraction mix and change in concentration of all the samples were determined and presented in table 4 the mixing rate of seawater with the fresh groundwater calculated for all the wells was 31 however one sample near the salt pans showed relatively higher mixing rate which would have been affected due to total mixing rate the samples no 1 2 3 7 and 8 which are located near the near the coast salt pans showed a positive seawater fraction while a negative seawater fraction was shown by the samples 4 5 6 and 9 collected inside the villages this shows the occurrence of seawater intrusion to the well numbers 1 2 3 7 and 8 the e change of all the samples was negative however freshwater samples have e change close to zero fig 10 shows the ionic changes e change calculated for na ca mg k hco3 and so4 for all samples from the detailed analysis of hydrochemical mixing processes it was concluded that the study area exhibited a very complex and heterogeneous characteristics the complexity of this aquifer can be attributed to the dual nature of the origin of salinization from sea as well as the salt pans the salt pans in the study area are fairly far away from the coast however they are pumping the under groundwater for the production of salt the high saline nature of these waters can be attributed to the brines situated far below the ground controlled by the sea as well as the lithology this can be visible in the well no 3 situated near the salt pan the e change of mg followed the same trend of cl ve in all the other location except in this water in well no 3 it is positive which may be due to influence lithology on the groundwater chemistry during pumping ca and na are most important cations in the assessment of seawater intrusion the e change of na was usually positive since fresh groundwater contains only a small amount of na pulidoleboeuf 2004 aris et al 2009 however in the present study all the wells showed a negative e change for na in comparison with the e change of ca due to seawater intrusion the enrichment of na in the groundwater can be rationally explained by the cation exchange process mondal et al 2011 ions like k and mg showed almost the same high negative trend as na ions near the coast as well as the salt pans 3 6 factor analysis and cluster analysis factor analysis was applied to the hydrochemical parameters for identifying the sources of each ions the number of factors were determined based on the eigenvalues 1 these factors were rotated using varimax rotation the classification of factor loadings is important in identifying the significant parameters grouped in the corresponding factor a following classification is adopted by rao 2014 a very low positive 0 450 b low positive 0 450 0 600 c medium positive 0 600 0 750 d high positive 0 750 0 900 and e very high positive 0 900 a total of nine water quality parameters were analyzed and two major factors were yielded from the analysis the detailed classification of variable in each factor is presented in table 5 parameters like ec tds th na mg k and cl showed a medium high positive loading in the factor 1 all these water quality parameters in factor 1 represent seawater intrusion however a less loading of these ions and high factor loading for ions such as ca hco3 co3 so4 and ph represents the fresh water in normal cases sulphate is higher in the seawater but the presence of so4 with ca in factor 2 suggests the dissolution of gypsum in the study area the existence of ph and co3 in the factor 2 indicates e the dominance of carbonate dissolution and deposition in the coastal aquifer factor 1 explained 77 53 and factor 2 explained 12 99 of the total variance comparison of both factors with hydrochemical parameters suggests that seawater intrusion is dominating over the normal carbonate dissolution and related process to a large extent cluster analysis was applied for grouping the different sample locations with similar characteristics the wards method of linkage and euclidean distance was used for the analysis and a dendrogram was prepared the dendrogram for the study area showed two major clusters fig 11 this classification of dendrogram agreed with the results obtained from ionic changes hydrogeochemical analysis and factor analysis cluster 1 includes the sample numbers 1 2 3 7 and 8 however sample 3 was classified as a different sub class indicating the possible effect of salt pan water in general cluster 1 represents the samples affected by seawater intrusion cluster 2 includes sample 4 5 6 and 9 ionic constituents of this group indicate the dissolution of carbonate these samples are mainly located in the villages away from the coast 4 conclusions in this study the influence of sea water intrusion on groundwater of point calimere was studied using ionic changes hydrogeochemical and multivariate statistical methods physicochemical parameters represented in a boxplot show the wide range of variation in the chemistry of water from piper diagram it was observed that all the water samples were alkaline in nature with major water type of na cl type 83 and ca na hco3 17 from gibb s diagram it was identified that the evaporation and rock water interactions are the major controlling factors of the groundwater quality high rate of evaporation was occurring in the coastal wells while rock water interactions dominate in the subsurface away from the sea premises a good correlation was observed between tds and ions like na cl and mg in the samples near the coast the dominance of na over ca was suggested a direct cation exchange between these ions while a weak correlation was observed for hco3 the calculated ionic ratio between na and cl less than 0 86 for the samples from wells and the ratio greater than 1 for na cl mg cl cl hco3 and mg ca indicated the salinity intrusion in the well numbers 1 2 3 and 7 the hydrogeochemical ionic changes were calculated for all anions and cations and fraction was positive in many samples the e change of the parameters was negative and it decreased considerably while moving towards the sea and salt pans from the factor analysis it was concluded that the major source of pollution is due to seawater intrusion which was explained by first factor 77 53 of the total variance factor 2 was responsible for 12 99 of the total variance which indicate the dissolution of gypsum from the dendrogram obtained during cluster analysis two classification of groundwater samples were obtained which exactly depict the similar results obtained through factor analysis and

12042,seawater intrusion is a major threat to the water quality in the coastal aquifers a hydrogeochemical survey was conducted in and around the point calimere wetland with an objective to delineating the impact and sources of groundwater salinization these objectives were met by a combined hydrochemical and multivariate statistical approach groundwater samples showed an alkaline nature throughout the area it was substantiated by the observed positive correlation of tds with na mg and cl and a negative correlation with hco3 ionic changes during the saline water freshwater mixing were analyzed it was detected that the mixing rate of seawater with the fresh groundwater was 31 a negative e change was observed for the samples collected near the coast as well as salt pans the sources of salinity identified through factor analysis exhibited a clear segregation between freshwater and saline water the presence of ca and so4 in the factor 2 shows the dissolution of gypsum minerals the dendrogram generated through cluster analysis classified the total groundwater samples into two groups which agrees with the results obtained from the hydrochemical and factor analysis the wells that are near the coast and salt pans which are grouped under cluster 1 have influence of saline intrusion graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater salinization ionic ratio ionic change factor analysis cluster analysis point calimere 1 introduction water is considered as one of the most important components of human life and development it is used almost in all the sectors such as agricultural industrial environmental and domestic however water resources are getting depleted because of both natural and anthropogenic activities most of the coastal aquifers are sandy aquifer with high permeability which leads to seawater intrusion higher hydrostatic pressure and low density of freshwater column play significant role in maintaining the saline fresh water balance excessive pumping of wells in and around the coastal areas may disturb this balance and results in movement of seawater into coastal aquifers possible zones of salinization their origin and associated geochemical processes in the transition zone between salt and fresh water can be explained by analyses of groundwater chemistry panteleit et al 2001 geophysical hydrochemical isotopes and statistical methods are the most common tools available in the literature for analyzing the saline intrusion senthil kumar et al 2011 reported that vertical electrical sounding ves is well suited in the investigation of alluvial aquifers with large resistivity contacts hydrochemical and isotopic methods have been applied by various researchers for study the seawater intrusion phenomena in the coastal

many samples and varied from 0 to 120 mg l bicarbonates were in the range of 30 600 mg l hco3 is a representative of natural fresh water primarily originated from carbonate rocks concentration of sulphate ranged between 12 and 490 mg l the variation of the chemical parameters of the study area is shown in a boxplot fig 2 3 2 hydrochemical facies and water types from hydrogeochemical analysis the type of water with dominating ions was represented using piper diagram after piper 1944 as shown in fig 3 most of the groundwater samples show na cl type 83 the remaining samples were plotted under ca na hco3 groundwater samples collected near the coast as well as the salt pans were mainly nacl type this suggests the significant influence of seawater intrusion ca na hco3 type of water was seen in the samples collected from the wells in the villages which are away from the sea and saltpans the study area is sandwiched between bay of bengal in the east palk strait in the south and salt pans in the west the results showed that the hydrochemistry is largely controlled by the saline intrusion from seawater as well as the salt pan water 3 3 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry a gibbs diagram after gibbs 1970 was plotted to identify the different processes influencing groundwater chemistry fig 4 shows the gibbs diagram indicate that the groundwater in point calimere is are mainly controlled by the evaporation and rock water interaction those samples collected near the sea and saltpans undergo more evaporation than those samples that are collected from the villages which are largely controlled by rock water interaction none of the samples fall under the region of precipitation 3 4 chemical correlations and ionic ratios ionic ratios of groundwater have been often used to evaluate seawater intrusion in coastal areas sánchez martos et al 2002 kim et al 2003 abdalla 2016 the correlation between all the chemical parameters were analyzed and a correlation matrix was generated see table 2 considering the importance of each of these ions in delineating seawater intrusion cross plots were made between the selected ions and tds chloride is considered to be the most common and effective tracer of saline water freshwater mixing from the cross plot between cl and tds shown in fig 5 a perfect correlation with the dissolved solids was observed almost the same ratio was exhibited by the tds vs na k plot fig 5 meanwhile a weak correlation was observed between tds and hco3 fig 5 this suggests the marginal contribution of this ion in the total ionic concentration the results of cross plot between ca and mg with tds showed a high positive correlation fig 5 in normal circumstances the magnesium ions will be dominating over calcium in the coastal aquifers this is proved by a feeble relation between tds and so4 fig 5 which is due to the deposition of ca and so4 as gypsum a highly linear relation of tds with na and cl and a weak relation with hco3 suggest the possibility of seawater intrusion nevertheless the origins of these ions have been considered in a detailed manner in the coming sections the na cl relationship often has been used an indicator for mechanisms controlling the salinity and saline intrusions in coastal regions kim et al 2003 shammas and jacks 2007 wen et al 2011 the na cl ratio of the seawater is 0 86 a value below and above 0 86 is considered as seawater intrusion and anthropogenic sources respectively sherif et al 2011 if the origin is from the seawater the relation between the na and cl must be strongly correlated as shown in fig 6 most of the values of the parameters are on or near the seawater freshwater mixing line which indicate the mixing of seawater with the freshwater few values are in the chloride zone which may be due to the cation exchange between ca and na the plot of na cl ratio with the sample location showed that majority of the samples were below the line of seawater ratio suggesting the influence of seawater fig 7 however those samples collected near the salt pans have ratio more than 1 which represents the anthropogenic inputs mg cl can be used in the identification of salinization process a ratio of mg cl above 0 5 fig 7 in all the samples indicates the seawater intrusion bo 1996 shammas and jacks 2007 the relation between ca mg and cl was drawn to assess the behavior of these ions with salinity fig 8 a linear relation between these ions with chloride suggests the reverse ion exchange process wen et al 2011 the concentration of calcium and bicarbonate ions is high in freshwater and magnesium and chlorides ions are abundant in saline water if the ratio of cl hco3and mg ca exceeded 1 suggesting the excess of cl and mg in groundwater eventually indicate the seawater intrusion phenomena mondal et al 2011 the relation between cl hco3 and mg ca are presented in fig 9 the samples showed a slight variation in both of these ratios which can be attributed to the geochemical process like cation exchange 3 5 ionic changes the ionic changes were calculated to determine the behavior of each ion during the salinization process and the geochemical processes that change the theoretical content of ions the chemical reactions occurring during the seawater fresh water can be effectively analyzed by comparing the fraction of seawater in fresh water seawater and in the mixed water with the actual groundwater sample each of these parameters was calculated using equation 1 table 3 shows the theoretical concentration of seawater and freshwater the seawater fraction mix and change in concentration of all the samples were determined and presented in table 4 the mixing rate of seawater with the fresh groundwater calculated for all the wells was 31 however one sample near the salt pans showed relatively higher mixing rate which would have been affected due to total mixing rate the samples no 1 2 3 7 and 8 which are located near the near the coast salt pans showed a positive seawater fraction while a negative seawater fraction was shown by the samples 4 5 6 and 9 collected inside the villages this shows the occurrence of seawater intrusion to the well numbers 1 2 3 7 and 8 the e change of all the samples was negative however freshwater samples have e change close to zero fig 10 shows the ionic changes e change calculated for na ca mg k hco3 and so4 for all samples from the detailed analysis of hydrochemical mixing processes it was concluded that the study area exhibited a very complex and heterogeneous characteristics the complexity of this aquifer can be attributed to the dual nature of the origin of salinization from sea as well as the salt pans the salt pans in the study area are fairly far away from the coast however they are pumping the under groundwater for the production of salt the high saline nature of these waters can be attributed to the brines situated far below the ground controlled by the sea as well as the lithology this can be visible in the well no 3 situated near the salt pan the e change of mg followed the same trend of cl ve in all the other location except in this water in well no 3 it is positive which may be due to influence lithology on the groundwater chemistry during pumping ca and na are most important cations in the assessment of seawater intrusion the e change of na was usually positive since fresh groundwater contains only a small amount of na pulidoleboeuf 2004 aris et al 2009 however in the present study all the wells showed a negative e change for na in comparison with the e change of ca due to seawater intrusion the enrichment of na in the groundwater can be rationally explained by the cation exchange process mondal et al 2011 ions like k and mg showed almost the same high negative trend as na ions near the coast as well as the salt pans 3 6 factor analysis and cluster analysis factor analysis was applied to the hydrochemical parameters for identifying the sources of each ions the number of factors were determined based on the eigenvalues 1 these factors were rotated using varimax rotation the classification of factor loadings is important in identifying the significant parameters grouped in the corresponding factor a following classification is adopted by rao 2014 a very low positive 0 450 b low positive 0 450 0 600 c medium positive 0 600 0 750 d high positive 0 750 0 900 and e very high positive 0 900 a total of nine water quality parameters were analyzed and two major factors were yielded from the analysis the detailed classification of variable in each factor is presented in table 5 parameters like ec tds th na mg k and cl showed a medium high positive loading in the factor 1 all these water quality parameters in factor 1 represent seawater intrusion however a less loading of these ions and high factor loading for ions such as ca hco3 co3 so4 and ph represents the fresh water in normal cases sulphate is higher in the seawater but the presence of so4 with ca in factor 2 suggests the dissolution of gypsum in the study area the existence of ph and co3 in the factor 2 indicates e the dominance of carbonate dissolution and deposition in the coastal aquifer factor 1 explained 77 53 and factor 2 explained 12 99 of the total variance comparison of both factors with hydrochemical parameters suggests that seawater intrusion is dominating over the normal carbonate dissolution and related process to a large extent cluster analysis was applied for grouping the different sample locations with similar characteristics the wards method of linkage and euclidean distance was used for the analysis and a dendrogram was prepared the dendrogram for the study area showed two major clusters fig 11 this classification of dendrogram agreed with the results obtained from ionic changes hydrogeochemical analysis and factor analysis cluster 1 includes the sample numbers 1 2 3 7 and 8 however sample 3 was classified as a different sub class indicating the possible effect of salt pan water in general cluster 1 represents the samples affected by seawater intrusion cluster 2 includes sample 4 5 6 and 9 ionic constituents of this group indicate the dissolution of carbonate these samples are mainly located in the villages away from the coast 4 conclusions in this study the influence of sea water intrusion on groundwater of point calimere was studied using ionic changes hydrogeochemical and multivariate statistical methods physicochemical parameters represented in a boxplot show the wide range of variation in the chemistry of water from piper diagram it was observed that all the water samples were alkaline in nature with major water type of na cl type 83 and ca na hco3 17 from gibb s diagram it was identified that the evaporation and rock water interactions are the major controlling factors of the groundwater quality high rate of evaporation was occurring in the coastal wells while rock water interactions dominate in the subsurface away from the sea premises a good correlation was observed between tds and ions like na cl and mg in the samples near the coast the dominance of na over ca was suggested a direct cation exchange between these ions while a weak correlation was observed for hco3 the calculated ionic ratio between na and cl less than 0 86 for the samples from wells and the ratio greater than 1 for na cl mg cl cl hco3 and mg ca indicated the salinity intrusion in the well numbers 1 2 3 and 7 the hydrogeochemical ionic changes were calculated for all anions and cations and fraction was positive in many samples the e change of the parameters was negative and it decreased considerably while moving towards the sea and salt pans from the factor analysis it was concluded that the major source of pollution is due to seawater intrusion which was explained by first factor 77 53 of the total variance factor 2 was responsible for 12 99 of the total variance which indicate the dissolution of gypsum from the dendrogram obtained during cluster analysis two classification of groundwater samples were obtained which exactly depict the similar results obtained through factor analysis and

12043,rapid industrialization of the city of coimbatore in the recent past has imposed stress on groundwater resources resulting in quantity depletion and quality deterioration the present study aimed at evaluating the groundwater quality of coimbatore city india qualitative analysis of 17 groundwater samples were made during the post monsoon and pre monsoon in 2015 as groundwater forms a dominant source for irrigation and domestic purposes an evaluation of its suitability for these purposes were assessed classic geochemical methods have been coupled with geospatial approaches to arrive at the geochemical processes controlling the hydrochemistry of groundwater the study reveals that the high concentration of nickel and total dissolved solids in the groundwater is caused due to the contamination from textile mill effluent which is discharged into the noyyal river and ultimately join the water table the influence of this contamination is reflected in the geochemical processes wherein the contaminated area exhibits different water type at different seasons ca type water was converted to na type or mixed na ca type during the transition from post monsoon to pre monsoon majority of the samples are influenced by rock water interaction and the dominance of the processes followed the order ion exchange weathering reverse ion exchange the major driving force for ion exchange between ca2 in rock and na in water was the abundance of na in the percolating water which is contributed by textile effluent among the weathering process carbonate weathering dominated silicate weathering due to the presence of limestone deposit and red calcareous soil the quantification of saturation index suggests that carbonate minerals are super saturated in the groundwater in the following order dolomite calcite aragonite while other minerals including fluorite halite and gypsum were unsaturated graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality geochemistry rock water interaction textile sewage nickel coimbatore india 1 introduction in many arid and semi arid regions groundwater is one of the alternate sources mainly for domestic and agricultural activities due to rapid industrialization and rising population stress on the groundwater resource is increasing on quantitative as well as qualitative aspects it is the quality of groundwater which ultimately determines its suitability for various purposes groundwater quality may get deteriorated by natural and anthropogenic factors namely geochemical processes hem 1989 rao et al 2012 precipitation jalali 2007 leaching of domestic agricultural and industrial waste the various geochemical processes which take place between water and aquifer include weathering and dissolution precipitation and crystallization sorption ion exchange and reactions the interaction of both natural processes and human activities determine the water types belkhiri and mouni 2013 the knowledge of the geochemical interactions in the soil rock groundwater system is essential to an adequate assessment of water quality at a regional scale reddy et al 2010 further a thorough understanding of the geochemical process that affect the groundwater quality is necessary to address groundwater related issues subramani et al 2010 the assessment of hydrogeochemical processes requires the knowledge of hydrochemical facies influence of rock water interactions evaporation and precipitation on water chemistry which can be studied using graphical plots such as piper diagram lee et al 2001 hajalilou and khaleghi 2009 sadashivaiah et al 2008 selvakumar et al 2017 and gibbs plot kaur et al 2017 kozłowski and komisarek 2017 sajil kumar et al 2014 the interrelationship between various ions will demonstrate the different rock water interactions occurring in the aquifer geochemical modelling using phreeqc code is being used along with other statistical techniques in the recent years to explore more information on the hydrogeochemical systems belkhiri and mouni 2013 demirel 2004 this multidisciplinary approach is needed to delineate the exact processes occurring in the aquifer system in a semi arid region such as coimbatore tamil nadu a variety of groundwater situations may arise due to the different geochemical processes that occur in the aquifer jebastina and arulraj 2016 proposed that carbonate dissolution silicate weathering ion exchange and leaching of industrial effluents and fertilizers can possibly alter the water chemistry based on multivariate statistical analysis on the groundwater quality of coimbatore district some of the studies related to groundwater quality of coimbatore are concentrated on small sub basins of lakes priya et al 2011 priya and arulraj 2011 selvakumar et al 2017 sundar et al 2015 even though degradation in groundwater quality is reported the causes underlying its degradation have not been identified as numerous textile mills are located in the industrialized city the influence of textile mill effluent on the groundwater quality of the city needs investigation an assessment of the geochemical processes in the aquifer using the above mentioned state of the art techniques is found lacking in literatures as far as the aquifers of coimbatore is concerned this study is therefore aimed at investigating the major hydrogeochemical processes occurring in the aquifer system of coimbatore city tamil nadu the main objective was to identify the different mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry through a systematic study of the geochemical and geospatial techniques the study specifically explored the role of textile mills on the geochemical processes in the aquifer as the groundwater forms the major source for irrigation an evaluation of it suitability for irrigation was carried out 2 study area 2 1 general the coimbatore city the administrative headquarters of coimbatore district is one of the highly industrialized city in south india fig 1 located between 100 55 110 10 n latitude and 76050 77010 e longitude it is surrounded by the western ghats to the north west and have an elevation of ca 430 m above m s l the topography of the city slopes from north towards south and from west towards east fig 2 noyyal river a tributary of cauvery river runs through coimbatore and forms the southern boundary of the city fig 2 the city is known for its textile factories and is often referred to as the mancehster of south india in 1888 the first textile mill started and since then there are over 100 mills in operation moreover there are more than 25 000 small to large scale industries in coimbatore thereby forming a major economy driving force for tamil nadu msme 2013 thus the land use of coimbatore is mainly consisting of built up land except at the banks of noyyal river where most of the land is occupied by agricultural field 2 2 hydrological setting the climate is generally tropical with lowest temperature during november to february 17 c and highest temperature during march to may 39 c the average annual rainfall varies from 550 mm to 900 mm under the influence of north east and south west monsoons the northeast monsoon occurs during october november months which contributes to the major portion of rainfall in the city and summer rains are negligible the period from april to june is generally hot and dry and consists of summer fig 3 represents a typical rainfall histogram for the study area this rainfall is not sufficient to sustain the demand of the city for the entire year and the shortage is partially covered through water supply schemes like siruvani pillor and athikkadavu the remaining demand is being fulfilled by water extracted from the aquifer through dug and bore wells the city is located in the noyyal river basin a sub basin of cauvery river basin the noyyal is a seasonal river having good flow only during the north east and south west monsoon the river emerges in the vellangiri hills of the western ghats and flows over a distance of 180 km in an area of 3510 sq km to join cauvery river at karur district there are 8 major wetlands singanallur velankulam ukkadam periyakulam selvampathy narasampathi krishnampathi selvachinthamani and kumaraswami fed by the noyyal river and are mostly used for irrigation purposes some of the natural drains in the city include sanganur pallam velangurichi singanallur drain railway feeder road side drain trichy singanallur check drain ganapathy drain koilmedu drain and karperayam koil drain 2 3 geological setting geology of coimbatore is mainly characterized by the peninsular gneiss complex and the local rock formation can be classified as a wide range of metamorphic rocks which are extensively weathered and overlain by recent valley fills and alluvium the geological formations found in the district are khondalite calc granulite complex gneiss mainly hornblende biotite and crystalline limestone dolerite charnockite granite gneiss granite and syenite pegmatite and quartzite veins fissured granitic gneiss and massive granitic gneiss form the bed rocks table 1 shows the various components of rocks of the study area coimbatore is the source of many mineral resources namely gypsum feldspar limestone and quartz silica magnesite source department of mines geology coimbatore the four major types of soil in the study area include black cotton soil 9 14 reddish brown brown loamy soil 4 86 alluvium and colluvium 8 91 red calcareous soil 63 83 and red non calcareous soil 13 26 subburaj 2008 the main constituent of soil in the study area is caco3 due to the predominance of red calcareous soil kankar is followed by top soil at certain areas the sand deposit is predominant at the eastern side fig 4 represents the soil in the district 2 4 hydrogeological setting in coimbatore groundwater occurs in all geological formations from the oldest archaen to recent alluvium the geological formation lithological variation tectonic complexity and geomorphological and hydrometerorological dissimilarities existing in the region give rise to a variety of groundwater situations based on the mode of occurrence the hydrogeological framework has been divided into two categories fissured and fractured formation both in gneiss and charnockite formation and porous formation fig 5 the porous formation in the area is represented by alluvium colluvium and laterites the groundwater in the region with colluvium formation occurs under phreatic conditions in the aquifer at depth ranging from 30 to 60 m in alluvium formation consisting mainly of silt and clay groundwater occurs under water table conditions or semi confined and the formations are highly porous permeable and developed into potential water bearing zones the depth to water level depends on the rainfall intensity and is variable over the year the water is produced by the usage of dug wells and bore wells 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and analysis groundwater samples were collected from 17 wells during the post monsoon october 2015 and the pre monsoon april 2015 seasons fig 2 the samples were collected in polyethylene bottles pre cleaned with de ionized water the bottles were rinsed using the groundwater samples before collection for determining each parameter of each sample three replicates were carried out the parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and temperature were measured in situ using a portable water quality analyser systronics water analyser 371 after proper calibration the collected samples were transferred to the laboratory and were analysed for the major cations such as ca2 mg2 na k and major anions such as cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 and for total hardness as per apha 1998 standard methods the ca2 and mg2 were analysed using titrimetric methods using standard edta na and k were determined using flame photometer cl was analysed by argentometric method by titration with agno3 hco3 and co3 2 were determined by acid titration and so4 2 by spectrophotometry fluoride concentration was found using spectrophotometer using spands reagent for the analysis of heavy metals the samples were collected in bottles pre cleaned by soaking in detergent followed by soaking in 10 nitric acid for 48 h and finally rinsed with deionized water the samples were filtered and acid stabilized soon after collection metal ion concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometer model 3110 using air acetylene flame quantification of metals was based upon calibration curves of standard solution of respective metals the detection limits for fe mn cu ni cr pb cd and zn are 0 003 0 001 0 004 0 002 0 01 0 0005 0 0008 and 0 004 mg l respectively the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes was assessed using salinity hazard alkalinity hazard sodium permeability index magnesium ratio and kelly ratio hydrochemical classification was done using piper diagram and the various hydrogeochemical facies existing in the study area were identified hydrochemical evolution of groundwater was delineated using gibbs diagram and the influence of rock water interaction evaporation and precipitation on the groundwater chemistry was studied the mutual relationships existing between the major cations and anions were investigated through ca2 mg2 ratio ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 ratio na k total cations ratio ca2 mg2 vs ec plot na cl vs ec plot and chloroalkaline indices and the analysis lead to the identification of the processes controlling the groundwater chemistry further geochemical modelling was attempted using the geochemical code phreeqc to analyse the degree of equilibrium between water and minerals in the aquifer 4 results and discussion 4 1 general chemistry the summary of statistics of qualitative parameters of groundwater samples during the post monsoon and pre monsoon is presented in table 2 the groundwater was slightly alkaline in nature with the ph varying between 7 1 and 7 6 during the post monsoon and between 7 and 7 8 during the pre monsoon a wide spatial and temporal variation in electrical conductivity ec was observed in the study area the range of ec was between 532 and 6240 μs cm and between 300 and 8360 μs cm during the post monsoon and pre monsoon respectively and the corresponding variations of tds was 340 3934 mg l and 192 5451 mg l 82 of the samples are classified as brackish total dissolved solids tds of 1000 10 000 mg l with the remaining samples falling under freshwater category 250 1000 mg l as per the classification proposed by todd 1980 88 of the samples fall under very hard category 300 mg l based on the classification system proposed by sawyer and mccartly 1967 with the total hardness ranging between 279 1425 mg l during the post monsoon and between 230 and 3400 mg l during the pre monsoon the results show that the groundwater is highly mineralized in the study area the dominance of major cations in the groundwater samples followed the order ca2 na mg2 k meq l while the major anions followed the order cl hco3 co3 2 so4 2 meq l during both the seasons the ion balance errors of all the samples during both the seasons were within 5 the concentration of ca2 ranged between 30 and 451 mg l during the post monsoon and between 135 and 318 mg l during the pre monsoon while the range of mg2 was 22 243 mg l and 12 160 mg l during the post monsoon and pre monsoon respectively these ions may be derived from calcium and magnesium bearing rocks namely charnokite granite and gneiss the concentration of na and k ranged respectively from 32 to 380 mg l and from 4 to 87 mg l during the post monsoon and from 95 to 823 mg l and 6 182 mg l during the pre monsoon a higher concentration of ca2 ions among the cations may be attributed to rock weathering or dissolution of soil minerals another cause of dominance of alkali earth elements over alkali elements may be the ion exchange process between rock and water the variation of cl was between 28 1614 mg l during the post monsoon and between 44 1500 mg l during the pre monsoon weathering and dissolution of salt deposits percolation from agricultural fields and discharge from industrial wastewater are some of the common causes of higher chloride content in groundwater jeevanandam et al 2012 higher carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations leading to alkalinity of water was observed in the study area with their concentration varying between 146 561 mg l during the post monsoon and between 336 600 mg l during the pre monsoon they are probably derived from the weathering of limestone dissolution of carbonate precipitates atmospheric and soil carbon di oxide jeong 2001 the least dominant anion in the groundwater was sulphates and it ranged between 25 and 880 mg l during the post monsoon and between 14 and 166 mg l during the pre monsoon contamination from industrial and domestic sewage are likely to cause an increase in the concentration of sulphates baruah et al 2008 at some locations a marginally higher concentration of fluorides was observed for 35 and 18 of the samples with its value peaking to 1 8 and 1 28 mg l during the post monsoon and pre monsoon respectively biotite hornblende lepidolite and mica are the major components of rocks contributing to fluorides in groundwater some of the major factors that affect the dissolution of fluoride from rocks in groundwater include ph temperature anion exchange capacity residence time depth age of groundwater concentration of carbonates and bicarbonates apambire et al 1997 over 24 of the samples exhibited a fe concentration greater than bis drinking water standards of 300 μg l with its values ranging between 90 570 μg l during the post monsoon and 8 455 μg l during the pre monsoon biotite and hornblende are the major sources of fe in the study area and it is expected that conditions favorable for the reduction of ferric ion into ferrous ion exists in the location it was observed that all the samples exhibited low concentration of mn zn and cu during both the seasons and were well below the bis drinking water standards of 100 μg l 5000 μg l and 50 μg l respectively cd was below the detection limits in all the samples hence not given in table 2 except 12 of the samples during the post monsoon and 1 during the pre monsoon cr concentration in all the samples were within bis drinking water standards of 50 μg l nevertheless all the samples had ni concentrations exceeding the bis standards of 20 μg l during both the seasons the health effects due to exposure to nickel include nausea headache vomiting skin irritation hypersensitivity and carcinogenicity nickel is extensively used in textile mills where they use nickel phthalocyanines bright green dyes during the dyeing process a number of textile mills are located in the study area as can be seen from fig 2 the wastewater from the textile mills are discharged into the noyyal river which ultimately reaches the groundwater table the mobility of nickel is enhanced by the presence of fe and mn oxides in the aquifer while biotite and hornblende contribute to fe mn may be contributed by khondalite it was observed that there was a good correlation of fe and mn with ni during the post monsoon table 3 this suggests that when the groundwater flow is appreciable ni is highly mobilized in the aquifer causing a wide spread distribution even though the dilution effect of rain plays a role to reduce the concentration fig 6 during the pre monsoon the concentration of ni is marginally high because of the absence of dilution effect and this leads to the distribution of ni on the central and south eastern regions fig 6 salt is extensively used during the dyeing process there was a consistent positive correlation of ni with ec and tds table 4 during both the seasons further the spatial variation of ni fig 6 and tds fig 7 show that both ni and tds have higher concentration at same spatial areas thereby depicting that ni and tds are arrived from the same source also referring the location of textile mills fig 2 it is certain that textile mills can be the possible source of contamination of groundwater in the central and south eastern regions it is interesting to note that the distribution of ni resembles the topography of coimbatore fig 2 suggesting that the tributary of noyyal river see fig 2 which carries the wastewater recharges the groundwater and therefore spatial distribution of ni follows that of the flow pattern in the aquifer ie from north western to south eastern direction thus textile mills can be considered as the possible contributors of nickel in the groundwater of coimbatore around 41 of the samples during post monsoon exhibited pb concentrations exceeding bis standards 10 μg l the maximum reported concentration being 70 μg l on the other hand the concentration of pb during the pre monsoon was well within the permissible limit in all the samples pb is primarily used in the production of lead acid batteries solder and alloys the various effects due to exposure to lead include neuro developmental effects mortality due to cardio vascular diseases impaired renal function hypertension and impaired fertility who 2017 correlation analysis reveals that pb is having high positive correlation with fe thereby suggesting the association of pb with fe table 3 pb is likely mobilized in groundwater through adsorptive retardation by iron oxy hydroxides further the high correlation of pb with cr indicates that both are originated from the same source they are possibly transported by percolation through the precipitation during the post monsoon during the pre monsoon ion exchange of pb with ca of calcite may have probably lead to the reduction of pb in groundwater thereby increasing the concentration of ca in groundwater as evidenced by the higher concentration of ca in the samples during pre monsoon 4 2 hydrogeochemical classification 4 2 1 classification of water for irrigation groundwater is the major source of water for irrigation accounting for 92 of the total irrigated area in coimbatore district being the dominant source of water for irrigation an analysis of the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes was carried out the major parameters that are important for irrigation water include salinity hazard electrical conductivity alkalinity hazard sodium absorption ratio sar percentage sodium na permeability index pi magnesium ratio mr and kelly ratio ki table 5 gives the different classification systems generally adopted for classifying irrigation water and the of samples falling under in each category from the study area sar is the ratio between na and ca2 mg2 ions and is a measure of alkali sodium hazard to crops subramani et al 2010 higher amounts of na relative to ca2 and mg2 ions can cause dispersion of soil colloids thereby destroying soil texture and permeability kumar et al 2007 the us salinity laboratory classification system classify irrigation water into 4 categories based on sar and ec excellent sar 10 ec 250 μs cm good sar 10 18 ec 250 750 μs cm satisfactory sar 18 26 ec 750 2250 μs cm bad sar 26 ec 2250 μs cm richards 1954 the salinity hazard and alkalinity hazard of groundwater samples can be best represented by wilcox diagram wilcox 1955 as per the classification 12 of the samples fall under s3c4 category 37 of the samples under s2c4 category and the remaining samples can be categorized as s1c3 and s1c2 fig 8 sodium interacts with soil and reduces its permeability parthasarathy et al 2012 through adsorption on to clay particles followed by ion exchange with ca2 and mg2 ions from the soil as a result internal drainage is lowered leading to reduced circulation of air and water and ultimately the soil becomes hard saleh et al 1999 wilcox 1955 put forward a method for classifying irrigation water based on sodium percentage accordingly 12 of the samples fall under excellent category with a na 20 and the remaining under good and permissible category during the post monsoon while 23 of the samples had a na 60 during the pre monsoon showing that the water samples are not satisfactory for irrigation table 5 a criteria for assessing the irrigation water was proposed by doneen 1964 on the basis of the influence of na ca2 mg2 and hco3 on the permeability of soil according to him the permeability index is the ratio of na hco3 to ca2 mg2 na a permeability index of 75 is classified as class i and between 25 and 75 as class ii and are suitable for irrigation while if the index is 25 the water is unsuitable for irrigation all the samples from the study area fall either under class i or class ii thereby indicating their suitability for irrigation considering the ratio of na to ca2 mg2 which is defined as kelly ratio kelley 1951 all the samples exhibited a value 1 and are suitable for irrigation during the post monsoon 35 of the samples were found to be unsuitable for irrigation during the pre monsoon in natural waters ca2 and mg2 ions will be in equilibrium hem 1989 however some of the processes such as ion exchange and rock water interaction may disrupt the equilibrium leading to high mg2 ions in water which can have adverse effects on the yield of crop when used for irrigation kumar et al 2007 the mg ratio is calculated as the ratio of mg2 to the sum of ca2 and mg2 paliwal 1972 a mg ratio of 50 is considered as suitable for irrigation and comprises of 41 and 82 of the samples during post monsoon and pre monsoon respectively 4 2 2 hydrochemical facies the groundwater chemistry is governed by geochemical reactions occurring in the aquifer or by the intrusion followed by contamination from neighbourhood areas the various geochemical compositions arising from these processes can be identified by analyzing the hydrogeochemical facies of groundwater using piper diagram piper 1944 the diagram consists of two triangular and a central diamond shaped field and from the position of the water sample in the field the water type can be identified fig 9 the diagram reveals that alkaline earths ca2 mg2 exceed alkalies na k and strong acids cl so4 2 exceed weak acids hco3 co3 2 during both the seasons for majority of the samples however for a small group of samples the phenomenon was reversed during the transition from post monsoon to pre monsoon 57 of the samples fall under mixed ca mg cl type while 35 fall under ca mg hco3 type during the post monsoon some of the samples which exhibited ca type were converted to na type or mixed ca na type during the transition from post monsoon to pre monsoon and that accounted for 29 of the samples the samples on the central part exhibited this transition fig 10 this has occurred mainly at locations of textile mills fig 2 it is suspected that the textile mills are a main contributor to the water type in the central regions the chemicals used by the textile mills during the scouring caustic soda soda ash mercerizing caustic soda bleaching sodium hypochlorite and dyeing process are released into the noyyal river and subsequently reach the groundwater table it can be noted that na ions are the major cations in all these chemicals used during post monsoon the rainwater dilute the concentration of textile wastewater in the river thereby reducing the concentration of na ions and thus the ca2 ions dominate na ions resulting in the ca type of water nevertheless during the pre monsoon in the absence of rainfall there will be higher degree of concentration of na in the river thereby increasing the levels of na ions in comparison with ca2 ions thus textile mills contribute to the water type of the central and south eastern regions of the study area wherein ca type during post monsoon was converted to na type or mixed ca na type during the pre monsoon thus the contamination from textile mills has caused a seasonal variability in the aquifer characteristics especially the water type 4 3 hydrochemical evolution in order to further delineate the processes controlling groundwater chemistry gibbs diagram proposed by gibbs 1970 was plotted it is used to interpret the influence of rock water interaction evaporation and precipitation on the groundwater chemistry the gibbs ratios are plotted against tds concentrations as shown in fig 11 the cation ratio varied from 0 06 to 0 76 and the anion ratio between 0 16 and 0 85 most of the samples fall under rock water interaction and evaporation crystallization dominant zone the rock water interactions that affect the groundwater chemistry include chemical weathering of rocks dissolution precipitation of secondary carbonates and ion exchange between water and clay minerals the samples falling under evaporation zone exhibit higher cl ions and consequently higher tds concentrations as the phenomenon of evaporation is not much predominant in the deep aquifers as in the study area the high tds may be attributed to contamination from anthropogenic activities especially from textile mills as described earlier hence evaporation may not have much influence on the groundwater chemistry 4 4 hydrochemical relations an analysis of the relationship among major ions is essential for understanding the natural rock water interaction process taking place in the aquifer the dominant cations in most of the samples include ca2 and mg2 calcite and aragonite are the predominant rocks rick in ca2 while the presence of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater may be due to weathering of dolomite the weathering of dolomite rocks will be predominant at locations with a ca2 mg2 molar ratio 1 mayo and loucks 1995 while a ca2 mg2 ratio between 1 and 2 represents calcite weathering and a greater ca2 mg2 ratio indicate silicate weathering katz et al 1997 65 of the samples exhibited a ca2 mg2 ratio 1 18 between 1 and 2 and 17 had ratios 2 during the post monsoon while 17 of the samples showed a ratio 1 29 between 1 and 2 and over 53 of the samples have ca2 mg2 ratio 2 the dissolution of rocks is driven by the presence of co2 in the aquifer which is liberated during the degradation of organic matter present in the soil the fundamental process to weathering includes h 2 o c o 2 h 2 c o 3 carbonate rocks limestone rocks such as calcite aragonite and dolomite undergo dissolution under natural conditions as given below calcite and aragonite c a c o 3 h 2 c o 3 c a 2 2 h c o 3 c a c o 3 h

feldspar of granite rocks it may undergo hydrolysis and get altered to clay minerals releasing ca2 as depicted below c a a l 2 s i 2 o 8 2 h 2 c o 3 1 2 o 2 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 c a 2 2 c o 3 2 a higher ca2 mg2 ratio was exhibited in the north western regions fig 12 where the water was of ca mg hco3 type the results suggest that carbonate weathering predominate in those regions of the study area the huge deposits of limestone may be the source for carbonate weathering in addition the red calcareous soil may also contribute to carbonate leading to the release of ca2 ions to water the dominance of carbonate weathering is suspected when ca2 mg2 dominate hco3 and so4 2 resulting in an increase in ca2 and mg2 in groundwater elango and kannan 2007 the plot between ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 will be near 1 1 equiline if ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 are derived from calcite aragonite dolomite and gypsum the average ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 was greater than 1 1 7 with the ratios ranging between 0 6 and 2 3 fig 13 a 23 of the samples were clustered near 1 1 equiline indicating that the dissolution of calcite dolomite and aragonite lead to higher ca2 mg2 in groundwater majority of the samples are shifted to the left of the equiline and have an excess of ca2 mg2 and may be dominated by ion exchange process wherein na in water is exchanged for ca2 from clay which is seen in alluvium formations as indicated below c a c l a y 2 2 n a 2 n a c l a y c a 2 the na in water is possibly contributed by the textile mill effluents where salt and caustic soda are used for dyeing scouring bleaching and mercerizing process and are generally discharged without proper treatment this suggest that the contamination from textile mills through the release of na into the aquifer enhances the ion exchange process thereby leading to an increase in the concentration of ca ions in the aquifer 17 of the samples fall below the 1 1 equiline during the post monsoon and are shifted to the right of the 1 1 equiline have an excess of so4 2 hco3 which can be attributed to reverse ion exchange process as shown below 2 n a c l a y c a 2 c a c l a y 2 2 n a in addition to carbonate weathering weathering of silicates can play a major role in controlling the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater garrels and mackenzie 1967 the ratio between na k and total cations is generally considered for identifying the process of silicate weathering sarin et al 1989 majority of the samples fall above 1 2 line while a few samples fall close to or below 1 2 line fig 13 b thereby indicating the importance of silicate weathering only at those regions a constant increase in salinity with na cl ratio is an indicator that evaporation is a dominant process there was a positive correlation between ca2 mg2 and cl fig 13 c and a negative correlation between na cl and ec fig 13 d this indicates that evaporation has no role in the hydrochemistry different values of na cl for an increasing ec suggest that exchange reactions and silicate weathering dominate over evaporation majority of the samples exhibited a decreasing na cl ratio with increasing salinity which may be attributed to removal of na from groundwater due to ion exchange process rajmohan and elango 2004 further na cl ratio equal to or greater than 1 suggests silicate weathering wherein feldspar minerals under acidic conditions hydrolyze as follows n a a l s i 3 o 8 4 h 2 o 4 h n a a l 3 3 s i o h 4 a l 3 s i o h 4 1 2 h 2 o 3 h 1 2 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 overall n a a l s i 3 o 8 4 1 2 h 2 o h n a 2 s i o h 4 1 2 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 the influence of ion exchange process on the groundwater chemistry can be assessed from two chloro alkaline indices namely cai 1 and cai 2 suggested by schoeller 1967 the indices were obtained using the following equations c a i 1 c l n a k c l c a i 2 c l n a k s o 4 h c o 3 c o 3 if both the indices are positive there is exchange of na or k from water with ca2 or mg2 from rocks and vice versa schoeller 1967 majority of the samples exhibited a positive value of cai 1 cai 2 fig 13 e indicating that the exchange of na or k from water occurs with ca2 and mg2 from rocks this is in agreement with the results obtained from ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 plot for the remaining samples with negative cai values it is suspected that reverse ion exchange or weathering dominate over ion exchange process during reverse ion exchange when the replacement of ca2 mg2 ions by na ions in solution takes place the removal of ca2 causes a change in ph because of the change in equilibrium of the reaction c a c o 3 c o 2 h 2 o c a 2 2 h c o 3 the reaction is driven further to the right increasing the bicarbonate level and reduces the ph this is depicted as shown in fig 13 f wherein ph increases as the ca2 concentration drops the overall processes occurring in the aquifer of coimbatore city can thus be depicted as shown in fig 14 the ion exchange process is dominant in the south western and central regions and major driving force for the process in this region is contamination from textile mill effluent contributing to na ions 4 5 geochemical modelling the degree of equilibrium between water and minerals in the aquifer which affects their dissolution and precipitation can best be represented by saturation index si it can well predict the thermodynamic control on the composition of water which has equilibrated with the minerals in the aquifer saturation index was obtained using the geochemical code phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 si was calculated using the following expression s i log i a p k where iap is the ion activity product and k is the solubility product constant when si 0 equilibrium exists between groundwater and minerals while minerals tend to precipitate when they are saturated or super saturated and in such cases si is positive thus negative si values indicate that water is under saturated with the minerals and suggests the possibilities of mineral dissolution the saturation index of the groundwater samples was estimated using phreeqc package in which the chemical parameters of the groundwater samples form the input variables the code was run to obtain the si of all the possible minerals considering the major cations and anions in the groundwater of the study area minerals such as calcite dolomite aragonite were expected to dominate other minerals the analysis of si in the study area indicates that majority of the carbonate minerals are saturated in the aquifer fig 15 and are incapable of dissolving more minerals of the carbonate minerals super saturation followed the order dolomite calcite aragonite the influencing factors of super saturation of carbonate minerals include differential weathering of carbonate rocks and dissolution of silicate minerals common ion effect jabal et al 2015 this validates the previous observations that carbonate weathering dominates a major part of the study area where limestone formation is available the other minerals including fluorite gypsum halite and anhydride were under saturated in all the samples thereby indicating that the ions such as na cl ca2 and so4 2 were not limited by mineral equilibrium belkhiri and mouni 2013 5 conclusions the study applied a multi dimensional approach of integrating geochemical and geospatial methods to assess the processes controlling groundwater quality of coimbatore city the study area was dominated by ca and mg type of water which get altered to na type or mixed na ca type over a seasonal change the study reveals that the textile mills have played a major role in altering the water type to na type or mixed na ca type in the central and south eastern regions of the city in addition the high concentration of nickel on the central and south eastern regions is contributed by the discharge of textile mill effluent into the noyyal river which recharge the groundwater table the spatial distribution of nickel and total dissolved solids followed the topography of the city thereby further validating the findings another major process which controls the groundwater chemistry of the region is rock water interaction in which ion exchange was identified to have a dominant role followed by weathering and reverse ion exchange the major drive for the ion exchange process is the presence of na ions which is being supplied by the textile mills causing an exchange for ca ions with na ions this is evident from the spatial distribution map showing the predominance of ion exchange process and the location of textile mills wherein the locations where ion exchange process dominates coincide with the locations textile mills this shows the specific application of the integration of geochemical and geospatial methods in delineating the processes in the aquifer the results highlight that the anthropogenic activities interfere with the natural rock water interaction in the study area carbonate weathering dominates silicate weathering in major parts of the study area the assessment of saturation index for carbonate minerals such as calcite dolomite and aragonite clearly depicts the influence of carbonate weathering the groundwater is super saturated with these carbonate minerals with saturation index greater than 1 while other minerals such as gypsum halite and fluorite are unsaturated thus the study revealed that the aquifer geochemical processes are influenced by the contamination from textile mills further studies are demanded to quantify the transport of nickel through the aquifer so that proper management measures can be adopted to control groundwater contamination and also for maintaining balance in the natural processes in the aquifer declaration of competing interest the authors would like to indicate that there are no conflicts of interest 
12043,rapid industrialization of the city of coimbatore in the recent past has imposed stress on groundwater resources resulting in quantity depletion and quality deterioration the present study aimed at evaluating the groundwater quality of coimbatore city india qualitative analysis of 17 groundwater samples were made during the post monsoon and pre monsoon in 2015 as groundwater forms a dominant source for irrigation and domestic purposes an evaluation of its suitability for these purposes were assessed classic geochemical methods have been coupled with geospatial approaches to arrive at the geochemical processes controlling the hydrochemistry of groundwater the study reveals that the high concentration of nickel and total dissolved solids in the groundwater is caused due to the contamination from textile mill effluent which is discharged into the noyyal river and ultimately join the water table the influence of this contamination is reflected in the geochemical processes wherein the contaminated area exhibits different water type at different seasons ca type water was converted to na type or mixed na ca type during the transition from post monsoon to pre monsoon majority of the samples are influenced by rock water interaction and the dominance of the processes followed the order ion exchange weathering reverse ion exchange the major driving force for ion exchange between ca2 in rock and na in water was the abundance of na in the percolating water which is contributed by textile effluent among the weathering process carbonate weathering dominated silicate weathering due to the presence of limestone deposit and red calcareous soil the quantification of saturation index suggests that carbonate minerals are super saturated in the groundwater in the following order dolomite calcite aragonite while other minerals including fluorite halite and gypsum were unsaturated graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality geochemistry rock water interaction textile sewage nickel coimbatore india 1 introduction in many arid and semi arid regions groundwater is one of the alternate sources mainly for domestic and agricultural activities due to rapid industrialization and rising population stress on the groundwater resource is increasing on quantitative as well as qualitative aspects it is the quality of groundwater which ultimately determines its suitability for various purposes groundwater quality may get deteriorated by natural and anthropogenic factors namely geochemical processes hem 1989 rao et al 2012 precipitation jalali 2007 leaching of domestic agricultural and industrial waste the various geochemical processes which take place between water and aquifer include weathering and dissolution precipitation and crystallization sorption ion exchange and reactions the interaction of both natural processes and human activities determine the water types belkhiri and mouni 2013 the knowledge of the geochemical interactions in the soil rock groundwater system is essential to an adequate assessment of water quality at a regional scale reddy et al 2010 further a thorough understanding of the geochemical process that affect the groundwater quality is necessary to address groundwater related issues subramani et al 2010 the assessment of hydrogeochemical processes requires the knowledge of hydrochemical facies influence of rock water interactions evaporation and precipitation on water chemistry which can be studied using graphical plots such as piper diagram lee et al 2001 hajalilou and khaleghi 2009 sadashivaiah et al 2008 selvakumar et al 2017 and gibbs plot kaur et al 2017 kozłowski and komisarek 2017 sajil kumar et al 2014 the interrelationship between various ions will demonstrate the different rock water interactions occurring in the aquifer geochemical modelling using phreeqc code is being used along with other statistical techniques in the recent years to explore more information on the hydrogeochemical systems belkhiri and mouni 2013 demirel 2004 this multidisciplinary approach is needed to delineate the exact processes occurring in the aquifer system in a semi arid region such as coimbatore tamil nadu a variety of groundwater situations may arise due to the different geochemical processes that occur in the aquifer jebastina and arulraj 2016 proposed that carbonate dissolution silicate weathering ion exchange and leaching of industrial effluents and fertilizers can possibly alter the water chemistry based on multivariate statistical analysis on the groundwater quality of coimbatore district some of the studies related to groundwater quality of coimbatore are concentrated on small sub basins of lakes priya et al 2011 priya and arulraj 2011 selvakumar et al 2017 sundar et al 2015 even though degradation in groundwater quality is reported the causes underlying its degradation have not been identified as numerous textile mills are located in the industrialized city the influence of textile mill effluent on the groundwater quality of the city needs investigation an assessment of the geochemical processes in the aquifer using the above mentioned state of the art techniques is found lacking in literatures as far as the aquifers of coimbatore is concerned this study is therefore aimed at investigating the major hydrogeochemical processes occurring in the aquifer system of coimbatore city tamil nadu the main objective was to identify the different mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry through a systematic study of the geochemical and geospatial techniques the study specifically explored the role of textile mills on the geochemical processes in the aquifer as the groundwater forms the major source for irrigation an evaluation of it suitability for irrigation was carried out 2 study area 2 1 general the coimbatore city the administrative headquarters of coimbatore district is one of the highly industrialized city in south india fig 1 located between 100 55 110 10 n latitude and 76050 77010 e longitude it is surrounded by the western ghats to the north west and have an elevation of ca 430 m above m s l the topography of the city slopes from north towards south and from west towards east fig 2 noyyal river a tributary of cauvery river runs through coimbatore and forms the southern boundary of the city fig 2 the city is known for its textile factories and is often referred to as the mancehster of south india in 1888 the first textile mill started and since then there are over 100 mills in operation moreover there are more than 25 000 small to large scale industries in coimbatore thereby forming a major economy driving force for tamil nadu msme 2013 thus the land use of coimbatore is mainly consisting of built up land except at the banks of noyyal river where most of the land is occupied by agricultural field 2 2 hydrological setting the climate is generally tropical with lowest temperature during november to february 17 c and highest temperature during march to may 39 c the average annual rainfall varies from 550 mm to 900 mm under the influence of north east and south west monsoons the northeast monsoon occurs during october november months which contributes to the major portion of rainfall in the city and summer rains are negligible the period from april to june is generally hot and dry and consists of summer fig 3 represents a typical rainfall histogram for the study area this rainfall is not sufficient to sustain the demand of the city for the entire year and the shortage is partially covered through water supply schemes like siruvani pillor and athikkadavu the remaining demand is being fulfilled by water extracted from the aquifer through dug and bore wells the city is located in the noyyal river basin a sub basin of cauvery river basin the noyyal is a seasonal river having good flow only during the north east and south west monsoon the river emerges in the vellangiri hills of the western ghats and flows over a distance of 180 km in an area of 3510 sq km to join cauvery river at karur district there are 8 major wetlands singanallur velankulam ukkadam periyakulam selvampathy narasampathi krishnampathi selvachinthamani and kumaraswami fed by the noyyal river and are mostly used for irrigation purposes some of the natural drains in the city include sanganur pallam velangurichi singanallur drain railway feeder road side drain trichy singanallur check drain ganapathy drain koilmedu drain and karperayam koil drain 2 3 geological setting geology of coimbatore is mainly characterized by the peninsular gneiss complex and the local rock formation can be classified as a wide range of metamorphic rocks which are extensively weathered and overlain by recent valley fills and alluvium the geological formations found in the district are khondalite calc granulite complex gneiss mainly hornblende biotite and crystalline limestone dolerite charnockite granite gneiss granite and syenite pegmatite and quartzite veins fissured granitic gneiss and massive granitic gneiss form the bed rocks table 1 shows the various components of rocks of the study area coimbatore is the source of many mineral resources namely gypsum feldspar limestone and quartz silica magnesite source department of mines geology coimbatore the four major types of soil in the study area include black cotton soil 9 14 reddish brown brown loamy soil 4 86 alluvium and colluvium 8 91 red calcareous soil 63 83 and red non calcareous soil 13 26 subburaj 2008 the main constituent of soil in the study area is caco3 due to the predominance of red calcareous soil kankar is followed by top soil at certain areas the sand deposit is predominant at the eastern side fig 4 represents the soil in the district 2 4 hydrogeological setting in coimbatore groundwater occurs in all geological formations from the oldest archaen to recent alluvium the geological formation lithological variation tectonic complexity and geomorphological and hydrometerorological dissimilarities existing in the region give rise to a variety of groundwater situations based on the mode of occurrence the hydrogeological framework has been divided into two categories fissured and fractured formation both in gneiss and charnockite formation and porous formation fig 5 the porous formation in the area is represented by alluvium colluvium and laterites the groundwater in the region with colluvium formation occurs under phreatic conditions in the aquifer at depth ranging from 30 to 60 m in alluvium formation consisting mainly of silt and clay groundwater occurs under water table conditions or semi confined and the formations are highly porous permeable and developed into potential water bearing zones the depth to water level depends on the rainfall intensity and is variable over the year the water is produced by the usage of dug wells and bore wells 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and analysis groundwater samples were collected from 17 wells during the post monsoon october 2015 and the pre monsoon april 2015 seasons fig 2 the samples were collected in polyethylene bottles pre cleaned with de ionized water the bottles were rinsed using the groundwater samples before collection for determining each parameter of each sample three replicates were carried out the parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and temperature were measured in situ using a portable water quality analyser systronics water analyser 371 after proper calibration the collected samples were transferred to the laboratory and were analysed for the major cations such as ca2 mg2 na k and major anions such as cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 and for total hardness as per apha 1998 standard methods the ca2 and mg2 were analysed using titrimetric methods using standard edta na and k were determined using flame photometer cl was analysed by argentometric method by titration with agno3 hco3 and co3 2 were determined by acid titration and so4 2 by spectrophotometry fluoride concentration was found using spectrophotometer using spands reagent for the analysis of heavy metals the samples were collected in bottles pre cleaned by soaking in detergent followed by soaking in 10 nitric acid for 48 h and finally rinsed with deionized water the samples were filtered and acid stabilized soon after collection metal ion concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometer model 3110 using air acetylene flame quantification of metals was based upon calibration curves of standard solution of respective metals the detection limits for fe mn cu ni cr pb cd and zn are 0 003 0 001 0 004 0 002 0 01 0 0005 0 0008 and 0 004 mg l respectively the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes was assessed using salinity hazard alkalinity hazard sodium permeability index magnesium ratio and kelly ratio hydrochemical classification was done using piper diagram and the various hydrogeochemical facies existing in the study area were identified hydrochemical evolution of groundwater was delineated using gibbs diagram and the influence of rock water interaction evaporation and precipitation on the groundwater chemistry was studied the mutual relationships existing between the major cations and anions were investigated through ca2 mg2 ratio ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 ratio na k total cations ratio ca2 mg2 vs ec plot na cl vs ec plot and chloroalkaline indices and the analysis lead to the identification of the processes controlling the groundwater chemistry further geochemical modelling was attempted using the geochemical code phreeqc to analyse the degree of equilibrium between water and minerals in the aquifer 4 results and discussion 4 1 general chemistry the summary of statistics of qualitative parameters of groundwater samples during the post monsoon and pre monsoon is presented in table 2 the groundwater was slightly alkaline in nature with the ph varying between 7 1 and 7 6 during the post monsoon and between 7 and 7 8 during the pre monsoon a wide spatial and temporal variation in electrical conductivity ec was observed in the study area the range of ec was between 532 and 6240 μs cm and between 300 and 8360 μs cm during the post monsoon and pre monsoon respectively and the corresponding variations of tds was 340 3934 mg l and 192 5451 mg l 82 of the samples are classified as brackish total dissolved solids tds of 1000 10 000 mg l with the remaining samples falling under freshwater category 250 1000 mg l as per the classification proposed by todd 1980 88 of the samples fall under very hard category 300 mg l based on the classification system proposed by sawyer and mccartly 1967 with the total hardness ranging between 279 1425 mg l during the post monsoon and between 230 and 3400 mg l during the pre monsoon the results show that the groundwater is highly mineralized in the study area the dominance of major cations in the groundwater samples followed the order ca2 na mg2 k meq l while the major anions followed the order cl hco3 co3 2 so4 2 meq l during both the seasons the ion balance errors of all the samples during both the seasons were within 5 the concentration of ca2 ranged between 30 and 451 mg l during the post monsoon and between 135 and 318 mg l during the pre monsoon while the range of mg2 was 22 243 mg l and 12 160 mg l during the post monsoon and pre monsoon respectively these ions may be derived from calcium and magnesium bearing rocks namely charnokite granite and gneiss the concentration of na and k ranged respectively from 32 to 380 mg l and from 4 to 87 mg l during the post monsoon and from 95 to 823 mg l and 6 182 mg l during the pre monsoon a higher concentration of ca2 ions among the cations may be attributed to rock weathering or dissolution of soil minerals another cause of dominance of alkali earth elements over alkali elements may be the ion exchange process between rock and water the variation of cl was between 28 1614 mg l during the post monsoon and between 44 1500 mg l during the pre monsoon weathering and dissolution of salt deposits percolation from agricultural fields and discharge from industrial wastewater are some of the common causes of higher chloride content in groundwater jeevanandam et al 2012 higher carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations leading to alkalinity of water was observed in the study area with their concentration varying between 146 561 mg l during the post monsoon and between 336 600 mg l during the pre monsoon they are probably derived from the weathering of limestone dissolution of carbonate precipitates atmospheric and soil carbon di oxide jeong 2001 the least dominant anion in the groundwater was sulphates and it ranged between 25 and 880 mg l during the post monsoon and between 14 and 166 mg l during the pre monsoon contamination from industrial and domestic sewage are likely to cause an increase in the concentration of sulphates baruah et al 2008 at some locations a marginally higher concentration of fluorides was observed for 35 and 18 of the samples with its value peaking to 1 8 and 1 28 mg l during the post monsoon and pre monsoon respectively biotite hornblende lepidolite and mica are the major components of rocks contributing to fluorides in groundwater some of the major factors that affect the dissolution of fluoride from rocks in groundwater include ph temperature anion exchange capacity residence time depth age of groundwater concentration of carbonates and bicarbonates apambire et al 1997 over 24 of the samples exhibited a fe concentration greater than bis drinking water standards of 300 μg l with its values ranging between 90 570 μg l during the post monsoon and 8 455 μg l during the pre monsoon biotite and hornblende are the major sources of fe in the study area and it is expected that conditions favorable for the reduction of ferric ion into ferrous ion exists in the location it was observed that all the samples exhibited low concentration of mn zn and cu during both the seasons and were well below the bis drinking water standards of 100 μg l 5000 μg l and 50 μg l respectively cd was below the detection limits in all the samples hence not given in table 2 except 12 of the samples during the post monsoon and 1 during the pre monsoon cr concentration in all the samples were within bis drinking water standards of 50 μg l nevertheless all the samples had ni concentrations exceeding the bis standards of 20 μg l during both the seasons the health effects due to exposure to nickel include nausea headache vomiting skin irritation hypersensitivity and carcinogenicity nickel is extensively used in textile mills where they use nickel phthalocyanines bright green dyes during the dyeing process a number of textile mills are located in the study area as can be seen from fig 2 the wastewater from the textile mills are discharged into the noyyal river which ultimately reaches the groundwater table the mobility of nickel is enhanced by the presence of fe and mn oxides in the aquifer while biotite and hornblende contribute to fe mn may be contributed by khondalite it was observed that there was a good correlation of fe and mn with ni during the post monsoon table 3 this suggests that when the groundwater flow is appreciable ni is highly mobilized in the aquifer causing a wide spread distribution even though the dilution effect of rain plays a role to reduce the concentration fig 6 during the pre monsoon the concentration of ni is marginally high because of the absence of dilution effect and this leads to the distribution of ni on the central and south eastern regions fig 6 salt is extensively used during the dyeing process there was a consistent positive correlation of ni with ec and tds table 4 during both the seasons further the spatial variation of ni fig 6 and tds fig 7 show that both ni and tds have higher concentration at same spatial areas thereby depicting that ni and tds are arrived from the same source also referring the location of textile mills fig 2 it is certain that textile mills can be the possible source of contamination of groundwater in the central and south eastern regions it is interesting to note that the distribution of ni resembles the topography of coimbatore fig 2 suggesting that the tributary of noyyal river see fig 2 which carries the wastewater recharges the groundwater and therefore spatial distribution of ni follows that of the flow pattern in the aquifer ie from north western to south eastern direction thus textile mills can be considered as the possible contributors of nickel in the groundwater of coimbatore around 41 of the samples during post monsoon exhibited pb concentrations exceeding bis standards 10 μg l the maximum reported concentration being 70 μg l on the other hand the concentration of pb during the pre monsoon was well within the permissible limit in all the samples pb is primarily used in the production of lead acid batteries solder and alloys the various effects due to exposure to lead include neuro developmental effects mortality due to cardio vascular diseases impaired renal function hypertension and impaired fertility who 2017 correlation analysis reveals that pb is having high positive correlation with fe thereby suggesting the association of pb with fe table 3 pb is likely mobilized in groundwater through adsorptive retardation by iron oxy hydroxides further the high correlation of pb with cr indicates that both are originated from the same source they are possibly transported by percolation through the precipitation during the post monsoon during the pre monsoon ion exchange of pb with ca of calcite may have probably lead to the reduction of pb in groundwater thereby increasing the concentration of ca in groundwater as evidenced by the higher concentration of ca in the samples during pre monsoon 4 2 hydrogeochemical classification 4 2 1 classification of water for irrigation groundwater is the major source of water for irrigation accounting for 92 of the total irrigated area in coimbatore district being the dominant source of water for irrigation an analysis of the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes was carried out the major parameters that are important for irrigation water include salinity hazard electrical conductivity alkalinity hazard sodium absorption ratio sar percentage sodium na permeability index pi magnesium ratio mr and kelly ratio ki table 5 gives the different classification systems generally adopted for classifying irrigation water and the of samples falling under in each category from the study area sar is the ratio between na and ca2 mg2 ions and is a measure of alkali sodium hazard to crops subramani et al 2010 higher amounts of na relative to ca2 and mg2 ions can cause dispersion of soil colloids thereby destroying soil texture and permeability kumar et al 2007 the us salinity laboratory classification system classify irrigation water into 4 categories based on sar and ec excellent sar 10 ec 250 μs cm good sar 10 18 ec 250 750 μs cm satisfactory sar 18 26 ec 750 2250 μs cm bad sar 26 ec 2250 μs cm richards 1954 the salinity hazard and alkalinity hazard of groundwater samples can be best represented by wilcox diagram wilcox 1955 as per the classification 12 of the samples fall under s3c4 category 37 of the samples under s2c4 category and the remaining samples can be categorized as s1c3 and s1c2 fig 8 sodium interacts with soil and reduces its permeability parthasarathy et al 2012 through adsorption on to clay particles followed by ion exchange with ca2 and mg2 ions from the soil as a result internal drainage is lowered leading to reduced circulation of air and water and ultimately the soil becomes hard saleh et al 1999 wilcox 1955 put forward a method for classifying irrigation water based on sodium percentage accordingly 12 of the samples fall under excellent category with a na 20 and the remaining under good and permissible category during the post monsoon while 23 of the samples had a na 60 during the pre monsoon showing that the water samples are not satisfactory for irrigation table 5 a criteria for assessing the irrigation water was proposed by doneen 1964 on the basis of the influence of na ca2 mg2 and hco3 on the permeability of soil according to him the permeability index is the ratio of na hco3 to ca2 mg2 na a permeability index of 75 is classified as class i and between 25 and 75 as class ii and are suitable for irrigation while if the index is 25 the water is unsuitable for irrigation all the samples from the study area fall either under class i or class ii thereby indicating their suitability for irrigation considering the ratio of na to ca2 mg2 which is defined as kelly ratio kelley 1951 all the samples exhibited a value 1 and are suitable for irrigation during the post monsoon 35 of the samples were found to be unsuitable for irrigation during the pre monsoon in natural waters ca2 and mg2 ions will be in equilibrium hem 1989 however some of the processes such as ion exchange and rock water interaction may disrupt the equilibrium leading to high mg2 ions in water which can have adverse effects on the yield of crop when used for irrigation kumar et al 2007 the mg ratio is calculated as the ratio of mg2 to the sum of ca2 and mg2 paliwal 1972 a mg ratio of 50 is considered as suitable for irrigation and comprises of 41 and 82 of the samples during post monsoon and pre monsoon respectively 4 2 2 hydrochemical facies the groundwater chemistry is governed by geochemical reactions occurring in the aquifer or by the intrusion followed by contamination from neighbourhood areas the various geochemical compositions arising from these processes can be identified by analyzing the hydrogeochemical facies of groundwater using piper diagram piper 1944 the diagram consists of two triangular and a central diamond shaped field and from the position of the water sample in the field the water type can be identified fig 9 the diagram reveals that alkaline earths ca2 mg2 exceed alkalies na k and strong acids cl so4 2 exceed weak acids hco3 co3 2 during both the seasons for majority of the samples however for a small group of samples the phenomenon was reversed during the transition from post monsoon to pre monsoon 57 of the samples fall under mixed ca mg cl type while 35 fall under ca mg hco3 type during the post monsoon some of the samples which exhibited ca type were converted to na type or mixed ca na type during the transition from post monsoon to pre monsoon and that accounted for 29 of the samples the samples on the central part exhibited this transition fig 10 this has occurred mainly at locations of textile mills fig 2 it is suspected that the textile mills are a main contributor to the water type in the central regions the chemicals used by the textile mills during the scouring caustic soda soda ash mercerizing caustic soda bleaching sodium hypochlorite and dyeing process are released into the noyyal river and subsequently reach the groundwater table it can be noted that na ions are the major cations in all these chemicals used during post monsoon the rainwater dilute the concentration of textile wastewater in the river thereby reducing the concentration of na ions and thus the ca2 ions dominate na ions resulting in the ca type of water nevertheless during the pre monsoon in the absence of rainfall there will be higher degree of concentration of na in the river thereby increasing the levels of na ions in comparison with ca2 ions thus textile mills contribute to the water type of the central and south eastern regions of the study area wherein ca type during post monsoon was converted to na type or mixed ca na type during the pre monsoon thus the contamination from textile mills has caused a seasonal variability in the aquifer characteristics especially the water type 4 3 hydrochemical evolution in order to further delineate the processes controlling groundwater chemistry gibbs diagram proposed by gibbs 1970 was plotted it is used to interpret the influence of rock water interaction evaporation and precipitation on the groundwater chemistry the gibbs ratios are plotted against tds concentrations as shown in fig 11 the cation ratio varied from 0 06 to 0 76 and the anion ratio between 0 16 and 0 85 most of the samples fall under rock water interaction and evaporation crystallization dominant zone the rock water interactions that affect the groundwater chemistry include chemical weathering of rocks dissolution precipitation of secondary carbonates and ion exchange between water and clay minerals the samples falling under evaporation zone exhibit higher cl ions and consequently higher tds concentrations as the phenomenon of evaporation is not much predominant in the deep aquifers as in the study area the high tds may be attributed to contamination from anthropogenic activities especially from textile mills as described earlier hence evaporation may not have much influence on the groundwater chemistry 4 4 hydrochemical relations an analysis of the relationship among major ions is essential for understanding the natural rock water interaction process taking place in the aquifer the dominant cations in most of the samples include ca2 and mg2 calcite and aragonite are the predominant rocks rick in ca2 while the presence of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater may be due to weathering of dolomite the weathering of dolomite rocks will be predominant at locations with a ca2 mg2 molar ratio 1 mayo and loucks 1995 while a ca2 mg2 ratio between 1 and 2 represents calcite weathering and a greater ca2 mg2 ratio indicate silicate weathering katz et al 1997 65 of the samples exhibited a ca2 mg2 ratio 1 18 between 1 and 2 and 17 had ratios 2 during the post monsoon while 17 of the samples showed a ratio 1 29 between 1 and 2 and over 53 of the samples have ca2 mg2 ratio 2 the dissolution of rocks is driven by the presence of co2 in the aquifer which is liberated during the degradation of organic matter present in the soil the fundamental process to weathering includes h 2 o c o 2 h 2 c o 3 carbonate rocks limestone rocks such as calcite aragonite and dolomite undergo dissolution under natural conditions as given below calcite and aragonite c a c o 3 h 2 c o 3 c a 2 2 h c o 3 c a c o 3 h

feldspar of granite rocks it may undergo hydrolysis and get altered to clay minerals releasing ca2 as depicted below c a a l 2 s i 2 o 8 2 h 2 c o 3 1 2 o 2 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 c a 2 2 c o 3 2 a higher ca2 mg2 ratio was exhibited in the north western regions fig 12 where the water was of ca mg hco3 type the results suggest that carbonate weathering predominate in those regions of the study area the huge deposits of limestone may be the source for carbonate weathering in addition the red calcareous soil may also contribute to carbonate leading to the release of ca2 ions to water the dominance of carbonate weathering is suspected when ca2 mg2 dominate hco3 and so4 2 resulting in an increase in ca2 and mg2 in groundwater elango and kannan 2007 the plot between ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 will be near 1 1 equiline if ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 are derived from calcite aragonite dolomite and gypsum the average ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 was greater than 1 1 7 with the ratios ranging between 0 6 and 2 3 fig 13 a 23 of the samples were clustered near 1 1 equiline indicating that the dissolution of calcite dolomite and aragonite lead to higher ca2 mg2 in groundwater majority of the samples are shifted to the left of the equiline and have an excess of ca2 mg2 and may be dominated by ion exchange process wherein na in water is exchanged for ca2 from clay which is seen in alluvium formations as indicated below c a c l a y 2 2 n a 2 n a c l a y c a 2 the na in water is possibly contributed by the textile mill effluents where salt and caustic soda are used for dyeing scouring bleaching and mercerizing process and are generally discharged without proper treatment this suggest that the contamination from textile mills through the release of na into the aquifer enhances the ion exchange process thereby leading to an increase in the concentration of ca ions in the aquifer 17 of the samples fall below the 1 1 equiline during the post monsoon and are shifted to the right of the 1 1 equiline have an excess of so4 2 hco3 which can be attributed to reverse ion exchange process as shown below 2 n a c l a y c a 2 c a c l a y 2 2 n a in addition to carbonate weathering weathering of silicates can play a major role in controlling the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater garrels and mackenzie 1967 the ratio between na k and total cations is generally considered for identifying the process of silicate weathering sarin et al 1989 majority of the samples fall above 1 2 line while a few samples fall close to or below 1 2 line fig 13 b thereby indicating the importance of silicate weathering only at those regions a constant increase in salinity with na cl ratio is an indicator that evaporation is a dominant process there was a positive correlation between ca2 mg2 and cl fig 13 c and a negative correlation between na cl and ec fig 13 d this indicates that evaporation has no role in the hydrochemistry different values of na cl for an increasing ec suggest that exchange reactions and silicate weathering dominate over evaporation majority of the samples exhibited a decreasing na cl ratio with increasing salinity which may be attributed to removal of na from groundwater due to ion exchange process rajmohan and elango 2004 further na cl ratio equal to or greater than 1 suggests silicate weathering wherein feldspar minerals under acidic conditions hydrolyze as follows n a a l s i 3 o 8 4 h 2 o 4 h n a a l 3 3 s i o h 4 a l 3 s i o h 4 1 2 h 2 o 3 h 1 2 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 overall n a a l s i 3 o 8 4 1 2 h 2 o h n a 2 s i o h 4 1 2 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 the influence of ion exchange process on the groundwater chemistry can be assessed from two chloro alkaline indices namely cai 1 and cai 2 suggested by schoeller 1967 the indices were obtained using the following equations c a i 1 c l n a k c l c a i 2 c l n a k s o 4 h c o 3 c o 3 if both the indices are positive there is exchange of na or k from water with ca2 or mg2 from rocks and vice versa schoeller 1967 majority of the samples exhibited a positive value of cai 1 cai 2 fig 13 e indicating that the exchange of na or k from water occurs with ca2 and mg2 from rocks this is in agreement with the results obtained from ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 plot for the remaining samples with negative cai values it is suspected that reverse ion exchange or weathering dominate over ion exchange process during reverse ion exchange when the replacement of ca2 mg2 ions by na ions in solution takes place the removal of ca2 causes a change in ph because of the change in equilibrium of the reaction c a c o 3 c o 2 h 2 o c a 2 2 h c o 3 the reaction is driven further to the right increasing the bicarbonate level and reduces the ph this is depicted as shown in fig 13 f wherein ph increases as the ca2 concentration drops the overall processes occurring in the aquifer of coimbatore city can thus be depicted as shown in fig 14 the ion exchange process is dominant in the south western and central regions and major driving force for the process in this region is contamination from textile mill effluent contributing to na ions 4 5 geochemical modelling the degree of equilibrium between water and minerals in the aquifer which affects their dissolution and precipitation can best be represented by saturation index si it can well predict the thermodynamic control on the composition of water which has equilibrated with the minerals in the aquifer saturation index was obtained using the geochemical code phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 si was calculated using the following expression s i log i a p k where iap is the ion activity product and k is the solubility product constant when si 0 equilibrium exists between groundwater and minerals while minerals tend to precipitate when they are saturated or super saturated and in such cases si is positive thus negative si values indicate that water is under saturated with the minerals and suggests the possibilities of mineral dissolution the saturation index of the groundwater samples was estimated using phreeqc package in which the chemical parameters of the groundwater samples form the input variables the code was run to obtain the si of all the possible minerals considering the major cations and anions in the groundwater of the study area minerals such as calcite dolomite aragonite were expected to dominate other minerals the analysis of si in the study area indicates that majority of the carbonate minerals are saturated in the aquifer fig 15 and are incapable of dissolving more minerals of the carbonate minerals super saturation followed the order dolomite calcite aragonite the influencing factors of super saturation of carbonate minerals include differential weathering of carbonate rocks and dissolution of silicate minerals common ion effect jabal et al 2015 this validates the previous observations that carbonate weathering dominates a major part of the study area where limestone formation is available the other minerals including fluorite gypsum halite and anhydride were under saturated in all the samples thereby indicating that the ions such as na cl ca2 and so4 2 were not limited by mineral equilibrium belkhiri and mouni 2013 5 conclusions the study applied a multi dimensional approach of integrating geochemical and geospatial methods to assess the processes controlling groundwater quality of coimbatore city the study area was dominated by ca and mg type of water which get altered to na type or mixed na ca type over a seasonal change the study reveals that the textile mills have played a major role in altering the water type to na type or mixed na ca type in the central and south eastern regions of the city in addition the high concentration of nickel on the central and south eastern regions is contributed by the discharge of textile mill effluent into the noyyal river which recharge the groundwater table the spatial distribution of nickel and total dissolved solids followed the topography of the city thereby further validating the findings another major process which controls the groundwater chemistry of the region is rock water interaction in which ion exchange was identified to have a dominant role followed by weathering and reverse ion exchange the major drive for the ion exchange process is the presence of na ions which is being supplied by the textile mills causing an exchange for ca ions with na ions this is evident from the spatial distribution map showing the predominance of ion exchange process and the location of textile mills wherein the locations where ion exchange process dominates coincide with the locations textile mills this shows the specific application of the integration of geochemical and geospatial methods in delineating the processes in the aquifer the results highlight that the anthropogenic activities interfere with the natural rock water interaction in the study area carbonate weathering dominates silicate weathering in major parts of the study area the assessment of saturation index for carbonate minerals such as calcite dolomite and aragonite clearly depicts the influence of carbonate weathering the groundwater is super saturated with these carbonate minerals with saturation index greater than 1 while other minerals such as gypsum halite and fluorite are unsaturated thus the study revealed that the aquifer geochemical processes are influenced by the contamination from textile mills further studies are demanded to quantify the transport of nickel through the aquifer so that proper management measures can be adopted to control groundwater contamination and also for maintaining balance in the natural processes in the aquifer declaration of competing interest the authors would like to indicate that there are no conflicts of interest

g was used to increase adsorption properties of the photocatalyst the scanning electron microscope is illustrated in fig 2 the physical and chemical properties of the photocatalyst are summarized in table 1 2 1 1 photoreactor and light source the experimental studies were performed in a cylindrical batch reactor opened with a capacity ½ l which presents two lateral openings one for bubbling oxygen and the other for sampling whose dimensions are 8 cm in diameter and 12 cm in height fig 3 the luminous source is composed of a hpk philips uv lamp 125 w the wavelength maximum of the light source was 365 5 nm placed in axial position inside the water jacket cooled by a continuous flow of water 2 2 procedure and analysis in the photoreactor we introduced a photocatalyst sheet 11 cm 25 cm equivalent to 1 g of tio2 with the addition of 500 ml of dr80 aqueous solution the mixture is maintained under continuous stirring 500 rpm by means of a magnetic stirrer in the dark for 45 min this time is sufficient to reach the adsorption equilibrium then we expose the reaction mixture to uv radiation the samples taken are filtered on a millipore membrane of type 0 45 μm ha and analysed by uv

results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic degradation of direct red 80 3 1 1 photocatalytic nature of the reaction in order to study the photocatalytic degradation of dr80 some experiments were made in different conditions i in the absence of catalyst neat photohemical regime ii in the presence of catalyst dark condition and iii in the presence of catalyst and under uv light fig 4 the initial concentrations of tio2 and dr80 were 1 g and 30 mg l 1 respectively at ph 5 8 a negligible disappearance of dr80 was observed during irradiation in the absence of tio2 or in the presence of tio2 without light source in contrast in the simultaneous presence of tio2 and uv light a complete disappearance of dr80 was observed after 90 min of irradiation this confirms the photocatalytic nature of the reaction 3 1 2 uv vis spectra fig 5 shows the changes in the dr80 optical densities under different irradiation times the spectra present three main maxima one at 527 nm one at 285 nm and the other one at 235 nm the one at 527 nm being responsible of the colour of the dye the complete decolorization is achieved at 60 min of irradiation time while the degradation of intermediates continues up to more than 90 min the fast decolorization of dye is due to the initial electrophilic cleavage of its chromophoric azo nn bonds bouzaida et al 2012 alahiane et al 2020 the degradation of aromatic part of the dye molecule produced number of intermediate compounds and the removal of these intermediates took longer time 3 1 3 dye initial concentration effect the effect of dye initial concentration on the efficiency of dye degradation was investigated with concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 mg l 1 fig 6 it was found that when the dye concentration increases the degradation time of dye increases too hence the photodegradation process will work faster at a low concentration of pollutants these results are in excellent agreement with previous reports qourzal et al 2012 jo and tayade 2016 chennah et al 2018a at high concentrations of dye the deeper coloured solution becomes compact and forms a screen rendering the solution less transparent to uv light and the dye molecules may absorb a significant quantity of uv light causing less light to reach the photocatalyst and thus decreasing the formation of ho radicals hence at low concentrations of the coloured solution the opposite effect is observed because the solution becomes easily to cross by the uv light increasing the number of irradiation absorbed by the photocatalyst and hence its activity natarajan et al 2011a 2011b jo and tayade 2016 the effect of the initial dye concentration on the initial rate of photocatalytic degradation is illustrated in fig 7 a v0 grows rapidly at low concentrations and tends towards a limit value about 0 8 mg l min this value certainly corresponds to the saturation of tio2 surface the shape of the curve obtained is similar to that of langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model ahmad and mondal 2012 this is confirmed by the plots of 1 v0 versus 1 co which gives a straight line of slope 1 k k and the intercept 1 k fig 7 b the kinetic constants of equilibrium table 2 are calculated from the plot of fig 7 b the tio2 photocatalytic degradation of many organic molecules follows first order kinetics ahmad and mondal 2012 du et al 2013 el saliby et al 2013 usually described through the langmuir hinshelwood model at low initial dye concentration the simplified kinetic model can be described by eq 1 li et al 2015a 2015b 1 ln c c 0 k app t where c and c0 mg l 1 are the concentration at time t and initial time kapp min 1 is the apparent rate constant and t min is the time of irradiation the half lives can be calculated by the equation 2 t 1 2 ln 2 k app in order to evaluate the kinetics of the dye decolorization in the presence of the catalyst the rate constants were calculated by the slope of the line obtained by presentation of the evolution of ln c c0 versus irradiation time at different initial concentrations the linear regression appears to fit well table 3 and consequently dr80 oxidation follows first order kinetic law in order to evaluate the decolorization kinetics of dr80 dye in presence of the catalyst the rate constants were calculated by using the graph ln c c0 versus irradiation time at different initial concentrations the linear regression showed a good fit table 3 and involving a pseudo first order kinetic for dr80 oxidation 3 1 4 effect of solution ph the ph is an important factor controlling the photocatalytic reactions which take place on the particles surfaces of photocatalyst it is well known that ph affects the degradation kinetics of certain organic compounds in photocatalytic processes alahiane et al 2013 sennaoui et al 2018a zangeneh et al 2020 therefore we studied the degradation of dr80 at different ph values 3 5 8 7 8 and 10 the evolution of the apparent constants kapp versus ph is shown in fig 8 the experimental results show that the degradation of dr80 is better in acidic conditions the maximum discoloration was observed at ph 3 this can be explained by the electrostatic forces between the positive charge at the surface of catalyst and the anionic groups of the dye fig 9 a similar behavior has been reported for the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 for the discoloration of azo dyes barka et al 2010 gupta et al 2012 alahiane et al 2017 at high ph values electrostatic repulsion between the negative charge at the tio2 surface and hydroxide anions prevent the formation of ho at the surface resulting in a decrease of the photodegradation activity gupta et al 2012 rauf and ashraf 2009 3 1 5 effect of inorganic ions the salt effect on the photodegradation of organic pollutants was frequently investigated due to the possibility of the adsorption of inorganic anions onto the catalyst surface this adsorption results in decreasing of number of the holes and ho radicals and reaction rate decrease djokić et al 2012 they are generally present in the real industrial wastewaters with values depending on the nature of the effluent in order to evaluate the importance effect of some anions so4 2 cl no3 ch3coo hco3 et hpo4 2 sodium salts we have studied their effect on the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation by adding an amount 10 3 mol l 1 of each ions fig 10 for hpo4 2 ions it s well known that they strongly adsorb on the tio2 surface and therefore come into competition with the adsorption of dr80 at the photocatalyst surface they can also trap ho to form the corresponding anionic radicals hpo4 which leads to decreasing of photodegradation effectivity barka et al 2008a 3 hpo4 2 ho hpo4 h2o the inhibitory effect of hco3 ions have been formerly attributed to adsorption competition with the dye on the tio2 surface on the other hand it s well known that the bicarbonate and carbonate ions are usually assumed to reduce photocatalysis efficiency by scavenging ho according to following reactions ji et al 2013 4 hco3 ho co3 h2o 5 co3 2 ho co3 ho these anions can also block the active sites on the tio2 surface and deactivate the catalyst toward dr80 and intermediates the generated carbonate radical anion is a weaker oxidizing agent than ho radical and reaction rates for many organic substrates with co3 are several orders of magnitude slower than reactions with ho hu et al 2007 behnajady et al 2006 chloride anions along with sectional wastes are generally present in the effluent of the textile industry the increase in the photocatalytic degradation rate of dr80 in the presence of cl ions could be explained by the result of the reaction of radical ho with cl eq 6 barka et al 2008b 6 ho cl cl oh cl radicals can be also oxidizing pollutants and participating in the photodegradation process kiwi et al 2000 concerning the no3 ions some authors have reported that they can increase the photodegradation rate alahiane et al 2014 zhu et al 2009 it has been shown that no3 ions are weakly adsorbed on the tio2 surface and therefore they have little effect on the photodegradation of dr80 this result is similar with those observed by barka et al 2008a and alahiane et al 2013 the inhibition of the photocatalytic reaction of dr80 in the presence of ch3coo which is used to reduce the alkalinity of the textile effluents could be explained by the photo kolbe reaction eq 12 stylidi et al 2003 which reduces the formation of ho radicals via eqs 8 and 9 on the tio2 surface 7 ch3coo h ch3 co2 8 h h2o ho h 9 h oh ho finally the so4 2 ions are adsorbed on the tio2 surface and are consequently reacted with the positive holes hvb and hydroxyl radical ho hu et al 2003 10 hvb so4 2 so4 11 ho so4 2 so4 ho since so4 is a strong oxidant by removing the electron from neutral molecule like water and generates ho radical that can enhance the photocatalytic reaction rate the sulfate radical can accelerate the reaction and participate in the degradation process according to the following reactions kositzi et al 2004 12 so4 h2o so4 2 ho h 13 so4 dr80 so4 2 int1 14 so4 int1 so4 2 co2 where int1 symbolises the first reaction intermediates partially transformed until the total mineralization 3 1 6 effect of temperature since the temperature variation could affect the photocatalytic reaction rate the effect of temperature on the degradation reaction of dye was monitored by raising reaction temperature the reaction was done at 295 301 308 and 317 k table 4 lists the apparent rate constant kapp of dr80 with increasing temperature these results show that efficiency of degradation increases slightly with increasing temperature the temperature variation is not rate determining step in the photocatalysed reactions

the planck constant kapp min 1 is the apparent rate constant δh j mol is the activation enthalpy and δs j k mol is the activation entropy according to the equation of the straight line we deduce the values of δh 8 218 kj mol and δs 193 008 j k mol the large negative value of δs suggest decreased randomness at the solid solution interface and no significant changes occur in the internal structure of the adsorbent through the adsorption of dr80 onto tio2 particles 3 2 mineralization of dr80 in order to verify the capacity of the heterogeneous photocatalysis to mineralize a synthetic dye and to have information on the oxidation state of the target compound and its degree of mineralization we have followed the kinetics of mineralization of the dye by the measurement of the cod chemical oxygen demand fig 13 during the treatment by this process of a solution initially containing a dye the cod removal increased rapidly during the reaction time but in a manner more slowly than the decolorization of solutions at 100 of the decolorization the cod abatement rate after 7 h of irradiation is 88 64 which proves the formation of intermediate products radjenovic et al 2009 after the decolorization of the solution the cod decreased sharply reaching a plateau that corresponds to the oxidation of most stable compounds indi cating that almost complete mineralization of intermediates has occurred giwa et al 2012 table 5 summarizes the theoretical cod value that we have calculated by pursuing a chemical reaction process ayral et al 2010 and the experimental cod value of the initial concentration of the dr80 dye from the results mentioned in the table above it appears that the cod value calculated theoretically is close to that obtained experimentally 3 3 suggested mechanism based on the degradation products identified by the hplc and identified by comparison with commercial standards and according to the literature giwa et al 2012 gutowska et al 2007 zhao et al 2010 natarajan et al 2011b ma et al 2011 a simplified degradation mechanism of the dye in aqueous solution during the treatment by heterogeneous photocatalysis is proposed the uv vis spectra of dye initial solution fig 14 represents a wide band in the visible region at 527 nm which characterizes the chromophore linked to the benzene and naphthalene rings the conjugation of this chromophore with the double bonds of the naphthalene ring is more important than the one with the double bonds of benzene this results in a wavelength of absorption of naphthalene 285 nm higher than the one of benzene ring 235 nm the dramatic change in uv visible spectra in a first time of degradation of dr80 represents the reduction of azo bonds ar n n àr which is being transformed into hydroxyl structure and further oxidation leads to bursting of n n bond and the formation of nitro groups and the production of mono or multi substituted benzene and naphthalene compounds gutowska et al 2007 additional oxidation gives rise to the opening of an aromatic ring to the formation of carboxylic acids alcohols aldehydes formic acids hydrocarbon gutowska et al 2007 natarajan et al 2011b zhao et al 2010 ma et al 2011 finally the mineralization of dye leads to the production of carbon dioxide water and inorganic compounds 4 conclusion the photocatalytic degradation of dr80 has been performed with immobilised tio2 proved that the reaction obeys to an expression of pseudo first order the results confirm that the system is working in a pure photocatalytic regime the experimental results indicate that the rate of degradation of dr80 was affected by initial dye concentration ph and the presence of salts the photodegradation of dr80 can be modeled by using langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model the cod abatement is higher the value obtained is 89 after 7 h this shows that this technique is effective for reducing the pollutant load in wastewater declaration of interests the authors declare that

sennaoui et al 2018b chennah et al 2018b 2019 alahiane et al 2020 among the new oxidation methods heterogeneous photocatalysis appears as a destructive technology leading to the total mineralization of many organic pollutants khataee et al 2011 qourzal et al 2012 tio2 has been considered as an ideal photocatalyst due to many factors such as availability high photocatalytic activity non toxicity low cost and chemical stability tseng et al 2010 however problems with the use of tio2 powder is also well recognized specifically 1 the difficulty in filtering it from the solution after reaction is complete 2 aggregation of particles in suspension especially at high loadings and 3 difficulty in application to continuous flow systems leary and westwood 2011 which prevents the recovery and the reuse of the catalyst sriwong et al 2012 this form of photocatalyst may contribute to serious health problems habibi et al 2007 to avoid this problem several works have focused their research on the means of immobilization tio2 as thin films filed on various substrates paper or glass natarajan et al 2011a 2011b sriwong et al 2012 wang et al 2012 el kalliny et al 2014 jo and tayade 2016 the aim of

photocatalyst used in this work is a commercial titania photocatalyst from ahlstrom firm france ref 1048 it s about the titanium dioxide pc500 as millennium inorganic chemicals brand supported on a non woven natural and synthetic fibers using an inorganic binder the binder was an aqueous dispersion of colloidal sio2 ep1069950b1 european patent a specific surface area extender zeolite uop 2000 m2 g was used to increase adsorption properties of the photocatalyst the scanning electron microscope is illustrated in fig 2 the physical and chemical properties of the photocatalyst are summarized in table 1 2 1 1 photoreactor and light source the experimental studies were performed in a cylindrical batch reactor opened with a capacity ½ l which presents two lateral openings one for bubbling oxygen and the other for sampling whose dimensions are 8 cm in diameter and 12 cm in height fig 3 the luminous source is composed of a hpk philips uv lamp 125 w the wavelength maximum of the light source was 365 5 nm placed in axial position inside the water jacket cooled by a continuous flow of water 2 2 procedure and analysis in the photoreactor we introduced a photocatalyst sheet 11 cm 25 cm equivalent to 1 g of tio2 with the addition of 500 ml of dr80 aqueous solution the mixture is maintained under continuous stirring 500 rpm by means of a magnetic stirrer in the dark for 45 min this time is sufficient to reach the adsorption equilibrium then we expose the reaction mixture to uv radiation the samples taken are filtered on a millipore membrane of type 0 45 μm ha and analysed by uv vis spectrophotometer jasco v 630 the wavelength of maximum absorption λ max is 527 nm the organic intermediates were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu model lc spd20a

results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic degradation of direct red 80 3 1 1 photocatalytic nature of the reaction in order to study the photocatalytic degradation of dr80 some experiments were made in different conditions i in the absence of catalyst neat photohemical regime ii in the presence of catalyst dark condition and iii in the presence of catalyst and under uv light fig 4 the initial concentrations of tio2 and dr80 were 1 g and 30 mg l 1 respectively at ph 5 8 a negligible disappearance of dr80 was observed during irradiation in the absence of tio2 or in the presence of tio2 without light source in contrast in the simultaneous presence of tio2 and uv light a complete disappearance of dr80 was observed after 90 min of irradiation this confirms the photocatalytic nature of the reaction 3 1 2 uv vis spectra fig 5 shows the changes in the dr80 optical densities under different irradiation times the spectra present three main maxima one at 527 nm one at 285 nm and the other one at 235 nm the one at 527 nm being responsible of the colour of the dye the complete decolorization is achieved at 60 min of irradiation time while the degradation of intermediates continues up to more than 90 min the fast decolorization of dye is due to the initial electrophilic cleavage of its chromophoric azo nn bonds bouzaida et al 2012 alahiane et al 2020 the degradation of aromatic part of the dye molecule produced number of intermediate compounds and the removal of these intermediates took longer time 3 1 3 dye initial concentration effect the effect of dye initial concentration on the efficiency of dye degradation was investigated with concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 mg l 1 fig 6 it was found that when the dye concentration increases the degradation time of dye increases too hence the photodegradation process will work faster at a low concentration of pollutants these results are in excellent agreement with previous reports qourzal et al 2012 jo and tayade 2016 chennah et al 2018a at high concentrations of dye the deeper coloured solution becomes compact and forms a screen rendering the solution less transparent to uv light and the dye molecules may absorb a significant quantity of uv light causing less light to reach the photocatalyst and thus decreasing the formation of ho radicals hence at low concentrations of the coloured solution the opposite effect is observed because the solution becomes easily to cross by the uv light increasing the number of irradiation absorbed by the photocatalyst and hence its activity natarajan et al 2011a 2011b jo and tayade 2016 the effect of the initial dye concentration on the initial rate of photocatalytic degradation is illustrated in fig 7 a v0 grows rapidly at low concentrations and tends towards a limit value about 0 8 mg l min this value certainly corresponds to the saturation of tio2 surface the shape of the curve obtained is similar to that of langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model ahmad and mondal 2012 this is confirmed by the plots of 1 v0 versus 1 co which gives a straight line of slope 1 k k and the intercept 1 k fig 7 b the kinetic constants of equilibrium table 2 are calculated from the plot of fig 7 b the tio2 photocatalytic degradation of many organic molecules follows first order kinetics ahmad and mondal 2012 du et al 2013 el saliby et al 2013 usually described through the langmuir hinshelwood model at low initial dye concentration the simplified kinetic model can be described by eq 1 li et al 2015a 2015b 1 ln c c 0 k app t where c and c0 mg l 1 are the concentration at time t and initial time kapp min 1 is the apparent rate constant and t min is the time of irradiation the half lives can be calculated by the equation 2 t 1 2 ln 2 k app in order to evaluate the kinetics of the dye decolorization in the presence of the catalyst the rate constants were calculated by the slope of the line obtained by presentation of the evolution of ln c c0 versus irradiation time at different initial concentrations the linear regression appears to fit well table 3 and consequently dr80 oxidation follows first order kinetic law in order to evaluate the decolorization kinetics of dr80 dye in presence of the catalyst the rate constants were calculated by using the graph ln c c0 versus irradiation time at different initial concentrations the linear regression showed a good fit table 3 and involving a pseudo first order kinetic for dr80 oxidation 3 1 4 effect of solution ph the ph is an important factor controlling the photocatalytic reactions which take place on the particles surfaces of photocatalyst it is well known that ph affects the degradation kinetics of certain organic compounds in photocatalytic processes alahiane et al 2013 sennaoui et al 2018a zangeneh et al 2020 therefore we studied the degradation of dr80 at different ph values 3 5 8 7 8 and 10 the evolution of the apparent constants kapp versus ph is shown in fig 8 the experimental results show that the degradation of dr80 is better in acidic conditions the maximum discoloration was observed at ph 3 this can be explained by the electrostatic forces between the positive charge at the surface of catalyst and the anionic groups of the dye fig 9 a similar behavior has been reported for the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 for the discoloration of azo dyes barka et al 2010 gupta et al 2012 alahiane et al 2017 at high ph values electrostatic repulsion between the negative charge at the tio2 surface and hydroxide anions prevent the formation of ho at the surface resulting in a decrease of the photodegradation activity gupta et al 2012 rauf and ashraf 2009 3 1 5 effect of inorganic ions the salt effect on the photodegradation of organic pollutants was frequently investigated due to the possibility of the adsorption of inorganic anions onto the catalyst surface this adsorption results in decreasing of number of the holes and ho radicals and reaction rate decrease djokić et al 2012 they are generally present in the real industrial wastewaters with values depending on the nature of the effluent in order to evaluate the importance effect of some anions so4 2 cl no3 ch3coo hco3 et hpo4 2 sodium salts we have studied their effect on the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation by adding an amount 10 3 mol l 1 of each ions fig 10 for hpo4 2 ions it s well known that they strongly adsorb on the tio2 surface and therefore come into competition with the adsorption of dr80 at the photocatalyst surface they can also trap ho to form the corresponding anionic radicals hpo4 which leads to decreasing of photodegradation effectivity barka et al 2008a 3 hpo4 2 ho hpo4 h2o the inhibitory effect of hco3 ions have been formerly attributed to adsorption competition with the dye on the tio2 surface on the other hand it s well known that the bicarbonate and carbonate ions are usually assumed to reduce photocatalysis efficiency by scavenging ho according to following reactions ji et al 2013 4 hco3 ho co3 h2o 5 co3 2 ho co3 ho these anions can also block the active sites on the tio2 surface and deactivate the catalyst toward dr80 and intermediates the generated carbonate radical anion is a weaker oxidizing agent than ho radical and reaction rates for many organic substrates with co3 are several orders of magnitude slower than reactions with ho hu et al 2007 behnajady et al 2006 chloride anions along with sectional wastes are generally present in the effluent of the textile industry the increase in the photocatalytic degradation rate of dr80 in the presence of cl ions could be explained by the result of the reaction of radical ho with cl eq 6 barka et al 2008b 6 ho cl cl oh cl radicals can be also oxidizing pollutants and participating in the photodegradation process kiwi et al 2000 concerning the no3 ions some authors have reported that they can increase the photodegradation rate alahiane et al 2014 zhu et al 2009 it has been shown that no3 ions are weakly adsorbed on the tio2 surface and therefore they have little effect on the photodegradation of dr80 this result is similar with those observed by barka et al 2008a and alahiane et al 2013 the inhibition of the photocatalytic reaction of dr80 in the presence of ch3coo which is used to reduce the alkalinity of the textile effluents could be explained by the photo kolbe reaction eq 12 stylidi et al 2003 which reduces the formation of ho radicals via eqs 8 and 9 on the tio2 surface 7 ch3coo h ch3 co2 8 h h2o ho h 9 h oh ho finally the so4 2 ions are adsorbed on the tio2 surface and are consequently reacted with the positive holes hvb and hydroxyl radical ho hu et al 2003 10 hvb so4 2 so4 11 ho so4 2 so4 ho since so4 is a strong oxidant by removing the electron from neutral molecule like water and generates ho radical that can enhance the photocatalytic reaction rate the sulfate radical can accelerate the reaction and participate in the degradation process according to the following reactions kositzi et al 2004 12 so4 h2o so4 2 ho h 13 so4 dr80 so4 2 int1 14 so4 int1 so4 2 co2 where int1 symbolises the first reaction intermediates partially transformed until the total mineralization 3 1 6 effect of temperature since the temperature variation could affect the photocatalytic reaction rate the effect of temperature on the degradation reaction of dye was monitored by raising reaction temperature the reaction was done at 295 301 308 and 317 k table 4 lists the apparent rate constant kapp of dr80 with increasing temperature these results show that efficiency of degradation increases slightly with increasing temperature the temperature variation is not rate determining step in the photocatalysed reactions qourzal et al 2007 the activation energy ea can be calculated from the arrhenius equation as follows tabbara and jamal 2012 15 k app ae e a rt where kapp min 1 is the apparent rate constant a min 1 is the frequency factor ea j mol is the activation energy r j mol k is the general gas constant and t k is the absolute temperature fig 11 illustrates the linear transformation of the arrhenius equation ln k app f 1 t in photocatalytic reaction the activation energy deals with electron transfer from valence band to the conduction band of the catalyst pare et al 2008 the activation energy is very low 10 130 kj mol and it does not depend on the reaction type mohamed hussain et al 2008 moreover the values of thermodynamic activation parameters such as the enthalpy of activation δh and entropy of activation δs were evaluated using eyring equation as follows tabbara and jamal 2012 16 k app k b t h e δ g rt a linear plot of lnkapp t versus 1 t yielded a straight line fig 12 whose slope is equal to δ h r and the intercept is equal to ln k b h δ s r 17 ln k app t δ h r 1 t ln k b h δ s r where kb 1 3807 10 23 j k is the boltzmann constant t k is the absolute temperature h 6 6261 10 34s j is the planck constant kapp min 1 is the apparent rate constant δh j mol is the activation enthalpy and δs j k mol is the activation entropy according to the equation of the straight line we deduce the values of δh 8 218 kj mol and δs 193 008 j k mol the large negative value of δs suggest decreased randomness at the solid solution interface and no significant changes occur in the internal structure of the adsorbent through the adsorption of dr80 onto tio2 particles 3 2 mineralization of dr80 in order to verify the capacity of the heterogeneous photocatalysis to mineralize a synthetic dye and to have information on the oxidation state of the target compound and its degree of mineralization we have followed the kinetics of mineralization of the dye by the measurement of the cod chemical oxygen demand fig 13 during the treatment by this process of a solution initially containing a dye the cod removal increased rapidly during the reaction time but in a manner more slowly than the decolorization of solutions at 100 of the decolorization the cod abatement rate after 7 h of irradiation is 88 64 which proves the formation of intermediate products radjenovic et al 2009 after the decolorization of the solution the cod decreased sharply reaching a plateau that corresponds to the oxidation of most stable compounds indi cating that almost complete mineralization of intermediates has occurred giwa et al 2012 table 5 summarizes the theoretical cod value that we have calculated by pursuing a chemical reaction process ayral et al 2010 and the experimental cod value of the initial concentration of the dr80 dye from the results mentioned in the table above it appears that the cod value calculated theoretically is close to that obtained experimentally 3 3 suggested mechanism based on the degradation products identified by the hplc and identified by comparison with commercial standards and according to the literature giwa et al 2012 gutowska et al 2007 zhao et al 2010 natarajan et al 2011b ma et al 2011 a simplified degradation mechanism of the dye in aqueous solution during the treatment by heterogeneous photocatalysis is proposed the uv vis spectra of dye initial
