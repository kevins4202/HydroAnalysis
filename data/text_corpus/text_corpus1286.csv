6430,in order to advance our understanding of the driving factors controlling carbon dynamics and evolution of water quality in river reservoir systems for the generation of hydropower we conducted a study in a karst deep water reservoir wujiangdu reservoir southwest china water samples were collected from the inflow outflow of the wujiangdu reservoir four vertical columns along the reservoir and from three tributaries to the reservoir in january april july and october 2017 the dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations and carbon isotope composition δ13cdic varied greatly 1 99 3 45 mmol l and 10 7 to 6 0 respectively and were controlled by multiple processes including co2 outgassing primary production and organic matter degradation in the four vertical profiles the difference between the values of samples with those at 15 m of δ dic and δ δ13cdic δ dic and δca2 in the same water column had positive correlations and the variation in dissolved o2 partial pressure of co2 and flux of co2 suggested that primary production dominated above the epilimnion and degradation of om dominated below the epilimnion during the warm season continuous co2 outgassing was found from riverine water to surface water of the reservoir before the dam based on carbon isotopic compositions and water chemistry these processes would cause isotopic fractionation between the residual dic and co2 aqueous the degree of which varied among different seasons july april october january carbon transport and biogeochemical processes were highly controlled by the hydraulic retention time hrt in the river reservoir system it was estimated that approximately 71 5 of the annual dic flux was produced in the water column below 15 m depth during the study year suggesting that the processes of dic generation and consumption occurred at the same time the results highlight that carbon behavior in the impounded rivers is influenced by multiple processes the carbon transformation processes should be taken into account for improving the estimation accuracy of the carbon budget calculations and the management of water quality for river reservoir systems keywords dissolved inorganic carbon carbon isotope biogeochemical processes reservoir hydraulic retention time hrt 1 introduction rivers act as the major pathway for transporting of terrestrial materials to the oceans cole et al 2007 raymond and hamilton 2018 a large number of dams have been built in rivers over the past 60 years for flood control irrigation navigation sediment control and hydropower generation purposes lehner et al 2011 lu et al 2018a teodoru et al 2013 wcd 2000 wen et al 2017 especially in china china has 23 842 dams with heights over 15 m representing 40 92 of the world s dams in 2015 icold 2018 owing to the fact there are over 68 of the country s hydropower resources in southwestern china the construction of dams is particularly intense in this region li et al 2017 impounding rivers with dams affect the transport of carbon to the ocean and thus the global carbon cycle cole 2013 kemenes et al 2007 oh and raymond 2006 raymond and hamilton 2018 raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 previous studies have estimated the dic flux to oceans varying from 0 4 pg yr bauer et al 2013 richey 2004 and 0 6 pg yr cai 2011 to 0 9 pg yr li and bush 2015 river damming also modifies riverine fluxes of nutrients maavara et al 2017 van cappellen and maavara 2016 making the reservoir s internal environment more complex and causing greenhouse gas ghg outgassing from the reservoir surface borges et al 2015 fearnside and pueyo 2012 kemenes et al 2007 van geldern et al 2015 wen et al 2017 therefore there still exists a debate as to whether hydro power generated by dams is a green form of energy tranvik et al 2009 the effect of damming has already attracted much attention from the scientific and wider communities however the complex internal carbon cycle of dam river systems and the environmental effect of damming has still not been fully understood prairie et al 2017 for example there are inadequate data to evaluate dic variations particularly as a result of the processes of transport and transformation of carbon occurring between rivers and the reservoirs during different seasons rivers are fragmented and form a river reservoir system due to dam construction which makes the carbon cycle complex in the system stable isotopes of dic δ 13cdic has become an important indicator to trace processes within the carbon cycle anderson et al 2009 van geldern et al 2015 there are many factors influencing dic production and consumption such as outgassing of co2 removal of dic during primary production degradation of organic matter om and carbonate deposition dissolution in karst reservoirs waters in chinese karst regions is one of the highest producers of inorganic carbon released to the atmospheric co2 reservoir in the world due to the extensive area of carbonate rocks in those regions liu et al 2016 despite the widely distributed of karst landforms in china research on the carbon cycle of river reservoir systems in karst regions and its relevance to the global carbon cycle is still insufficient a high soil co2 efflux of 1392 122 6 g c m 2 year 1 was reported in karst area in central part of guizhou province southwest china liu et al 2012 the major form of dic in rivers in karst region is bicarbonate hco3 and chemical weathering is the main generation mechanism controlling dic in reservoirs carbonate dissolution rapidly and constantly consumes soil co2 to form hco3 which is subsequently delivered to rivers lu et al 2018b oh and raymond 2006 shen et al 2017 zhong et al 2017 and accelerates the processes of catchment carbon transfer dic in rivers in carbonate regions is mainly derived from two sources namely allochthonous and autochthonous sources liu 2007 the allochthonous dic is derived from watershed erosion e g chemical weathering of carbonates and the soil zone while the autochthonous sources are mainly from processes such as degradation and decomposition of organic matter major rivers are vital for the global carbon cycle but the important role of smaller rivers and streams has been recently realized and the processes occurring within these systems requires more attention borges et al 2015 butman and raymond 2011 cole 2013 raymond et al 2013 studying impounded rivers in the southwest china karst region will inform on the mechanisms controlling carbon cycling in this environment and potentially provide transferrable model parameters for other reservoirs in the world in this study we explored the various processes affected dic using δ 13cdic which was a powerful tool to understand the sources and fate of the carbon in rivers and reservoirs alling et al 2012 aucour et al 1999 de montety et al 2011 samanta et al 2015 this investigation was carried out at a medium sized reservoir in a karst region southwest china we used δ13cdic dic concentrations water temperature t dissolved oxygen do calcium ion ca2 co2 partial pressure pco2 and diffusion flux of co2 fco2 to address the following objectives 1 understanding the changing mechanisms of dic cycling from river to reservoir in different seasons 2 exploring the fractionation process of dic at the water atmosphere interface in different seasons and 3 revealing seasonal changes in dic flux production and consumption mechanisms addressing these objectives will improve the knowledge base underpinning how to best manage reservoirs to minimize their environmental impact hence providing cleaner energy thus one of the most important goals of this study is to explore the process of limnological evolution in impounded rivers and elucidate the key carbon sources and sinks in this environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the wujiangdu reservoir supplementary text s1 was the first large scale hydropower station of wujiang river constructed in the early 1980s located in the upper reaches wujiang river is the largest river in guizhou province and the largest tributary on the south of the upper reaches of the yangtze river with a total length of 1037 km and drainage area of 87 900 km2 cui 2006 table s1 the carbonate rocks are well developed and the exposed area is up to 64 81 lin and zhu 1999 the climate is subtropical humid monsoon with mean annual rainfall of 1178 6 mm and mean annual air temperature of 15 5 c gzqx 2017 the temperature in the region varies seasonally with the warm wet season from april to september and cold dry season from october to march january april july and october represent the midpoints of winter spring summer and autumn respectively we investigated the inflow w1 three tributaries w2 w6 w7 reservoir area w3 w4 w5 w8 and outlet of the reservoir w9 2 2 sampling and analysis for this study four sample campaigns were conducted in january april july and october of 2017 each sample campaign included 2 3 replicates and water sampling was carried out from the middle of the channel water samples from rivers w1 w2 w6 w7 were collected within 0 5 m from the river surface fig 1 while water samples from the vertical profiles in the reservoir w3 w4 w5 w8 were collected at a range of different depths such as 0 m 5 m 15 m 30 m 45 m and 60 m using a niskin water sampler model 1010 general oceanics usa the water temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ with an automated multiparameter profiler model ysi exo total alkalinity was titrated by titrimeter brand 4760161 with three parallel samples using 0 02 mol l hydrochloric acid telmer and veizer 1999 all water samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm filter whatman inc and stored in acid washed hdpe bottles samples for anion and cation analysis were stored at 4 c and cation samples were preserved with acid hno3 at ph 2 major anions including cl so4 2 no3 were determined by ion chromatography using a diones ics90 5 uncertainty and major cations k na ca2 and mg2 were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 5 uncertainty the samples were filtered on site with 0 45 μm pinhole filters and then 20 ml was injected into vacuum glass bottles pre filled with 2 ml 85 phosphoric acid and a bar magnet for carbon isotopic analysis of co2 the samples were heated at 50 to extract co2 into tubes by the off line vacuum system atekwana and krishnamurthy 1998 li et al 2008 carbon isotope measurement was performed on a finnigan mat 252 mass spectrometer carbon stable isotope results are expressed in as permil deviation with reference to a standard vpdb with an analytical precision of 0 1 all laboratory analyses were conducted at the institute of geochemistry chinese academy of science the discharge data and meteorological data were obtained from the guizhou provincial hydrology bureau 2 3 calculation of co2 partial pressure flux and the calcite saturation index we used the indirect calculation method based on the quantitative relation between pco2 and ph alkalinity water temperature see details in the supplementary text s2 clark and fritz 1997 li et al 2012 the calcite saturation index sic of water samples was calculated with the phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 1999 the diffusion flux of co2 through the water air interface was estimated with the following equation butman and raymond 2011 cole and caraco 2001 1 f k k h p co 2 aq p co 2 air where f mmol m2 d is the diffusion flux of co2 between water and atmosphere k is the gas exchange rate m d cole and caraco 1998 crusius and wanninkhof 2003 k h is henry s constant water temperature corrected pco2 aq is the partial pressure of co2 at the water surface and pco2 air is the partial pressure of atmospheric co2 400 μatm calculated from https www esrl noaa gov gmd ccgg trends full html we estimated k to be 10 cm h in the inflow and outflow waters and 3 cm h in the reservoir area based on the work of wang et al 2014 3 results 3 1 water chemistry the water temperature in the wujangdu reservoir had a significant response to atmospheric temperature variations ranging from 12 8 c to 29 8 c mean 18 5 c sd 3 5 supplementary fig s1 water temperature varied in a narrow range during the cold season than the warm season and water temperature decreased with increasing water depth during the warm season the storage capacity and water release increased first and then decreased from january to october while the retention time showed an opposite trend and periodically stratification of the reservoir occurs in this study the reservoir had obvious thermal stratifications in spring and summer and gradually disappeared in autumn and winter this phenomenon can be seen from the vertical variation of t do ph and other parameters supplementary figs s2 4 tables s1 and s2 thus we defined 0 5 m as the epilimnion 5 15 m as the thermocline and water below 15 m as the hypolimnion which is similar to previous studies han et al 2017 wang et al 2014 the water in the river reservoir system was low in alkalinity and ph ranged from 7 32 to 8 54 do concentrations ranged from 0 32 mg l to 16 22 mg l mean 7 84 mg l sd 2 51 for all samples do concentrations decreased with water depth in the warm season and remained stable in the cold season the seasonal variation in do was higher in the reservoir area than at other sites and also higher at sites closer to the dam outlet than further away from the dam water chemistry showed significant seasonal and spatial variations in the wujiangdu river reservoir system ca2 accounted for 73 of the total cations in the reservoir area ca2 concentrations ranged from 1 36 mmol l to 2 35 mmol l mean 1 63 mmol l sd 0 15 mmol l in the all samples indicating that the water was rich in ca2 across the whole study area ca2 concentrations ranged from 1 36 to 1 76 mmol l mean 1 59 mmol l in the reservoir and increased with depth in january there was a decreasing trend of sic 0 with water depth indicating that calcite tended to be dissolved at deeper depths of the reservoir however calcite precipitation rates in the epilimnion tended to be greater in the warm season than in the cold season supplementary fig s4 the water ph ranged between 7 51 and 8 54 supplementary fig s2 indicating the carbonate system in the main channel was dominated by hco3 which is the major component of dic 95 ca2 was the dominant cation in the wujiang river due to the weathering of permian and triassic carbonate rocks liu 2007 3 2 variability of the pco2 f co2 the pco2 in the surface reservoir water and f co2 at the reservoir water air interface showed clear seasonal patterns in 2017 supplementary figs s2 and s3 which were similar to those observed in the previous study wang et al 2014 in the reservoir area pco2 ranged from 455 7 to 8238 1 μatm mean 3086 9 μatm sd 1487 1 μatm and was often supersaturated relative to the atmosphere leading to rapid co2 degassing in the warm season pco2 in the surface water had lower values nearly in equilibrium with the atmosphere and generally decreased close to the dam pco2 values were higher in the outflow water and increased with increasing depth in all seasons in the cold season the range of pco2 values was smaller and the difference between the outflow and reservoir area was smaller than in the warm season however the pco2 values of the surface water in the reservoir area were much higher in the cold season than in the warm season the pco2 values were always high in the bottom water close to the dam f co2 values were lower in the reservoir area in the warm season 8 58 mmol m2 d sd 7 76 mmol m2 d than in the cold season mean 59 28 mmol m2 d sd 9 54 mmol m2 d the values of f co2 and pco2 in the outflow river showed distinctive seasonal patterns summer autumn winter spring supplementary fig s2 but the inflow river and tributaries varied in a narrow range 3 3 dic and δ 13cdic dic concentrations showed seasonal variations at the surface and stratified waters overall dic concentrations ranged from 1 99 mmol l to 3 45 mmol l mean 2 50 mmol l sd 0 27 mmol l and varied more in the warm season 1 99 3 45 mmol l mean 2 51 mmol l than in the cold season 2 20 3 14 mmol l mean 2 39 mmol l dic concentrations of the surface water in the warm season mean 2 24 mmol l were much lower than in the cold season mean 2 37 mmol l dic concentrations remained stable in water of the river inflow 2 36 0 06 mmol l and river outflow 2 51 0 12 mmol l dic concentrations were significantly higher in tributaries than that in the main stream but varied in a narrow range supplementary fig s2 the δ 13cdic values ranged from 10 7 to 6 0 mean 9 2 sd 1 1 in the study area and showed large temporal and spatial fluctuations in the reservoir in the surface water although δ 13cdic values were higher in the warm season mean 7 2 than in the cold season mean 9 3 changed little under the epilimnion both in the warm season and in the cold season in the warm season as the water temperature increased the reservoir stratified and had increases in do as well as in δ 13cdic in the surface water while pco2 fco2 and ca2 decreased however the δ 13cdic values in the bottom water were more negative and stable throughout the year 9 8 0 5 since april to september is the warm wet season and the water is greatly disturbed by high rainfall the δ 13cdic varied significantly along the river channel and δ 13cdic responded to reservoir stratification biological activity would have caused the enrichment of δ 13cdic in the surface waters while the bottom area was characterized by lower δ 13cdic values in the cold season δ 13cdic values were more depleted over the entire profiles especially in october fig 2 4 discussion the variation in dic concentrations and δ13cdic observed in the river reservoir system in this study were caused by a combination of biogeochemical processes such as outgassing of co2 biological processes precipitation or dissolution of calcite and respiration and degradation of om by considering both dic and δ13cdic we can therefore gain insights into these processes an equation relating dic to δ13cdic and a graph indicating the effects of each of these processes on the dic concentrations and δ13cdic were developed fig 3 4 1 processes affecting dic concentrations and δ 13cdic δ13cdic varied largely between the epilimnion and the hypoliminon fig 2 especially in the upper 15 m the water below the depth of 15 m showed better physical and chemical stability i e t ph do ec pco2 while other parameters changed little with increasing depth in all seasons the water chemistry parameters at 15 m depth δ13cdic 9 4 0 4 dic 2 45 0 20 mmol l were similar to those in the input river waters δ13cdic 9 6 0 6 dic 2 36 0 06 mmol l and the chemical properties were relatively stable this is perhaps because 15 m is above the dead water level throughout all seasons which is generally the boundary between the thermocline and hypolimnion and the depth at which water starts to be less affected by light and discharge for power generation the specific calculation formula can be defined by the following equations 2 δ δ 13 c dic δ 13 c dic sample δ 13 c dic 15 m 3 δ dic dic sample dic 15 m where δ δ13cdic and δ dic represent the difference between the δ 13cdic and dic values of samples versus these values at 15 m in the same water column respectively 4 1 1 outgassing co2 and primary production in fig 3 most of the data from surface water falls in quadrant a with a faster rate of decrease of δ dic with increasing δ δ13cdic than other samples which could be ascribed to the outgassing of co2 caused by photosynthesis the pco2 values in the surface reservoir area were higher than those in the air for the majority of the study year supplementary fig s2 isotopic fractionation occurs during the release of co2 from surface water to the atmosphere causing 13c enriched in residual dic during the cold dry season photosynthesis at the surface is reduced and respiration is the dominant process barros et al 2011 the stratification of the water body gradually disappeared in the autumn which would have caused the accumulated co2 at the bottom to gradually rise to the surface and escape to the atmosphere causing the significant decrease of δ 13cdic values especially in the autumn photosynthesis increases with increasing water temperature resulting in more dissolved co2 to be absorbed in the reservoir and consequently algal blooms in the warm season e g chlorophyta dinophyta and cyanophyta gamier et al 1995 yao et al 2007 han et al 2017 found that the concentrations of chlorophyll increased rapidly from january 1 35 μg l to july 40 64 μg l in the surface water of the reservoir the significant decrease in dissolved co2 would then cause the dic concentrations to decrease guo et al 2015 wang et al 2018 due to the gradual stratification of the water column in spring the rate of dic exchange between the upper and lower waters diminished however the dic removal by photosynthesis caused dic concentrations to decrease in the surface waters of the reservoir phytoplankton preferentially uptakes the lighter 12c bardhan et al 2017 maberly et al 2012 therefore the epilimnion becomes enriched in 13c which eventually leads to an increase in δ δ13cdic the δ dic values were significantly lower in the warm season than in the cold season in the cold season in order to meet the demand for power generation and prevent flooding during the wet season water was gradually released reaching its lowest level the stratification of water levels between april and july may cause the variation in hrt and dic concentrations in the surface water between these periods fig 3 c1 and c2 previous studies have confirmed that phytoplankton bloom in april after the cold season gamier et al 1995 yao et al 2007 the difference between the δ δ13cdic values of the c1 and c2 groups could be caused by the increased oxygen exchange rate in july this accelerates aerobic mineralization of om increasing the production rate of dic in the reservoir stratification occurs under high water temperature in summer and was most pronounced close to the dam owing to the high discharge of rivers entering the dam supplementary figs s2 and s3 the lower discharge rates in april than in july also caused the variation in δ δ13cdic along the river course to be smaller in april due to the lower river lacustrine gradient the seasonal release of water in reservoirs leads to variation in hrt between seasons with hrt being lowest in july affecting the river hydrodynamics which leads to the enrichment of dic in heavy isotopes along the river course in july the changes in dic concentrations in the water profile at different distances from the dam need to be considered to understand the carbon cycling in the reservoir system it is difficult to distinguish the effects of algal photosynthesis and outgassing of co2 for samples in quadrant a fig 3 because these two processes have similar influences on the values of dic concentrations and δ13cdic values alling et al 2012 samanta et al 2015 however we found that the intensity of the processes varied between seasons pco2 and f co2 values in the warm season were lower than in the cold season which indicated that the rate of photosynthesis was higher in the warm season and the dominant process controlling dic in the epilimnion overall nearly all the warm season reservoir surface samples were plotted in quadrant a fig 3 and cold season samples were plotted in c3 and quadrant c fig 3 indicating photosynthesis and mixing of dic in the water column were important processes controlling dic and δ13cdic in the study period it can be concluded that the role of primary production is more significant than degradation of om in the epilimnion during the warm season while the degradation of om was the dominant process in the cold season 4 1 2 degradation of organic matter the continuous flow of terrestrial and autochthonous organic matter into the waters has a great impact on dic concentrations raymond et al 2013 zhong et al 2018 the flux of sediments is 1 39 109g yr in the wujiangdu reservoir yang et al 2017 and forms a major input in the carbon cycle of the river reservoir system δ dic and δ δ13cdic show a negative correlation fig 3 the samples from the bottom of the reservoir in all four seasons plot in quadrant c and group c4 and a previous study showed that doc concentrations decrease with increasing water depth han et al 2017 indicating that degradation of om always occurs in this environment the process of om degradation would increase the concentrations of dic and decrease the δ13cdic value de montety et al 2011 autochthonous om in the reservoir can be divided into two major pools one is the algal biomass in the surface waters phytoplankton from wujiangdu reservoir account for 80 of the annual sedimentation per year yang et al 2017 do also increased with the decrease of δ dic in the surface waters indicating that this reaction does occur supplementary figs s5 and s6 the other pool is the om in the bottom of the reservoir from the riverine inputs the increase of δ dic and the decrease of δ δ13cdic suggest the generation of dic via degradation of organic matter supplementary fig s6 b resuspended sedimentary om and settling biological om would be degraded in the reservoir causing an increase in δ dic with a corresponding decrease in do and photosynthesis becomes negligible as water depth increases in the warm season the water column was stratified causing water temperature to decrease markedly with depth while pco2 increased supplementary fig s6 dic was hence enriched in the hypolimnion fig 3c3 while pco2 in surface waters was close to atmospheric pco2 and fco2 was much lower than in the cold season although the decomposition of om occurs at the bottom of the reservoir occurs it has little effect on the dic concentrations in the epilimnion because of thermal stratification thus discharge causes more co2 outgassing to the atmosphere therefore releasing water from the reservoir in the warm season causes the runoff to become a carbon source barros et al 2011 fearnside and pueyo 2012 tranvik et al 2009 in the cold season reservoir stratification does not occur and accumulated dic would mix rapidly the δ13cdic fig 3c3 pco2 supplementary fig s5 a and δ t supplementary fig s5 b show little variation in the water column fig 3c3 4 1 3 precipitation and dissolution of carbonate precipitation of carbonate is a major process in karst areas and a few samples fell in the quadrant d fig 3 this process was particularly evident in the epilimnion during the warm season which caused the decreases in ca2 concentrations and δ ca2 and δ dic in the water column showed a good correlation responsible for the precipitation of carbonate supplementary fig s6 r2 0 54 at the commencement of the rainy season the weathering intensity increases rapidly leading to high fluxes of dic and ca2 flowing into the river co2 outgassing and photosynthesis enhance the precipitation of carbonate during daylight leading to surface water being over saturated with calcite de montety et al 2011 hartley et al 1996 as 13c is preferentially precipitated during carbonate mineral precipitation this process causes carbon isotope fractionation in dic species romanek et al 1992 photosynthesis by phytoplankton removes co2 aq from the water eq 4 increasing the ph and decreasing the solubility of calcite hence calcite precipitation would be accelerated in the warm season 4 caco 3 co 2 h 2 o hco 3 ca 2 caco 3 x co 2 h 2 o 1 x ch 2 o o 2 in the cold season the stratification gradually recedes and disappears and the upwelling of dic from the bottom of the reservoir further accelerates the sedimentation of carbonate sic supplementary fig s4 was greater than zero in the epilimnion all year round indicating that carbonate precipitation plays an important role in the epilimnion based on estimation of the inorganic carbon ic concentrations at the surface of the sediment the deposition flux of ic in the reservoir could reach up to 89 3 g m2 y and the content of ic in the bottom water is stable at around 1 52 yang et al 2017 in the quadrant b fig 3 both δ dic and δ δ13cdic increased which can be ascribed to the dissolution of carbonate we could also observe the process of carbonate dissolution at the bottom area supplementary fig s4 this might be due to large amounts of co2 produced by the degradation of om in the bottom details in 4 1 2 resulting in low ph values although carbonate dissolution leads to the 13c enriched dic values δ13cdic values would not rise significantly which may be due to the degradation of om producing respired co2 lu et al 2018b in january constant carbonate precipitation supplementary fig s4 was probably due to the disappearance of thermal stratification allowing sufficient mixing of dic and ca2 thus it can be concluded that dissolution of carbonate followed by the degradation of om and related processes can explain the trends observed in the decreased δδ13cdic and sic fig 3 and supplementary figs s4 and s5 4 2 carbon isotope fractionation of dic outgassing of co2 from water and primary production would cause isotopic fractionation between the residual dic and co2 aqueous the isotopic fractionation in relation to co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in rivers occurs primarily at tropical and sub tropical latitudes bloom et al 2010 borges et al 2015 lauerwald et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 availability of dic dictates the development and activity of biological structures in ecosystems orion jędrysek et al 2006 in our study we focused on the dic variation in the epilimnion starting from a depth of 15 m at 15 m primary dic sources are rivers om degradation and sedimentation of phytoplankton han et al 2017 the final concentrations of dic dic final is related to the initial dic concentrations dic i through the factor fpp the fraction of dic remaining in the water 5 dic final f pp dic i the progressive outgassing of co2 which obeys the rayleigh distillation theory thus the residual 13c 12c rfinal of stratified waters can be determined as follows 6 r final r i f pp α co2 1 where α is the fractionation factor outgassing and primary production would change the isotopic composition of the remaining dic in a similar way these processes therefore will change the δ 13cdic values by rayleigh distillation and thus the resulting composition of dic relative to the initial composition 15 m as a function of the amount left after the process fpp 7 δ 13 c final δ 13 c i 10 3 α c o 2 1 l n f pp hco3 co2 system 8 10 3 ln 9 55 10 3 t 24 10 5 c t 125 c 9 ε hco 3 co 2 0 114 0 03 t c 10 78 0 04 5 c t 25 c 10 α co 2 0 114 0 03 t c 10 78 0 04 10 3 1000 1 mook et al 1974 zhang et al 1995 where δ13cfinal and δ13ci are the final and initial δ13cdic values respectively we chose eq 10 to calculate αco2 for different seasons and compared with eq 8 compared with the calculated fractionation curve fig 4 the actual degree of fractionation of δ13cdic values was july april october january and it can be observed from the gradient that the fractionation of dic increases gradually with the seasonally induced increase in photosynthesis considering the difference between the modeled fractionation curve and the actual values it is likely that co2 exchange occurs at the water atmosphere interface in the warm season when there is insufficient dissolved co2 to maintain the normal photosynthesis of planktonic algae atmospheric co2 will dissolve in the water and carbonic anhydrase ca of the algae e g cyanobacterial and microalgae converts the accumulated hco3 to co2 to participate in photosynthesis amoroso et al 1998 giordano et al 2003 maberly and madsen 2002 in july with the arrival of the rain the flow rate and water storage capacity increased and hrt was shortened fig 4 although the photosynthesis of phytoplankton was enhanced the consumed dic can be quickly replenished and the overall consumption of the epilimnion was less than in april as the dic was consumed δ13cdic increases concurrently and the degree of fractionation gradually increases which was probably due to the conducive photosynthesis of planktonic algae with the lowered levels of disturbance in the reservoir fractionation was enhanced in the warm season when artificial regulation changes the hrt the higher water temperature and rainfall increase the flow rate and chlorophyll levels increases barth and veizer 1999 and stratification becomes more pronounced the closer the distance to the dam the more stable the water was causing more pronounced isotope fractionation fig 3c2 overall hrt and the subtropical humid monsoon climate are the two most important physical characteristics driving dic dynamics in the river reservoir system the impact of these factors is mainly reflected in the following processes 1 the input and output of inorganic carbon organic carbon and other nutrient matter 2 appearance and disappearance of stratification at different time in the reservoir 3 the intensity of biological processes these effects eventually cause periodic changes of dic concentrations and δ13cdic values 4 3 generation consumption processes of dic in the typical karst reservoir in order to further understand the transport and transformation of dic we used formulas to calculate the related amount of dic and other variables supplementary text s3 in the warm season the calculated results suggest 330 k ton c of input and 321 k ton c of dic export the dic flux decreased by 2 88 due to water impoundment in the wujiangdu reservoir the increase in stratification in july resulted in a strong linear relationship between water temperature and isotopic composition supplementary fig s5 r2 0 90 indicating thermal stratification did enhance and cause the consumption of dic by algal photosynthesis although the δ dic varied considerably in the vertical profiles of the reservoir and the dic concentrations in the surface was lowest for the year 27 54 mg l about 73 of dic was generated in the waters and 71 5 was produced in the water column under 15 m the decomposition of organic matter contributed dic below 15 m so that dic content in the discharged water did not decrease significantly and δ13cdic was more depleted than in the bottom waters the primary sources and processes producing dic in summer are as follows 1 the weathering of carbonate rocks is enhanced in summer and contributes large amounts of dic to the watershed liu et al 2016 shen et al 2017 2 the stratification in summer leads to poor dic exchange and enhanced photosynthesis at the surface due to higher water temperature increases the difference between dic concentrations at 15 m depth and the reservoir bottom 15 8 mg l the dic concentrations at water depths of 0 1 m and 15 16 m were the lowest of the year thus thermal stratification gives a stable environment for decomposition of om and pic generation which is introduced by riverine input and can be biodegraded to dic by microbes kim 2015 the reduced disturbance of water flow in the reservoir area was conducive to the decomposition of om at the bottom and the dic content gradually increases to the highest level observed during the year 36 7 mg l which eventually affects the export of dic in the cold season the calculated results show 123 k ton c of dic input and 119 k ton c of export indicating the dic flux decreased by 3 85 through the reservoir system the reasons for the decrease are likely as follows 1 rainfall declined and the water flow decreased significantly water temperature decreased and the rate of organic mineralization slowed down 2 the disappearance of the thermal stratification allowed the release of carbon dioxide to occur and co2 was quickly released into the atmosphere in the autumn the dic concentrations in the bottom below 15 m was lower than that in the upper water 0 15 m with the fco2 values in outflow water being the highest of the year 272 4 mmol m2 d 5 times that in summer 9 times that in spring these values are similar to those observed in a previous study 272 1 mmol m2 d in the same area wang et al 2014 the average dic content of water dropped to the lowest level in the study year 27 0 mg l perhaps because of the rapid release of co2 from the well mixed water the annual total dic influx of the wujiangdu reservoir in the study year was 453 k ton c and the outflow was 440 k ton c indicating about 3 14 was retained lost by the reservoir the process of dic consumption occurs via the following three pathways fig 5 1 outgassing at the air water surface 3 3 2 removal by phytoplankton photosynthesis and calcium carbonate precipitation 10 8 and 3 degassing emission at spillways turbines and downstream of the dams 5 8 the process of dic generation also occurs through three pathways fig 5 1 from the inflowing river to the reservoir 2 dissolution of the calcium carbonate at the bottom of the reservoir and 3 degradation of the bottom om 13 5 however the processes of dic consumption and generation varied among seasons although the dic export is less affected by damming the waters have been affected by the reservoir system in agreement with previous studies climate and disturbance were found to have a major impact on primary productivity nutrient cycling and decomposition of om in the river reservoir system hart et al 2013 tian et al 2015 as shown by the calculations the bottom region became a carbon source due to degradation of organic matter and the surface region formed a carbon sink due to phytoplankton photosynthesis in the warm season human intervention could accelerate water mixing which could reduce surface phytoplankton growth and improve water quality management 5 conclusion the impoundment of rivers for hydroelectric power generation has led to changes in aquatic carbon cycle and water quality by converting terrestrial ecosystems into lakes the processes involved in dic transformation are difficult to accurately constrain because the pathways are complex this study investigated multiple processes affecting carbon transportations at the different section from the inflowing river to the reservoir we collected and analyzed samples from four vertical water profiles in the reservoir to gain insight into the spatial processes occurring in the reservoir our study suggests that the primary factors controlling dic dynamics during the study period were climate and artificial flow regulation the primary mechanisms and processes regulating dic in the study area can be summarized as follows the subtropical monsoon climate causes highly variable water temperature and rainfall during the cold season in order to meet the demand for power generation the reservoir releases water while during the warm season reservoir storage begins to increase this anti seasonal storage pattern causes contrasting hydrodynamic conditions and affects the hrt biological and abiotic processes and ultimately dic variations in our study water level discharge dic flux and pco2 values of the reservoir water always followed in the trend summer autumn winter spring which were responsible for the transport and transformation of dic thus the climatic conditions and artificial regulation form a unique spatial and temporal pattern in dic concentrations the results of this study suggest hrt could be adjusted artificially in accordance with seasonal change to form a new reservoir operation mode and change hydraulic conditions for improvement of water quality in the river reservoir system of the karst region it is essential that further work needs to be conducted in the future such as more detailed analyses of the biogeochemical setting of reservoirs and application of accurate geochemical modeling to explore the aquatic carbon cycle declaration of interest none acknowledgments

6430,in order to advance our understanding of the driving factors controlling carbon dynamics and evolution of water quality in river reservoir systems for the generation of hydropower we conducted a study in a karst deep water reservoir wujiangdu reservoir southwest china water samples were collected from the inflow outflow of the wujiangdu reservoir four vertical columns along the reservoir and from three tributaries to the reservoir in january april july and october 2017 the dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations and carbon isotope composition δ13cdic varied greatly 1 99 3 45 mmol l and 10 7 to 6 0 respectively and were controlled by multiple processes including co2 outgassing primary production and organic matter degradation in the four vertical profiles the difference between the values of samples with those at 15 m of δ dic and δ δ13cdic δ dic and δca2 in the same water column had positive correlations and the variation in dissolved o2 partial pressure of co2 and flux of co2 suggested that primary production dominated above the epilimnion and degradation of om dominated below the epilimnion during the warm season continuous co2 outgassing was found from riverine water to surface water of the reservoir before the dam based on carbon isotopic compositions and water chemistry these processes would cause isotopic fractionation between the residual dic and co2 aqueous the degree of which varied among different seasons july april october january carbon transport and biogeochemical processes were highly controlled by the hydraulic retention time hrt in the river reservoir system it was estimated that approximately 71 5 of the annual dic flux was produced in the water column below 15 m depth during the study year suggesting that the processes of dic generation and consumption occurred at the same time the results highlight that carbon behavior in the impounded rivers is influenced by multiple processes the carbon transformation processes should be taken into account for improving the estimation accuracy of the carbon budget calculations and the management of water quality for river reservoir systems keywords dissolved inorganic carbon carbon isotope biogeochemical processes reservoir hydraulic retention time hrt 1 introduction rivers act as the major pathway for transporting of terrestrial materials to the oceans cole et al 2007 raymond and hamilton 2018 a large number of dams have been built in rivers over the past 60 years for flood control irrigation navigation sediment control and hydropower generation purposes lehner et al 2011 lu et al 2018a teodoru et al 2013 wcd 2000 wen et al 2017 especially in china china has 23 842 dams with heights over 15 m representing 40 92 of the world s dams in 2015 icold 2018 owing to the fact there are over 68 of the country s hydropower resources in southwestern china the construction of dams is particularly intense in this region li et al 2017 impounding rivers with dams affect the transport of carbon to the ocean and thus the global carbon cycle cole 2013 kemenes et al 2007 oh and raymond 2006 raymond and hamilton 2018 raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 previous studies have estimated the dic flux to oceans varying from 0 4 pg yr bauer et al 2013 richey 2004 and 0 6 pg yr cai 2011 to 0 9 pg yr li and bush 2015 river damming also modifies riverine fluxes of nutrients

fearnside and pueyo 2012 kemenes et al 2007 van geldern et al 2015 wen et al 2017 therefore there still exists a debate as to whether hydro power generated by dams is a green form of energy tranvik et al 2009 the effect of damming has already attracted much attention from the scientific and wider communities however the complex internal carbon cycle of dam river systems and the environmental effect of damming has still not been fully understood prairie et al 2017 for example there are inadequate data to evaluate dic variations particularly as a result of the processes of transport and transformation of carbon occurring between rivers and the reservoirs during different seasons rivers are fragmented and form a river reservoir system due to dam construction which makes the carbon cycle complex in the system stable isotopes of dic δ 13cdic has become an important indicator to trace processes within the carbon cycle anderson et al 2009 van geldern et al 2015 there are many factors influencing dic production and consumption such as outgassing of co2 removal of dic during primary production degradation of organic matter om and carbonate deposition dissolution in karst reservoirs waters in chinese karst regions is one of the highest producers of inorganic carbon released to the atmospheric co2 reservoir in the world due to the extensive area of carbonate rocks in those regions liu et al 2016 despite the widely distributed of karst landforms in china research on the carbon cycle of river reservoir systems in karst regions and its relevance to the global carbon cycle is still insufficient a high soil co2 efflux of 1392 122 6 g c m 2 year 1 was reported in karst area in central part of guizhou province southwest china liu et al 2012 the major form of dic in rivers in karst region is bicarbonate hco3 and chemical weathering is the main generation mechanism controlling dic in reservoirs carbonate dissolution rapidly and constantly consumes soil co2 to form hco3 which is subsequently delivered to rivers lu et al 2018b oh and raymond 2006 shen et al 2017 zhong et al 2017 and accelerates the processes of catchment carbon transfer dic in rivers in carbonate regions is mainly derived from two sources namely allochthonous and autochthonous sources liu 2007 the allochthonous dic is derived from watershed erosion e g chemical weathering of carbonates and the soil zone while the autochthonous sources are mainly from processes such as degradation and decomposition of organic matter major rivers are vital for the global carbon cycle but the important role of smaller rivers and streams has been recently realized and the processes occurring within these systems requires more attention borges et al 2015 butman and raymond 2011 cole 2013 raymond et al 2013 studying impounded rivers in the southwest china karst region will inform on the mechanisms controlling carbon cycling in this environment and potentially provide transferrable model parameters for other reservoirs in the world in this study we explored the various processes affected dic using δ 13cdic which was a powerful tool to understand the sources and fate of the carbon in rivers and reservoirs alling et al 2012 aucour et al 1999 de montety et al 2011 samanta et al 2015 this investigation was carried out at a medium sized reservoir in a karst region southwest china we used δ13cdic dic concentrations water temperature t dissolved oxygen do calcium ion ca2 co2 partial pressure pco2 and diffusion flux of co2 fco2 to address the following objectives 1 understanding the changing mechanisms of dic cycling from river to reservoir in different seasons 2 exploring the fractionation process of dic at the water atmosphere interface in different seasons and 3 revealing seasonal changes in dic flux production and consumption mechanisms addressing these objectives will improve the knowledge base underpinning how to best manage reservoirs to minimize their environmental impact hence providing cleaner energy thus one of the most important goals of this study is to explore the process of limnological evolution in impounded rivers and elucidate the key carbon sources and sinks in this environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the wujiangdu reservoir supplementary text s1 was the first large scale hydropower station of wujiang river constructed in the early

400 μatm calculated from https www esrl noaa gov gmd ccgg trends full html we estimated k to be 10 cm h in the inflow and outflow waters and 3 cm h in the reservoir area based on the work of wang et al 2014 3 results 3 1 water chemistry the water temperature in the wujangdu reservoir had a significant response to atmospheric temperature variations ranging from 12 8 c to 29 8 c mean 18 5 c sd 3 5 supplementary fig s1 water temperature varied in a narrow range during the cold season than the warm season and water temperature decreased with increasing water depth during the warm season the storage capacity and water release increased first and then decreased from january to october while the retention time showed an opposite trend and periodically stratification of the reservoir occurs in this study the reservoir had obvious thermal stratifications in spring and summer and gradually disappeared in autumn and winter this phenomenon can be seen from the vertical variation of t do ph and other parameters supplementary figs s2 4 tables s1 and s2 thus we defined 0 5 m as the epilimnion 5 15 m as the thermocline and water below 15 m as the hypolimnion which is similar to previous studies han et al 2017 wang et al 2014 the water in the river reservoir system was low in alkalinity and ph ranged from 7 32 to 8 54 do concentrations ranged from 0 32 mg l to 16 22 mg l mean 7 84 mg l sd 2 51 for all samples do concentrations decreased with water depth in the warm season and remained stable in the cold season the seasonal variation in do was higher in the reservoir area than at other sites and also higher at sites closer to the dam outlet than further away from the dam water chemistry showed significant seasonal and spatial variations in the wujiangdu river reservoir system ca2 accounted for 73 of the total cations in the reservoir area ca2 concentrations ranged from 1 36 mmol l to 2 35 mmol l mean 1 63 mmol l sd 0 15 mmol l in the all samples indicating that the water was rich in ca2 across the whole study area ca2 concentrations ranged from 1 36 to 1 76 mmol l mean 1 59 mmol l in the reservoir and increased with depth in january there was a decreasing trend of sic 0 with water depth indicating that calcite tended to be dissolved at deeper depths of the reservoir however calcite precipitation rates in the epilimnion tended to be greater in the warm season than in the cold season supplementary fig s4 the water ph ranged between 7 51 and 8 54 supplementary fig s2 indicating the carbonate system in the main channel was dominated by hco3 which is the major component of dic 95 ca2 was the dominant cation in the wujiang river due to the weathering of permian and triassic carbonate rocks liu 2007 3 2 variability of the pco2 f co2 the pco2 in the surface reservoir water and f co2 at the reservoir water air interface showed clear seasonal patterns in 2017 supplementary figs s2 and s3 which were similar to those observed in the previous study wang et al 2014 in the reservoir area pco2 ranged from 455 7 to 8238 1 μatm mean 3086 9 μatm sd 1487 1 μatm and was often supersaturated relative to the atmosphere leading to rapid co2 degassing in the warm season pco2 in the surface water had lower values nearly in equilibrium with the atmosphere and generally decreased close to the dam pco2 values were higher in the outflow water and increased with increasing depth in all seasons in the cold season the range of pco2 values was smaller and the difference between the outflow and reservoir area was smaller than in the warm season however the pco2 values of the surface water in the reservoir area were much higher in the cold season than in the warm season the pco2 values were always high in the bottom water close to the dam f co2 values were lower in the reservoir area in the warm season 8 58 mmol m2 d sd 7 76 mmol m2 d than in the cold season mean 59 28 mmol m2 d sd 9 54 mmol m2 d the values of f co2 and pco2 in the outflow river showed distinctive seasonal patterns summer autumn winter spring supplementary fig s2 but the inflow river and tributaries varied in a narrow range 3 3 dic and δ 13cdic dic concentrations showed seasonal variations at the surface and stratified waters overall dic concentrations ranged from 1 99 mmol l to 3 45 mmol l mean 2 50 mmol l sd 0 27 mmol l and varied more in the warm season 1 99 3 45 mmol l mean 2 51 mmol l than in the cold season 2 20 3 14 mmol l mean 2 39 mmol l dic concentrations of the surface water in the warm season mean 2 24 mmol l were much lower than in the cold season mean 2 37 mmol l dic concentrations remained stable in water of the river inflow 2 36 0 06 mmol l and river outflow 2 51 0 12 mmol l dic concentrations were significantly higher in tributaries than that in the main stream but varied in a narrow range supplementary fig s2 the δ 13cdic values ranged from 10 7 to 6 0 mean 9 2 sd 1 1 in the study area and showed large temporal and spatial fluctuations in the reservoir in the surface water although δ 13cdic values were higher in the warm season mean 7 2 than in the cold season mean 9 3 changed little under the epilimnion both in the warm season and in the cold season in the warm season as the water temperature increased the reservoir stratified and had increases in do as well as in δ 13cdic in the surface water while pco2 fco2 and ca2 decreased however the δ 13cdic values in the bottom water were more negative and stable throughout the year 9 8 0 5 since april to september is the warm wet season and the water is greatly disturbed by high rainfall the δ 13cdic varied significantly along the river channel and δ 13cdic responded to reservoir stratification biological activity would have caused the enrichment of δ 13cdic in the surface waters while the bottom area was characterized by lower δ 13cdic values in the cold season δ 13cdic values were more depleted over the entire profiles especially in october fig 2 4 discussion the variation in dic concentrations and δ13cdic observed in the river reservoir system in this study were caused by a combination of biogeochemical processes such as outgassing of co2 biological processes precipitation or dissolution of calcite and respiration and degradation of om by considering both dic and δ13cdic we can therefore gain insights into these processes an equation relating dic to δ13cdic and a graph indicating the effects of each of these processes on the dic concentrations and δ13cdic were developed fig 3 4 1 processes affecting dic concentrations and δ 13cdic δ13cdic varied largely between the epilimnion and the hypoliminon fig 2 especially in the upper 15 m the water below the depth of 15 m showed better physical and chemical stability i e t ph do ec pco2 while other parameters changed little with increasing depth in all seasons the water chemistry parameters at 15 m depth δ13cdic 9 4 0 4 dic 2 45 0 20 mmol l were similar to those in the input river waters δ13cdic 9 6 0 6 dic 2 36 0 06 mmol l and the chemical properties were relatively stable this is perhaps because 15 m is above the dead water level throughout all seasons which is generally the boundary between the thermocline and hypolimnion and the depth at which water starts to be less affected by light and discharge for power generation the specific calculation formula can be defined by the following equations 2 δ δ 13 c dic δ 13 c dic sample δ 13 c dic 15 m 3 δ dic dic sample dic 15 m where δ δ13cdic and δ dic represent the difference between the δ 13cdic and dic values of samples versus these values at 15 m in the same water column respectively 4 1 1 outgassing co2 and primary production in fig 3 most of the data from surface water falls in quadrant a with a faster rate of decrease of δ dic with increasing δ δ13cdic than other samples which could be ascribed to the outgassing of co2 caused by photosynthesis the pco2 values in the surface reservoir area were higher than those in the air for the majority of the study year supplementary fig s2 isotopic fractionation occurs during the release of co2 from surface water to the atmosphere causing 13c enriched in residual dic during the cold dry season photosynthesis at the surface is reduced and respiration is the dominant process barros et al 2011 the stratification of the water body gradually disappeared in the autumn which would have caused the accumulated co2 at the bottom to gradually rise to the surface and escape to the atmosphere causing the significant decrease of δ 13cdic values especially in the autumn photosynthesis increases with increasing water temperature resulting in more dissolved co2 to be absorbed in the reservoir and consequently algal blooms in the warm season e g chlorophyta dinophyta and cyanophyta gamier et al 1995 yao et al 2007 han et al 2017 found that the concentrations of chlorophyll increased rapidly from january 1 35 μg l to july 40 64 μg l in the surface water of the reservoir the significant decrease in dissolved co2 would then cause the dic concentrations to decrease guo et al 2015 wang et al 2018 due to the gradual stratification of the water column in spring the rate of dic exchange between the upper and lower waters diminished however the dic removal by photosynthesis caused dic concentrations to decrease in the surface waters of the reservoir phytoplankton preferentially uptakes the lighter 12c bardhan et al 2017 maberly et al 2012 therefore the epilimnion becomes enriched in 13c which eventually leads to an increase in δ δ13cdic the δ dic values were significantly lower in the warm season than in the cold season in the cold season in order to meet the demand for power generation and prevent flooding during the wet season water was gradually released reaching its lowest level the stratification of water levels between april and july may cause the variation in hrt and dic concentrations in the surface water between these periods fig 3 c1 and c2 previous studies have confirmed that phytoplankton bloom in april after the cold season gamier et al 1995 yao et al 2007 the difference between the δ δ13cdic values of the c1 and c2 groups could be caused by the increased oxygen exchange rate in july this accelerates aerobic mineralization of om increasing the production rate of dic in the reservoir stratification occurs under high water temperature in summer and was most pronounced close to the dam owing to the high discharge of rivers entering the dam supplementary figs s2 and s3 the lower discharge rates in april than in july also caused the variation in δ δ13cdic along the river course to be smaller in april due to the lower river lacustrine gradient the seasonal release of water in reservoirs leads to variation in hrt between seasons with hrt being lowest in july affecting the river hydrodynamics which leads to the enrichment of dic in heavy isotopes along the river course in july the changes in dic concentrations in the water profile at different distances from the dam need to be considered to understand the carbon cycling in the reservoir system it is difficult to distinguish the effects of algal photosynthesis and outgassing of co2 for samples in quadrant a fig 3 because these two processes have similar influences on the values of dic concentrations and δ13cdic values alling et al 2012 samanta et al 2015 however we found that the intensity of the processes varied between seasons pco2 and f co2 values in the warm season were lower than in the cold season which indicated that the rate of photosynthesis was higher in the warm season and the dominant process controlling dic in the epilimnion overall nearly all the warm season reservoir surface samples were plotted in quadrant a fig 3 and cold season samples were plotted in c3 and quadrant c fig 3 indicating photosynthesis and mixing of dic in the water column were important processes controlling dic and δ13cdic in the study period it can be concluded that the role of primary production is more significant than degradation of om in the epilimnion during the warm season while the degradation of om was the dominant process in the cold season 4 1 2 degradation of organic matter the continuous flow of terrestrial and autochthonous organic matter into the waters has a great impact on dic concentrations raymond et al 2013 zhong et al 2018 the flux of sediments is 1 39 109g yr in the wujiangdu reservoir yang et al 2017 and forms a major input in the carbon cycle of the river reservoir system δ dic and δ δ13cdic show a negative correlation fig 3 the samples from the bottom of the reservoir in all four seasons plot in quadrant c and group c4 and a previous study showed that doc concentrations decrease with increasing water depth han et al 2017 indicating that degradation of om always occurs in this environment the process of om degradation would increase the concentrations of dic and decrease the δ13cdic value de montety et al 2011 autochthonous om in the reservoir can be divided into two major pools one is the algal biomass in the surface waters phytoplankton from wujiangdu reservoir account for 80 of the annual sedimentation per year yang et al 2017 do also increased with the decrease of δ dic in the surface waters indicating that this reaction does occur supplementary figs s5 and s6 the other pool is the om in the bottom of the reservoir from the riverine inputs the increase of δ dic and the decrease of δ δ13cdic suggest the generation of dic via degradation of organic matter supplementary fig s6 b resuspended sedimentary om and settling biological om would be degraded in the reservoir causing an increase in δ dic with a corresponding decrease in do and photosynthesis becomes negligible as water depth increases in the warm season the water column was stratified causing water temperature to decrease markedly with depth while pco2 increased supplementary fig s6 dic was hence enriched in the hypolimnion fig 3c3 while pco2 in surface waters was close to atmospheric pco2 and fco2 was much lower than in the cold season although the decomposition of om occurs at the bottom of the reservoir occurs it has little effect on the dic concentrations in the epilimnion because of thermal stratification thus discharge causes more co2 outgassing to the atmosphere therefore releasing water from the reservoir in the warm season causes the runoff to become a carbon source barros et al 2011 fearnside and pueyo 2012 tranvik et al 2009 in the cold season reservoir stratification does not occur and accumulated dic would mix rapidly the δ13cdic fig 3c3 pco2 supplementary fig s5 a and δ t supplementary fig s5 b show little variation in the water column fig 3c3 4 1 3 precipitation and dissolution of carbonate precipitation of carbonate is a major process in karst areas and a few samples fell in the quadrant d fig 3 this process was particularly evident in the epilimnion during the warm season which caused the decreases in ca2 concentrations and δ ca2 and δ dic in the water column showed a good correlation responsible for the precipitation of carbonate supplementary fig s6 r2 0 54 at the commencement of the rainy season the weathering intensity increases rapidly leading to high fluxes of dic and ca2 flowing into the river co2 outgassing and photosynthesis enhance the precipitation of carbonate during daylight leading to surface water being over saturated with calcite de montety et al 2011 hartley et al 1996 as 13c is preferentially precipitated during carbonate mineral precipitation this process causes carbon isotope fractionation in dic species romanek et al 1992 photosynthesis by phytoplankton removes co2 aq from the water eq 4 increasing the ph and decreasing the solubility of calcite hence calcite precipitation would be accelerated in the warm season 4 caco 3 co 2 h 2 o hco 3 ca 2 caco 3 x co 2 h 2 o 1 x ch 2 o o 2 in the cold season the stratification gradually recedes and disappears and the upwelling of dic from the bottom of the reservoir further accelerates the sedimentation of carbonate sic supplementary fig s4 was greater than zero in the epilimnion all year round indicating that carbonate precipitation plays an important role in the epilimnion based on estimation of the inorganic carbon ic concentrations at the surface of the sediment the deposition flux of ic in the reservoir could reach up to 89 3 g m2 y and the content of ic in the bottom water is stable at around 1 52 yang et al 2017 in the quadrant b fig 3 both δ dic and δ δ13cdic increased which can be ascribed to the dissolution of carbonate we could also observe the process of carbonate dissolution at the bottom area supplementary fig s4 this might be due to large amounts of co2 produced by the degradation of om in the bottom details in 4 1 2 resulting in low ph values although carbonate dissolution leads to the 13c enriched dic values δ13cdic values would not rise significantly which may be due to the degradation of om producing respired co2 lu et al 2018b in january constant carbonate precipitation supplementary fig s4 was probably due to the disappearance of thermal stratification allowing sufficient mixing of dic and ca2 thus it can be concluded that dissolution of carbonate followed by the degradation of om and related processes can explain the trends observed in the decreased δδ13cdic and sic fig 3 and supplementary figs s4 and s5 4 2 carbon isotope fractionation of dic outgassing of co2 from water and primary production would cause isotopic fractionation between the residual dic and co2 aqueous the isotopic fractionation in relation to co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in rivers occurs primarily at tropical and sub tropical latitudes bloom et al 2010 borges et al 2015 lauerwald et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 availability of dic dictates the development and activity of biological structures in ecosystems orion jędrysek et al 2006 in our study we focused on the dic variation in the epilimnion starting from a depth of 15 m at 15 m primary dic sources are rivers om degradation and sedimentation of phytoplankton han et al 2017 the final concentrations of dic dic final is related to the initial dic concentrations dic i through the factor fpp the fraction of dic remaining in the water 5 dic final

where α is the fractionation factor outgassing and primary production would change the isotopic composition of the remaining dic in a similar way these processes therefore will change the δ 13cdic

1995 where δ13cfinal and δ13ci are the final and initial δ13cdic values respectively we chose eq 10 to calculate αco2 for different seasons and compared with eq 8 compared with the calculated fractionation curve fig 4 the actual degree of fractionation of δ13cdic values was july april october january and it can be observed from the gradient that the fractionation of dic increases gradually with the seasonally induced increase in photosynthesis considering the difference between the modeled fractionation curve and the actual values it is likely that co2 exchange occurs at the water atmosphere interface in the warm season when there is insufficient dissolved co2 to maintain the normal photosynthesis of planktonic algae atmospheric co2 will dissolve in the water and carbonic anhydrase ca of the algae e g cyanobacterial and microalgae converts the accumulated hco3 to co2 to participate in photosynthesis amoroso et al 1998 giordano et al 2003 maberly and madsen 2002 in july with the arrival of the rain the flow rate and water storage capacity increased and hrt was shortened fig 4 although the photosynthesis of phytoplankton was enhanced the consumed dic can be quickly replenished and the overall consumption of the epilimnion was less than in april as the dic was consumed δ13cdic increases concurrently and the degree of fractionation gradually increases which was probably due to the conducive photosynthesis of planktonic algae with the lowered levels of disturbance in the reservoir fractionation was enhanced in the warm season when artificial regulation changes the hrt the higher water temperature and rainfall increase the flow rate and chlorophyll levels increases barth and veizer 1999 and stratification becomes more pronounced the closer the distance to the dam the more stable the water was causing more pronounced isotope fractionation fig 3c2 overall hrt and the subtropical humid monsoon climate are the two most important physical characteristics driving dic dynamics in the river reservoir system the impact of these factors is mainly reflected in the following processes 1 the input and output of inorganic carbon organic carbon and other nutrient matter 2 appearance and disappearance of stratification at different time in the reservoir 3 the intensity of biological processes these effects eventually cause periodic changes of dic concentrations and δ13cdic values 4 3 generation consumption processes of dic in the typical karst reservoir in order to further understand the transport and transformation of dic we used formulas to calculate the related amount of dic and other variables supplementary text s3 in the warm season the calculated results suggest 330 k ton c of input and 321 k ton c of dic export the dic flux decreased by 2 88 due to water impoundment in the wujiangdu reservoir the increase in stratification in july resulted in a strong linear relationship between water temperature and isotopic composition supplementary fig s5 r2 0 90 indicating thermal stratification did enhance and cause the consumption of dic by algal photosynthesis although the δ dic varied considerably in the vertical profiles of the reservoir and the dic concentrations in the surface was lowest for the year 27 54 mg l about 73 of dic was generated in the waters and 71 5 was produced in the water column under 15 m the decomposition of organic matter contributed dic below 15 m so that dic content in the discharged water did not decrease significantly and δ13cdic was more depleted than in the bottom waters the primary sources and processes producing dic in summer are as follows 1 the weathering of carbonate rocks is enhanced in summer and contributes large amounts of dic to the watershed liu et al 2016 shen et al 2017 2 the stratification in summer leads to poor dic exchange and enhanced photosynthesis at the surface due to higher water temperature increases the difference between dic concentrations at 15 m depth and the reservoir bottom 15 8 mg l the dic concentrations at water depths of 0 1 m and 15 16 m were the lowest of the year thus thermal stratification gives a stable environment for decomposition of om and pic generation which is introduced by riverine input and can be biodegraded to dic by microbes kim 2015 the reduced disturbance of water flow in the reservoir area was conducive to the decomposition of om at the bottom and the dic content gradually increases to the highest level observed during the year 36 7 mg l which eventually affects the export of dic in the cold season the calculated results show 123 k ton c of dic input and 119 k ton c of export indicating the dic flux decreased by 3 85 through the reservoir system the reasons for the decrease are likely as follows 1 rainfall declined and the water flow decreased significantly water temperature decreased and the rate of organic mineralization slowed down 2 the disappearance of the thermal stratification allowed the release of carbon dioxide to occur and co2 was quickly released into the atmosphere in the autumn the dic concentrations in the bottom below 15 m was lower than that in the upper water 0 15 m with the fco2 values in outflow water being the highest of the year 272 4 mmol m2 d 5 times that in summer 9 times that in spring these values are similar to those observed in a previous study 272 1 mmol m2 d in the same area wang et al 2014 the average dic content of water dropped to the lowest level in the study year 27 0 mg l perhaps because of the rapid release of co2 from the well mixed water the annual total dic influx of the wujiangdu reservoir in the study year was 453 k ton c and the outflow was 440 k ton c indicating about 3 14 was retained lost by the reservoir the process of dic consumption occurs via the following three pathways fig 5 1 outgassing at the air water surface 3 3 2 removal by phytoplankton photosynthesis and calcium carbonate precipitation 10 8 and 3 degassing emission at spillways turbines and downstream of the dams 5 8 the process of dic generation also occurs through three pathways fig 5 1 from the inflowing river to the reservoir 2 dissolution of the calcium carbonate at the bottom of the reservoir and 3 degradation of the bottom om 13 5 however the processes of dic consumption and generation varied among seasons although the dic export is less affected by damming the waters have been affected by the reservoir system in agreement with previous studies climate and disturbance were found to have a major impact on primary productivity nutrient cycling and decomposition of om in the river reservoir system hart et al 2013 tian et al 2015 as shown by the calculations the bottom region became a carbon source due to degradation of organic matter and the surface region formed a carbon sink due to phytoplankton photosynthesis in the warm season human intervention could accelerate water mixing which could reduce surface phytoplankton growth and improve water quality management 5 conclusion the impoundment of rivers for hydroelectric power generation has led to changes in aquatic carbon cycle and water quality by converting terrestrial ecosystems into lakes the processes involved in dic transformation are difficult to accurately constrain because the pathways are complex this study investigated multiple processes affecting carbon transportations at the different section from the inflowing river to the reservoir we collected and analyzed samples from four vertical water profiles in the reservoir to gain insight into the spatial processes occurring in the reservoir our study suggests that the primary factors controlling dic dynamics during the study period were climate and artificial flow regulation the primary mechanisms and processes regulating dic in the study area can be summarized as follows the subtropical monsoon climate causes highly variable water temperature and rainfall during the cold season in order to meet the demand for power generation the reservoir releases water while during the warm season reservoir storage begins to increase this anti seasonal storage pattern causes contrasting hydrodynamic conditions and affects the hrt biological and abiotic processes and ultimately dic variations in our study water level discharge dic flux and pco2 values of the reservoir water always followed in the trend summer autumn winter spring which were responsible for the transport and transformation of dic thus the climatic conditions and artificial regulation form a unique spatial and temporal pattern in dic concentrations the results of this study suggest hrt could be adjusted artificially in accordance with seasonal change to form a new reservoir operation mode and change hydraulic conditions for improvement of water quality in the river reservoir system of the karst region it is essential that further work needs to be conducted in the future such as more detailed analyses of the biogeochemical setting of reservoirs and application of accurate geochemical modeling to explore the aquatic carbon cycle declaration of interest none acknowledgments

6431,lateral seepage can be an important water loss pathway at the field level and a conduit for the discharge of pesticides and nutrients from rice fields however few studies have directly measured lateral seepage rates in flooded rice fields this study sought to characterize the magnitude and variability of lateral seepage in california rice fields and to explore the relationship between lateral seepage and soil properties or hydrologic conditions lateral seepage was measured during the growing season at 50 locations spread across six rice fields using a methodology that operates analogously to a double ring infiltrometer lateral seepage rates varied over four orders of magnitude 0 05 33 11 cm2 h 1 or 0 0011 1 05 cm h 1 though even the highest rate measured was small compared to typical water inputs in california rice fields and lateral seepage corresponded to only 1 0 1 9 of water inputs at sites where irrigation inputs were measured lateral seepage was negatively correlated with levee width p 0 025 and the relative water height in the adjacent field supply canal or drainage ditch p 0 045 though this relationship explained little of the variation in lateral seepage rates marginal r2 0 129 contrary to expectations not all supply canals or higher flooded fields were a source for lateral seepage into fields as unsaturated zones present in most levees served as a sink for lateral seepage from both sides of the levee future research should examine the prevalence of preferential flow pathways in rice field levees and the potential for transport of nutrients or agrochemicals through these flow pathways keywords bund california lateral seepage levee rice water 1 introduction rice oryza sativa accounts for only 10 of global cropland yet rice fields are estimated to receive 23 43 of all irrigation water worldwide bouman et al 2007 grisp 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 evapotranspiration which is the major outflow in non rice cropping systems has been estimated at 680 to 870 mm season 1 for rice linquist et al 2015 montazar et al 2017 comparable to many other crops the high applied water footprint of rice production must therefore be explained by surface drainage from the field which is controlled by the farmer and percolation and lateral seepage which are uncontrolled losses at the field level percolation is the downward movement of water to below the rice root zone and lateral seepage is the subsurface movement of water through the levees sometimes referred to as bunds that border the rice fields bouman et al 2007 due to the influence of numerous hydrologic and edaphic factors lateral seepage losses from rice fields are highly variable for example a single study observed lateral seepage losses that ranged from 2 to 75 of the water inputs to each field tsubo et al 2007a lateral seepage losses at the field level are commonly recaptured and reused downstream and thus may not represent losses at the landscape level hafeez et al 2007 roost et al 2008 nonetheless lateral seepage may be an important consideration for reducing applied water at the field level as well as for controlling the off site transport of pesticides and nutrients lateral seepage is governed by darcy s law except in some cases of nonlaminar preferential flow which states that this flow will be a product of the hydraulic head gradient and the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil hillel 1998 the former is a function of the levee width and the relative water height on both sides of the levee or the relative groundwater height in cases where lateral seepage flows to the groundwater the latter the saturated hydraulic conductivity is an intrinsic property of each soil that depends on its total porosity and pore size distribution which in turn depend on soil texture and structure hillel 1998 saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density levee width soil texture and the relative difference in water height or hydraulic head all affect lateral seepage rates especially as these values go to their extremes these last three parameters are of particular interest as they affect the hydraulic head gradient and saturated hydraulic conductivity but can be measured in commercial rice fields without destructive sampling of the border levees quantifying the magnitude of lateral seepage losses is critical for understanding the potential for transport of agrochemicals and nutrients from rice fields lateral seepage has been studied through modeling efforts for its role in pesticide movement boulange et al 2014 phong et al 2011 and through both modeling liang et al 2007 liang et al 2014a and physical studies liang et al 2008 liang et al 2013 xu et al 2017 for its contribution to nutrient transport understanding lateral seepage is also critical to determining the potential impact of alternative irrigation practices that are designed to reduce applied water to rice fields for example alternate wetting and drying awd has been extensively investigated worldwide carrijo et al 2017 and field level water savings associated with awd are expected to come principally from reductions in percolation and lateral seepage lampayan et al 2015 the percent of applied water lost as lateral seepage will depend on the field area and perimeter janssen and lennartz 2009 and given the small field size associated with many awd studies e g abbasi and sepaskhah 2011 de vries et al 2010 dunn and gaydon 2011 feng et al 2007 quantifying lateral seepage on commercial scale rice fields should provide a better estimate of the potential for reducing applied water with novel irrigation management strategies despite the important role lateral seepage may play in field level water losses and agrochemical movement relatively few studies have directly measured lateral seepage from rice fields during the growing season janssen and lennartz 2008 janssen and lennartz 2009 liang et al 2008 liang et al 2013 or used a water balance to estimate lateral seepage separately rather than combined percolation and lateral seepage agrawal et al 2004 kukal and aggarwal 2002 tsubo et al 2007a wopereis et al 1994 there has been little research on lateral seepage in california rice production even though rice is grown on over 200 000 ha and agricultural water use is frequently under scrutiny in the heavily irrigated and drought prone state usda 2017 linquist et al 2015 developed a water balance in commercial california rice fields and estimated combined percolation and lateral seepage the residual term based on the difference method at 27 cm or 15 of the total water input the authors suggested that this combined loss was principally due to lateral seepage after comparing the combined loss with saturated hydraulic conductivity data from an earlier study liang et al 2014b and speculated that drainage ditches surrounding some fields may have been responsible for the relatively higher lateral seepage rates linquist et al 2015 given the increasing pressure on growers to reduce applied water and the need to avoid pesticide transport through rice field levees it is important to understand the magnitude and variability of lateral seepage in california rice fields our objectives in this study were to 1 quantify the variability in lateral seepage rates for levees typical of california rice fields 2 situate field level lateral seepage losses within the context of water inputs to rice fields and 3 determine whether variability in lateral seepage rates was correlated with soil properties or hydrologic conditions that water managers could non destructively measure in commercial rice fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites lateral seepage measurements were taken from border levees of five commercial rice fields spread throughout the sacramento valley and at the california cooperative rice research foundation s rice experiment station in biggs ca fig 1 sites were chosen to be representative of california rice fields and to ensure adequate geographic representation table 1 a total of 50 direct measurements were made during the 2017 growing season with four to twelve measurements at each site measurements were made at randomized locations on all border levees at three sites and at randomized locations on select levees at the other three sites to ensure that the diversity of levees around california rice fields was appropriately captured levees may border supply canals drainage ditches fallow fields or flooded fields with a higher or lower relative water height fig 2 a 2d border levees typically double as unpaved roads in california rice fields and this was the case for all but four measurements in this study which were made on smaller levees with no roads fig 2e all levees were composed of native soil and were constructed at least a decade prior to this study sacramento valley soils on the valley floor generally have a high clay content and are dominated by smectitic clays whereas soils on the eastern margin of the valley have a lower clay content and a mixed mineralogy table 1 the regional groundwater table is generally close to the soil surface 0 5 3 0 m at the start of the growing season for most of the valley floor state of california 2018 though restrictive layers cemented with silica and carbonates are present approximately 1 0 m below the soil surface at some sites table 1 and may limit interaction between the regional groundwater and shallower groundwater 2 2 lateral seepage measurements direct lateral seepage measurements were made using a modified version of the three sided metal frames introduced by janssen and lennartz 2009 frames were driven 25 cm into the soil at the intersection of the floodwater and the border levee so that the floodwater covered approximately half of the area encompassed by the frame and the open side of the frame was parallel with the levee fig 3 even though the fields were flooded for the measurements nested frames were used to create a situation analogous to double ring infiltrometers to minimize the effect of small fluctuations in field water height from wind or diurnal cycles of evapotranspiration janssen and lennartz 2009 reynolds 2007 a constant water height in both frames was maintained using mariotte bottles which were positioned to maintain the frame water height at the field water height at the onset of the measurement frames were covered with reflective insulation to minimize evaporation and the residual evaporation from a specimen cup inside the frame was measured and subtracted from lateral seepage rates similarly percolation was measured at three locations in each field and the average percolation rate was subtracted from the lateral seepage rate percolation was measured using a methodology adapted from the international rice research institute s water requirement meter irri 1987 and the seepage meters commonly used in stream hydrology limnology and oceanography lee 1977 briefly 30 cm diameter pvc rings were inserted to 20 25 cm below the soil surface 5 15 cm into the plow pan and covered with vented lids to minimize evaporation while allowing equilibration of air pressure a flexible polyethylene bag attached to the ring s side allowed hydraulic head to equilibrate between the ring and the field this bag was completely emptied into the ring for weekly ring water height measurements although lateral seepage rates may change over time measurements for each individual frame location were generally conducted in a single day 3 8 h or until a consistent measurement was obtained as the limited number of nested frames 4 necessitated a choice between breadth and depth of measurement coverage with the former more relevant to our research objectives all lateral seepage measurements were taken at least six weeks after the fields were initially flooded which allowed time for the levees to equilibrate with the flooded field direct lateral seepage measurements have variably been presented as a volume flux per unit area e g liang et al 2008 or as a volume flux per unit length of levee e g janssen and lennartz 2009 while the former is in the same form as darcy s law in practice the boundary between lateral seepage and vertical percolation and thus the area over which a volume water flux is measured is difficult to determine for this reason and other reasons discussed by janssen and lennartz 2009 we chose to use the latter units and treat lateral seepage as an edge effect dependent on the length of levee measured that is the average percolation rate measured elsewhere in the field was subtracted out and the resultant measurement was considered lateral seepage however we also provide units of volume flux per unit area for ease of comparison by considering the area of the open face of the metal frame below the field water level 2 3 lateral seepage measurement quality control janssen and lennartz 2008 2009 validated the seepage measurement methodology used in this study with dye tracers and levee dissection repeating this work was not feasible given the number of levees we investigated and that it required the levees to be deconstructed which was not possible in commercial fields however every effort was made to ensure the accuracy of measurements and to verify that any water lost from the frames entered the levee rather than the field water exchange between the frame and the field was restricted by 1 maintaining the water height in both frames at the field water height to prevent a hydraulic head gradient from forming and 2 ensuring good contact between the frame and the soil by adding and compacting soil into any cracks between the soil and the frame as this was done only in the area immediately adjacent to the frame 10 of the frame length the effect on lateral seepage rates should be negligible a potassium chloride kcl tracer chosen for its lack of toxicity ease of use and availability leibundgut and seibert 2011 mastrocicco et al 2011 was applied to one frame per site to verify the absence of significant water exchange between the field and the frame by monitoring the electrical conductivity ec in the outer frame and the immediately adjacent field floodwater no increase in ec relative to a control frame not spiked with kcl was observed in either the field or the outer frame auger holes were also cored into the levee at one site and the ec of the water in the holes was measured directly in front of the frame and at progressive distances from the frame along the levee to confirm that water from the frame was moving into the levee auger holes in front of the outer frame which was not spiked with kcl and the immediately adjacent field showed no increase in ec compared to a random location along the levee as expected auger holes in front of the inner frame showed an increase in ec especially closer to the intersection of the levee and the field floodwater 2 4 soil sampling and field measurements levee width field water depth groundwater elevation and the relative water height in the adjacent supply canal drainage ditch or field hereafter referred to as adjacent water height were measured in the field at each location where a lateral seepage measurement was made the water height in the adjacent supply canal flooded field or drainage ditch was measured using a nsl100b builder s level tripod and rod northwest instrument mt olive nj for adjacent fallow fields the depth to reach groundwater as determined by free water in soil cores pulled from an auger hole in the fallow field was added to the soil surface elevation levee width was measured as the horizontal distance between the field water levee interface and the adjacent water levee interface field water depth was measured at three points 30 40 cm from the back of the lateral seepage frame a 6 cm wide dutch auger was used to core into the center of the levee until free water was observed in the soil removed from the auger bucket or until a confining layer e g a duripan or chemically cemented layer was reached the depth at which free water was observed in soil samples was recorded as the groundwater height any soil from the auger hole above the elevation of the water on either side of the levee was discarded the complete soil sample was divided into horizons based on defining visual features such as consistence soil texture soil color water content etc and samples were taken at the midpoint of each horizon intact cores at depth could not be obtained as this would require destructive sampling of the levees in commercial rice fields and therefore saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density could not be measured 2 5 soil particle size analysis soil samples were air dried ground and passed through a 2 mm sieve for textural analysis 5 00 g of the sample was weighed into a 50 ml centrifuge tube mixed with 5 g l 1 sodium metaphosphate nao3p and shaken overnight on a mechanical shaker the presence of significant carbonates was evaluated visually with 1 m hydrochloric acid hcl and samples were pre treated with 1 m sodium acetate c2h3o2na adjusted to ph 5 to remove carbonates as necessary the percent clay was determined using the micro pipette method miller and miller 1987 with laboratory duplicates for each soil sample the percent sand was determined by wet sieving the dispersed soil sample through a 53 µm sieve finally a depth weighted average was calculated for percent sand and percent clay based on the estimated thickness of the soil horizons in the field 2 6 data analysis all data analysis was done in r version 3 5 0 r core team 2018 and data visualization was performed using the ggplot2 package wickham 2009 to investigate the relationship between variation in lateral seepage rates and measured soil properties or hydrologic conditions the lme function of the nlme package was used for a linear mixed effects model pinheiro et al 2018 as percent sand percent clay or both could be used to represent soil texture and the two variables were correlated only percent clay was considered in the analysis due to its greater range of variation and the nature of its relationship with lateral seepage as the model residuals did not satisfy the assumption of normality due to leptokurtosis shapiro wilk w 0 927 p 0 005 a lambert w transformation was applied to the lateral seepage data goerg 2011 at which point the residuals satisfied the assumption shapiro wilk w 0 970 p 0 243 however the models with the original and transformed data yielded nearly identical results so the original data is used to simplify the interpretation of results 3 results and discussion 3 1 lateral seepage magnitude and variability in california rice fields lateral seepage measurements at the 50 locations in six california rice fields varied over four orders of magnitude fig 4 with the highest value 33 11 cm2 hr 1 or 1 05 cm hr 1 recorded for a narrow levee with no road bordering a drainage ditch fig 2e the lowest positive value 0 05 cm2 hr 1 or 1 1 10 3 cm hr 1 recorded for a levee with a dirt road bordered by a supply canal fig 2a and the overall lowest value 17 10 cm2 hr 1 or 0 48 cm hr 1 showing an influx of water to the field for a levee with a gravel road bordered by a higher flooded field fig 2d despite this variability all measured lateral seepage rates were low relative to total water inputs or evapotranspiration losses for example the highest lateral seepage rate measured corresponds to 7 3 cm per season for a hypothetical square 25 ha field that is bordered by drainage ditches on all sides and flooded for 115 days in contrast applied water to california rice fields averages 137 cm johnson and cody 2015 the mean lateral seepage rate across all sites and locations was 5 35 cm2 hr 1 or 0 16 cm hr 1 which can be interpreted as 5 35 cm3 or ml of water passing through each cm of perimeter levee length per hour std dev 8 70 cm2 hr 1 std error 1 23 cm2 hr 1 directly measured lateral seepage rates in other studies ranged from 0 017 to 4 3 cm2 hr 1 for a levee bordered by a drainage ditch in a clay loam soil liang et al 2008 liang et al 2013 and from 10 8 to 43 7 cm2 hr 1 for a levee with a loam and clay loam soil texture bordered by a lower flooded field janssen and lennartz 2009 despite these measurements being made at a single site in each study the ranges are consistent with the 0 34 33 11 cm2 hr 1 range of lateral seepage measurements on levees bordered by drainage ditches in this study most water balance studies report combined percolation and lateral seepage losses rather than each component individually due to the difficulty in quantifying them separately bouman et al 2005 devkota et al 2013 mcdonald et al 2006 mohanty et al 2004 linquist et al 2015 even in those water balance studies that do report lateral seepage separately from percolation lateral seepage is frequently given in a single dimension that is based on the area and perimeter of the field but these dimensions are often not reported as discussed in janssen and lennartz 2009 however for the few water balance studies that reported lateral seepage and field dimensions lateral seepage rates were 0 17 1 98 cm2 hr 1 kukal and aggarwal 2002 and 67 cm2 hr 1 wopereis et al 1994 which is generally consistent with the rates reported in this study while reporting seasonal lateral seepage losses as an equivalent height of water in the field can make it difficult to compare across locations as it depends on the field area and perimeter it is still useful to situate lateral seepage within the context of other water balance components field level lateral seepage losses extrapolated for the entire growing season were only 1 4 cm 1 5 cm and 2 3 cm at sites 2 3 and 4 respectively the three fields where districts measured irrigation inputs and at least two measurements were taken in all four border levees table 2 using this irrigation input data outflow from lateral seepage corresponds to 1 2 1 0 and 1 9 of the total season long water inputs at sites 2 3 and 4 respectively table 2 this small contribution to the rice field water balance in california stands in contrast to the substantial field level water losses from lateral seepage in many rice growing regions likely due in part to differences in field size and soil texture whereas large fields 14 46 ha table 2 and clay rich soils 38 70 figure s2 table 1 are typical of california s sacramento valley 90 of global rice production comes from 1 ha fields tonini and cabrera 2011 and rice is grown on 14 4 million ha with coarse textured soils worldwide haefele et al 2014 yadav et al 2011 reported lateral seepage rates corresponding to 16 38 of total water inputs in india attributable largely to small plot size and the resulting high perimeter to area ratio similarly high losses from lateral seepage have been observed in india kukal and aggarwal 2002 and the philippines wopereis et al 1994 and while most commercial fields in these countries are larger than the experimental plots in these studies they are still much smaller than california rice fields tsubo et al 2007a reported lateral seepage losses representing 2 75 of total water inputs in thailand corresponding to clay contents ranging from 4 to 47 illustrating the potential for higher contributions of lateral seepage to the rice field water balance in regions with coarse textured soils 3 2 lateral seepage hydrologic conditions and soil properties the substantial relative variability in lateral seepage from rice fields reported here though small compared to irrigation inputs and the variability reported elsewhere reflect the fact that many different edaphic and hydrologic factors may affect lateral seepage here we measured levee width percent clay percent sand groundwater elevation field water height and adjacent water height figure s2 it was determined that accurate and representative bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements could not be made without destructive sampling of the levee saturated hydraulic conductivity can be highly spatially variable even in texturally homogenous soils due in a large part to variation in bulk density morbidelli et al 2017 and therefore measuring these parameters would have required multiple intact cores to be obtained at depth which was not possible in the commercial rice fields studied it is worth reiterating that all of these factors will likely affect lateral seepage under certain conditions especially at their extreme values our objective here was to determine whether non destructive measurements of local hydrologic conditions and soil properties could reasonably predict lateral seepage in california rice fields allowing water managers to estimate lateral seepage losses and adapt their management accordingly the levees studied encompassed a regionally relevant range of values for all measured factors figure s2 our results show that both adjacent water height and levee width were negatively correlated with lateral seepage across all observations even after accounting for differences between sites due to unmeasured variables p 0 045 and p 0 025 respectively table 3 the effect sizes for these parameters were small but meaningful with a 100 cm decrease in adjacent water height or levee width corresponding to a 5 0 and 1 9 cm2 hr 1 increase in lateral seepage respectively compared to the range in measured values of 50 cm2 hr 1 fig 4 table 3 however percent clay field water height and groundwater height were not correlated with lateral seepage table 3 and the overall model explained little of the variability in lateral seepage marginal r2 0 129 this variability is not surprising due to the many other factors that may influence lateral seepage rates bulk density saturated hydraulic conductivity and the prevalence of preferential flow pathways will certainly affect lateral seepage especially for cases where there is no relationship with adjacent water height such as for levees bordering fallow fields variability between fields was less than in field variability for levees bordered by drainage ditches or fallow fields while variability between fields was greater for levees bordering supply canals or higher flooded fields fig 4 table 4 despite the apparent hydraulic head gradient for lateral seepage into the field for levees bordering supply canals or higher flooded fields positive lateral seepage rates or seepage out of the field were observed at most sites fig 4 in these cases the upper extent of the saturated zone in the levee was below the surface water elevation on either side of the levee and the unsaturated zone served as a sink for lateral seepage from both sides of the levee this is an important consideration for efforts to model or predict lateral seepage especially for those that rely on the dupuit equation agrawal et al 2004 tsubo et al 2007b which assumes no flow in the vertical direction fetter 2001 the presence of downward flow within levees as opposed to lateral flow across levees has also been inferred from soil moisture data and numerical modeling huang et al 2003 no significant relationship between lateral seepage and percent clay or field water height was observed in our study while soil texture undoubtedly affects lateral seepage the high clay content typical of california rice fields limits the responsiveness of lateral seepage to further changes in this property and factors like the prevalence of preferential flow pathways may become more important as discussed above correlations between lateral seepage and percent clay are much stronger in regions with less clay rich soils and more variability in soil texture tsubo et al 2007a in addition to soil texture bulk density affects the soil pore size distribution and higher bulk density is typically associated with lower lateral seepage rates janssen and lennartz 2009 patil et al 2011 although bulk density could not be measured in our study it is likely that most levees had a high bulk density given that they have been compacted by heavy machinery for many years similar to janssen and lennartz 2009 field water height had no relationship with lateral seepage rates in this study likely due to the relatively small contribution of field water height to the total hydraulic head gradient to the best of our knowledge no studies have directly evaluated the effect of adjacent water height on lateral seepage in rice fields however gallucci 2006 found that higher adjacent water height in drainage ditches lowered the export of dissolved organic carbon and nitrate which indirectly showed that higher adjacent water height reduced lateral seepage as previously mentioned the mean lateral seepage rates reported here were comparable to many other studies but small compared to the total water balance for commercial california rice fields the slow lateral seepage rates may suggest a dominant role for matrix flow through the levees at the measured locations but variable seepage rates were observed at two sites sites 2 and 4 for levees with similar hydrologic conditions and soil properties preferential flow pathways could play a role in the observed variability in lateral seepage rates under similar conditions the soils at both of these sites contained shrink swell smectitic clays table 1 which would not be expected to have preferential flow pathways due to soil structure when saturated favre et al 1997 nevertheless preferential flow pathways due to macrofaunal activity especially rodents and crayfish are common in rice fields and are supported by anecdotal observations if these pathways play a role in lateral seepage losses in california rice fields this would have important implications for nutrient and pesticide transport however determining the relative contributions of matrix flow and preferential flow to lateral seepage would require detailed tracer experiments e g flury et al 1994 which were beyond the scope of our study 3 3 lateral seepage measurement methodology benefits and limitations in this study we directly measured lateral seepage rates using a methodology that operates on principles analogous to a double ring infiltrometer janssen and lennartz 2009 several other methodologies have been used to estimate or directly measure lateral seepage in rice fields with the study objectives and the scale of the study influencing the choice of methodologies perhaps the most common methodology is measuring all of the other components of the field water balance irrigation rainfall evapotranspiration runoff or drainage percolation and the change in soil moisture and estimating lateral seepage as the missing term agrawal et al 2004 kukal and aggarwal 2002 tsubo et al 2007a wopereis et al 1994 advantages of the water balance approach are that it accounts for in field spatial variability and that irrigation rainfall evapotranspiration runoff or drainage and even percolation are typically easier to measure or independently estimate than seepage the notable shortcomings of the water balance approach include 1 the lateral seepage estimate will include errors in the measurement of all the other water balance terms the error for some of which e g irrigation may be comparable in magnitude to the lateral seepage term and 2 the relationship between lateral seepage and local edaphic or hydrologic properties cannot be explored in detail as lateral seepage can only be determined at the field or plot level direct measurements of lateral seepage in rice fields are less common but have included collecting lateral seepage water in containers dug into the far side of each levee liang et al 2008 liang et al 2013 and the three sided double frame methodology used in this study janssen and lennartz 2008 janssen and lennartz 2009 while these methods allow for a more detailed study of lateral seepage and avoid incorporating the errors associated with all the terms of the water balance they are frequently more labor intensive than the water balance approach and sufficient replication is required to account for in field variability given the constraints associated with measurements in commercial rice fields and the sub field scale of our objectives we decided that the three sided double frame methodology was most appropriate for this study yet we recognize the potential sources of error inherent in scaling up point measurements racz et al 2012 3 4 conclusions and future research the relatively low lateral seepage rates measured in this study indicate that lateral seepage generally has a small contribution to water loss at the field level in california rice fields nevertheless the role of lateral seepage and particularly of lateral preferential flow pathways in agrochemical movement should not be discounted especially since the point measurements used in this study will not capture all of the preferential flow pathways within a given rice field significant preferential flow pathways were anecdotally observed in some fields especially around outlet pipes for tailwater drainage grower attention to these leaks could help reduce field level water losses and thus applied water to rice fields lateral seepage rates were negatively correlated with levee width and the relative water height in the adjacent drainage ditch field or supply canal but not with percent clay field water height or groundwater height it is important to note that these latter properties certainly influence lateral seepage in many situations and that their lack of a relationship with lateral seepage in this study is likely due to their limited range of variation and the low lateral seepage rates observed in california rice fields future research should examine the prevalence of preferential flow pathways in rice field levees due to

6431,lateral seepage can be an important water loss pathway at the field level and a conduit for the discharge of pesticides and nutrients from rice fields however few studies have directly measured lateral seepage rates in flooded rice fields this study sought to characterize the magnitude and variability of lateral seepage in california rice fields and to explore the relationship between lateral seepage and soil properties or hydrologic conditions lateral seepage was measured during the growing season at 50 locations spread across six rice fields using a methodology that operates analogously to a double ring infiltrometer lateral seepage rates varied over four orders of magnitude 0 05 33 11 cm2 h 1 or 0 0011 1 05 cm h 1 though even the highest rate measured was small compared to typical water inputs in california rice fields and lateral seepage corresponded to only 1 0 1 9 of water inputs at sites where irrigation inputs were measured lateral seepage was negatively correlated with levee width p 0 025 and the relative water height in the adjacent field supply canal or drainage ditch p 0 045 though this relationship explained little of the variation in lateral seepage rates marginal r2 0 129 contrary to expectations not all supply canals or higher flooded fields were a source for lateral seepage into fields as unsaturated zones present in most levees served as a sink for lateral seepage from both sides of the levee future research should examine the prevalence of preferential flow pathways in rice field levees and the potential for transport of nutrients or agrochemicals through these flow pathways keywords bund california lateral seepage levee rice water 1 introduction rice oryza sativa accounts for only 10 of global cropland yet rice fields are estimated to receive 23 43 of all irrigation water worldwide bouman et al 2007 grisp 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 evapotranspiration which is the major outflow in non rice cropping systems has been estimated at 680 to 870 mm season 1 for rice linquist et al 2015 montazar et al 2017 comparable to many other crops the high applied water footprint of rice production must therefore be explained by surface drainage from the field which is controlled by the farmer and percolation and lateral seepage which are uncontrolled losses at the field level percolation is the downward movement of water to below the rice root zone and lateral seepage is the subsurface movement of water through the levees sometimes referred to as bunds that border the rice fields bouman et al 2007 due to the influence of numerous hydrologic and edaphic factors lateral seepage losses from rice fields are highly variable for example a single study observed lateral seepage losses that ranged from 2 to 75 of the water inputs to each field tsubo et al 2007a lateral seepage losses at the field level are commonly recaptured and reused downstream and thus may not represent losses at the landscape level hafeez et al 2007 roost et al 2008 nonetheless lateral seepage may be an important consideration for reducing applied water at the field level as well as for controlling the off site transport of pesticides and nutrients lateral seepage is governed by darcy s law except in some cases of nonlaminar preferential flow which states that this flow will be a product of the hydraulic head gradient and the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil hillel 1998 the former is a function of the levee width and the relative water height on both sides of the levee or the relative groundwater height in cases where lateral seepage flows to the groundwater the latter the saturated hydraulic conductivity is an intrinsic property of each soil that depends on its total porosity and pore size distribution which in turn depend on soil texture and structure hillel 1998 saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density levee width soil texture and the relative difference in water height or hydraulic head all affect lateral seepage rates especially as these values go to their extremes these last three parameters are of particular interest as they affect the hydraulic head gradient and saturated hydraulic conductivity but can be measured in commercial rice fields without destructive sampling of the border levees quantifying the magnitude of lateral seepage losses is critical for understanding the potential for transport of agrochemicals and nutrients from rice fields lateral seepage has been studied through modeling efforts for its role in pesticide movement boulange et al 2014 phong et al 2011 and through both modeling liang et al 2007 liang et al 2014a and physical studies liang et al 2008 liang et al 2013 xu et al 2017 for its contribution to nutrient transport understanding lateral seepage is also critical to determining the potential impact of alternative irrigation practices that are designed to reduce applied water to rice fields for example alternate wetting and drying awd has been extensively investigated worldwide carrijo et al 2017 and field level water savings associated with awd are expected to come principally from reductions in percolation and lateral seepage lampayan et al 2015 the percent of applied water lost as lateral seepage will depend on the field area and perimeter janssen and lennartz 2009 and given the small field size associated with many awd studies e g abbasi and sepaskhah 2011 de vries et al 2010 dunn and gaydon 2011 feng et al 2007 quantifying lateral seepage on commercial scale rice fields should provide a better estimate of the potential for reducing applied water with novel irrigation management strategies despite the important role lateral seepage may play in field level water losses and agrochemical movement relatively few studies have directly measured lateral seepage from rice fields during the growing season janssen and lennartz 2008 janssen and lennartz 2009 liang et al 2008 liang et al 2013 or used a water balance to estimate lateral seepage separately rather than combined percolation and lateral seepage agrawal et al 2004 kukal and aggarwal 2002 tsubo et al 2007a wopereis et al 1994 there has been little research on lateral seepage in california rice production even though rice is grown on over 200 000 ha and agricultural water use is frequently under scrutiny in the heavily irrigated and drought prone state usda 2017 linquist et al 2015 developed a water balance in commercial california rice fields and estimated combined percolation and lateral seepage the residual term based on the difference method at 27 cm or 15 of the total water input the authors suggested that this combined loss was principally due to lateral seepage after comparing the combined loss with saturated hydraulic conductivity data from an earlier study liang et al 2014b and speculated that drainage ditches surrounding some fields may have been responsible for the relatively higher lateral seepage rates linquist et al 2015 given the increasing pressure on growers to reduce applied water and the need to avoid pesticide transport through rice field levees it is important to understand the magnitude and variability of lateral seepage in california rice fields our objectives in this study were to 1 quantify the variability in lateral seepage rates for levees typical of california rice fields 2 situate field level lateral seepage losses within the context of water inputs to rice fields and 3 determine whether variability in lateral seepage rates was correlated with soil properties or hydrologic conditions that water managers could non destructively measure in commercial rice fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites lateral seepage measurements were taken from border levees of five commercial rice fields spread throughout the sacramento valley and at the california cooperative rice research foundation s rice experiment station in biggs ca fig 1 sites were chosen to be representative of california rice fields and to ensure adequate geographic representation table 1 a total of 50 direct measurements were made during the 2017 growing season with four to twelve measurements at each site measurements were made at randomized locations on all border levees at three sites and at randomized locations on select levees at the other three sites to ensure that the diversity of levees around california rice fields was appropriately captured levees may border supply canals drainage ditches fallow fields or flooded fields with a higher or lower relative water height fig 2 a 2d border levees typically double as unpaved roads in california rice fields and this was the case for all but four measurements in this study which were made on smaller levees with no roads fig 2e all levees were composed of native soil and were constructed at least a decade prior to this study sacramento valley soils on the valley floor generally have a high clay content and are dominated by smectitic clays whereas soils on the eastern margin of the valley have a lower clay content and a mixed mineralogy table 1 the regional groundwater table is generally close to the soil surface 0 5 3 0 m at the start of the growing season for most of the valley floor state of california 2018 though restrictive layers cemented with silica and carbonates are present approximately 1 0 m below the soil surface at some sites table 1 and may limit interaction between the regional groundwater and shallower groundwater 2 2 lateral seepage measurements direct lateral seepage measurements were made using a modified version of the three sided metal frames introduced by janssen and lennartz 2009 frames were driven 25 cm into the soil at the intersection of the floodwater and the border levee so that the floodwater covered approximately half of the area encompassed by the frame and the open side of the frame was parallel with the levee fig 3 even though the fields were flooded for the measurements nested frames were used to create a situation analogous to double ring infiltrometers to minimize the effect of small fluctuations in field water height from wind or diurnal cycles of evapotranspiration janssen and lennartz 2009 reynolds 2007 a constant water height in both frames was maintained using mariotte bottles which were positioned to maintain the frame water height at the field water height at the onset of the measurement frames were covered with reflective insulation to minimize evaporation and the residual evaporation from a specimen cup inside the frame was measured and subtracted from lateral seepage rates similarly percolation was measured at three locations in each field and the average percolation rate was subtracted from the lateral seepage rate percolation was measured using a methodology adapted from the international rice research institute s water requirement meter irri 1987 and the seepage meters commonly used in stream hydrology limnology and oceanography lee 1977 briefly 30 cm diameter pvc rings were inserted to 20 25 cm below the soil surface 5 15 cm into the plow pan and covered with vented lids to minimize evaporation while allowing equilibration of air pressure a flexible polyethylene bag attached to the ring s side allowed hydraulic head to equilibrate between the ring and the field this bag was completely emptied into the ring for weekly ring water height measurements although lateral seepage rates may change over time measurements for each individual frame location were generally conducted in a single day 3 8 h or until a consistent measurement was obtained as the limited number of nested frames 4 necessitated a choice between breadth and depth of measurement coverage with the former more relevant to our research objectives all lateral seepage measurements were taken at least six weeks after the fields were initially flooded which allowed time for the levees to equilibrate with the flooded field direct lateral seepage measurements have variably been presented as a volume flux per unit area e g liang et al 2008 or as a volume flux per unit length of levee e g janssen and lennartz 2009 while the former is in the same form as darcy s law in practice the boundary between lateral seepage and vertical percolation and thus the area over which a volume water flux is measured is difficult to determine for this reason and other reasons discussed by janssen and lennartz 2009 we chose to use the latter units and treat lateral seepage as an edge effect dependent on the length of levee measured that is the average percolation rate measured elsewhere in the field was subtracted out and the resultant measurement was considered lateral seepage however we also provide units of volume flux per unit area for ease of comparison by considering the area of the open face of the metal frame below the field water level 2 3 lateral seepage measurement quality control janssen and lennartz 2008 2009 validated the seepage measurement methodology used in this study with dye tracers and levee dissection repeating this work was not feasible given the number of levees we investigated and that it required the levees to be deconstructed which was not possible in commercial fields however every effort was made to ensure the accuracy of measurements and to verify that any water lost from the frames entered the levee rather than the field water exchange between the frame and the field was restricted by 1 maintaining the water height in both frames at the field water height to prevent a hydraulic head gradient from forming and 2 ensuring good contact between the frame and the soil by adding and compacting soil into any cracks between the soil and the frame as this was done only in the area immediately adjacent to the frame 10 of the frame length the effect on lateral seepage rates should be negligible a potassium chloride kcl tracer chosen for its lack of toxicity ease of use and availability leibundgut and seibert 2011 mastrocicco et al 2011 was applied to one frame per site to verify the absence of significant water exchange between the field and the frame by monitoring the electrical conductivity ec in the outer frame and the immediately adjacent field floodwater no increase in ec relative to a control frame not spiked with kcl was observed in either the field or the outer frame auger holes were also cored into the levee at one site and the ec of the water in the holes was measured directly in front of the frame and at progressive distances from the frame along the levee to confirm that water from the frame was moving into the levee auger holes in front of the outer frame which was not spiked with kcl and the immediately adjacent field showed no increase in ec compared to a random location along the levee as expected auger holes in front of the inner frame showed an increase in ec especially closer to the intersection of the levee and the field floodwater 2 4 soil sampling and field measurements levee width field water depth groundwater elevation and the relative water height in the adjacent supply canal drainage ditch or field hereafter referred to as adjacent water height were measured in the field at each location where a lateral seepage measurement was made the water height in the adjacent supply canal flooded field or drainage ditch was measured using a nsl100b builder s level tripod and rod northwest instrument mt olive nj for adjacent fallow fields the depth to reach groundwater as determined by free water in soil cores pulled from an auger hole in the fallow field was added to the soil surface elevation levee width was measured as the horizontal distance between the field water levee interface and the adjacent water levee interface field water depth was measured at three points 30 40 cm from the back of the lateral seepage frame a 6 cm wide dutch auger was used to core into the center of the levee until free water was observed in the soil removed from the auger bucket or until a confining layer e g a duripan or chemically cemented layer was reached the depth at which free water was observed in soil samples was recorded as the groundwater height any soil from the auger hole above the elevation of the water on either side of the levee was discarded the complete soil sample was divided into horizons based on defining visual features such as consistence soil texture soil color water content etc and samples were taken at the midpoint of each horizon intact cores at depth could not be obtained as this would require destructive sampling of the levees in commercial rice fields and therefore saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density could not be measured 2 5 soil particle size analysis soil samples were air dried ground and passed through a 2 mm sieve for textural analysis 5 00 g of the sample was weighed into a 50 ml centrifuge tube mixed with 5 g l 1 sodium metaphosphate nao3p and shaken overnight on a mechanical shaker the presence of significant carbonates was evaluated visually with 1 m hydrochloric acid hcl and samples were pre treated with 1 m sodium acetate c2h3o2na adjusted to ph 5 to remove carbonates as necessary the percent clay was determined using the micro pipette method miller and miller 1987 with laboratory duplicates for each soil sample the percent sand was determined by wet sieving the dispersed soil sample through a 53 µm sieve finally a depth weighted average was calculated for percent sand and percent clay based on the estimated thickness of the soil horizons in the field 2 6 data analysis all data analysis was done in r version 3 5 0 r core team 2018 and data visualization was performed using the ggplot2 package wickham 2009 to investigate the relationship between variation in lateral seepage rates and measured soil properties or hydrologic conditions the lme function of the nlme package was used for a linear mixed effects model pinheiro et al 2018 as percent sand percent clay or both could be used to represent soil texture and the two variables were correlated only percent clay was considered in the analysis due to its greater range of variation and the nature of its relationship with lateral seepage as the model residuals did not satisfy the assumption of normality due to leptokurtosis shapiro wilk w 0 927 p 0 005 a lambert w transformation was applied to the lateral seepage data goerg 2011 at which point the residuals satisfied the assumption shapiro wilk w 0 970 p 0 243 however the models with the original and transformed data yielded nearly identical results so the original data is used to simplify the interpretation of results 3 results and discussion 3 1 lateral seepage magnitude and variability in california rice fields lateral seepage measurements at the 50 locations in six california rice fields varied over four orders of magnitude fig 4 with the highest value 33 11 cm2 hr 1 or 1 05 cm hr 1 recorded for a narrow levee with no road bordering a drainage ditch fig 2e the lowest positive value 0 05 cm2 hr 1 or 1 1 10 3 cm hr 1 recorded for a levee with a dirt road bordered by a supply canal fig 2a and the overall lowest value 17 10 cm2 hr 1 or 0 48 cm hr 1 showing an influx of water to the field for a levee with a gravel road bordered by a higher flooded field fig 2d despite this variability all measured lateral seepage rates were low relative to total water inputs or evapotranspiration losses for example the highest lateral seepage rate measured corresponds to 7 3 cm per season for a hypothetical square 25 ha field that is bordered by drainage ditches on all sides and flooded for 115 days in contrast applied water to california rice fields averages 137 cm johnson and cody 2015 the mean lateral seepage rate across all sites and locations was 5 35 cm2 hr 1 or 0 16 cm hr 1 which can be interpreted as 5 35 cm3 or ml of water passing through each cm of perimeter levee length per hour std dev 8 70 cm2 hr 1 std error 1 23 cm2 hr 1 directly measured lateral seepage rates in other studies ranged from 0 017 to 4 3 cm2 hr 1 for a levee bordered by a drainage ditch in a clay loam soil liang et al 2008 liang et al 2013 and from 10 8 to 43 7 cm2 hr 1 for a levee with a loam and clay loam soil texture bordered by a lower flooded field janssen and lennartz 2009 despite these measurements being made at a single site in each study the ranges are consistent with the 0 34 33 11 cm2 hr 1 range of lateral seepage measurements on levees bordered by drainage ditches in this study most water balance studies report combined percolation and lateral seepage losses rather than each component individually due to the difficulty in quantifying them separately bouman et al 2005 devkota et al 2013 mcdonald et al 2006 mohanty et al 2004 linquist et al 2015 even in those water balance studies that do report lateral seepage separately from percolation lateral seepage is frequently given in a single dimension that is based on the area and perimeter of the field but these dimensions are often not reported as discussed in janssen and lennartz 2009 however for the few water balance studies that reported lateral seepage and field dimensions lateral seepage rates were 0 17 1 98 cm2 hr 1 kukal and aggarwal 2002 and 67 cm2 hr 1 wopereis et al 1994 which is generally consistent with the rates reported in this study while reporting seasonal lateral seepage losses as an equivalent height of water in the field can make it difficult to compare across locations as it depends on the field area and perimeter it is still useful to situate lateral seepage within the context of other water balance components field level lateral seepage losses extrapolated for the entire growing season were only 1 4 cm 1 5 cm and 2 3 cm at sites 2 3 and 4 respectively the three fields where districts measured irrigation inputs and at least two measurements were taken in all four border levees table 2 using this irrigation input data outflow from lateral seepage corresponds to 1 2 1 0 and 1 9 of the total season long water inputs at sites 2 3 and 4 respectively table 2 this small contribution to the rice field water balance in california stands in contrast to the substantial field level water losses from lateral seepage in many rice growing regions likely due in part to differences in field size and soil texture whereas large fields 14 46 ha table 2 and clay rich soils 38 70 figure s2 table 1 are typical of california s sacramento valley 90 of global rice production comes from 1 ha fields tonini and cabrera 2011 and rice is grown on 14 4 million ha with coarse textured soils worldwide haefele et al 2014 yadav et al 2011 reported lateral seepage rates corresponding to 16 38 of total water inputs in india attributable largely to small plot size and the resulting high perimeter to area ratio similarly high losses from lateral seepage have been observed in india kukal and aggarwal 2002 and the philippines wopereis et al 1994 and while most commercial fields in these countries are larger than the experimental plots in these studies they are still much smaller than california rice fields tsubo et al 2007a reported lateral seepage losses representing 2 75 of total water inputs in thailand corresponding to clay contents ranging from 4 to 47 illustrating the potential for higher contributions of lateral seepage to the rice field water balance in regions with coarse textured soils 3 2 lateral seepage hydrologic conditions and soil properties the substantial relative variability in lateral seepage from rice fields reported here though small compared to irrigation inputs and the variability reported elsewhere reflect the fact that many different edaphic and hydrologic factors may affect lateral seepage here we measured levee width percent clay percent sand groundwater elevation field water height and adjacent water height figure s2 it was determined that accurate and representative bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements could not be made without destructive sampling of the levee saturated hydraulic conductivity can be highly spatially variable even in texturally homogenous soils due in a large part to variation in bulk density morbidelli et al 2017 and therefore measuring these parameters would have required multiple intact cores to be obtained at depth which was not possible in the commercial rice fields studied it is worth reiterating that all of these factors will likely affect lateral seepage under certain conditions especially at their extreme values our objective here was to determine whether non destructive measurements of local hydrologic conditions and soil properties could reasonably predict lateral seepage in california rice fields allowing water managers to estimate lateral seepage losses and adapt their management accordingly the levees studied encompassed a regionally relevant range of values for all measured factors figure s2 our results show that both adjacent water height and levee width were negatively correlated with lateral seepage across all observations even after accounting for differences between sites due to unmeasured variables p 0 045 and p 0 025 respectively table 3 the effect sizes for these parameters were small but meaningful with a 100 cm decrease in adjacent water height or levee width corresponding to a 5 0 and 1 9 cm2 hr 1 increase in lateral seepage respectively compared to the range in measured values of 50 cm2 hr 1 fig 4 table 3 however percent clay field water height and groundwater height were not correlated with lateral seepage table 3 and the overall model explained little of the variability in lateral seepage marginal r2 0 129 this variability is not surprising due to the many other factors that may influence lateral seepage rates bulk density saturated hydraulic conductivity and the prevalence of preferential flow pathways will certainly affect lateral seepage especially for cases where there is no relationship with adjacent water height such as for levees bordering fallow fields variability between fields was less than in field variability for levees bordered by drainage ditches or fallow fields while variability between fields was greater for levees bordering supply canals or higher flooded fields fig 4 table 4 despite the apparent hydraulic head gradient for lateral seepage into the field for levees bordering supply canals or higher flooded fields positive lateral seepage rates or seepage out of the field were observed at most sites fig 4 in these cases the upper extent of the saturated zone in the levee was below the surface water elevation on either side of the levee and the unsaturated zone served as a sink for lateral seepage from both sides of the levee this is an important consideration for efforts to model or predict lateral seepage especially for those that rely on the dupuit equation agrawal et al 2004 tsubo et al 2007b which assumes no flow in the vertical direction fetter 2001 the presence of downward flow within levees as opposed to lateral flow across levees has also been inferred from soil moisture data and numerical modeling huang et al 2003 no significant relationship between lateral seepage and percent clay or field water height was observed in our study while soil texture undoubtedly affects lateral seepage the high clay content typical of california rice fields limits the responsiveness of lateral seepage to further changes in this property and factors like the prevalence of preferential flow pathways may become more important as discussed above correlations between lateral seepage and percent clay are much stronger in regions with less clay rich soils and more variability in soil texture tsubo et al 2007a in addition to soil texture bulk density affects the soil pore size distribution and higher bulk density is typically associated with lower lateral seepage rates janssen and lennartz 2009 patil et al 2011 although bulk density could not be measured in our study it is likely that most levees had a high bulk density given that they have been compacted by heavy machinery for many years similar to janssen and lennartz 2009 field water height had no relationship with lateral seepage rates in this study likely due to the relatively small contribution of field water height to the total hydraulic head gradient to the best of our knowledge no studies have directly evaluated the effect of adjacent water height on lateral seepage in rice fields however gallucci 2006 found that higher adjacent water height in drainage ditches lowered the export of dissolved organic carbon and nitrate which indirectly showed that higher adjacent water height reduced lateral seepage as previously mentioned the mean lateral seepage rates reported here were comparable to many other studies but small compared to the total water balance for commercial california rice fields the slow lateral seepage rates may suggest a dominant role for matrix flow through the levees at the measured locations but variable seepage rates were observed at two sites sites 2 and 4 for levees with similar hydrologic conditions and soil properties preferential flow pathways could play a role in the observed variability in lateral seepage rates under similar conditions the soils at both of these sites contained shrink swell smectitic clays table 1 which would not be expected to have preferential flow pathways due to soil structure when saturated favre et al 1997 nevertheless preferential flow pathways due to macrofaunal activity especially rodents and crayfish are common in rice fields and are supported by anecdotal observations if these pathways play a role in lateral seepage losses in california rice fields this would have important implications for nutrient and pesticide transport however determining the relative contributions of matrix flow and preferential flow to lateral seepage would require detailed tracer experiments e g flury et al 1994 which were beyond the scope of our study 3 3 lateral seepage measurement methodology benefits and limitations in this study we directly measured lateral seepage rates using a methodology that operates on principles analogous to a double ring infiltrometer janssen and lennartz 2009 several other methodologies have been used to estimate or directly measure lateral seepage in rice fields with the study objectives and the scale of the study influencing the choice of methodologies perhaps the most common methodology is measuring all of the other components of the field water balance irrigation rainfall evapotranspiration runoff or drainage percolation and the change in soil moisture and estimating lateral seepage as the missing term agrawal et al 2004 kukal and aggarwal 2002 tsubo et al 2007a wopereis et al 1994 advantages of the water balance approach are that it accounts for in field spatial variability and that irrigation rainfall evapotranspiration runoff or drainage and even percolation are typically easier to measure or independently estimate than seepage the notable shortcomings of the water balance approach include 1 the lateral seepage estimate will include errors in the measurement of all the other water balance terms the error for some of which e g irrigation may be comparable in magnitude to the lateral seepage term and 2 the relationship between lateral seepage and local edaphic or hydrologic properties cannot be explored in detail as lateral seepage can only be determined at the field or plot level direct measurements of lateral seepage in rice fields are less common but have included collecting lateral seepage water in containers dug into the far side of each levee liang et al 2008 liang et al 2013 and the three sided double frame methodology used in this study janssen and lennartz 2008 janssen and lennartz 2009 while these methods allow for a more detailed study of lateral seepage and avoid incorporating the errors associated with all the terms of the water balance they are frequently more labor intensive than the water balance approach and sufficient replication is required to account for in field variability given the constraints associated with measurements in commercial rice fields and the sub field scale of our objectives we decided that the three sided double frame methodology was most appropriate for this study yet we recognize the potential sources of error inherent in scaling up point measurements racz et al 2012 3 4 conclusions and future research the relatively low lateral seepage rates measured in this study indicate that lateral seepage generally has a small contribution to water loss at the field level in california rice fields nevertheless the role of lateral seepage and particularly of lateral preferential flow pathways in agrochemical movement should not be discounted especially since the point measurements used in this study will not capture all of the preferential flow pathways within a given rice field significant preferential flow pathways were anecdotally observed in some fields especially around outlet pipes for tailwater drainage grower attention to these leaks could help reduce field level water losses and thus applied water to rice fields lateral seepage rates were negatively correlated with levee width and the relative water height in the adjacent drainage ditch field or supply canal but not with percent clay field water height or groundwater height it is important to note that these latter properties certainly influence lateral seepage in many situations and that their lack of a relationship with lateral seepage in this study is likely due to their limited range of variation and the low lateral seepage rates observed in california rice fields future research should examine the prevalence of preferential flow pathways in rice field levees due to macrofaunal activity and the potential for transport of nutrients or agrochemicals through these flow pathways acknowledgements we would like to thank the members of the linquist lab for their help

6432,the changes of soil properties caused by ecosystem restoration have played critical roles in controlling water and sediment loss in loess plateau however it is difficult to isolate and quantify the individual impact of each factor as the impact is hard to monitor separately the objectives of this study are to explore how the changes in different soil properties influence the hydrologic response and sediment transport at catchment scale we applied a coupled hydrologic sediment transport model to a small catchment in the loess plateau sensitivity analyses were conducted on three influential soil properties saturated hydraulic conductivity ks manning s roughness coefficient n and the variations of erodibility coefficient φ our results indicated that the increase in near surface saturated hydraulic conductivity could effectively reduce the peak and total flow i e when ks is smaller than rainfall intensity 22 5 increase in ks leads to over 70 reduction in total discharge and could lead to transition of runoff generation mechanism from horton overland flow to dunne overland flow the increase in manning s roughness coefficient would also reduce the discharge and sediment yield substantially by slowing down the flow velocity which leads to more infiltration along the flow path after the runoff is generated the decrease in erodibility coefficient reduces the sediment rate and total sediment mass delivered i e 20 decrease can reduce total sediment mass by 5 alleviating the undercutting in upstream gullies and deposition at downstream eventually slowing down landscape evolution our findings could be used to provide valuable guidance in the ecosystem restoration and land use management keywords sensitivity analyses soil properties water discharge sediment transport inhm 1 introduction the loess plateau has suffered from severe soil erosion problem for centuries wei et al 2014 zhao et al 2013a in recent years both runoff and sediment yield at main stem of the yellow river has dropped significantly at tongguan station a gauge downstream of the loess plateau observations show that discharge and sediment yield have reduced by 53 7 and 96 5 respectively comparing with early 20th century 1919 1959 when human activities were limited hu 2016 liu et al 2014 shi et al 2017 this drastic runoff and sediment load reduction in the loess plateau can be attributed to the extensive anthropogenic activities aiming for the water and soil conservation feng et al 2012 xin et al 2012 one of the implementations that have been proved to be effective is the green for grain project since 1998 which transforms the mountainous cropland into grassland or forests wu et al 2016a increasing the vegetation coverage in loess plateau from 31 6 in 1999 to 59 6 in 2013 chen et al 2015 studies have shown that long term vegetation restoration is able to alleviate the soil erosion issue by altering the soil properties i e the saturated hydraulic conductivity the manning s roughness coefficient and the erodibility coefficient jiao et al 2011 li and shao 2006 wang et al 2013a b as previous studies indicated the increase in vegetation coverage could effectively lead to increase in hydraulic conductivity and manning s roughness coefficient and decrease in soil erodibility wang et al 2019 for example ren et al 2016 and wang et al 2013a found that the soil hydraulic conductivity increased from 0 4 mm min to 1 3 mm min when the vegetation coverage increased from around 40 to 60 in a small catchment on loess plateau liu et al 2010 also observed significant increase in manning s roughness coefficient when grass coverage increased from 0 to 70 in the soil erosion process soil erodibility is also an important characteristic used to represent the inherent resistance of soil to both detachment and transport caused by rainfall and runoff gao et al 2017 zhu et al 2010 vegetation growth also helps to develop more organic matters in the soil to increase soil aggregation zhu et al 2010 reducing soil erodibility an et al 2013 wang et al 2013a 2018 these changes in soil properties eventually lead to the reduction in water and sediment yield li et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a zhao et al 2014 on the influences of soil properties on runoff and sediment yield in the loess plateau most of the previous studies focused on the field monitoring at local scales i e experimental slopes and flume tests in the laboratory ai et al 2016 liu et al 2012b zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 however the field observations are usually the comprehensive results of changes in various soil properties liu et al 2012b it is usually not able to isolate the impacts of individual soil properties furthermore previous studies were mostly conducted at the hillslope scale or by flumes in the laboratory not many focused on catchment scale ai et al 2016 pan and shangguan 2006 yet the impact of revegetation on scouring and siltation in the river channels could not be captured in the laboratory or at hillslope scale the coupled hydrologic and sediment transport model is needed to help quantify the individual impacts of changes in different soil properties at catchment scale to help upscale our understandings of the comprehensive influences on runoff generation flow confluence and the correlated sediment transport in this study we adopted the physics based integrated hydrology model inhm to investigate the effects of changes in soil properties on hydrologic response and sediment transport the model was originally developed by vanderkwaak 1999 and vanderkwaak and loague 2001 and was used to simulate 3 dimensional variably saturated flow and solute transport in porous media and 2 dimensional flow on surface or in open channels dutton et al 2005 ebel et al 2010 2008 2007 sediment transport was added to inhm by heppner et al 2006 and ran et al 2007 where the soil erodibility is estimated by the erodibility coefficient based on the surface properties i e soil texture organic matter vegetation etc this coupled hydrologic and sediment transport model has been applied and validated at both hillslope scale and regional scale ran et al 2012 this model is capable of simulating four principal runoff generation mechanisms without prior assumptions ebel et al 2008 among the parameters in the model saturated hydraulic conductivity k manning s roughness coefficient n and erodibility coefficient φ are considered as the most important input parameters in the runoff generation and soil erosion simulation heppner et al 2006 loague et al 2005 ran et al 2015 to understand the individual and combined impacts of these parameters we applied this model to a small catchment in the loess plateau and conducted sensitivity analysis for these parameters although most of the sensitivity analyses in sediment transport were conducted for parameter selection before calibration ranatunga et al 2016 song et al 2015 here the sensitivity analysis were carried out to explore the impacts of the variability in these well known influential parameters in this paper we are more interested in answering the question that how the changes in soil properties caused by revegetation influences the runoff generation mechanism and soil erosion sediment transport at catchment scale this paper is organized in the following way section 2 describes the study area and data and section 3 gives a brief description of the model structure and sensitivity analyses scenarios the calibration validation and sensitivity analyses results are given in section 4 in section 5 we discuss the impacts of soil properties on water and sediment transport finally section 6 summarizes the main conclusions 2 study site and data the study was conducted at shejiagou sjg catchment in the center of the loess plateau in zizhou county shaanxi province china sjg is a tributary of chabagou cbg which is a third order tributary of the yellow river sjg covers an area of 4 26 km2 with an average gradient of 1 15 and elevation ranging from 936 m and 1143 m fig 1 the region has a semiarid continental climate the mean annual precipitation is 480 mm 70 of which occurring from june to september as short intense storms zhang et al 2016b runoff and sediment events are usually caused by short intensive rainstorms the mean annual potential evaporation is 1228 mm fang et al 2008 the dominant soil in sjg is sandy loam according to the soil taxonomy established by usda fang et al 2008 which is easy to be eroded and crusting fang et al 2007 2008 the vegetation coverage was very limited in shejiagou from 1959 to 1969 fang et al 2010 yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2016b and the soil and water conservation measurements haven t been implemented until 1970 fang et al 2010 zheng et al 2008 the dominant land use type was bare land and cultivated land during our observations 1967 1969 which was then changed to grassland and forests in 1986 fig s1 the discharge and suspended sediment concentration data were collected during flood seasons between 1967 and 1969 from sjg gauge 0 8 km away from the outlet it is one of the zizhou runoff experimental stations established to collect data for soil erosion and sediment transport study in the middle yellow river basin by the yellow river water conservancy commission the rainfall data was obtained from the sjg precipitation gauge at the foot of the hill near the sjg hydrology gauge since the sediment loss issue in the loess plateau were mainly caused by high intensity rainstorms our study would focus on event scale six of the biggest rainstorms during 1967 1969 were selected for analysis two of the them were used for calibration and the other four were used for validation all these data were collected from the hydrologic experimental data of zizhou runoff experimental station printed and issued by the yellow river water conservancy commission for internal use 3 methodology 3 1 model

be found in vanderkwaak s studies loague et al 2005 loague and vanderkwaak 2002 vanderkwaak 1999 vanderkwaak and loague 2001 3 1 2 sediment transport the inhm sediment transport algorithm considers

can be found in heppner et al 2006 ran et al 2007 3 2 boundary value problem the boundary value problem bvp in this study includes the finite element method of numerical solution the boundary conditions the initial conditions and the parameterization of hydraulic properties 3 2 1 finite element discretization the finite element mesh used to represent the sjg catchment in inhm is shown in fig 2 a fig 2 b shows the details of the outlet the sjg mesh consists of 246 420 prism elements for the subsurface and 16 428 triangular elements for the surface the hydrologic response of the whole surface and subsurface is obtained through the grid computing and interpolation the result at every grid point is computed directly while the values between two grid points are obtained by linear interpolation the vertical spacing δ z in the sjg mesh varies from 0 1 m near surface to 1 6 m at depth the horizontal spacing δ x δ y varies from 5 m near channel and outlet to 160 m edges this meshing size is chosen to optimize the simulation based on previous experience loague and vanderkwaak 2002 mirus et al 2007 three cross sections are set as checkpoints along the river network to monitor the discharge and sediment passing through the channel fig 2a cross section 1 is set at sjg hydrometrical station cross section 2 is at the middle of the main channel and cross section 3 is in the upper stream reach 3 2 2 hydrologic initial conditions most of the observed events we used here occurred after a dry period 7 days without rainfall in general the discharge before the events was close to base flow to get close to this soil water condition we drained the catchment from a saturated state the model ran till the simulated discharge at cross section 1 near the sjg hydrometrical station was around 0 003 m3 s matching the mean discharge during base flow period in the observation we then applied the first month rainfall event july 1967 to the model as warm up this soil water distribution was then used as initial condition for our sensitivity analyses 3 2 3 hydrologic boundary conditions there are five faces in the simulation four of them are considered as impermeable a d h e d c g h c g f b and e h g f in fig 2 and the face at the outlet is considered as local sink a b f e the surface boundary conditions are impermeable the upgradient boundary dc and the sides da and cb except at the outlet of the river ab the rainfall rate from sjg precipitation station is applied to the whole catchment surface a d c b homogeneously while the evapotranspiration is assumed negligible during the relatively short simulation period usually less than 3 days 3 2 4 parameterization of hydraulic properties the soil profile is divided into two layers the near surface layer 0 0 5 m and the deep layer 0 5 10 m the near surface saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is calibrated while the value of deep layer kd is set to 9 10 7 m s and the porosity value of the whole soil layer is set to 0 4 m3 m3 they are based on the field measurement results at wangmaogou wmg a catchment in the neighboring county of zizhou county the two catchments are very similar in topography climate and soil properties they have the similar drainage area main channel length and altitude difference they are both characterized by semi arid continental monsoon climate with similar annual precipitation around 500 mm year air temperature mean temperature is around 10 c and seasonal variability fang et al 2007 zhao et al 2017 the dominant soil in both catchments is malan loess with less organic matter and high erodibility fang et al 2010 2008 the porosity value is consistent with the saturated water content measured by kimura et al 2005 the soil water retention and permeability functions are based upon the van genuchten vangenuchten 1980 approach and characteristics of sandy loam the parameters used in the van genuchten method are also averaged from measurements in wmg which are all within the range of sandy loam in van genuchten parameters rawls et al 1991 the kd value measured in wmg is used for our calibration as the impact of kd on runoff is limited table s1 3 3 calibration and validation the near surface saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the manning s roughness coefficient n are calibrated to fit the observed discharge at sjg gauge after the calibration of discharge the erodibility coefficient φ is calibrated to meet the observed sediment rate the criterion used to measure model performance is nash coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 two events in 1967 are simulated for calibration while the other four events in 1968 and 1969 are used for validation with the calibrated parameter values table 1 3 4 sensitivity analysis event in july 25th 1969 is selected for sensitivity analysis as there wasn t rainfall events within one week the antecedent water storage is close to our initial state assumption the three parameters investigated in the sensitivity analyses sa are 1 surface saturated hydraulic conductivity ks 2 the manning s roughness coefficient n and 3 the erodibility coefficient φ the calibrated values are considered as base case note that another soil erosion parameter rainsplash coefficient cf is not considered in the sensitivity analysis as its influence on sediment transport rate is negligible table s3 in addition though different soil water retention and permeability functions would also affect the simulated results ebel et al 2010 ran et al 2015 there is limited field observations or theoretical hypothesis about how they would change with vegetation restoration therefore the impacts of soil water retention and permeability functions are not included in this study the sensitivity analyses are designed based on the observations on the loess plateau from the literature as well as our measurements at nearby catchments table 2 since it usually takes decades for the restoration to have impacts on soil properties soils at different stages of restoration from different spots within same region were sampled to represent its temporal evolution due to re vegetation along the time jiao et al 2011 li and shao 2006 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2013b previous studies show that the ks values can vary from 8 3 10 8 m s up to 1 32 10 4 m s after decades of revegetation wang et al 2013a b wu et al 2016a zhao et al 2013b our measurements on loess plateau found similar results the ks value could increase from 1 84 10 7 m s to 1 03 10 4 m s after more than 40 years of vegetation restoration see fig s2 and table 2 therefore the ks value is set to vary from 8 3 10 8 m s to 1 32 10 4 m s in our sensitivity analysis since physical properties of deep soil could also be improved due to vegetation restoration the kd is also set to vary with ks to maintain their ratio constant in sensitivity analyses the variations of manning s roughness coefficient is set to cover the range of the measurements from different land use types in the loess area zhang et al 2007 and the experiments on the relationship between grass coverage and manning s roughness coefficient in the loess plateau liu et al 2010 different values of manning s roughness coefficient are assigned to channel cells and hillslope cells the manning s roughness coefficient on the hillslope varies with that in the main channel to keep their ratio constant the erodibility coefficient is a lumped parameter larger than zero although it cannot be measured directly previous field measurements laboratory experiments and data analyses of soil erodibility under different vegetation coverage all suggested that the erodibility decreased with the increase of vegetation coverage wang et al 2013a zhu et al 2010 which supports the variation in our sensitivity analyses variables used to describe the simulated rainfall runoff characteristics are the end time of flow event t e s the time to peak flow t p s the peak discharge q max m3 s and the total discharge q sum m3 the lyne holick filtering method is used to separate base flow from the total discharge to decide the end time of flow event lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 whereas variables used to quantify soil erosion and sediment transport characteristics are the peak sediment rate r max kg s and the total sediment mass s sum kg 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation the calibration and validation results are summarized in table 1 and figs 3 4 the calibrated values for near surface saturated hydraulic conductivity value ks and erodibility coefficient φ are 2 7 10 6 m s and 0 0003 respectively the manning s roughness coefficient in the channel and on the hillslopes are 0 008 and 0 01 respectively the manning s roughness coefficient values are smaller than expectation however given the characteristics of loess soil and close to bare soil in sjg during the simulation period 1967 1969 these calibrated n values are acceptable for our study catchment similar n values have been found at bare land or cultivated land on the loess plateau in previous studies li et al 2013 zhang et al 1995 1994 as we can see from table 1 and fig 3 the modeled results capture the flow events relatively well with the nash sutcliffe ns coefficients exceed 0 65 for most of the simulated events both the peak discharge and time to the peak discharge match observation well the only exception is the mismatched peak flow for event in aug 12th 1968 it is most likely due to the relatively large rainfall events before the simulated one elevating the antecedent soil water content that is our assumption on initial condition underestimated the actual value which then propagated to the estimate of peak runoff the model also simulates sediment concentration reasonably well with the ns coefficient larger than 0 55 for all the events except the one in aug 12th 1968 similar with the runoff simulation since the sediment transport of inhm is based on the hydrologic response this underestimation in sediment rate is likely propagated from the underestimation in the hydrologic simulation moreover the hyper concentrated flow occurring in low discharge event is difficult to simulate as it is not only caused by hydraulic erosion and rainsplash erosion in reality low discharge may be able to deliver unproportionally large amount of sediment due to the gravitational erosion including the sudden slope failure and collapse caused by rainfall li et al 2009 wang et al 1982 xu 1999 xu and yan 2005 since the goal of this work is to understand the impact of change in soil properties the current model is more focused on the integrated response for the entire rainfall time series simulations of these sudden geological hazards are beyond the scope of this study future improvement in the model structure is needed to include these abrupt geological events for better understanding in the overall mechanism of soil erosion on the loess plateau for this study we will concentrate on the everyday hydrologic erosion and our sensitivity analysis will be conducted on the events with best simulation results 4 2 sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 sa for saturated hydraulic conductivity the range of ks is from 8 3 10 8 m s to 1 32 10 4 m s according to the observations from literature and our measurements table 2 as we can see from table 3 both discharge qmax and qsum and sediment delivery rate rmax and stotal are relatively sensitive to the changes of ks one quarter drop in ks leads to 60 increase in peak flow while three quarters decrease in ks could increase the peak flow qmax by 3 5 times and lead to 128 increase in the total discharge qsum the changes of peak sediment rate and total sediment mass are similar to the changes of peak flow and total flow table 3 and fig 5 a b and e f on the other hand qmax drops significantly with the increase of ks when ks less than 5 62 10 6 m s this decrease slows down when ks continues to increase timing values te tp are relatively insensitive to the changes in ks table 3 and fig 5c d both the end time and peak time fluctuate slightly as the flow travel time is not much influenced by the saturated hydraulic conductivity especially when ks is larger than the rainfall intensity the end time and peak time are close to stable as the runoff is mainly generated from the channel area these trends are similar among three cross sections though the hydrologic response is more sensitive in lower reaches of main stream fig 6 illustrates the spatial variation of surface soil water content at the peak time for different ks values the whole surface is almost saturated at the peak time when ks 5 62 10 6 m s fig 6a c with the increase of ks only the channel and near channel areas remain saturated the hillslope becomes less and less saturated as more and more water infiltrates to the deep layer at a faster rate fig 7 presents the vertical distribution of soil water content with minimum and maximum ks values at the hillslope fig 7a b and near the channel fig 7c d as we can see the initial water table level around the channel is higher and it is easier to get saturated at the surface the vertical distribution patterns are different between the minimum ks 8 3 10 8 m s and the maximum ks 1 32 10 4 m s values for the soil at the top four meters when ks value is small the near surface soil gets saturated quickly after the rainfall and is close to saturation at peak time yet the soil water content remains the same below the near surface layer fig 7a c on the other hand when ks value is large the soil water content increases slightly at the surface layer but rises substantially for soils from one meter to four meters below the surface at the hillslope fig 7b or increases to become saturated for the whole soil layer near the channel fig 7d that is when the ks value is small only the near surface layer d 1 m gets wetted and saturated while large ks value leads to elevation in the soil water content for deeper soil from surface to 4 m deep in addition to the hydrologic response soil erosion and sediment transport are also sensitive to changes in ks table 3 and fig 5e f since hydraulic erosion is the dominant mechanism in the study catchment the change in sediment delivery rate corresponding to ks is similar with the trend observed in discharge fig 5a b and fig 5e f when ks is larger than 5 62 10 6 m s not only the sediment yield changes little for every cross section the total sediment mass passing through cross section 2 and 1 tend to be the same that is for the channels between these two cross sections there is dynamic balance between erosion and deposition the erosion occurring in the branched gullies is mainly deposited in the downstream main channel between cross section 2 and 1 fig s3 4 2 2 sa for manning s roughness coefficient the manning s roughness coefficient can be up to 0 6 in the secondary forests while it can also be less than 0 01 with bare soil liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 a wider range for the manning s roughness coefficient 0 004 0 8 in the channel is used in the sensitivity analyses to cover all possible values table 2 this way we can derive a more comprehensive trend of the changes in water and sediment transport caused by variation of the manning s roughness coefficient since this is part of our sensitivity analyses results from this very small manning s roughness coefficient will not impact our simulations as presented in table 4 both discharge and sediment delivery rate decrease with the increase of manning s roughness coefficient n quickly at the beginning and slow down when n 0 08 fig 8 a b and e f comparison between tables 3 and 4 indicates that the hydrological responses are more sensitive to the near surface saturated hydrologic conductivity ks than the manning s roughness coefficient n the relationships between te tp and n are almost linear fig 8c d the larger the manning s roughness coefficient is the longer the discharge is delayed to reach the flow peak tp similar for te fig 9 shows the surface runoff velocity at peak discharge when n keeps increasing the runoff velocity decreases significantly similar as the results of sensitivity analyses for ks the influence of change in the manning s roughness coefficient is more significant in the downstream reaches due to routing to investigate the combined impact of these two parameters ks and n on hydrologic response we conduct sensitivity analyses for n with different values of ks as we can see the two parameters have similar impact on qmax and qsum while te and tp are mainly dominated by n fig 10 along with the reduction in discharge increase of manning s roughness coefficient also reduces sediment yield table 4 and fig 8e f our results indicate that with the increase of manning s roughness coefficient the total sediment mass passing through cross section 1 becomes less than that passing through cross section 2 the reduction in total sediment yield caused by larger n at cross section 1 is larger than cross section 2 that is from cross section 2 to cross section 1 more sediment is deposited than eroded due to the smaller discharge 4 2 3 sa for erodibility coefficient the erodibility coefficient φ as a lumped parameter representing the soil susceptibility to water erosion is an essential parameter for erosion prediction in inhm heppner et al 2006 we conduct 11 simulations to examine the impact of erodibility coefficient φ on soil erosion and sediment transport table 5 the results of the peak sediment rate and total sediment mass at the three cross sections are presented in fig 11 both the peak sediment rate rmax and total sediment yield stotal increase with erodibility coefficient almost linearly at all three cross sections fig 11 however comparing across the space the sediment rate and total yield don t increase downstream as we expected the total sediment yield stotal at cross section 2 is higher than the other two cross sections where the peak sediment rate rmax also exceeds the other two cross sections when φ 0 0015 this suggests that as we go downstream more and more eroded sediment deposited in the main channel between cross section 2 and 1 probably because the sediment concentration becomes larger than the transport capacity when erodibility coefficient continues to increase 5 discussion 5 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity potential cause of transition in dominant runoff generation mechanism revegetation could modify top layer soil properties by root development gonzalez sosa et al 2010 ren et al 2016 wu et al 2016b one of the impacts is to increase the saturated hydraulic conductivity which would lead to reduction in peak flow and total discharge higher ks means higher infiltration rate and thus decreases surface runoff vice versa as fig 5 shows there is an apparent transition point in the relationship between ks and discharge occurring between 2 7 10 6 m s and 5 62 10 6 m s this phenomenon can be attributed to the impact of rainfall the instantaneous maximum rainfall intensity of the investigated event is 1 6 10 5 m s when ks is less than 2 7 10 6 m s horton overland flow hof occurs as the rainfall intensity is larger than ks in most of the time the surface soil becomes saturated quickly by rainfall while the deeper layer of the soil remains dry as the rainfall cannot infiltrate downward fast enough due to the small ks figs 6a c and 7a c as a result the runoff generated under these scenarios is mostly horton overland flow the entire catchment contributed to the runoff generation at peak time for horton overland flow the partition between infiltration and surface flow is decided by ks hence the generated discharge is strongly influenced by ks after decades of revegetation on the loess plateau studies have observed significant increase in ks value it could be larger than the instantaneous maximum rainfall intensity in many events our sensitivity analysis indicated that with the increase in ks the soil water content at surface decreases significantly at hillslope fig 6d f most of the rainfall falling on the hillslope infiltrates into the soil instead of the saturated near surface layer of soil larger ks values lead to increase in soil water content in the soil layers from one meter to four meters deep fig 7b due to the deep water table and the low soil water content at the whole soil column hillslope is not able to generate surface runoff during this rainfall event the surface runoff is mainly generated from the saturated area near the channel where the initial water table is close to the surface and the soil layer becomes saturated quickly during rainfall fig 7d that is the runoff generated here is dunne overland flow dof occurring in small areas adjacent to the channel with convergent topography it can be assumed that as rainfall amount increases the contribution area would expand to the whole hillslope as more and more area will be saturated since it is the total rainfall depth deciding the saturation area that contributes to runoff generation the peak flow and total discharge don t change much with the increase in ks the traditional understanding of the runoff generation mechanism in the loess plateau is hof liu et al 2012a however our analyses suggest that with the increase in ks due to revegetation the importance of dof rises when ks becomes larger than rainfall intensity dof may even take over the dominance in runoff generation at places near the rivers or in the forests playing a more important role than before on the loess plateau this emergent importance of dof was also hypothesized from field observation liu et al 2012a found that the value of ks in upper wei river basin was generally larger than the maximum daily rainfall during 2001 2004 suggesting the possibility of dunne runoff generation more field observations and numerical simulations are needed to examine the importance of dof and its spatial extent furthermore the potential increase in ks caused by revegetation would further aggravate the difference in ks between the top layer soil under vegetation impact and the bottom layer soil this increased divergence in the vertical profile of ks may also lead to more saturation excess runoff dof note that as long as the ks is larger than the rainfall intensity rainfall will continue to infiltrate into the soil and generate saturation excess runoff despite the division in soil layers further field sampling and measurements are needed to examine and validate our hypothesis from the sensitivity analysis 5 2 manning s coefficient transition from surface runoff to infiltration the increase in vegetation coverage will also lead to increase in the roughness of hillslope and the upstream gullies that is larger manning s roughness coefficient in the numerical simulations this would substantially reduce the runoff velocity on the hillslope and extend the total travel time which eventually affect both the hydrologic response and sediment transport as we have shown in table 4 and fig 8c d larger roughness coefficient can postpone the flood peak tp and extend the duration of flow event te by slowing down the surface runoff not only the travel time both the peak flow and total discharge also decrease with the increase of roughness this is because that during the extended travel time more and more surface runoff is intercepted by vegetation and re infiltrates into the soil along the flow path downstream to the channel that is by increasing the travel time larger manning s roughness coefficient enables more opportunities for re distribution in the partition between surface runoff and infiltration some of the surface runoff infiltrates back to the soil in the unsaturated area along the flow path this transition from surface runoff to re infiltration reduces the total discharge in general with the increased roughness a decreased flow velocity will lead to sediment deposition besides the extended time for re infiltration along the flow path could also cause the discontinuity of flow and decrease the discharge at catchment scale gomi et al 2008 moreno de las heras et al 2010 which would further increase sediment deposition along the flow path as we can see in fig 8f for scenarios with larger n values the total sediment yield at outlet cross section 1 is smaller than that at upstream cross section 2 suggesting more deposition between cross section 2 and cross section 1 due to the slower velocity comparing with the influence of ks we can see that increase in ks and n due to revegetation cast influence on hydrologic response in different ways although both of them result in increase in infiltration and reduction in total discharge their impacts occur at different stages in flow generation the increase in ks causes more infiltration at the initial stage when rainfall reaches the hillslope while the increase in n enables the re distribution of the initial generated runoff by infiltrating more surface runoff during the longer travel time after runoff is generated to conclude larger vegetation coverage would trigger the transition in dominant runoff from hof to dof by increasing ks at the initial stage when runoff is first generated and turn runoff into infiltration at the travelling period afterwards by decreasing the flow velocity with larger surface roughness n 5 3 erodibility coefficient impact on the channel topography besides ks and n vegetation development could also alter other soil properties i e the aggregation of soil particles the stem of vegetation can be a barrier for sediment transport and vegetation root network also plays a great role in protecting soil against water erosion wang et al 2013a as a surrogate of these characteristics the erodibility coefficient is used in the model to describe the soil resistance to erosion it can be reduced by larger vegetation coverage decrease the actual erosion by rainfall and runoff besides smaller erodibility coefficient in the channel area could also lead to less sediment scouring and silting in the gullies and channels as we can see from fig 11 with the decrease in erodibility coefficient caused by re vegetation not only the total sediment yield decreases at all three cross sections the difference between cross section 2 and cross section 1 also diminishes that is the net deposition between these two cross sections decreases fig 11b i e during the peak flow there is net erosion occurring between these two cross sections fig 11a to further examine the actual deposition and erosion in the whole catchment under the impact of erodibility coefficient we present the map of deposition in fig 12 at the time of peak flow the decrease in erodibility coefficient could substantially alleviate erosion in gullies as well as reduce the deposition in the main channel from upstream to downstream in reality this suggests that by altering soil properties larger vegetation coverage can alleviate the undercutting in the upstream tributary gullies and slow down the lifting of river bed of the main channel that is ecosystem restoration is able to slow down the drastic modification in topography in the loess plateau this is consistent with the observations that the implementation of grain for green project in loess plateau has been conducive to the reduction in soil erodibility throughout the yellow river basin and resulted in much smaller sediment output into the sea feng et al 2012 gao et al 2011 peng and chen 2010 it also plays an important role in slowing down the downstream river bed elevation and reducing the flood risk in the downstream region chu 2014 peng and chen 2010 6 conclusion in this paper we used a coupled hydrologic sediment transport model to conduct sensitivity analyses for saturated hydraulic conductivity k manning s roughness coefficient n and the variations of erodibility coefficient to study the impact of potential changes in these soil properties caused by re vegetation on water and sediment transport in a small catchment in the loess plateau our results indicated that the increase in near surface saturated hydraulic conductivity and manning s roughness coefficient could effectively reduce the peak and total flow at different stages of runoff generation the increase in ks leads to more infiltration at the initial stage when runoff is generated while the increase in n enables more infiltration of surface runoff along the flow path by slowing down the surface flow velocity this reduced surface runoff and smaller flow velocity caused by larger ks and n is less capable to erode soil and to transport sediment moreover smaller erodibility coefficient also results in sediment reduction by mediating the undercutting in the upstream tributaries which helps to slow down the increase in downstream river bed elevation to conclude our analyses suggest that the ongoing ecosystem restoration can influence the water and soil transport in the loess plateau in different ways by altering the various characteristics of soil by increasing ks re vegetation could result in shift of runoff generation mechanism from infiltration excess horton overland flow occurring at the entire catchment to the saturation excess dunne overland flow mostly at areas near the river channels the extended vegetation patches on hillslope and in the gullies would substantially slow down the surface flow velocity and trapped the water and soil along the flow path moreover smaller erodibility coefficient mediates the erosion in upstream gullies and deposition in downstream main channel which helps to slow down the fragmentation of landscape in the loess plateau given the changing climate and ongoing human intervention in the loess plateau our results shed light on possible results of approaches that are implemented however our simulations are based on some simplified assumptions i e the ks n or φ are applied to the whole catchment without the consideration of heterogeneity in soil or land use types more field measurements would help to better quantify the vertical profile of ks as well as the changes in soil water retention and permeability functions caused by re vegetation and their impacts on water and soil yield on the loess plateau further field observations and experiments with longer record length on the impacts of the changing environment are needed to validate our findings i e

6432,the changes of soil properties caused by ecosystem restoration have played critical roles in controlling water and sediment loss in loess plateau however it is difficult to isolate and quantify the individual impact of each factor as the impact is hard to monitor separately the objectives of this study are to explore how the changes in different soil properties influence the hydrologic response and sediment transport at catchment scale we applied a coupled hydrologic sediment transport model to a small catchment in the loess plateau sensitivity analyses were conducted on three influential soil properties saturated hydraulic conductivity ks manning s roughness coefficient n and the variations of erodibility coefficient φ our results indicated that the increase in near surface saturated hydraulic conductivity could effectively reduce the peak and total flow i e when ks is smaller than rainfall intensity 22 5 increase in ks leads to over 70 reduction in total discharge and could lead to transition of runoff generation mechanism from horton overland flow to dunne overland flow the increase in manning s roughness coefficient would also reduce the discharge and sediment yield substantially by slowing down the flow velocity which leads to more infiltration along the flow path after the runoff is generated the decrease in erodibility coefficient reduces the sediment rate and total sediment mass delivered i e 20 decrease can reduce total sediment mass by 5 alleviating the undercutting in upstream gullies and deposition at downstream eventually slowing down landscape evolution our findings could be used to provide valuable guidance in the ecosystem restoration and land use management keywords sensitivity analyses soil properties water discharge sediment transport inhm 1 introduction the loess plateau has suffered from severe soil erosion problem for centuries wei et al 2014 zhao et al 2013a in recent years both runoff and sediment yield at main stem of the yellow river has dropped significantly at tongguan station a gauge downstream of the loess plateau observations show that discharge and sediment yield have reduced by 53 7 and 96 5 respectively comparing with early 20th century 1919 1959 when human activities were limited hu 2016 liu et al 2014 shi et al 2017 this drastic runoff and sediment load reduction in the loess plateau can be attributed to the extensive anthropogenic activities aiming for the water and soil conservation feng et al 2012 xin et al 2012 one of the implementations that have been proved to be effective is the green for grain project since 1998 which transforms the mountainous cropland into grassland or forests wu et al 2016a increasing the vegetation coverage in loess plateau from 31 6 in 1999 to 59 6 in 2013 chen et al 2015 studies have shown that long term vegetation restoration is able to alleviate the soil erosion issue by altering the soil properties i e the saturated hydraulic conductivity the manning s roughness coefficient and the erodibility coefficient jiao et al 2011 li and shao 2006 wang et al 2013a b as previous studies indicated the increase in vegetation coverage could effectively lead to increase in hydraulic conductivity and manning s roughness coefficient and decrease in soil erodibility wang et al 2019 for example ren et al 2016 and wang et al 2013a found that the soil hydraulic conductivity increased from 0 4 mm min to 1 3 mm min when the vegetation coverage increased from around 40 to 60 in a small catchment on loess plateau liu et al 2010 also observed significant increase in manning s roughness coefficient when grass coverage increased from 0 to 70 in the soil erosion process soil erodibility is also an important characteristic used to represent the inherent resistance of soil to both detachment and transport caused by rainfall and runoff gao et al 2017 zhu et al 2010 vegetation growth also helps to develop more organic matters in the soil to increase soil aggregation zhu et al 2010 reducing soil erodibility an et al 2013 wang et al 2013a 2018 these changes in soil properties eventually lead to the reduction in water and sediment yield li et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a zhao et al 2014 on the influences of soil properties on runoff and sediment yield in the loess plateau most of the previous studies focused on the field monitoring at local scales i e experimental slopes and flume tests in the laboratory ai et al 2016 liu et al 2012b zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 however the field observations are usually the comprehensive results of changes in various soil properties liu et al 2012b it is usually not able to isolate the impacts of individual soil properties furthermore previous studies were mostly conducted at the hillslope scale or by flumes in the laboratory not many focused on catchment scale ai et al 2016 pan and shangguan 2006 yet the impact of revegetation on scouring and siltation in the river channels could not be captured in the laboratory or at hillslope scale the coupled hydrologic and sediment transport model is needed to help quantify the individual impacts of changes in different soil properties at catchment scale to help upscale our understandings of the comprehensive influences on runoff generation flow confluence and the correlated sediment transport in this study we adopted the physics based integrated hydrology model inhm to investigate the effects of changes in soil properties on hydrologic response and sediment transport the model was originally developed by vanderkwaak 1999 and vanderkwaak and loague 2001 and was used to simulate 3 dimensional variably saturated flow and solute transport in porous media and 2 dimensional flow on surface or in open channels dutton et al 2005 ebel et al 2010 2008 2007 sediment transport was added to inhm by heppner et al 2006 and ran et al 2007 where the soil erodibility is estimated by the erodibility coefficient based on the surface properties i e soil texture organic matter vegetation etc this coupled hydrologic and sediment transport model has been applied and validated at both hillslope scale and regional scale ran et al 2012 this model is capable of simulating four principal runoff generation mechanisms without prior assumptions ebel et al 2008 among the parameters in the model saturated hydraulic conductivity k manning s roughness coefficient n and erodibility coefficient φ are considered as the most important input parameters in the runoff generation and soil erosion simulation heppner et al 2006 loague et al 2005 ran et al 2015 to understand the individual and combined impacts of these parameters we applied this model to a small catchment in the loess plateau and conducted sensitivity analysis for these parameters although most of the sensitivity analyses in sediment transport were conducted for parameter selection before calibration ranatunga et al 2016 song et al 2015 here the sensitivity analysis were carried out to explore the impacts of the variability in these well known influential parameters in this paper we are more interested in answering the question that how the changes in soil properties caused by revegetation influences the runoff generation mechanism and soil erosion sediment transport at catchment scale this paper is organized in the following way section 2 describes the study area and data and section 3 gives a brief description of the model structure and sensitivity analyses scenarios the calibration validation and sensitivity analyses results are given in section 4 in section 5 we discuss the impacts of soil properties on water and sediment transport finally section 6 summarizes the main conclusions 2 study site and data the study was conducted at shejiagou sjg catchment in the center of the loess plateau in zizhou county shaanxi province china sjg is a tributary of chabagou cbg which is a third order tributary of the yellow river sjg covers an area of 4 26 km2 with an average gradient of 1 15 and elevation ranging from 936 m and 1143 m fig 1 the region has a semiarid continental climate the mean annual precipitation is 480 mm 70 of which occurring from june to september as short intense storms zhang et al 2016b runoff and sediment events are usually caused by short intensive rainstorms the mean annual potential evaporation is 1228 mm fang et al 2008 the dominant soil in sjg is sandy loam according to the soil taxonomy established by usda fang et al 2008 which is easy to be eroded and crusting fang et al 2007 2008 the vegetation coverage was very limited in shejiagou from 1959 to 1969 fang et al 2010 yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2016b and the soil and water conservation measurements haven t been implemented until 1970 fang et al 2010 zheng et al 2008 the dominant land use type was bare land and cultivated land during our observations 1967 1969 which was then changed to grassland and forests in 1986 fig s1 the discharge and suspended sediment concentration data were collected during flood seasons between 1967 and 1969 from sjg gauge 0 8 km away from the outlet it is one of the zizhou runoff experimental stations established to collect data for soil erosion and sediment transport study in the middle yellow river basin by the yellow river water conservancy commission the rainfall data was obtained from the sjg precipitation gauge at the foot of the hill near the sjg hydrology gauge since the sediment loss issue in the loess plateau were mainly caused by high intensity rainstorms our study would focus on event scale six of the biggest rainstorms during 1967 1969 were selected for analysis two of the them were used for calibration and the other four were used for validation all these data were collected from the hydrologic experimental data of zizhou runoff experimental station printed and issued by the yellow river water conservancy commission for internal use 3 methodology 3 1 model

can be found in heppner et al 2006 ran et al 2007 3 2 boundary value problem the boundary value problem bvp in this study includes the finite element method of numerical solution the boundary conditions the initial conditions and the parameterization of hydraulic properties 3 2 1 finite element discretization the finite element mesh used to represent the sjg catchment in inhm is shown in fig 2 a fig 2 b shows the details of the outlet the sjg mesh consists of 246 420 prism elements for the subsurface and 16 428 triangular elements for the surface the hydrologic response of the whole surface and subsurface is obtained through the grid computing and interpolation the result at every grid point is computed directly while the values between two grid points are obtained by linear interpolation the vertical spacing δ z in the sjg mesh varies from 0 1 m near surface to 1 6 m at depth the horizontal spacing δ x δ y varies from 5 m near channel and outlet to 160 m edges this meshing size is chosen to optimize the simulation based on previous experience loague and vanderkwaak 2002 mirus et al 2007 three cross sections are set as checkpoints along the river network to monitor the discharge and sediment passing through the channel fig 2a cross section 1 is set at sjg hydrometrical station cross section 2 is at the middle of the main channel and cross section 3 is in the upper stream reach 3 2 2 hydrologic initial conditions most of the observed events we used here occurred after a dry period 7 days without rainfall in general the discharge before the events was close to base flow to get close to this soil water condition we drained the catchment from a saturated state the model ran till the simulated discharge at cross section 1 near the sjg hydrometrical station was around 0 003 m3 s matching the mean discharge during base flow period in the observation we then applied the first month rainfall event july 1967 to the model as warm up this soil water distribution was then used as initial condition for our sensitivity analyses 3 2 3 hydrologic boundary conditions there are five faces in the simulation four of them are considered as impermeable a d h e d c g h c g f b and e h g f in fig 2 and the face at the outlet is considered as local sink a b f e the surface boundary conditions are impermeable the upgradient boundary dc and the sides da and cb except at the outlet of the river ab the rainfall rate from sjg precipitation station is applied to the whole catchment surface a d c b homogeneously while the evapotranspiration is assumed negligible during the relatively short simulation period usually less than 3 days 3 2 4 parameterization of hydraulic properties the soil profile is divided into two layers the near surface layer 0 0 5 m and the deep layer 0 5 10 m the near surface saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is calibrated while the value of deep layer kd is set to 9 10 7 m s and the porosity value of the whole soil layer is set to 0 4 m3 m3 they are based on the field measurement results at wangmaogou wmg a catchment in the neighboring county of zizhou county the two catchments are very similar in topography climate and soil properties they have the similar drainage area main channel length and altitude difference they are both characterized by semi arid continental monsoon climate with similar annual precipitation around 500 mm year air temperature mean temperature is around 10 c and seasonal variability fang et al 2007 zhao et al 2017 the dominant soil in both catchments is malan loess with less organic matter and high erodibility fang et al 2010 2008 the porosity value is consistent with the saturated water content measured by kimura et al 2005 the soil water retention and permeability functions are based upon the van genuchten vangenuchten 1980 approach and characteristics of sandy loam the parameters used in the van genuchten method are also averaged from measurements in wmg which are all within the range of sandy loam in van genuchten parameters rawls et al 1991 the kd value measured in wmg is used for our calibration as the impact of kd on runoff is limited table s1 3 3 calibration and validation the near surface saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the manning s roughness coefficient n are calibrated to fit the observed discharge at sjg gauge after the calibration of discharge the erodibility coefficient φ is calibrated to meet the observed sediment rate the criterion used to measure model performance is nash coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 two events in 1967 are simulated for calibration while the other four events in 1968 and 1969 are used for validation with the calibrated parameter values table 1 3 4 sensitivity analysis event in july 25th 1969 is selected for sensitivity analysis as there wasn t rainfall events within one week the antecedent water storage is close to our initial state assumption the three parameters investigated in the sensitivity analyses sa are 1 surface saturated hydraulic conductivity ks 2 the manning s roughness coefficient n and 3 the erodibility coefficient φ the calibrated values are considered as base case note that another soil erosion parameter rainsplash coefficient cf is not considered in the sensitivity analysis as its influence on sediment transport rate is negligible table s3 in addition though different soil water retention and permeability functions would also affect the simulated results ebel et al 2010 ran et al 2015 there is limited field observations or theoretical hypothesis about how they would change with vegetation restoration therefore the impacts of soil water retention and permeability functions are not included in this study the sensitivity analyses are designed based on the observations on the loess plateau from the literature as well as our measurements at nearby catchments table 2 since it usually takes decades for the restoration to have impacts on soil properties soils at different stages of restoration from different spots within same region were sampled to represent its temporal evolution due to re vegetation along the time jiao et al 2011 li and shao 2006 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2013b previous studies show that the ks values can vary from 8 3 10 8 m s up to 1 32 10 4 m s after decades of revegetation wang et al 2013a b wu et al 2016a zhao et al 2013b our measurements on loess plateau found similar results the ks value could increase from 1 84 10 7 m s to 1 03 10 4 m s after more than 40 years of vegetation restoration see fig s2 and table 2 therefore the ks value is set to vary from 8 3 10 8 m s to 1 32 10 4 m s in our sensitivity analysis since physical properties of deep soil could also be improved due to vegetation restoration the kd is also set to vary with ks to maintain their ratio constant in sensitivity analyses the variations of manning s roughness coefficient is set to cover the range of the measurements from different land use types in the loess area zhang et al 2007 and the experiments on the relationship between grass coverage and manning s roughness coefficient in the loess plateau liu et al 2010 different values of manning s roughness coefficient are assigned to channel cells and hillslope cells the manning s roughness coefficient on the hillslope varies with that in the main channel to keep their ratio constant the erodibility coefficient is a lumped parameter larger than zero although it cannot be measured directly previous field measurements laboratory experiments and data analyses of soil erodibility under different vegetation coverage all suggested that the erodibility decreased with the increase of vegetation coverage wang et al 2013a zhu et al 2010 which supports the variation in our sensitivity analyses variables used to describe the simulated rainfall runoff characteristics are the end time of flow event t e s the time to peak flow t p s the peak discharge q max m3 s and the total discharge q sum m3 the lyne holick filtering method is used to separate base flow from the total discharge to decide the end time of flow event lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 whereas variables used to quantify soil erosion and sediment transport characteristics are the peak sediment rate r max kg s and the total sediment mass s sum kg 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation the calibration and validation results are summarized in table 1 and figs 3 4 the calibrated values for near surface saturated hydraulic conductivity value ks and erodibility coefficient φ are 2 7 10 6 m s and 0 0003 respectively the manning s roughness coefficient in the channel and on the hillslopes are 0 008 and 0 01 respectively the manning s roughness coefficient values are smaller than expectation however given the characteristics of loess soil and close to bare soil in sjg during the simulation period 1967 1969 these calibrated n values are acceptable for our study catchment similar n values have been found at bare land or cultivated land on the loess plateau in previous studies li et al 2013 zhang et al 1995 1994 as we can see from table 1 and fig 3 the modeled results capture the flow events relatively well with the nash sutcliffe ns coefficients exceed 0 65 for most of the simulated events both the peak discharge and time to the peak discharge match observation well the only exception is the mismatched peak flow for event in aug 12th 1968 it is most likely due to the relatively large rainfall events before the simulated one elevating the antecedent soil water content that is our assumption on initial condition underestimated the actual value which then propagated to the estimate of peak runoff the model also simulates sediment concentration reasonably well with the ns coefficient larger than 0 55 for all the events except the one in aug 12th 1968 similar with the runoff simulation since the sediment transport of inhm is based on the hydrologic response this underestimation in sediment rate is likely propagated from the underestimation in the hydrologic simulation moreover the hyper concentrated flow occurring in low discharge event is difficult to simulate as it is not only caused by hydraulic erosion and rainsplash erosion in reality low discharge may be able to deliver unproportionally large amount of sediment due to the gravitational erosion including the sudden slope failure and collapse caused by rainfall li et al 2009 wang et al 1982 xu 1999 xu and yan 2005 since the goal of this work is to understand the impact of change in soil properties the current model is more focused on the integrated response for the entire rainfall time series simulations of these sudden geological hazards are beyond the scope of this study future improvement in the model structure is needed to include these abrupt geological events for better understanding in the overall mechanism of soil erosion on the loess plateau for this study we will concentrate on the everyday hydrologic erosion and our sensitivity analysis will be conducted on the events with best simulation results 4 2 sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 sa for saturated hydraulic conductivity the range of ks is from 8 3 10 8 m s to 1 32 10 4 m s according to the observations from literature and our measurements table 2 as we can see from table 3 both discharge qmax and qsum and sediment delivery rate rmax and stotal are relatively sensitive to the changes of ks one quarter drop in ks leads to 60 increase in peak flow while three quarters decrease in ks could increase the peak flow qmax by 3 5 times and lead to 128 increase in the total discharge qsum the changes of peak sediment rate and total sediment mass are similar to the changes of peak flow and total flow table 3 and fig 5 a b and e f on the other hand qmax drops significantly with the increase of ks when ks less than 5 62 10 6 m s this decrease slows down when ks continues to increase timing values te tp are relatively insensitive to the changes in ks table 3 and fig 5c d both the end time and peak time fluctuate slightly as the flow travel time is not much influenced by the saturated hydraulic conductivity especially when ks is larger than the rainfall intensity the end time and peak time are close to stable as the runoff is mainly generated from the channel area these trends are similar among three cross sections though the hydrologic response is more sensitive in lower reaches of main stream fig 6 illustrates the spatial variation of surface soil water content at the peak time for different ks values the whole surface is almost saturated at the peak time when ks 5 62 10 6 m s fig 6a c with the increase of ks only the channel and near channel areas remain saturated the hillslope becomes less and less saturated as more and more water infiltrates to the deep layer at a faster rate fig 7 presents the vertical distribution of soil water content with minimum and maximum ks values at the hillslope fig 7a b and near the channel fig 7c d as we can see the initial water table level around the channel is higher and it is easier to get saturated at the surface the vertical distribution patterns are different between the minimum ks 8 3 10 8 m s and the maximum ks 1 32 10 4 m s values for the soil at the top four meters when ks value is small the near surface soil gets saturated quickly after the rainfall and is close to saturation at peak time yet the soil water content remains the same below the near surface layer fig 7a c on the other hand when ks value is large the soil water content increases slightly at the surface layer but rises substantially for soils from one meter to four meters below the surface at the hillslope fig 7b or increases to become saturated for the whole soil layer near the channel fig 7d that is when the ks value is small only the near surface layer d 1 m gets wetted and saturated while large ks value leads to elevation in the soil water content for deeper soil from surface to 4 m deep in addition to the hydrologic response soil erosion and sediment transport are also sensitive to changes in ks table 3 and fig 5e f since hydraulic erosion is the dominant mechanism in the study catchment the change in sediment delivery rate corresponding to ks is similar with the trend observed in discharge fig 5a b and fig 5e f when ks is larger than 5 62 10 6 m s not only the sediment yield changes little for every cross section the total sediment mass passing through cross section 2 and 1 tend to be the same that is for the channels between these two cross sections there is dynamic balance between erosion and deposition the erosion occurring in the branched gullies is mainly deposited in the downstream main channel between cross section 2 and 1 fig s3 4 2 2 sa for manning s roughness coefficient the manning s roughness coefficient can be up to 0 6 in the secondary forests while it can also be less than 0 01 with bare soil liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 a wider range for the manning s roughness coefficient 0 004 0 8 in the channel is used in the sensitivity analyses to cover all possible values table 2 this way we can derive a more comprehensive trend of the changes in water and sediment transport caused by variation of the manning s roughness coefficient since this is part of our sensitivity analyses results from this very small manning s roughness coefficient will not impact our simulations as presented in table 4 both discharge and sediment delivery rate decrease with the increase of manning s roughness coefficient n quickly at the beginning and slow down when n 0 08 fig 8 a b and e f comparison between tables 3 and 4 indicates that the hydrological responses are more sensitive to the near surface saturated hydrologic conductivity ks than the manning s roughness coefficient n the relationships between te tp and n are almost linear fig 8c d the larger the manning s roughness coefficient is the longer the discharge is delayed to reach the flow peak tp similar for te fig 9 shows the surface runoff velocity at peak discharge when n keeps increasing the runoff velocity decreases significantly similar as the results of sensitivity analyses for ks the influence of change in the manning s roughness coefficient is more significant in the downstream reaches due to routing to investigate the combined impact of these two parameters ks and n on hydrologic response we conduct sensitivity analyses for n with different values of ks as we can see the two parameters have similar impact on qmax and qsum while te and tp are mainly dominated by n fig 10 along with the reduction in discharge increase of manning s roughness coefficient also reduces sediment yield table 4 and fig 8e f our results indicate that with the increase of manning s roughness coefficient the total sediment mass passing through cross section 1 becomes less than that passing through cross section 2 the reduction in total sediment yield caused by larger n at cross section 1 is larger than cross section 2 that is from cross section 2 to cross section 1 more sediment is deposited than eroded due to the smaller discharge 4 2 3 sa for erodibility coefficient the erodibility coefficient φ as a lumped parameter representing the soil susceptibility to water erosion is an essential parameter for erosion prediction in inhm heppner et al 2006 we conduct 11 simulations to examine the impact of erodibility coefficient φ on soil erosion and sediment transport table 5 the results of the peak sediment rate and total sediment mass at the three cross sections are presented in fig 11 both the peak sediment rate rmax and total sediment yield stotal increase with erodibility coefficient almost linearly at all three cross sections fig 11 however comparing across the space the sediment rate and total yield don t increase downstream as we expected the total sediment yield stotal at cross section 2 is higher than the other two cross sections where the peak sediment rate rmax also exceeds the other two cross sections when φ 0 0015 this suggests that as we go downstream more and more eroded sediment deposited in the main channel between cross section 2 and 1 probably because the sediment concentration becomes larger than the transport capacity when erodibility coefficient continues to increase 5 discussion 5 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity potential cause of transition in dominant runoff generation mechanism revegetation could modify top layer soil properties by root development gonzalez sosa et al 2010 ren et al 2016 wu et al 2016b one of the impacts is to increase the saturated hydraulic conductivity which would lead to reduction in peak flow and total discharge higher ks means higher infiltration rate and thus decreases surface runoff vice versa as fig 5 shows there is an apparent transition point in the relationship between ks and discharge occurring between 2 7 10 6 m s and 5 62 10 6 m s this phenomenon can be attributed to the impact of rainfall the instantaneous maximum rainfall intensity of the investigated event is 1 6 10 5 m s when ks is less than 2 7 10 6 m s horton overland flow hof occurs as the rainfall intensity is larger than ks in most of the time the surface soil becomes saturated quickly by rainfall while the deeper layer of the soil remains dry as the rainfall cannot infiltrate downward fast enough due to the small ks figs 6a c and 7a c as a result the runoff generated under these scenarios is mostly horton overland flow the entire catchment contributed to the runoff generation at peak time for horton overland flow the partition between infiltration and surface flow is decided by ks hence the generated discharge is strongly influenced by ks after decades of revegetation on the loess plateau studies have observed significant increase in ks value it could be larger than the instantaneous maximum rainfall intensity in many events our sensitivity analysis indicated that with the increase in ks the soil water content at surface decreases significantly at hillslope fig 6d f most of the rainfall falling on the hillslope infiltrates into the soil instead of the saturated near surface layer of soil larger ks values lead to increase in soil water content in the soil layers from one meter to four meters deep fig 7b due to the deep water table and the low soil water content at the whole soil column hillslope is not able to generate surface runoff during this rainfall event the surface runoff is mainly generated from the saturated area near the channel where the initial water table is close to the surface and the soil layer becomes saturated quickly during rainfall fig 7d that is the runoff generated here is dunne overland flow dof occurring in small areas adjacent to the channel with convergent topography it can be assumed that as rainfall amount increases the contribution area would expand to the whole hillslope as more and more area will be saturated since it is the total rainfall depth deciding the saturation area that contributes to runoff generation the peak flow and total discharge don t change much with the increase in ks the traditional understanding of the runoff generation mechanism in the loess plateau is hof liu et al 2012a however our analyses suggest that with the increase in ks due to revegetation the importance of dof rises when ks becomes larger than rainfall intensity dof may even take over the dominance in runoff generation at places near the rivers or in the forests playing a more important role than before on the loess plateau this emergent importance of dof was also hypothesized from field observation liu et al 2012a found that the value of ks in upper wei river basin was generally larger than the maximum daily rainfall during 2001 2004 suggesting the possibility of dunne runoff generation more field observations and numerical simulations are needed to examine the importance of dof and its spatial extent furthermore the potential increase in ks caused by revegetation would further aggravate the difference in ks between the top layer soil under vegetation impact and the bottom layer soil this increased divergence in the vertical profile of ks may also lead to more saturation excess runoff dof note that as long as the ks is larger than the rainfall intensity rainfall will continue to infiltrate into the soil and generate saturation excess runoff despite the division in soil layers further field sampling and measurements are needed to examine and validate our hypothesis from the sensitivity analysis 5 2 manning s coefficient transition from surface runoff to infiltration the increase in vegetation coverage will also lead to increase in the roughness of hillslope and the upstream gullies that is larger manning s roughness coefficient in the numerical simulations this would substantially reduce the runoff velocity on the hillslope and extend the total travel time which eventually affect both the hydrologic response and sediment transport as we have shown in table 4 and fig 8c d larger roughness coefficient can postpone the flood peak tp and extend the duration of flow event te by slowing down the surface runoff not only the travel time both the peak flow and total discharge also decrease with the increase of roughness this is because that during the extended travel time more and more surface runoff is intercepted by vegetation and re infiltrates into the soil along the flow path downstream to the channel that is by increasing the travel time larger manning s roughness coefficient enables more opportunities for re distribution in the partition between surface runoff and infiltration some of the surface runoff infiltrates back to the soil in the unsaturated area along the flow path this transition from surface runoff to re infiltration reduces the total discharge in general with the increased roughness a decreased flow velocity will lead to sediment deposition besides the extended time for re infiltration along the flow path could also cause the discontinuity of flow and decrease the discharge at catchment scale gomi et al 2008 moreno de las heras et al 2010 which would further increase sediment deposition along the flow path as we can see in fig 8f for scenarios with larger n values the total sediment yield at outlet cross section 1 is smaller than that at upstream cross section 2 suggesting more deposition between cross section 2 and cross section 1 due to the slower velocity comparing with the influence of ks we can see that increase in ks and n due to revegetation cast influence on hydrologic response in different ways although both of them result in increase in infiltration and reduction in total discharge their impacts occur at different stages in flow generation the increase in ks causes more infiltration at the initial stage when rainfall reaches the hillslope while the increase in n enables the re distribution of the initial generated runoff by infiltrating more surface runoff during the longer travel time after runoff is generated to conclude larger vegetation coverage would trigger the transition in dominant runoff from hof to dof by increasing ks at the initial stage when runoff is first generated and turn runoff into infiltration at the travelling period afterwards by decreasing the flow velocity with larger surface roughness n 5 3 erodibility coefficient impact on the channel topography besides ks and n vegetation development could also alter other soil properties i e the aggregation of soil particles the stem of vegetation can be a barrier for sediment transport and vegetation root network also plays a great role in protecting soil against water erosion wang et al 2013a as a surrogate of these characteristics the erodibility coefficient is used in the model to describe the soil resistance to erosion it can be reduced by larger vegetation coverage decrease the actual erosion by rainfall and runoff besides smaller erodibility coefficient in the channel area could also lead to less sediment scouring and silting in the gullies and channels as we can see from fig 11 with the decrease in erodibility coefficient caused by re vegetation not only the total sediment yield decreases at all three cross sections the difference between cross section 2 and cross section 1 also diminishes that is the net deposition between these two cross sections decreases fig 11b i e during the peak flow there is net erosion occurring between these two cross sections fig 11a to further examine the actual deposition and erosion in the whole catchment under the impact of erodibility coefficient we present the map of deposition in fig 12 at the time of peak flow the decrease in erodibility coefficient could substantially alleviate erosion in gullies as well as reduce the deposition in the main channel from upstream to downstream in reality this suggests that by altering soil properties larger vegetation coverage can alleviate the undercutting in the upstream tributary gullies and slow down the lifting of river bed of the main channel that is ecosystem restoration is able to slow down the drastic modification in topography in the loess plateau this is consistent with the observations that the implementation of grain for green project in loess plateau has been conducive to the reduction in soil erodibility throughout the yellow river basin and resulted in much smaller sediment output into the sea feng et al 2012 gao et al 2011 peng and chen 2010 it also plays an important role in slowing down the downstream river bed elevation and reducing the flood risk in the downstream region chu 2014 peng and chen 2010 6 conclusion in this paper we used a coupled hydrologic sediment transport model to conduct sensitivity analyses for saturated hydraulic conductivity k manning s roughness coefficient n and the variations of erodibility coefficient to study the impact of potential changes in these soil properties caused by re vegetation on water and sediment transport in a small catchment in the loess plateau our results indicated that the increase in near surface saturated hydraulic conductivity and manning s roughness coefficient could effectively reduce the peak and total flow at different stages of runoff generation the increase in ks leads to more infiltration at the initial stage when runoff is generated while the increase in n enables more infiltration of surface runoff along the flow path by slowing down the surface flow velocity this reduced surface runoff and smaller flow velocity caused by larger ks and n is less capable to erode soil and to transport sediment moreover smaller erodibility coefficient also results in sediment reduction by mediating the undercutting in the upstream tributaries which helps to slow down the increase in downstream river bed elevation to conclude our analyses suggest that the ongoing ecosystem restoration can influence the water and soil transport in the loess plateau in different ways by altering the various characteristics of soil by increasing ks re vegetation could result in shift of runoff generation mechanism from infiltration excess horton overland flow occurring at the entire catchment to the saturation excess dunne overland flow mostly at areas near the river channels the extended vegetation patches on hillslope and in the gullies would substantially slow down the surface flow velocity and trapped the water and soil along the flow path moreover smaller erodibility coefficient mediates the erosion in upstream gullies and deposition in downstream main channel which helps to slow down the fragmentation of landscape in the loess plateau given the changing climate and ongoing human intervention in the loess plateau our results shed light on possible results of approaches that are implemented however our simulations are based on some simplified assumptions i e the ks n or φ are applied to the whole catchment without the consideration of heterogeneity in soil or land use types more field measurements would help to better quantify the vertical profile of ks as well as the changes in soil water retention and permeability functions caused by re vegetation and their impacts on water and soil yield on the loess plateau further field observations and experiments with longer record length on the impacts of the changing environment are needed to validate our findings i e

6433,the coordination of social economy water and ecology is an important foundation for sustainable development however the interaction among social economy water and ecology are complex the data scales between socioeconomic factors normally at the spatial scale of the administrative region and the temporal scale of a year or month and river water quality and ecological factors normally at the spatial scale of a sub basin and the temporal scale of an instantaneous value do not match therefore many current regulation methods do not sufficiently consider the interaction mechanisms between socioeconomic water and ecological factors or cannot adequately deal with the scale of the data in this study we proposed a new framework to assess the coordinated development of social economy water and ecology swe by integrating the distributed social economy water ecological model sewe and the harmonious regulation model we built the sewe model by coupling a rainfall runoff model river water quality and ecological models we built the harmonious regulation model based on the harmony theory method we applied the proposed method and framework to the shaying river basin which exhibited typical characteristics of multiple sluices and dams high pollution and significant human activities results indicated that the coordinated development level of the swe in the shaying river basin was poor with the average coordination degree varying from 0 39 to 0 60 the average growth rate of the coordination degree of socioeconomic indicators was greater than that of the river water quality and ecological indicators the coordination degree of water ecological indicators was small with a decreasing trend these results indicated the increasing impact of socioeconomic development on river water quality and ecology therefore the shaying river basin should focus on ecological and environmental restoration such as the effective control of pollution draining into rivers the proposed methods and framework could contribute to the integrated water resource management of the basin keywords social economy distributed hydrological model harmonious regulation model coordinated development shaying river basin 1 introduction water is a basic but indispensable and strategic natural resource for human survival yang et al 2015 ecology and the environment have important links between human and nature levin and unsworth 2013 ives et al 2017 today due to the rapid development of human society problems associated with water resources ecology and the environment have become key factors hindering development it is necessary to study coordinated development by examining the relationships among the social economy water and ecology estoque and murayama 2017 vollmer et al 2018 in our study we considered the social economy water and ecology as a single system that consisted of a socioeconomic subsystem a water subsystem and an ecological subsystem we described each subsystem using certain indicators specifically we described the social economy according to indicators that reflected the level of social development we described the water according to indicators that reflected the state of river water quantity and quality and we described the ecology according to indicators that reflected only the state of river water ecology we based the selection of these indicators on in depth research of their interaction mechanism and actual conditions in the study areas however it is difficult to deal with the mismatched space time scales inherent in socioeconomic data and in river water quality and ecological data de lange et al 2010 hufnagl eichiner et al 2011 chaffin and gunderson 2016 vigiak et al 2018 current evaluation and regulation methods based on mathematics and statistics fail to consider the interaction mechanisms between socioeconomic river water quality and ecological factors cui et al 2019 therefore new research ideas are necessary in this study we propose a framework by integrating the distributed social economy water ecology model sewe and the harmonious regulation model luo et al 2018a compared with lumped models distributed hydrological models account for more of the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological factors and their parameters have explicit physical meanings stisen et al 2008 schröter et al 2011 bhatt et al 2014 liu et al 2015 koch et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 therefore they have developed rapidly since first being proposed particularly with the successful application of geographic information technology and remote sensing technology in hydrological modeling kang and merwade 2011 soulis 2013 sanzana et al 2017 currently distributed hydrological models that consider the interaction mechanism of the social economy water and ecology have attracted attention with the increasing complexity of the human water relationship liu et al 2014 sivapalan 2015 he et al 2018 for example rosegrant et al 2000 introduced an integrated economic hydrologic modeling framework that accounted for the interactions among water allocation farmer input choice agricultural productivity nonagricultural water demand and resource degradation cai et al 2003 developed a new integrated hydrologic agronomic economic model ahrends et al 2008 developed a coupled model system that included a distributed hydrological model and an economic optimization model due to a lack of in depth research on the interaction mechanisms between natural and social water cycle factors and their interaction with river water quantity quality and ecological indicators few distributed models have been built that consider the complex interactions of the social economy water and ecology factors as a whole this limits the application of distributed models in heavily disturbed basins in this study we attempted to build an integrated model the distributed social economy water ecology model sewe by coupling the rainfall runoff model river water quality and water ecological models to conduct a comprehensive simulation of socioeconomic factors including river water quality and water ecological factors in the literature considerable research has been conducted on the relationship between humans and nature flint et al 2013 motesharrei et al 2014 fischer and eastwood 2016 augustine and dolinting 2016 yan et al 2018 the relationship between humans and water mehta 2014 choi et al 2017 bao and zou 2018 and the impact of socioeconomic development on basin ecology or the environment zessner et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 islam et al 2018 for example mohamad and momcilo 2009 studied the impact of human activities on the water system through the response of flood peak flow to urbanization and climate change zuo et al 2016 analyzed the harmonious development level between the socioeconomic system and the river lake system in xiangyang city using the harmony theory method and albuquerque et al 2018 introduced the niche construction theory nct to investigate the effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbances on the environment few studies however have been conducted on the coordinated development of the social economy water and ecology from a systematic perspective in this study we proposed a new idea to study the coordinated development of the social economy water and ecology by integrating a distributed hydrological model and a harmony regulation model see section 3 1 the core of this approach is to build the sewe model which considers the interaction mechanism of social water cycle processes water withdrawal water use water consumption drainage and sewage and natural water cycle processes rainfall runoff and to integrate this model with the harmonious regulation model first we built an index system from the aspects of social economy water and ecology see section 3 2 for details second we built the sewe model by coupling the rainfall runoff model river water quality model and water ecological model followed by a social economic water ecological harmonious regulation model based on the harmony theory method we used the simulation outputs of the sewe model as the inputs for the harmonious regulation model the combination of the sewe model and the harmonious regulation model has the advantage of dealing with the different spatiotemporal scales of data see section 3 1 and solving the limitations of the harmonious regulation model and some similar regulation methods without considering the interaction mechanisms among social economy water and ecological factors in their coordinated development studies finally we developed a framework for the coordinated development of the swe see section 3 1 as a case study we applied the proposed method and framework to the shaying river basin in recent years rapid industrial development and urban domestic pollution have had a serious impact on the river water ecology and environment of the basin leading to the serious deterioration of river water quality and ecology pollutants are mainly concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the basin luo et al 2019 according to our field survey and experiments 2012 2015 the riverbank is severely hardened in many locations throughout the basin due to long term human interference the habitat of aquatic organisms is constantly changing the newly formed river habitat environment has a selective effect on river organisms leading to changes in the community structure of organisms we detected few aquatic species in our experiment and most of them are pollution tolerant the paper is organized as follows the study area and data are given in section 2 followed by the construction of the distributed social economy water ecological model sewe with consideration of the interaction mechanism of socioeconomic water and ecological factors by coupling the rainfall runoff model river water quality model water ecological model and a harmonious regulation model based on the harmony theory method see section 3 in our study we combined the sewe model and the harmonious regulation model to deal with the different spatiotemporal scale of data and to make up for the insufficient consideration of the interaction mechanism between the socioeconomic factors and the river water quality and ecological factors by the harmonious regulation model we formed a new framework for studying the coordinated development of the social economy water and ecology see section 3 1 we then applied the proposed method and framework to the shaying river basin which exhibited typical characteristics of multiple sluices and dams high pollution and significant human activities see section 4 2 study area and data 2 1 study area shaying river fig 1 with a length of 621 20 km

entering the huai river in mohekou town of yingshang county the basin is densely populated with a population density of 872 72 people per square kilometer in 2015 the utilization ratio of water resources exceeded 90 in 2015 in particular a large number of sluices and reservoirs were built in the middle and upper reaches of the basin luo et al 2018b zhai et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 2 2 data

model we conducted an ecological experiment to monitor the river environment in the shaying river basin and collected data accordingly luo et al 2018a we set up seven sampling points zhaopingtai station baiguishan station zhoukou station huaidian station fuyang station and yingshang station from the upstream to downstream of the shaying river basin fig 1 3 methods 3 1 research framework when the socioeconomic subsystem water subsystem in terms of river water quantity and quality and ecological subsystem in terms of river water ecology are in a good condition the swe is considered to be coordinated see section 3 3 2 therefore the level of coordinated development of the swe was first evaluated based on the basin s actual situation see section 3 4 1 followed by regulating the coordinated development of the swe in our study see section 3 4 2 in this process we combined the sewe model see section 3 3 with its remarkable spatial analysis ability and the harmonious regulation model see section 3 4 with its advantage of dealing with the basin s competition issues see the framework in fig 2 first we built an evaluation index system drawing on aspects of the socioeconomic subsystem water subsystem and ecological subsystem see section 3 2 second we built the sewe model to deal with the spatial and temporal mismatch of socioeconomic data and river water quality and ecological data see section 3 3 for spatial scales we counted the number of river segments within each administrative region and then we simulated and recorded the water subsystem and ecological subsystem data using the sewe model at the outlets of these river segments we next calculated water subsystem and ecological subsystem data in each administrative region from the average simulation results of the counted river segments within the corresponding administrative regions for the time scale we converted the simulated river water quality and ecological data from a daily scale to an annual scale by calculating the average of the simulated results of corresponding river water quality and ecological indicators following this we calculated the coordination degree of indicators table 1 subsystems and the swe using the harmony theory method see section 3 4 1 according to the actual condition of the shaying river basin when the coordination degree of each subsystem socioeconomic subsystem water subsystem and ecological subsystem is equal to 0 6 the value depends on the strictness of the definition of coordinated development of subsystems the swe is considered to have reached the generally acceptable level therefore in our research we set 0 6 as the minimum threshold that subsystems must meet if all subsystems met the threshold we then had to judge whether the coordination degree of the swe met the target value of coordinated development in the study area see section 3 4 2 if the target was met no regulation was needed if the target was not met we identified the main factors that were affecting the coordinated development of the swe and then developed regulatory scenarios based on the main influential factors finally we developed appropriate regulation schemes through continuous simulation and iterative optimization 3 2 index system of the swe coordinated development we selected indicators from the aspects of the socioeconomic subsystem water subsystem and ecological subsystem according to the research framework see section 3 1 for the socioeconomic subsystem we selected representative indicators mainly from the aspects of regional economic development and social development the selected indexes included per capita gross domestic product gdp per capita net income of rural residents per capita disposable income of urban residents tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate engel s coefficient number of beds per 10 000 people per capita urban road area and resident satisfaction with the environment table 1 we selected water subsystem indicators based mainly changes in river water quantity and quality under the influence of human social and economic development therefore we selected the annual average flow rate to represent changes in the water quantity in rivers we selected physical and chemical indicators to represent changes in water quality in rivers the final selected indicators included the annual average flow rate q dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand codcr five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and permanganate index codmn table 1 we selected ecological subsystem indicators based on aquatic species diversity and riverbank habitat quality the selected indices included the habitat environmental quality index heqi the shannon weiner diversity index of phytoplankton p swi the shannon weiner diversity index of zooplankton z swi and the shannon weiner diversity index of zoobenthos b swi table 1 3 3 distributed model of social economy water ecology 3 3 1 problems and corresponding solutions in the model building 1 the coupling of natural and social water cycles the social water cycle driven by social development is part of the water cycle and should be considered together with the natural water cycle in the distributed hydrological model it is difficult however to couple the natural and social water cycles because of their complex interaction in particular the spatiotemporal scale of the data between them is mismatched in general social water cycle data have a spatial scale of the administrative region and a temporal scale of a year or month natural water cycle data have a spatial scale of a sub basin and a temporal scale of a day instantaneous values on the day of sampling for river water quality and ecological indicators we coupled water quantity using the processed water withdrawal and drainage of the social water cycle in the model we divided the water withdrawal processes into two parts according to the nature of the water source surface water rivers lakes reservoirs and groundwater shallow groundwater if we knew the location of water withdrawal then we could bring the amount of water into the river routing equation or groundwater motion equation see eqs 5 and 6 respectively if we did not know the location we first estimated the amount of water according to administrative areas and then evenly distributed the amount of water among the sub basins based on the area percentage finally the amount of water distributed to each sub basin dissipated as evaporation we divided the process of drainage inside and outside the river the model considered only two cases 1 the drainage inside the river where the outlet was known and 2 the drainage outside the river where the outlet was not known for the first case we introduced the amount of drainage into the river routing equation see eq 6 for the second case we processed the data similar to the case of water withdrawal when we did not know the location that is we first estimated the amount of water according to administrative areas and then we evenly distributed the water among the sub basins based on the area percentage the difference between the two was the amount of drainage superimposed with the precipitation in the model see eq 2 in the sewe model we did not consider the case of drainage outside the river if we knew the drainage outlet because it was difficult to accurately obtain the amount of drainage and the corresponding locations in the shaying river basin such as the nonpoint pollution in rural and urban areas in other words for almost all kinds of drainages which are discharged outside the river it is difficult to obtain the amount of drainage and the corresponding locations certainly if we knew the amount of drainage and the corresponding location the amount of drainage could be superimposed on the precipitation of the corresponding sub basin we used a sub basin and administrative region overlay approach in the model to deal with the inconsistencies in the spatial scale of the social water cycle data and natural water cycle data first we calculated the area of sub basins in each administrative region and then assigned the water quantity of each administrative region to these sub basins according to their area percentage since we assumed the processes of water withdrawal and drainage to have a stable time variation during the year they were evenly distributed across the daily scale in the model 2 the coupling of rainfall runoff model river water quality model and water ecological model the interactions among water quantity water quality and water ecological indicators are complicated in areas with significant human activities it is difficult to quantify their relationship especially the water ecological indicators using a mathematical or physical model therefore we employed the nonlinear relationships between water ecological indicators water quantity indicators and water quality indicators to simulate the change in the river water ecological indicators see eqs 10 12 as for water quality indicators we used the outputs of the rainfall runoff model flow rate based on the coupling of natural social water cycle factors as the inputs for the river one dimensional water quality model see eqs 8 and 9 3 3 2 main modules of the sewe model we set five submodules the water circulation module socioeconomic module water quality module water ecology module and human intervention module in the sewe model fig 3 we built the model by combing the water circulation module rainfall runoff model water quality module and water ecological module under the influence of the socioeconomic module and the human intervention module the model considered the influence of water withdrawal water use water consumption drainage and sewage processes of the social water cycle on rainfall runoff processes of the natural water cycle fig 4 first we prepared the data of water withdrawal water use water consumption drainage and sewage of the social water cycle as the input to the sewe model second we simulated the runoff change process driven by the natural social water cycle based on the combination of the social water cycle processes of water withdrawal water use water consumption and drainage and the natural water cycle processes of rainfall and runoff see section 3 3 1 third we simulated the changing processes of water quality indicators in rivers using the flow rate output of the water circulation module as the input for the river one dimensional water quality model see section 3 3 1 finally we employed the nonlinear relationships among water ecological indicators water quantity indicators and water quality indicators established by liu 2016 in the shaying river basin using correlation analysis cluster analysis and impact contribution analysis we simulated changes in river water ecological indicators see eqs 10 12 we used the socioeconomic module which is the driver module of the sewe model to determine the water conversion relationship in the social water cycle water withdrawal water use water consumption drainage and sewage to provide the data inputs for the simulation of water quantity quality and ecological indicators the water circulation module provided the basis for the water quality module and water ecological module we used the module to simulate changes in runoff the simulation processes included rainfall runoff simulation soil water simulation shallow groundwater simulation and river flow rate routing simulation in particular the module considered the coupling of natural water cycle processes and social water cycle processes see section 3 3 1 we used some methods in the soil and water assessment tool swat model neitsch et al 2011 in our model s rainfall runoff simulation the water balance equation is as follows 1 δ v i p prec i r surf i e evap i w seep i q base i where δ v i is the

and δ t is the time step s the water quality module simulates changes in water quality indicators in rivers using the river one dimensional water quality model based on the results of the water circulation module and socioeconomic module the model considers the pollution load of the social water cycle and the impact of sluices gong and zhang 2013 8 c c 0 exp μ 2 d 1 1 4 k 1 d 86400 μ 2 x

sections linked to the branching point based on the results of the water circulation module and water quality module we used the water ecology module to simulate changes in water ecological indicators we used the nonlinear function relationships between water quantity water quality and water ecology proposed by liu 2016 based on the summary of a long series of experimental data from the shaying river basin 10 f p s w i 02371 0 0219 x do 2 0 0491 x tn 2 0 5080 x do 0 0136 x q 0 4750 x tn 0 0045 x q x tn 0 1014 x tn x tn 11 f z s w i 1 6626 0 0013 x q x tn 1 5803 ln x do and 12 f b s w i 0

intervention module to simulate the effect of different methods of human intervention on hydrology river water quality and ecology according to the actual condition of the shaying river basin the influence of sluices and water transfer between sub basins of the basin on the simulation of hydrology river water quality and ecology was considered neitsch et al 2011 3 4 harmonious regulation model 3 4 1 harmony theory method the harmony degree equation is a quantitative evaluation method used to study the human water relationship see zuo et al 2015a 2016 for details it has been widely used in water quality evaluation socioeconomic development evaluation and cross border river diversion cui et al 2014 meng et al 2016 song et al 2016 wang et al 2015 the core of the method calculates a comprehensive index that can reflect the level of harmonious development in regions by establishing a system evaluation criteria and evaluation methods we employed this method to study the coordinated development of the swe by coupling it with the sewe model we calculated the coordination degree of a single indicator as follows 13 s i i 0 x i a i 0 3 x i a i b i a i a i x i b i 0 3 0 3 x i b i c i b i b i x i c i 0 6 0 2 x i c i d i c i c i x i d i 0 8 0 2 x i d i e i d i d i x i e i 1 e i x i and s i i 1 x i e i 0 8 0 2 d i x i d i e i e i x i d i 0 6 0 2 c i x i c i d i d i x i c i 0 3 0 3 x i b i c i b i c i x i b i 0 3 x i a i b i a i b i x i a i 0 a i x i where s i i is the coordination degree of index i at time t s i i 0 1 x i is the value of index i at time t and a i b i c i d i and e i are node values of index i namely the worst value the worse value the normal value the better value and the optimal value among these indicators for water quality indicators we determined threshold values based on the surface water environmental quality standard state environmental protection administration of china and general administration of quality supervision and inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china 2002 for the socioeconomic indicators and water ecological indicators we determined the optimal value based on the national optimal level with a suitable increase in percentage and determined the normal value based on the multiyear average of the indicator in the study area we determined the worst value one of the node values defined above using the worst value of the indicator over many years in the study area we determined the worse value and the better value based on a combination of the interpolation method and the nature of the indicator luo et al 2018a the coordination degree of the swe can be calculated as follows 14 swehd t α s e h d t β w h d t γ e h d t α i 1 n 1 ω i s i i β j 1 n 2 ω j s i j γ k 1 n 3 ω k s i k where swehd is the coordination degree of the swe sehd is the coordination degree of the socioeconomic subsystem whd is the coordination degree of the water subsystem ehd is the coordination degree of the ecological subsystem and α β γ are the weights of corresponding subsystem indicators in this study socioeconomic subsystem water subsystem and ecological subsystem were considered to be of similar importance so we gave them equal value 1 3 each the coordination degree of the i th indicator of the socioeconomic subsystem is sii the coordination degree of the j th indicator of the water subsystem is sij and the coordination degree of the k th indicator of the ecological subsystem is sik to express the coordinated development level of the swe in regions intuitively we created seven levels completely uncoordinated highly uncoordinated generally uncoordinated relatively uncoordinated generally coordinated highly coordinated and completely coordinated based on the swehd with a step of 0 2 table 2 3 4 2 harmony regulation model the coordination of the swe constantly shifted from one state to another over time based on the harmonious balance theory described by zuo et al 2015b they defined the balance of harmony as a state that is relatively static and acceptable to stakeholders by considering their own interests and the overall harmonious goals the general form of the harmony regulation model is as follows 15 z h d x h d 0 subject to g x 0 and x 0 where x is the decision vector h d x is the harmony degree of the research object h d 0 is the minimum harmony degree that is considered to have reached a harmonious balance of the research object that is the target threshold of harmony degree and g x is a set of constraints according to the meaning of the harmonious regulation and the actual condition of the shaying river basin we employed this model to research the coordinated development of the swe the constraints considered in our model included the minimum coordination degree of subsystems water balance water quality and ecology 16 z s w e h d x s w e h d 0 and 17 s u b j e c t t o min s e h d x w h d x e h d x h d th subsystem δ w q 1 q pre q trib q hum q gc q seep q evap

employed the nash suttcliffe efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of determination r2 and relative error re as performance indicators to evaluate the accuracy of the sewe model we selected fuyang station which is located at the outlet of the shaying river basin as an example see fig 1 for hydrological simulation we used the nse and r2 as performance indicators the simulation period was from 2000 to 2013 we selected 2000 2009 as the calibration period and 2010 2013 as the verification period fig 5 through sensitivity analysis we considered the runoff curve number soil evaporation compensation coefficient and shallow groundwater runoff coefficient to be sensitive parameters after constant adjustment we obtained r2 0 78 and nse 0 73 for the calibration period and r2 0 74 and nse 0 70 for the validation period fig 5 which indicated that the results of hydrological simulation were satisfactory taking do codcr bod5 tp nh4 n and codmn as representative indicators we employed re to assess the simulation results of the water quality model after constantly adjusting the degradation coefficient we obtained re do 19 63 re codcr 21 73 re bod5 23 88 re tp 24 51 re nh4 n 24 77 re codmn 20 92 the simulation accuracy of some water quality indicators was not very high with an re value greater than 20 in general if re was less than or equal to 20 we considered that the simulation result was satisfactory fig 6 the inaccurate simulation may have been caused by the uncertainty of the input data and the impact of sluices on river water quality in addition to the point source pollution data that can be collected rural non point source pollution has a great impact on river water quality especially in areas with low urbanization rates the urbanization rate of the shaying river basin was not very high with a value of 44 37 in 2015 we estimated the amount of pollutants caused by rural households based on the number of rural people and livestock they raised and then estimated the amount of pollutants entering the river based on the coefficients of these pollutants entering the river the uncertainty in the assessment process had an impact on the accuracy of the model in addition the impact of sluices on river pollution is complicated for example the interaction of overlying water suspended solids and sediment pollutants caused by sluice scheduling may be accompanied by a series of physical chemical and biological processes the current research does not provide an advanced theoretical basis in our model we simulated the changing process of water quality indicators in the river sections in cases in which sluices are built on the basis of historical data establishing the relationship between the concentration of water quality indicators in upper and lower sections of sluices note that if more accurate input data are available in other basins and the influence of the sluice on river water quality is studied in depth simulation accuracy can be improved fortunately the current simulation accuracy can support the coordinated development research of the swe in this study similar to water quality indicators we employed the re to assess the simulation accuracy of water ecological indicators we selected the p swi and the z swi as representative indicators see fig 7 after calculation we obtained re p swi 19 29 and re z swi 21 75 note that we considered only the diversity index of phytoplankton zooplankton and zoobenthos as ecological indicators given that the actual condition of the shaying river basin has strong human activity and serious water pollution for details see luo et al 2018a the simulation accuracy of the model was not very high the interaction between aquatic organisms and their surrounding environment such as hydrodynamics water quantity water quality and morphology is complicated the current research does not fully reveal their interaction mechanisms including the enrichment of pollutants in aquatic organisms and the effects of water quality and hydrodynamic factors on spawning and the survival habits of aquatic organisms our research is limited to the use of the nonlinear relationship between biological indicators and surrounding environmental factors better evaluation results might be found if more in depth research can be conducted and more ecological indicators are considered 4 2 assessment of the coordinated development of the swe in shaying river basin 4 2 1 coordination degree calculation table 3 shows the calculation results of the coordination degree of the swe in different regions of the shaying river basin from 2000 to 2015 table 3 shows that the coordination degree in the shaying river basin varies between 0 3 and 0 7 indicating that the level of the coordinated development of the swe in the shaying river basin was poor the average coordination degrees in each region from 2000 to 2015 were as follows swehd zhengzhou city 0 51 swehd kaifeng city 0 47 swehd luoyang city 0 60 swehd pingdingshan city 0 58 swehd xuchang city 0 53 swehd luohe city 0 58 swehd nanyang city 0 56 swehd zhoukou city 0 45 swehd zhumadian city 0 39 and swehd fuyang city 0 50 these results revealed that differences in the coordinated development of the swe in regions of the shaying river basin are not obvious 4 2 2 time variation of the coordination degree the calculation results of the swehd sehd whd and ehd in the shaying river basin are plotted in fig 8 the figure shows that the coordination degree of the swe swehd changed between 0 4 and 0 6 from 2000 to 2015 and had a slowly increasing trend which indicated that the coordination of the swe in the shaying river basin was improving from a subsystems perspective the values of the sehd whd and ehd in the basin were small among these values the whd which varied between 0 5 and 0 7 was the largest followed by the sehd which varied between 0 3 and 0 7 the value of the ehd which varied between 0 3 and 0 5 was the smallest the small value of the sehd indicated that the level of the social and economic development in the basin was low the same was true for the whd and ehd which indicated the poor water environmental and ecological status from the perspective of time variation gaps between the sehd whd and ehd in the basin showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2015 which indicated an increasing impact of socioeconomic development on the basin s water ecology and environment from the perspective of administrative regions the value of the sehd was greater than that of the whd and ehd in zhengzhou city kaifeng city zhoukou city zhumadian city and fuyang city this greater shed value revealed the high socioeconomic development levels and poor river water environmental and ecological conditions in these regions coordinated development strategies should be adopted in these regions to ease the contradiction between socioeconomic development and water ecological and environmental protection values of the sehd whd and ehd in the remaining regions luoyang city xuchang city pingdingshan city luohe city and nanyang city showed that the whd value was greater than the sehd and that the sehd value was greater than the ehd these findings revealed the significant socioeconomic development potential in these regions under the condition of ecological and environmental protection 4 2 3 spatial variation of the coordination degree to analyze the spatial variation of the coordinated development among social economy water and ecology in the shaying river basin we selected four representative years 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 the spatial distributions of the sehd whd ehd and swehd are plotted in figs 9 12 respectively we used the sehd to reflect the level of regional socioeconomic development the greater the value the higher the level of socioeconomic development fig 9 shows that the sehd was small in all regions of the shaying river basin in 2000 and that it did not exceed the threshold level of 0 6 which indicated the low development level of the social economy in the shaying river basin the value of the sehd in zhengzhou city 0 41 however was the highest compared with other cities of the basin the value of the sehd improved from 2000 to 2005 the sehd in all regions of the basin was less than 0 6 however except for zhengzhou city with a value of 0 63 in 2010 the value of sehd was further improved zhengzhou city and luoyang city improved to the level of generally coordinated development and the remaining regions were improved to the level of relatively uncoordinated development compared with 2010 the social economy greatly improved in 2015 the sehd was spatially distributed in the western part of the basin which achieved a level of generally coordinated development and was greater than that of the eastern part of the basin which achieved a level of relatively uncoordinated development we calculated the whd to show the contribution of river water quantity and quality of the basin to the coordinated development of the swe the greater the value the more conducive it was to the coordinated development of the swe fig 10 shows that the value of the whd in luoyang city pingdingshan city luohe city and nanyang city ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 was good xuchang city and fuyang city followed with a value of the whd ranging from 0 6 to 0 8 the situation was classified as being the worst in zhengzhou city kaifeng city zhoukou city and zhumadian city in 2000 the main pollution areas were concentrated in zhengzhou city kaifeng city zhoukou city zhumadian city and fuyang city in addition the value of the whd in luohe city pingdingshan city and nanyang city which are located in the upper reaches of the shaying river basin was the highest with a level of very coordinated development the value of whd in xuchang city and luohe city which are located in the middle reaches of the basin was poor with a level of generally coordinated development compared with 2000 the value of whd in 2005 improved the level of the whd in zhoukou city and fuyang city improved from relatively uncoordinated to generally coordinated development in 2010 in addition to cities in the upper reaches of the basin i e luoyang city pingdingshan city and nanyang city water quality also deteriorated in the middle and lower reaches of the basin i e zhoukou city kaifeng city zhumadian city and fuyang city in 2015 because of government s governance water quality improved in the basin except for zhoukou city kaifeng city and zhumadian city with levels of relatively uncoordinated or generally uncoordinated development the calculation results of the ehd are plotted in fig 11 the greater the ehd the better the ecological condition the figure shows that the ehd in the basin was poor and almost no regions in the four representative years reached the threshold level of 0 6 from 2000 to 2005 the average rate of change of the ehd in the basin was 0 07 which indicated a gradually deteriorating trend of ecological conditions especially in regions of luoyang city pingdingshan city nanyang city xuchang city kaifeng city and zhumadian city from 2005 to 2010 the average rate of change of the ehd in the basin was 0 06 which indicated that ecological conditions in the basin had further deteriorated the ecological status of the basin further deteriorated from 2010 to 2015 with an average rate of change of 0 09 in summary the overall ecological condition in the shaying river basin was poor with the spatial distribution in the middle and lower reaches of the basin being slightly greater than that in the upper reaches of the basin the swehd is the integration of the sehd whd and ehd it can be used to comprehensively reflect the coordinated development level of the swe in the shaying river basin the greater the value the higher the coordinated development of the swe fig 12 shows that the value of swehd in the shaying river basin ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 was low in 2000 no region of the basin however reached the threshold level of 0 6 in 2005 the value of the swehd in the regions of zhengzhou city kaifeng city and fuyang city improved compared with 2000 this is especially true for fuyang city which reached a level of generally coordinated development in 2010 the spatial distribution of swehd became more uneven the swehd in regions of the basin except for luoyang city which had a level of generally coordinated development varied from 0 4 to 0 6 that is relatively uncoordinated development in 2015 the swehd in the basin improved significantly the spatial distribution in the upper reaches of the basin the value of the swehd ranged from 0 6 to 0 8 was greater than that in the middle and lower reaches the value of the swehd ranged from 0 4 to 0 6 4 3 regulation of the swe coordinated development in the shaying river basin 4 3 1 regulation indicators and their adjustability according to the assessment results of the swe although river water environmental and ecological conditions in the shaying river basin are poor they have great potential for improvement therefore on the basis of 2015 data we set the regulation goal of the swehd in the basin to increase by 25 that is the value of the swehd needs to improve from 0 57 to 0 71 as shown in table 3 the swehd values in all regions of the basin do not meet the target level of 0 71 the main factors that affect the swehd in each region need to be identified and then regulations should be implemented based on scenario simulation fig 13 shows the coordination degree for indicators of the shaying river basin in 2015 we set the target value of 0 71 to select the main influencing indicators if the coordination degree of an indicator was below the value of 0 71 we considered it to be an influencing factor it can be seen from fig 13 that the main indicators in zhengzhou city include annual average flow rate heqi p swi z swi and b swi kaifeng city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people annual average flow rate codcr tp nh4 n heqi p swi z swi and b swi luoyang city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp urbanization rate annual average flow rate heqi p swi z swi and b swi pingdingshan city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people heqi z swi and b swi xuchang city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people heqi z swi and b swi luohe city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people heqi p swi z swi and b swi nanyang city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people heqi p swi z swi and b swi zhoukou city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people tp nh4 n codmn annual average flow rate heqi z swi and b swi zhumadian city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people codcr nh4 n annual average flow rate heqi p swi z swi and b swi and fuyang city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people annual average flow rate heqi p swi and b swi since indicators of per capita gdp tertiary industry shares of gdp and number of beds per 10 000 people can be improved through measures such as increasing economic development adjusting the proportion of industrial structure and increasing the investment of medical devices they are considered to be indicators of adjustability urbanization rate and population density can only be controlled rather than artificially increased or decreased in the short term by considering the nature of these indicators and the actual condition of the basin pollution water quality indicators such as codcr codmn nh4 n and tp are mainly associated with industrial agricultural and urban rural domestic sewage discharge in the sewe model they were treated as the boundary inputs after the estimation of the amount of the pollutions from industry agriculture and urban rural households that is the adjustable water quality factors originate from the sewage discharge of industry agriculture and urban and rural households therefore we focused on indicators that refer to water use water treatment and water discharge the heqi which is scored based on on site surveys can be improved through ecological management of rivers and lakes and is considered to be an indicator that can be regulated as the ecological indicators such as p swi z swi and b swi cannot be improved through direct regulation and control measures in the short term because of their complex relationship with river water quality and water ecology factors they are indirectly regulated based on the nonlinear relationship of water quantity water quality and water ecological indicators in summary the selected regulatory indicators in the shaying river basin include per capita gdp rf1 tertiary industry share of gdp rf2 number of beds per 10 000 people rf3 per capita daily water use rf4 per 0 067 ha of farmland irrigation water use rf5 10 000 renminbi industrial added value water use rf6 heqi rf7 and concentrations of codcr rf8 codmn rf9 nh4 n rf10 and tp rf11 in regional industrial agricultural and urban rural domestic drainage 4 3 2 scenario design and scheme optimization to improve regulation efficiency we divided regulation indicators into three categories based on their nature and developed regulation scenarios based on a 10 growth or reduction rate of regulation indicators table 4 after iterative optimization we selected scenarios that met the target value of 0 71 to build a collection of recommended schemes each regulation indicator should be aligned with the corresponding constraints based on their nature and the actual condition of the basin for example the growth rate of per capita gdp should be limited to a suitable range based on the actual condition of the basin similarly the per capita domestic water use should be limited to a suitable range of reduction after comparison and optimization in which case per capita gdp and number of beds per 10 000 people increased by 50 heqi increased by 40 per capita daily water use decreased by 10 and the concentrations of codcr codmn nh4 n and tp in industrial agricultural and urban rural domestic drainage of the basin decreased by 30 the coordination degree of the swe in the shaying river basin met the target value of 0 71 the regulation scheme of the scenario is shown in table 5 5 conclusion due to the increasing complexity of the human water relationship it is necessary to research the coordinated development among social economy water and ecology by considering the interaction of their indicators in this study we proposed a framework for studying the coordinated development of the swe by building a distributed social economy water ecology model and a harmonious regulation model we applied the proposed framework and methods to the shaying river basin which exhibited the typical characteristics of multiple sluices and dams high levels of pollution and significant human activities the results indicated the following 1 the simulation results of the sewe model were satisfactory we employed nse and r2 to assess the accuracy of the hydrological simulation results of the model by comparison with the measured data the model had r2 0 78 and nse 0 73 in the calibration period and had r2 0 74 and nse 0 70 in the verification period we employed relative error re to assess the accuracy of the results of water quality and ecological indicators by comparing the measured data we obtained re do 19 63 re codcr 21 73 re bod5 23 88 re tp 24 51 re nh4 n 24 77 and re codmn 20 92 for water quality indicators and re p swi 19 29 and re z swi 21 75 for water ecological indicators the results of the model were acceptable 2 the coordinated development level of the swe in the shaying river basin which had an average coordination degree ranging from 0 39 to 0 60 was low in detail the coordination degree of river water quantity and quality ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 was the highest followed by the coordination degree of the social economy ranging from 0 3 to 0 7 the coordination degree of water ecology ranging from 0 3 to 0 5 was the smallest notably the ecological and environmental problems caused by socioeconomic development in the shaying river basin were serious 3 the main factors affecting the coordinated development of the swe in the shaying river basin were per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp number of beds per 10 000 people per capita daily water use per 0 067 ha of farmland irrigation water use 10 000 renminbi industrial added value water use heqi and concentrations of codcr codmn nh4 n and tp caused by regional industrial agricultural and urban rural domestic sewage discharge conflict of

6433,the coordination of social economy water and ecology is an important foundation for sustainable development however the interaction among social economy water and ecology are complex the data scales between socioeconomic factors normally at the spatial scale of the administrative region and the temporal scale of a year or month and river water quality and ecological factors normally at the spatial scale of a sub basin and the temporal scale of an instantaneous value do not match therefore many current regulation methods do not sufficiently consider the interaction mechanisms between socioeconomic water and ecological factors or cannot adequately deal with the scale of the data in this study we proposed a new framework to assess the coordinated development of social economy water and ecology swe by integrating the distributed social economy water ecological model sewe and the harmonious regulation model we built the sewe model by coupling a rainfall runoff model river water quality and ecological models we built the harmonious regulation model based on the harmony theory method we applied the proposed method and framework to the shaying river basin which exhibited typical characteristics of multiple sluices and dams high pollution and significant human activities results indicated that the coordinated development level of the swe in the shaying river basin was poor with the average coordination degree varying from 0 39 to 0 60 the average growth rate of the coordination degree of socioeconomic indicators was greater than that of the river water quality and ecological indicators the coordination degree of water ecological indicators was small with a decreasing trend these results indicated the increasing impact of socioeconomic development on river water quality and ecology therefore the shaying river basin should focus on ecological and environmental restoration such as the effective control of pollution draining into rivers the proposed methods and framework could contribute to the integrated water resource management of the basin keywords social economy distributed hydrological model harmonious regulation model coordinated development shaying river basin 1 introduction water is a basic but indispensable and strategic natural resource for human survival yang et al 2015 ecology and the environment have important links between human and nature levin and unsworth 2013 ives et al 2017 today due to the rapid development of human society problems associated with water resources ecology and the environment have become key factors hindering development it is necessary to study coordinated development by examining the relationships among the social economy water and ecology estoque and murayama 2017 vollmer et al 2018 in our study we considered the social economy water and ecology as a single system that consisted of a socioeconomic subsystem a water subsystem and an ecological subsystem we described each subsystem using certain indicators specifically we described the social economy according to indicators that reflected the level of social development we described the water according to indicators that reflected the state of river water quantity and quality and we described the ecology according to indicators that reflected only the state of river water ecology we based the selection of these indicators on in depth research of their interaction mechanism and actual conditions in the study areas however it is difficult to deal with the mismatched space time scales inherent in socioeconomic data and in river water quality and ecological data de lange et al 2010 hufnagl eichiner et al 2011 chaffin and gunderson 2016 vigiak et al 2018 current evaluation and regulation methods based on mathematics and statistics fail to consider the interaction mechanisms between socioeconomic river water quality and ecological factors cui et al 2019 therefore new research ideas are necessary in this study we propose a framework by integrating the distributed social economy water ecology model sewe and the harmonious regulation model luo et al 2018a compared with lumped models distributed hydrological models account for more of the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological factors and their parameters have explicit physical meanings stisen et al 2008 schröter et al 2011 bhatt et al 2014 liu et al 2015 koch et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 therefore they have developed rapidly since first being proposed particularly with the successful application of geographic information technology and remote sensing technology in hydrological modeling kang and merwade 2011 soulis 2013 sanzana et al 2017 currently distributed hydrological models that consider the interaction mechanism of the social economy water and ecology have attracted attention with the increasing complexity of the human water relationship liu et al 2014 sivapalan 2015 he et al 2018 for example rosegrant et al 2000 introduced an integrated economic hydrologic modeling framework that accounted for the interactions among water allocation farmer input choice agricultural productivity nonagricultural water demand and resource degradation cai et al 2003 developed a new integrated hydrologic agronomic economic model ahrends et al 2008 developed a coupled model system that included a distributed hydrological model and an economic optimization model due to a lack of in depth research on the interaction mechanisms between natural and social water cycle factors and their interaction with river water quantity quality and ecological indicators few distributed models have been built that consider the complex interactions of the social economy water and ecology factors as a whole this limits the application of distributed models in heavily disturbed basins in this study we attempted to build an integrated model the distributed social economy water ecology model sewe by coupling the rainfall runoff model river water quality and water ecological models to conduct a comprehensive simulation of socioeconomic factors including river water quality and water ecological factors in the literature considerable research has been conducted on the relationship between humans and nature flint et al 2013 motesharrei et al 2014 fischer and eastwood 2016 augustine and dolinting 2016 yan et al 2018 the relationship between humans and water mehta 2014 choi et al 2017 bao and zou 2018 and the impact of socioeconomic development on basin ecology or the environment zessner et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 islam et al 2018 for example mohamad and momcilo 2009 studied the impact of human activities on the water system through the response of flood peak flow to urbanization and climate change zuo et al 2016 analyzed the harmonious development level between the socioeconomic system and the river lake system in xiangyang city using the harmony theory method and albuquerque et al 2018 introduced the niche construction theory nct to investigate the effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbances on the environment few studies however have been conducted on the coordinated development of the social economy water and ecology from a systematic perspective in this study we proposed a new idea to study the coordinated development of the social economy water and ecology by integrating a distributed hydrological model and a harmony regulation model see section 3 1 the core of this approach is to build the sewe model which considers the interaction mechanism of social water cycle processes water withdrawal water use water consumption drainage and sewage and natural water cycle processes rainfall runoff and to integrate this model with the harmonious regulation model first we built an index system from the aspects of social economy water and ecology see section 3 2 for details second we built the sewe model by coupling the rainfall runoff model river water quality model and water ecological model followed by a social economic water ecological harmonious regulation model based on the harmony theory method we used the simulation outputs of the sewe model as the inputs for the harmonious regulation model the combination of the sewe model and the harmonious regulation model has the advantage of dealing with the different spatiotemporal scales of data see section 3 1 and solving the limitations of the harmonious regulation model and some similar regulation methods without considering the interaction mechanisms among social economy water and ecological factors in their coordinated development studies finally we developed a framework for the coordinated development of the swe see section 3 1 as a case study we applied the proposed method and framework to the shaying river basin in recent years rapid industrial development and urban domestic pollution have had a serious impact on the river water ecology and environment of the basin leading to the serious deterioration of river water quality and ecology pollutants are mainly concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the basin luo et al 2019 according to our field survey and experiments 2012 2015 the riverbank is severely hardened in many locations throughout the basin due to long term human interference the habitat of aquatic organisms is constantly changing the newly formed river habitat environment has a selective effect on river organisms leading to changes in the community structure of organisms we detected few aquatic species in our experiment and most of them are pollution tolerant the paper is organized as follows the study area and data are given in section 2 followed by the construction of the distributed social economy water ecological model sewe with consideration of the interaction mechanism of socioeconomic water and ecological factors by coupling the rainfall runoff model river water quality model water ecological model and a harmonious regulation model based on the harmony theory method see section 3 in our study we combined the sewe model and the harmonious regulation model to deal with the different spatiotemporal scale of data and to make up for the insufficient consideration of the interaction mechanism between the socioeconomic factors and the river water quality and ecological factors by the harmonious regulation model we formed a new framework for studying the coordinated development of the social economy water and ecology see section 3 1 we then applied the proposed method and framework to the shaying river basin which exhibited typical characteristics of multiple sluices and dams high pollution and significant human activities see section 4 2 study area and data 2 1 study area shaying river fig 1 with a length of 621 20 km and a catchment area of 39075 30 km2 originates in song mount henan province china 111 56 44 116 31 07 e 32 29 24 34 57 15 n luo et al 2018a it flows through more than 40 cities and counties before entering the huai river in mohekou town of yingshang county the basin is densely populated with a population density of 872 72 people per square kilometer in 2015 the utilization ratio of water resources exceeded 90 in 2015 in particular a large number of sluices and reservoirs were built in the middle and upper reaches of the basin luo et al 2018b zhai et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 2 2 data in this study we used socioeconomic data geospatial data meteorological data and hydrological data study we used socioeconomic data from 2000 to 2015 to estimate socioeconomic sewage discharge quota

data cma cn the four weather stations were zhengzhou station xuchang station baofeng station and xihua station fig 1 the data were used mainly as the inputs for the hydrological simulation of the sewe model we conducted an ecological experiment to monitor the river environment in the shaying river basin and collected data accordingly luo et al 2018a we set up seven sampling points zhaopingtai station baiguishan station zhoukou station huaidian station fuyang station and yingshang station from the upstream to downstream of the shaying river basin fig 1 3 methods 3 1 research framework when the socioeconomic subsystem water subsystem in terms of river water quantity and quality and ecological subsystem in terms of river water ecology are in a good condition the swe is considered to be coordinated see section 3 3 2 therefore the level of coordinated development of the swe was first evaluated based on the basin s actual situation see section 3 4 1 followed by regulating the coordinated development of the swe in our study see section 3 4 2 in this process we combined the sewe model see section 3 3 with its remarkable spatial analysis ability and the harmonious regulation model see section 3 4 with its advantage of dealing with the basin s competition issues see the framework in fig 2 first we built an evaluation index system drawing on aspects of the socioeconomic subsystem water subsystem and ecological subsystem see section 3 2 second we built the sewe model to deal with the spatial and temporal mismatch of socioeconomic data and river water quality and ecological data see section 3 3 for spatial scales we counted the number of river segments within each administrative region and then we simulated and recorded the water subsystem and ecological subsystem data using the sewe model at the outlets of these river segments we next calculated water subsystem and ecological subsystem data in each administrative region from the average simulation results of the counted river segments within the corresponding administrative regions for the time scale we converted the simulated river water quality and ecological data from a daily scale to an annual scale by calculating the average of the simulated results of corresponding river water quality and ecological indicators following this we calculated the coordination degree of indicators table 1 subsystems and the swe using the harmony theory method see section 3 4 1 according to the actual condition of the shaying river basin when the coordination degree of each subsystem socioeconomic subsystem water subsystem and ecological subsystem is equal to 0 6 the value depends on the strictness of the definition of coordinated development of subsystems the swe is considered to have reached the generally acceptable level therefore in our research we set 0 6 as the minimum threshold that subsystems must meet if all subsystems met the threshold we then had to judge whether the coordination degree of the swe met the target value of coordinated development in the study area see section 3 4 2 if the target was met no regulation was needed if the target was not met we identified the main factors that were affecting the coordinated development of the swe and then developed regulatory scenarios based on the main influential factors finally we developed appropriate regulation schemes through continuous simulation and iterative optimization 3 2 index system of the swe coordinated development we selected indicators from the aspects of the socioeconomic subsystem water subsystem and ecological subsystem according to the research framework see section 3 1 for the socioeconomic subsystem we selected representative indicators mainly from the aspects of regional economic development and social development the selected indexes included per capita gross domestic product gdp per capita net income of rural residents per capita disposable income of urban residents tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate engel s coefficient number of beds per 10 000 people per capita urban road area and resident satisfaction with the environment table 1 we selected water subsystem indicators based mainly changes in river water quantity and quality under the influence of human social and economic development therefore we selected the annual average flow rate to represent changes in the water quantity in rivers we selected physical and chemical indicators to represent changes in water quality in rivers the final selected indicators included the annual average flow rate q dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand codcr five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and permanganate index codmn table 1 we selected ecological subsystem indicators based on aquatic species diversity and riverbank habitat quality the selected indices included the habitat environmental quality index heqi the shannon weiner diversity index of phytoplankton p swi the shannon weiner diversity index of zooplankton z swi and the shannon weiner diversity index of zoobenthos b swi table 1 3 3 distributed model of social economy water ecology 3 3 1 problems and corresponding solutions in the model building 1 the coupling of natural and social water cycles the social water cycle driven by social development is part of the water cycle and should be considered together with the natural water cycle in the distributed hydrological model it is difficult however to couple the natural and social water cycles because of their complex interaction in particular the spatiotemporal scale of the data between them is mismatched in general social water cycle data have a spatial scale of the administrative region and a temporal scale of a year or month natural water cycle data have a spatial scale of a sub basin and a temporal scale of a day instantaneous values on the day of sampling for river water quality and ecological indicators we coupled water quantity using the processed water withdrawal and drainage of the social water cycle in the model we divided the water withdrawal processes into two parts according to the nature of the water source surface water rivers lakes reservoirs and groundwater shallow groundwater if we knew the location of water withdrawal then we could bring the amount of water into the river routing equation or groundwater motion equation see eqs 5 and 6 respectively if we did not know the location we first estimated the amount of water according to administrative areas and then evenly distributed the amount of water among the sub basins based on the area percentage finally the amount of water distributed to each sub basin dissipated as evaporation we divided the process of drainage inside and outside the river the model considered only two cases 1 the drainage inside the river where the outlet was known and 2 the drainage outside the river where the outlet was not known for the first case we introduced the amount of drainage into the river routing equation see eq 6 for the second case we processed the data similar to the case of water withdrawal when we did not know the location that is we first estimated the amount of water according to administrative areas and then we evenly distributed the water among the sub basins based on the area percentage the difference between the two was the amount of drainage superimposed with the precipitation in the model see eq 2 in the sewe model we did not consider the case of drainage outside the river if we knew the drainage outlet because it was difficult to accurately obtain the amount of drainage and the corresponding locations in the shaying river basin such as the nonpoint pollution in rural and urban areas in other words for almost all kinds of drainages which are discharged outside the river it is difficult to obtain the amount of drainage and the corresponding locations certainly if we knew the amount of drainage and the corresponding location the amount of drainage could be superimposed on the precipitation of the corresponding sub basin we used a sub basin and administrative region overlay approach in the model to deal with the inconsistencies in the spatial scale of the social water cycle data and natural water cycle data first we calculated the area of sub basins in each administrative region and then assigned the water quantity of each administrative region to these sub basins according to their area percentage since we assumed the processes of water withdrawal and drainage to have a stable time variation during the year they were evenly distributed across the daily scale in the model 2 the coupling of rainfall runoff model river water quality model and water ecological model the interactions among water quantity water quality and water ecological indicators are complicated in areas with significant human activities it is difficult to quantify their relationship especially the water ecological indicators using a mathematical or physical model therefore we employed the nonlinear relationships between water ecological indicators water quantity indicators and water quality indicators to simulate the change in the river water ecological indicators see eqs 10 12 as for water quality indicators we used the outputs of the rainfall runoff model flow rate based on the coupling of natural social water cycle factors as the inputs for the river one dimensional water quality model see eqs 8 and 9 3 3 2 main modules of the sewe model we set five submodules the water circulation module socioeconomic module water quality module water ecology module and human intervention module in the sewe model fig 3 we built the model by combing the water circulation module rainfall runoff model water quality module and water ecological module under the influence of the socioeconomic module and the human intervention module the model considered the influence of water withdrawal water use water consumption drainage and sewage processes of the social water cycle on rainfall runoff processes of the natural water cycle fig 4 first we prepared the data of water withdrawal water use water consumption drainage and sewage of the social water cycle as the input to the sewe model second we simulated the runoff change process driven by the natural social water cycle based on the combination of the social water cycle processes of water withdrawal water use water consumption and drainage and the natural water cycle processes of rainfall and runoff see section 3 3 1 third we simulated the changing processes of water quality indicators in rivers using the flow rate output of the water circulation module as the input for the river one dimensional water quality model see section 3 3 1 finally we employed the nonlinear relationships among water ecological indicators water quantity indicators and water quality indicators established by liu 2016 in the shaying river basin using correlation analysis cluster analysis and impact contribution analysis we simulated changes in river water ecological indicators see eqs 10 12 we used the socioeconomic module which is the driver module of the sewe model to determine the water conversion relationship in the social water cycle water withdrawal water use water consumption drainage and sewage to provide the data inputs for the simulation of water quantity quality and ecological indicators the water circulation module provided the basis for the water quality module and water ecological module we used the module to simulate changes in runoff the simulation processes included rainfall runoff simulation soil water simulation shallow groundwater simulation and river flow rate routing simulation in particular the module considered the coupling of natural water cycle processes and social water cycle processes see section 3 3 1 we used some methods in the soil and water assessment tool swat model neitsch et al 2011 in our model s rainfall runoff simulation the water balance equation is as follows 1 δ v i p prec i r surf i e evap i w seep i q base i where δ v i is the

influence of sluices and water transfer between sub basins of the basin on the simulation of hydrology river water quality and ecology was considered neitsch et al 2011 3 4 harmonious regulation model 3 4 1 harmony theory method the harmony degree equation is a quantitative evaluation method used to study the human water relationship see zuo et al 2015a 2016 for details it has been widely used in water quality evaluation socioeconomic development evaluation and cross border river diversion cui et al 2014 meng et al 2016 song et al 2016 wang et al 2015 the core of the method calculates a comprehensive index that can reflect the level of harmonious development in regions by establishing a system evaluation criteria and evaluation methods we employed this method to study the coordinated development of the swe by coupling it with the sewe model we calculated the coordination degree of a single indicator as follows 13 s i i 0 x i a i 0 3 x i a i b i a i a i x i b i 0 3 0 3 x i b i c i

e i are node values of index i namely the worst value the worse value the normal value the better value and the optimal value among these indicators for water quality indicators we determined threshold values based on the surface water environmental quality standard state environmental protection administration of china and general administration of quality supervision and inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china 2002 for the socioeconomic indicators and water ecological indicators we determined the optimal value based on the national optimal level with a suitable increase in percentage and determined the normal value based on the multiyear average of the indicator in the study area we determined the worst value one of the node values defined above using the worst value of the indicator over many years in the study area we determined the worse value and the better value based on a combination of the interpolation method and the nature of the indicator luo et al 2018a the coordination degree of the swe can be calculated as follows 14 swehd t α s e h d t β w h d t γ e h d t α i 1 n 1 ω i s i i β j 1 n 2 ω j s i j γ k 1 n 3 ω k s i k where swehd is the coordination degree of the swe sehd is the coordination degree of the socioeconomic subsystem whd is the coordination degree of the water subsystem ehd is the coordination degree of the ecological subsystem and α β γ are the weights of corresponding subsystem indicators in this study socioeconomic subsystem water subsystem and ecological subsystem were considered to be of similar importance so we gave them equal value 1 3 each the coordination degree of the i th indicator of the socioeconomic subsystem is sii the coordination degree of the j th indicator of the water subsystem is sij and the coordination degree of the k th indicator of the ecological subsystem is sik to express the coordinated development level of the swe in regions intuitively we created seven levels completely uncoordinated highly uncoordinated generally uncoordinated relatively uncoordinated generally coordinated highly coordinated and completely coordinated based on the swehd with a step of 0 2 table 2 3 4 2 harmony regulation model the coordination of the swe constantly shifted from one state to another over time based on the harmonious balance theory described by zuo et al 2015b they defined the balance of harmony as a state that is relatively static and acceptable to stakeholders by considering their own interests and the overall harmonious goals the general form of the harmony regulation model is as follows 15 z h d x h d 0 subject to g x 0 and x 0 where x is the decision vector h d x is the harmony degree of the research object h d 0 is the minimum harmony degree that is considered

actual condition of the shaying river basin we employed this model to research the coordinated development of the swe the constraints considered in our model included the minimum coordination degree

employed the nash suttcliffe efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of determination r2 and relative error re as performance indicators to evaluate the accuracy of the sewe model we selected fuyang station which is located at the outlet of the shaying river basin as an example see fig 1 for hydrological simulation we used the nse and r2 as performance indicators the simulation period was from 2000 to 2013 we selected 2000 2009 as the calibration period and 2010 2013 as the verification period fig 5 through sensitivity analysis we considered the runoff curve number soil evaporation compensation coefficient and shallow groundwater runoff coefficient to be sensitive parameters after constant adjustment we obtained r2 0 78 and nse 0 73 for the calibration period and r2 0 74 and nse 0 70 for the validation period fig 5 which indicated that the results of hydrological simulation were satisfactory taking do codcr bod5 tp nh4 n and codmn as representative indicators we employed re to assess the simulation results of the water quality model after constantly adjusting the degradation coefficient we obtained re do 19 63 re codcr 21 73 re bod5 23 88 re tp 24 51 re nh4 n 24 77 re codmn 20 92 the simulation accuracy of some water quality indicators was not very high with an re value greater than 20 in general if re was less than or equal to 20 we considered that the simulation result was satisfactory fig 6 the inaccurate simulation may have been caused by the uncertainty of the input data and the impact of sluices on river water quality in addition to the point source pollution data that can be collected rural non point source pollution has a great impact on river water quality especially in areas with low urbanization rates the urbanization rate of the shaying river basin was not very high with a value of 44 37 in 2015 we estimated the amount of pollutants caused by rural households based on the number of rural people and livestock they raised and then estimated the amount of pollutants entering the river based on the coefficients of these pollutants entering the river the uncertainty in the assessment process had an impact on the accuracy of the model in addition the impact of sluices on river pollution is complicated for example the interaction of overlying water suspended solids and sediment pollutants caused by sluice scheduling may be accompanied by a series of physical chemical and biological processes the current research does not provide an advanced theoretical basis in our model we simulated the changing process of water quality indicators in the river sections in cases in which sluices are built on the basis of historical data establishing the relationship between the concentration of water quality indicators in upper and lower sections of sluices note that if more accurate input data are available in other basins and the influence of the sluice on river water quality is studied in depth simulation accuracy can be improved fortunately the current simulation accuracy can support the coordinated development research of the swe in this study similar to water quality indicators we employed the re to assess the simulation accuracy of water ecological indicators we selected the p swi and the z swi as representative indicators see fig 7 after calculation we obtained re p swi 19 29 and re z swi 21 75 note that we considered only the diversity index of phytoplankton zooplankton and zoobenthos as ecological indicators given that the actual condition of the shaying river basin has strong human activity and serious water pollution for details see luo et al 2018a the simulation accuracy of the model was not very high the interaction between aquatic organisms and their surrounding environment such as hydrodynamics water quantity water quality and morphology is complicated the current research does not fully reveal their interaction mechanisms including the enrichment of pollutants in aquatic organisms and the effects of water quality and hydrodynamic factors on spawning and the survival habits of aquatic organisms our research is limited to the use of the nonlinear relationship between biological indicators and surrounding environmental factors better evaluation results might be found if more in depth research can be conducted and more ecological indicators are considered 4 2 assessment of the coordinated development of the swe in shaying river basin 4 2 1 coordination degree calculation table 3 shows the calculation results of the coordination degree of the swe in different regions of the shaying river basin from 2000 to 2015 table 3 shows that the coordination degree in the shaying river basin varies between 0 3 and 0 7 indicating that the level of the coordinated development of the swe in the shaying river basin was poor the average coordination degrees in each region from 2000 to 2015 were as follows swehd zhengzhou city 0 51 swehd kaifeng city 0 47 swehd luoyang city 0 60 swehd pingdingshan city 0 58 swehd xuchang city 0 53 swehd luohe city 0 58 swehd nanyang city 0 56 swehd zhoukou city 0 45 swehd zhumadian city 0 39 and swehd fuyang city 0 50 these results revealed that differences in the coordinated development of the swe in regions of the shaying river basin are not obvious 4 2 2 time variation of the coordination degree the calculation results of the swehd sehd whd and ehd in the shaying river basin are plotted in fig 8 the figure shows that the coordination degree of the swe swehd changed between 0 4 and 0 6 from 2000 to 2015 and had a slowly increasing trend which indicated that the coordination of the swe in the shaying river basin was improving from a subsystems perspective the values of the sehd whd and ehd in the basin were small among these values the whd which varied between 0 5 and 0 7 was the largest followed by the sehd which varied between 0 3 and 0 7 the value of the ehd which varied between 0 3 and 0 5 was the smallest the small value of the sehd indicated that the level of the social and economic development in the basin was low the same was true for the whd and ehd which indicated the poor water environmental and ecological status from the perspective of time variation gaps between the sehd whd and ehd in the basin showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2015 which indicated an increasing impact of socioeconomic development on the basin s water ecology and environment from the perspective of administrative regions the value of the sehd was greater than that of the whd and ehd in zhengzhou city kaifeng city zhoukou city zhumadian city and fuyang city this greater shed value revealed the high socioeconomic development levels and poor river water environmental and ecological conditions in these regions coordinated development strategies should be adopted in these regions to ease the contradiction between socioeconomic development and water ecological and environmental protection values of the sehd whd and ehd in the remaining regions luoyang city xuchang city pingdingshan city luohe city and nanyang city showed that the whd value was greater than the sehd and that the sehd value was greater than the ehd these findings revealed the significant socioeconomic development potential in these regions under the condition of ecological and environmental protection 4 2 3 spatial variation of the coordination degree to analyze the spatial variation of the coordinated development among social economy water and ecology in the shaying river basin we selected four representative years 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 the spatial distributions of the sehd whd ehd and swehd are plotted in figs 9 12 respectively we used the sehd to reflect the level of regional socioeconomic development the greater the value the higher the level of socioeconomic development fig 9 shows that the sehd was small in all regions of the shaying river basin in 2000 and that it did not exceed the threshold level of 0 6 which indicated the low development level of the social economy in the shaying river basin the value of the sehd in zhengzhou city 0 41 however was the highest compared with other cities of the basin the value of the sehd improved from 2000 to 2005 the sehd in all regions of the basin was less than 0 6 however except for zhengzhou city with a value of 0 63 in 2010 the value of sehd was further improved zhengzhou city and luoyang city improved to the level of generally coordinated development and the remaining regions were improved to the level of relatively uncoordinated development compared with 2010 the social economy greatly improved in 2015 the sehd was spatially distributed in the western part of the basin which achieved a level of generally coordinated development and was greater than that of the eastern part of the basin which achieved a level of relatively uncoordinated development we calculated the whd to show the contribution of river water quantity and quality of the basin to the coordinated development of the swe the greater the value the more conducive it was to the coordinated development of the swe fig 10 shows that the value of the whd in luoyang city pingdingshan city luohe city and nanyang city ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 was good xuchang city and fuyang city followed with a value of the whd ranging from 0 6 to 0 8 the situation was classified as being the worst in zhengzhou city kaifeng city zhoukou city and zhumadian city in 2000 the main pollution areas were concentrated in zhengzhou city kaifeng city zhoukou city zhumadian city and fuyang city in addition the value of the whd in luohe city pingdingshan city and nanyang city which are located in the upper reaches of the shaying river basin was the highest with a level of very coordinated development the value of whd in xuchang city and luohe city which are located in the middle reaches of the basin was poor with a level of generally coordinated development compared with 2000 the value of whd in 2005 improved the level of the whd in zhoukou city and fuyang city improved from relatively uncoordinated to generally coordinated development in 2010 in addition to cities in the upper reaches of the basin i e luoyang city pingdingshan city and nanyang city water quality also deteriorated in the middle and lower reaches of the basin i e zhoukou city kaifeng city zhumadian city and fuyang city in 2015 because of government s governance water quality improved in the basin except for zhoukou city kaifeng city and zhumadian city with levels of relatively uncoordinated or generally uncoordinated development the calculation results of the ehd are plotted in fig 11 the greater the ehd the better the ecological condition the figure shows that the ehd in the basin was poor and almost no regions in the four representative years reached the threshold level of 0 6 from 2000 to 2005 the average rate of change of the ehd in the basin was 0 07 which indicated a gradually deteriorating trend of ecological conditions especially in regions of luoyang city pingdingshan city nanyang city xuchang city kaifeng city and zhumadian city from 2005 to 2010 the average rate of change of the ehd in the basin was 0 06 which indicated that ecological conditions in the basin had further deteriorated the ecological status of the basin further deteriorated from 2010 to 2015 with an average rate of change of 0 09 in summary the overall ecological condition in the shaying river basin was poor with the spatial distribution in the middle and lower reaches of the basin being slightly greater than that in the upper reaches of the basin the swehd is the integration of the sehd whd and ehd it can be used to comprehensively reflect the coordinated development level of the swe in the shaying river basin the greater the value the higher the coordinated development of the swe fig 12 shows that the value of swehd in the shaying river basin ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 was low in 2000 no region of the basin however reached the threshold level of 0 6 in 2005 the value of the swehd in the regions of zhengzhou city kaifeng city and fuyang city improved compared with 2000 this is especially true for fuyang city which reached a level of generally coordinated development in 2010 the spatial distribution of swehd became more uneven the swehd in regions of the basin except for luoyang city which had a level of generally coordinated development varied from 0 4 to 0 6 that is relatively uncoordinated development in 2015 the swehd in the basin improved significantly the spatial distribution in the upper reaches of the basin the value of the swehd ranged from 0 6 to 0 8 was greater than that in the middle and lower reaches the value of the swehd ranged from 0 4 to 0 6 4 3 regulation of the swe coordinated development in the shaying river basin 4 3 1 regulation indicators and their adjustability according to the assessment results of the swe although river water environmental and ecological conditions in the shaying river basin are poor they have great potential for improvement therefore on the basis of 2015 data we set the regulation goal of the swehd in the basin to increase by 25 that is the value of the swehd needs to improve from 0 57 to 0 71 as shown in table 3 the swehd values in all regions of the basin do not meet the target level of 0 71 the main factors that affect the swehd in each region need to be identified and then regulations should be implemented based on scenario simulation fig 13 shows the coordination degree for indicators of the shaying river basin in 2015 we set the target value of 0 71 to select the main influencing indicators if the coordination degree of an indicator was below the value of 0 71 we considered it to be an influencing factor it can be seen from fig 13 that the main indicators in zhengzhou city include annual average flow rate heqi p swi z swi and b swi kaifeng city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people annual average flow rate codcr tp nh4 n heqi p swi z swi and b swi luoyang city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp urbanization rate annual average flow rate heqi p swi z swi and b swi pingdingshan city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people heqi z swi and b swi xuchang city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people heqi z swi and b swi luohe city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people heqi p swi z swi and b swi nanyang city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people heqi p swi z swi and b swi zhoukou city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people tp nh4 n codmn annual average flow rate heqi z swi and b swi zhumadian city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people codcr nh4 n annual average flow rate heqi p swi z swi and b swi and fuyang city indicators include per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp population density urbanization rate number of beds per 10 000 people annual average flow rate heqi p swi and b swi since indicators of per capita gdp tertiary industry shares of gdp and number of beds per 10 000 people can be improved through measures such as increasing economic development adjusting the proportion of industrial structure and increasing the investment of medical devices they are considered to be indicators of adjustability urbanization rate and population density can only be controlled rather than artificially increased or decreased in the short term by considering the nature of these indicators and the actual condition of the basin pollution water quality indicators such as codcr codmn nh4 n and tp are mainly associated with industrial agricultural and urban rural domestic sewage discharge in the sewe model they were treated as the boundary inputs after the estimation of the amount of the pollutions from industry agriculture and urban rural households that is the adjustable water quality factors originate from the sewage discharge of industry agriculture and urban and rural households therefore we focused on indicators that refer to water use water treatment and water discharge the heqi which is scored based on on site surveys can be improved through ecological management of rivers and lakes and is considered to be an indicator that can be regulated as the ecological indicators such as p swi z swi and b swi cannot be improved through direct regulation and control measures in the short term because of their complex relationship with river water quality and water ecology factors they are indirectly regulated based on the nonlinear relationship of water quantity water quality and water ecological indicators in summary the selected regulatory indicators in the shaying river basin include per capita gdp rf1 tertiary industry share of gdp rf2 number of beds per 10 000 people rf3 per capita daily water use rf4 per 0 067 ha of farmland irrigation water use rf5 10 000 renminbi industrial added value water use rf6 heqi rf7 and concentrations of codcr rf8 codmn rf9 nh4 n rf10 and tp rf11 in regional industrial agricultural and urban rural domestic drainage 4 3 2 scenario design and scheme optimization to improve regulation efficiency we divided regulation indicators into three categories based on their nature and developed regulation scenarios based on a 10 growth or reduction rate of regulation indicators table 4 after iterative optimization we selected scenarios that met the target value of 0 71 to build a collection of recommended schemes each regulation indicator should be aligned with the corresponding constraints based on their nature and the actual condition of the basin for example the growth rate of per capita gdp should be limited to a suitable range based on the actual condition of the basin similarly the per capita domestic water use should be limited to a suitable range of reduction after comparison and optimization in which case per capita gdp and number of beds per 10 000 people increased by 50 heqi increased by 40 per capita daily water use decreased by 10 and the concentrations of codcr codmn nh4 n and tp in industrial agricultural and urban rural domestic drainage of the basin decreased by 30 the coordination degree of the swe in the shaying river basin met the target value of 0 71 the regulation scheme of the scenario is shown in table 5 5 conclusion due to the increasing complexity of the human water relationship it is necessary to research the coordinated development among social economy water and ecology by considering the interaction of their indicators in this study we proposed a framework for studying the coordinated development of the swe by building a distributed social economy water ecology model and a harmonious regulation model we applied the proposed framework and methods to the shaying river basin which exhibited the typical characteristics of multiple sluices and dams high levels of pollution and significant human activities the results indicated the following 1 the simulation results of the sewe model were satisfactory we employed nse and r2 to assess the accuracy of the hydrological simulation results of the model by comparison with the measured data the model had r2 0 78 and nse 0 73 in the calibration period and had r2 0 74 and nse 0 70 in the verification period we employed relative error re to assess the accuracy of the results of water quality and ecological indicators by comparing the measured data we obtained re do 19 63 re codcr 21 73 re bod5 23 88 re tp 24 51 re nh4 n 24 77 and re codmn 20 92 for water quality indicators and re p swi 19 29 and re z swi 21 75 for water ecological indicators the results of the model were acceptable 2 the coordinated development level of the swe in the shaying river basin which had an average coordination degree ranging from 0 39 to 0 60 was low in detail the coordination degree of river water quantity and quality ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 was the highest followed by the coordination degree of the social economy ranging from 0 3 to 0 7 the coordination degree of water ecology ranging from 0 3 to 0 5 was the smallest notably the ecological and environmental problems caused by socioeconomic development in the shaying river basin were serious 3 the main factors affecting the coordinated development of the swe in the shaying river basin were per capita gdp tertiary industry share of gdp number of beds per 10 000 people per capita daily water use per 0 067 ha of farmland irrigation water use 10 000 renminbi industrial added value water use heqi and concentrations of codcr codmn nh4 n and tp caused by regional industrial agricultural and urban rural domestic sewage discharge conflict of

6434,agriculture accounts for 90 of global freshwater consumption and it is expected to intensify in the future climate and land use changes are two major factors affecting crop green and blue water consumption and in this study we explicitly consider the effects of both factors in a consistent modeling framework two important research questions are addressed 1 how will global crop green and blue water consumption evolve over the 21st century under climate and land use changes and 2 what are the individual and combined effects of climate and land use changes on future crop green and blue water consumption to tackle these two questions a crop water use module is developed based on the global change assessment model gcam and its hydrology module i e xanthos crop specific green and blue water consumption are then calculated at global 0 5 0 5 grid scale results show that global crop green water consumption increases by 12 in 2090s when compared with that in 1971 2000 and climate change dominates over land use change in determining the trend of global crop green water consumption however expansion in global irrigated area dominates the changing trend of global crop blue water consumption which increases 70 by 2090s especially in regions with significant irrigated land expansion e g northern africa central asia china mexico the middle east russia southern asia and argentina furthermore global crop blue water dependence will increase under climate and land use changes especially in arid regions keywords integrated assessment model crop green water consumption crop blue water consumption climate change land use change 1 introduction anthropogenic activities have altered the global water cycle significantly both directly e g human water consumption for agricultural industrial and domestic purposes and indirectly e g converting natural vegetation into cropland boucher et al 2004 bondeau et al 2007 tang et al 2007 rost et al 2008 rodell et al 2009 wada et al 2010 haddeland et al 2014 leng et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2015 agricultural irrigation which is the largest human water consumer accounts for about 70 of global human freshwater withdrawal and about 90 of global human freshwater consumption rost et al 2008 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 wada and bierkens 2014 huang et al 2018 and has contributed to increasing evapotranspiration and decreasing river discharges rost et al 2008 müller schmied et al 2014 given the rapid growth of global population and increasing food demand over the past several decades crop green and blue water consumption have increased with the expansion of cropland especially irrigated land klein goldewijk and ramankutty 2004 siebert et al 2015 here crop green water consumption is known as the evapotranspiration from soil moisture replenished by precipitation in cropland while crop blue water consumption is the evapotranspiration from irrigation i e water abstracted from rivers lakes and aquifers savenije 2000 falkenmark and rockström 2006 rockström et al 2009a previous studies have reported that the annual mean global crop green water consumption about 5000 km3 year is about three times of global crop blue water consumption which is about 1000 1700 km3 year shiklomanov 2000 rost et al 2008 hanasaki et al 2010 liu and yang 2010 chaturvedi et al 2015 the increase of human water consumption is expected to intensify global water scarcity which is a significant issue in a number of countries oki and kanae 2006 vörösmarty et al 2010 hayashi et al 2013 hejazi et al 2014 wada et al 2016 thus assessing future global agricultural green and blue water consumption and their implications on the sustainable use of freshwater and related food security issue are critical especially in arid and semi arid regions e g north china central asia the middle east and northern africa agricultural green and blue water consumption at global scale have attracted considerable attention and various approaches have shed new light upon the estimates of the present and future state of global agricultural water consumption during the past two decades shiklomanov 2000 döll and siebert 2002 alcamo et al 2003 hanasaki

and rodda 2004 were based on diverse irrigation water use statistics crop productivities and yields average evapotranspiration rates and vegetation distribution maps later many global hydrological models ghms have incorporated crop water use modules to assess crop green and blue water consumption döll and siebert 2002 tang et al 2007 hanasaki et al 2008b rost et al 2008 wisser et al 2008 siebert and döll 2010 wada et al 2011 pokhrel et al 2012 jaegermeyr et al 2015 however most studies have focused on historical reconstruction of crop blue water consumption and only a few simulations have addressed the effects of future global change e g climate and land use changes on both green and blue crop water consumption for example some studies have reported that future climate conditions will lead to an increase in global crop blue water consumption wada et al 2013b schewe et al 2014 elliott et al 2014 but didn t explore the effects of changes in cropland area induced by future socioeconomic development especially future irrigated land which is expected to expand to meet future crop demands for food feed and fuel hanasaki et al 2013 considered the effects of irrigated area expansion on crop blue water consumption but the future cropland projections were assumed exogenously based on expert judgement similar to that in shen et al 2008 and sulser et al 2010 thus projections of crop green and blue water consumption under an internally consistent set of future climate and land use conditions are still lacking in spite of their great significance furthermore the individual and combined effects of future climate and land use changes on crop green and blue water consumption which are of great significance to guide the sustainable use of freshwater are still unknown this study utilizes the global change assessment model gcam which simulates the complex interactions among economy energy land use water and climate systems in a consistent economic framework to assess how future crop specific cropland irrigated and rainfed will change through incorporating a crop water use module into the hydrological model in gcam namely xanthos li et al 2017 2018 crop specific green and blue water consumption under future climate and land use conditions are estimated globally this allows the trajectories of the land use change and climate change to be consistent under the same socioeconomics and emissions pathway which is a critical improvement to previous estimates of future crop water consumption which usually considered the single effects climate or land use or ignore their inherent consistency with concurrent socioeconomics and emissions pathway in this study we focus on two important scientific questions 1 how global crop green and blue water consumption will evolve over the 21st century under future climate and land use conditions 2 what are the individual and combined effects of climate and land use changes on future crop green and blue water consumption the remainder of this paper is organized as follows description of the data and modeling framework are represented in data and methods section findings about future global crop green and blue water consumption and uncertainties in our estimates are represented in the results section a comparison of estimation in this study with previous studies and broader implications of the results are discussed in the discussion section followed by conclusions 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets monthly meteorological data on a global 0 5 0 5 grid are obtained from the integrated project water and global change watch for the period 1951 2001 including precipitation surface mean air temperature maximum air temperature minimum air temperature relative humidity surface wind speed long wave downwelling radiation and short wave downwelling radiation weedon et al 2011 the watch climate data which is based on the reanalysis data set era 40 and bias corrected is served as historical climate input in this study for future simulations monthly climate datasets during the period 1951 2099 obtained from the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project isi mip https www isimip org were generated by five general circulation models gcms namely miroc esm chem nores1 m ipsl cm5a lr gfdl esm2m and hadgem2 es due to the biases between gcm outputs and observations piani et al 2010 climate datasets from these five gcms were all bias corrected using the watch climate data for the overlapping reference climate hempel et al 2013 the mirca2000 dataset which was generated based on multi census national and subnational statistics e g harvested crop area and cropping season provides the monthly crop harvested area and crop growing season for all the major rainfed and irrigated crops for the year around 2000 portmann et al 2010 in this study cropping period lists cpl from the mirca2000 dataset which provides the monthly growing area start and end month of cropping period for 26 irrigated and rainfed crops at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 for the years around 2000 are used we reclassified the 26 crops from the mirca2000 into 12 crops categories defined by the gcam model details in supplementary thus monthly growing area and the growing pattern of all 12 irrigated and rainfed crops for the years around 2000 at 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution are established 2 2 modeling framework the modeling framework consists of several models that are necessary to simulate future land use and land cover change lulcc and how both lulcc and future climate affect crop blue and green water consumption globally over the 21st century fig 1 more specifically gcam and two of its ancillary modeling tools demeter and xanthos are used gcam is used to simulate how land use may change over time given that gcam is an integrated human earth system model where land use decisions are made at regional scale e g water basin scale demeter a disaggregation tool is then used to map crop information from regional to grid scale cropland information is then incorporated into xanthos a global hydrologic model to simulate crop blue and green water consumption under future climate and land use conditions the following describes each of the three modeling tools in more details 2 2 1 gcam gcam is an open source community model with representation of relationships among economy energy land use climate and water systems clarke and edmonds 1993 edmonds et al 1997 kim et al 2006 gcam is often used to simulate different radiative forcing representative concentration pathways rcps and socioeconomic scenarios shared socioeconomic pathways ssps using a consistent accounting framework calvin et al 2014 2018 gcam is forced by present and future populations labor productivities resource availabilities and energy and agriculture technologies regional population and labor productivities assumptions drive the energy and land use system to produce transfer and provide energy services as well as to produce agriculture and forest products further to determine land use and land cover in this study the cropland areas for 12 crops both irrigated and rainfed are generated by gcam at the water basin level i e 235 basins globally liu et al 2018 from 2005 to 2100 under the ssp2 and rcp6 0 scenario see section 2 3 the 12 gcam crop categories are corn fiber crop fodder grass fodder herb miscellaneous crop misccrop oil crop other grain palm fruit rice root tuber sugar crop and wheat 2 2 2 demeter demeter is an open source community lulcc downscaling model which is designed to generate high resolution gridded time series representation of lulcc projections from country or region level to grid level west et al 2014 le page et al 2016 vernon et al 2018 the downscaling algorithm is supported by a number of user defined settings including the treatment order i e which lulcc type should be downscaled first and transition priorities i e which type of land swaps are favored e g irrigated rice expansion preferentially into rainfed rice rather than grassland demeter uses an intensification and extensification process applied to each lulcc type and downscales lulcc projections from region or zone to the resolution of the base layer i e observed spatial lulcc data e g mirca2000 notably lulcc types from both projected and observed data are harmonized in this study lulcc projections are simulated by gcam at basin level from 2005 to 2100 including changes in cropland area for 12 crops both irrigated and rainfed to assess the uncertainty associated with the parameters in demeter five alternative downscaling allocations i e treatment order and transition priorities are defined and 5 gridded lulcc datasets are generated therefore future gridded monthly growing area of 12 crops both irrigated and rainfed are established based on the gridded downscaled future results from demeter and historical monthly crop growing area in mirca2000 more details shown in supplementary 2 2 3 xanthos a crop water use module which estimates crop specific green and blue water consumption is built upon the hydrologic module in gcam i e xanthos li et al 2017 liu et al 2018 in this study the crop water consumption is simulated using the crop coefficient method for each 0 5 0 5 grid at a monthly time step allen et al 1998 monthly crop evapotranspiration etc mm month 1 which mainly depends on crop development stage and crop types is estimated as 1 e t c k c e t 0 where kc is the crop coefficient defined according to allen et al 1998 and siebert and döll 2010 and

crop blue and green water consumption we estimate the blue water index bwi which is defined as the ratio of crop blue water consumption to total water consumption to represent the dependence of crop production on blue water johansson et al 2016 a bwi value of 1 indicates that all crop water consumption comes from blue water i e irrigation and a bwi value of 0 means that precipitation is sufficient for maximum crop yield or no irrigation is implemented the bwi helps to identify hotspots where crop demands more water from irrigation than soil moisture as a result of high consumption of agricultural blue water where socioeconomic and environmental systems may face increasing conflicts over water resources johansson et al 2016 2 3 rcp6 0 ssp2 scenario this study targets rcp 6 0 and ssp2 scenarios which is a suitable combination of the scenario matrix architecture and describes a middle of the road development in climate change mitigation and adaption o neill et al 2014 van vuuren et al 2014 fricko et al 2017 this combination depicts a moderate evolution of climate change and socioeconomics in the future avoiding extreme pathways that are less likely to happen with the ongoing international efforts dedicated to mitigating climate change and seeking sustainable development goals sdgs un 2015 the projected global population under the middle of road scenario i e ssp2 grows to around 9 17 billion in the 2050s peaks around 9 4 billion in the 2070s and then declines to about 9 billion by the end of this century samir and wolfgang 2017 based on gcam simulation under the ssp2 scenario global total cropland area increases by 1 4 from 10 69 million km2 in 2000 to 10 84 million km2 in 2100 with most of the increase 5 7 occurring by 2070 and a subsequent slight decrease of 3 2 between 2070 and 2100 figs s1 2 generally global irrigated and rainfed cropland areas increase 11 4 and 4 2 by 2070 respectively therein expansion of rainfed cropland area is mainly for corn 14 4 fodder herb 62 9 and root tuber 87 9 and expansion of irrigated cropland is mainly for corn 40 0 fodder herb 83 2 and rice 17 4 which dominate the changing trend of total global rainfed and irrigated cropland area fig 2 detail description of changing patterns of future cropland are represented in supplementary figs s3 5 rcp 6 0 is a stabilization without overshoot scenario in which total radiative forcing level reaches a value of 6 w m2 at stabilization after 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 rcp6 0 depicts a global warming of about 4 c by 2100 with the most rapid increase in temperature in the northern high latitudes areas fig s6 global mean precipitation increases by about 5 7 and precipitation increases significantly in the northern high latitudes areas and decreases in the semi arid areas such as southern africa southeastern south america and areas near the mediterranean sea fig s6 2 4 experimental design four experiments are conducted in this study to assess the effects of climate and land use changes on crop blue and green water consumption both individually and in tandem table 1 the first experiment which is forced by the watch data for the period 1971 2001 with a 20 year spin up 1951 1970 is used as a benchmark and also for comparison to previous studies cropland area from mirca 2000 is used and kept static during the historical period the second experiment which is forced by climate inputs from 5 gcms under rcp6 0 during the period of 1971 2099 is designed to simulate the combined effects of future climate and land use changes on crop water consumption therein land use inputs use the mirca2000 data for the period 1971 2010 and land use projections from gcam for the period 2011 2099 experiment 3 and 4 are control experiments which are designed to reflect the individual effects of climate and land use changes on crop water consumption respectively different from experiment 2 cropland input in experiment 3 is kept consistent i e mirca2000 during 1971 2099 while climate input in experiment 4 during 2011 2099 is based on the monthly average value of each of the gcms but with transient land use data for the future period i e gcam and demeter estimates and is the same as that in experiment 2 experiments 2 and 4 include 25 model runs each 5 gcms 5 land use inputs while experiment 3 includes 5 model runs 5 gcms 1 historical land use input the results focus on the ensemble mean of the multiple simulations in each experiment and the uncertainty arising from various climate inputs i e gcms and land use inputs are also discussed 2 5 uncertainty analysis in this study the coefficient of variation cv defined as the standard deviation divided by the ensemble mean value of 25 runs in experiment 2 i e 5 gcms and 5 lulcc downscaling allocations in demeter is used to evaluate the uncertainty from future climate and land use projections to separate the fractional uncertainty in simulated crop water consumption arising from climate and land use inputs we use the method of hawkins and sutton 2009 and wada et al 2013b who calculated the fractional variance of each uncertainty source by assuming that each source is independent the uncertainties in simulated crop green and blue water consumption are separated into two sources climate inputs i e gcms and land use inputs i e lulcc allocations in demeter and the total variance vt of crop green and blue water consumption is the sum of the variance from climate inputs vc and land use inputs vl 9 v t v c v l here we use the simulation of gridded crop green and blue water consumption by experiment 2 25 runs 5gcms 5 land use inputs to calculate the fractional variance by climate and land use inputs for vc we first calculate the variance at grid level for annual average crop green or blue water during 2071 2099 across the 5 gcms for a given land use input i e 5 runs 5gcms 1 land use inputs and by repeating this for each land use input and the average variance of them is vc similar processes are also adopted for calculation of vl then the fractional variance of each uncertainty source can be distinguished 3 results 3 1 changes in future crop water consumption global crop green water consumption increases about 8 5 by 2099 relative to that of 1971 2000 due to future climate condition on the other hand under future land use conditions global total cropland area continues to increase by 2070 and then slightly decreases between 2070 and 2100 resulting in a moderate increase 6 0 of global crop green water consumption by 2070s and a mild decrease 0 8 during 2071 2099 fig 3 a generally global crop green water consumption is projected to increase by 11 3 from 4886 km3 year in the historical period 1971 2000 to 5400 km3 year by 2070s under both climate and land use change effects and continues to increase to 5460 km3 year by 2090s despite the decline of cropland area indicating that the effects of climate change on global crop green water consumption is larger than that of land use change in addition global crop blue water consumption is projected to increase by 14 1 46 6 and 70 3 by the end of this century under the three simulation scenarios i e climate change effects only land use change effects only and both climate and land use changes effects respectively fig 3b under climate change effects only scenario global crop blue water consumption continues to increase slightly in the 21st century however global crop blue water consumption simulated under the combined climate and land use effects scenario shows a similar changing pattern with that under land use change effects only with the peak occurring in 2070s and a slight decline during 2010 2099 indicating that changes in global irrigated cropland dominate the trend of global crop blue water consumption than climate change effects in fact even though global total irrigated area increases only 11 4 by 2070 most of the increases occur in arid and semi arid areas e g central asia north china and western us where crop blue water consumption per unit of irrigated area is higher than some more humid areas with a decline in irrigated cropland e g southern china japan central us and some europe areas therefore changes in global irrigated area lead to large increase in global total crop blue water consumption and dominate its changing trend over climate change due to pronounced warming conditions and associated precipitation change fig s6 crop green water consumption during 2071 2099 increases by about 15 when compared with that in 1971 2000 fig s7 with the most pronounced changes in the us european countries sub sahara regions and eastern china climate change also enhances crop blue water consumption globally especially in the eastern us by 30 northern brazil about 25 some european countries by 40 and southern china by 25 fig 4 a b when only considering the effects of changes in cropland area changes in crop green and blue water consumption shows similar changing pattern with changes in total cropland area and irrigated area respectively fig 4c d and fig s5 for example in some developed countries e g japan south korea uk sweden and finland population growth rates are very low and crop green water consumption decreases as cropland area shrinks but in some developing countries e g pakistan mexico vietnamese laos and countries in central asia crop green water consumption continues to increase as cropland expands to meet the growing demand of crop production due to population and economic growth irrigated cropland area also shows increasing trend e g corn in north china rice in vietnam laos and pakistan fig s4 which leads to large increase in crop blue water consumption when considering the combined effects of climate and land use changes fig 4e f crop green water consumption increases more than that only under climate change in many regions e g middle asia central china western us and eastern russia due to expansion of cropland area furthermore land use change aggravates global crop blue water consumption especially in area with significant irrigated area expansion e g western us spain france germany central asia middle east and southeast asia nonetheless for some regions the negative effects of land use change exceed the positive effects of climate change on crop green and blue water consumption further resulting in a decrease in crop water consumption for example crop green water consumption decreases in south sudan england sweden finland northern india and southeast china because the decrease in green water consumption as a result of reduction in cropland area outweigh the increase induced by climate change similarly crop blue water consumption decreases in northern india southeast china and japan because the decrease in blue water consumption caused by significant decrease in irrigated area overshadows the increase associated with climate change in general as shown in table 2 climate change dominates the changes in crop green water consumption in most of regions except for some developing regions e g africa central asia middle east and pakistan where sharp cropland expansions occur to meet the increasing crop production demand and for some regions with significant cropland decrease e g india and eastern africa as for changes in crop blue water consumption land use change plays a dominant role in regions with significant irrigated land expansion e g africa central asia china mexico middle east russia south asia and argentina and also in regions with sharp decreases in irrigated land e g japan south korea and eastern africa in terms of crop types large green water consumption lies in misccrop 718 km3 year oil crop 658 km3 year fodder herb 629 km3 year and rice 605 km3 year during 1971 2000 which also are the dominant global crops in terms of acreage table 3 due to future climate and land use changes green water consumption is expected to increase for most of crops e g corn by 30 fiber crop 30 fodder herb 49 where cropland expansion dominates their changing pattern than climate change as for blue water rice 247 km3 year and wheat 245 km3 year are the two major blue water consumer during 1971 2000 but change by 107 and 7 respectively during 2071 2099 as irrigated area increases significantly for rice but decreases for wheat the increase of irrigated area for rice mainly occurs in vietnam laos cambodia pakistan and afghanistan where rice is the major agricultural product both for food and trade in addition global blue water consumption also increases for corn 155 fiber crop 57 fodder herb 246 misc crop 50 by 2071 2099 relative to that in 1971 2000 expansion of irrigated area for corn mainly occur in china and us while irrigated area for fodder herb increases a lot in eastern us spain turkey and france fig s4 due to a significant decrease of irrigated area for sugar occurring in india europe and south asia which surpasses the positive effects of climate change global blue water consumption for sugar crop also decreases by about 20 3 2 crop blue water dependence it is evident that bwi in arid regions is larger than that in humid areas because of limited precipitation for crop growth in arid regions for example crop green water consumption is the dominant water consumption in most regions with bwi 0 25 like europe eastern us southern china southeast asia and eastern south america fig s8 blue water on the other hand plays a dominant role for crop production over green water in arid area where irrigated agriculture is the main source of crop production globally global crop bwi increases from 18 6 during 1971 2000 to 26 0 during 2071 2099 and future cropland expansion dominates this increase table s2 at the regional level climate change tends to induce a moderate increase about 20 of bwi in most of regions e g eastern us southern brazil and eastern china because future climate conditions lead to a greater relative increase in crop blue water consumption than in green water except for india and eastern africa where the percentage change of crop green water consumption is higher than that of blue water as shown in fig 5 a and table 2 as for the effects of land use change bwi increases significantly in regions with large irrigated cropland expansion e g china middle east central asia mexico and south africa and decreases in regions like australia japan and south korea where irrigated area shrinks in the future table 2 generally when considering the combined effects of future climate and land use changes fig 5b bwi increases significantly in western china us eastern africa middle east and some european countries in addition as the expansion of cropland area and changing climate conditions arid regions e g northern africa central asia middle east and south africa where local precipitation can t fully satisfy the demand for optimal growth of crops and irrigation is needed are expected to move towards higher bwi i e greater fraction of crop blue water consumption and these regions may face greater competition over water resources 3 3 uncertainty analysis the results presented above are the ensemble mean of global crop green and blue consumption however the uncertainties arising from the climate data from gcms and simulated land use data are still substantial in many regions as shown in fig 6 the uncertainties in estimated future crop green water consumption are rather high cv 0 5 in western us central asia and middle east the dominant factor driving the uncertainties of simulated crop green water consumption is climate input i e gcms in south america africa australia and southeast asia on the other hand land use inputs i e lulcc downscaling allocations in demeter dominates the uncertainty in regions like eastern us central asia middle east and west china fig 7 as for crop blue water consumption large uncertainties cv 0 5 mainly occur in central asia japan middle east and some european countries the dominant factor driving the uncertainty is gcms in the eastern us western africa southern india southeast asia and some european countries e g germany and poland and is land use inputs in regions like southwest us central asia japan and middle east in general in regions with large cropland expansion or reduction demeter will generate gridded land use data with large uncertainty when using different lulcc downscaling allocations as a result land use inputs dominate the uncertainties of estimated crop water consumption furthermore the pre processes of generating future gridded monthly growing area for 12 crops also lead to large uncertainty in land use data especially in grids without cropland in historical year but with cropland expansion in future in addition due to large variability in future climate projection e g precipitation arising from different gcms the uncertainties arising from gcms can t be neglected in spite of bias correction 4 discussions 4 1 comparison to previous studies 4 1 1 comparison to historical estimates at global scale estimates of historical global crop green and blue water consumption are compared against previous studies table 4 in this study global crop green and blue water consumption around the year 2000 average 1997 2001 are estimated as 4954 km3 year and 1095 km3 year respectively global crop green water consumption was almost the same as estimates from gepic liu and yang 2010 but about 10 20 less than estimates by other studies rost et al 2008 hanasaki et al 2010 siebert and döll 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 chaturvedi et al 2015 global crop blue water consumption was less than that of h08 hanasaki et al 2010 wbmplus wisser et al 2008 and lpjml rost et al 2008 and higher than that of gcam chaturvedi et al 2015 cropwat mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 and gepic liu and yang 2010 simulated crop water consumption highly depends on not only model framework e g formulation used to calculate reference evapotranspiration but also cropland extend consideration e g whether fallow land has been included and climate input wisser et al 2008 siebert and döll 2010 4 1 2 comparison to fao estimates at country scale at the country level estimates of annual crop blue water consumption around the year 2000 also show good agreement with a correlation coefficient of 0 96 fig 8 with estimates of irrigation water requirement from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao http www fao org nr water aquastat data query index html however for countries with large area of paddy rice e g india china indonesia and thailand blue water consumption were over 20 lower than fao estimation which might be explained by the reason that fao model computes irrigation water requirement in paddy rice by adding an additional amount of water 200 mm for land preparation and flooding for plant protection and the extra water for paddy rice will be mostly returned to rivers or aquifers and is not part of blue water consumption fao 2016 furthermore estimates of crop blue water consumption in this study were about 10 higher than fao estimates in some countries like the us spain and pakistan and the disagreement of blue water estimates between this study and fao might be attributed by the discrepancies in climate inputs crop growing areas and imprecise crop growing seasons which have also been reported in previous studies wisser et al 2008 wada et al 2013b 4 1 3 comparison to isimip historical estimates at grid scale spatial patterns of annual mean crop blue water consumption during 1971 2000 in this study also show a general match with estimates from isimip estimates supplementary fig s9 which are the ensemble mean of irrigation water consumption generated by 4 ghms i e watergap döll and siebert 2002 alcamo et al 2003 müller schmied et al 2014 lpjml rost et al 2008 h08 hanasaki et al 2008a b and pcr globwb van beek et al 2011 wada et al 2011 2014b however crop blue water consumption in this study was over 20 higher than the ensemble mean of isimip estimates in regions with large irrigation water requirement e g western us india north china and middle east and were about 20 lower than isimip estimates in some humid areas supplementary fig s9 differences in model structures assumptions and formulations use in ghms result in different crop water consumption estimates and uncertainty from ghms has been proven to be the largest uncertainty source on impacts assessment wada et al 2013b piontek et al 2014 the spatial patterns of crop blue water consumption in this work is within the uncertainties range of isimip estimates elliott et al 2014 4 1 4 comparison to previous future projections the effects of climate change on crop blue water consumption have been estimated in previous studies döll 2002 wada and bierkens 2014 elliott et al 2014 in this study global crop blue water consumption is projected to increase by 14 1 in 2099 when compared with that in 1971 2000 only under climate change effects this result is in agreement with the estimates of wada and bierkens 2014 who reported that global crop blue water consumption is projected to increase by about 14 between 2010 and 2100 under rcp6 0 but the global blue water consumption estimates in this study are lower than those by elliott et al 2014 who reported that global crop blue water consumption increase by 25 with uncertainty range 20 40 in 2090s when compared with that in 1980 2010 by 10 ghms under rcp8 5 and higher than the simulation by döll 2002 who estimated that climate change would induce about 7 increase in global irrigation water requirement by 2070s when compared with that in 1961 1990 these uncertainties come from different climate projection i e rcps and model framework ghms land use change is also an important factors driving crop water consumption fischer et al 2007 in this study we show that assuming land use static overtime could lead to underestimating humanity s need for water resources especially in regions that are likely to expand their cropland productions in the future as shown in fig s1 the amount of land expansion from gcam is generally lower than previous estimates such as hanasaki et al 2013 in which irrigated area was assumed to grow at rate of 0 3 yr under the ssp2 scenario in gcam irrigation expansion is an economic decision that relies on competing demands for agricultural commodities that are traded in global and regional markets calvin et al 2014 piontek et al 2014 have shown that the effects of human activities on water scarcity is comparable to the climate effect in general and that the human effect dominate in arid and semiarid regions this is consistent with this work where we show that the land use signal is comparable to the climate signal and tend to dominate in water scarce regions and regions that are projecting large shifts in agriculture productions 4 2 limitation and future improvements the uncertainties of crop water consumption estimates between this study and previous studies come from three parts model structures climate forcing and land use inputs wada et al 2013b reported that the structural uncertainty arising from different ghms is dominant over that from climate forcing i e gcms and rcps although this study has relied on a single ghm the estimation of crop blue water consumption is consistent with the results of the 10 ghms from isimip simulation elliott et al 2014 furthermore this study addresses another important source of uncertainty that is often neglected which is the lulcc downscaling step we use demeter to generate five gridded land use products based on regional gcam simulation the uncertainty from lulcc downscaling allocation is comparable to that from gcms and lulcc downscaling tend to dominate the uncertainty of crop water consumption than gcms especially in regions with large cropland expansion or reduction fig 7 future work should focus on understanding the sources of uncertainty with gridded land use projections to reduce these uncertainties in future simulations of crop water consumption unlike other ghms which simulate crop growth i e crop calendar under changing climate conditions bondeau et al 2007 hanasaki et al 2008b rost et al 2008 wisser et al 2008 we use a prescribed crop calendar compiled by portmann et al 2010 in line with that in some models siebert and döll 2010 wada et al 2014b notably the specific crop calendar in a specific region remains static over time thus more dynamic representation of crop information including crop coefficient crop categories crop calendar with future changing environment would improve the estimation of crop water consumption in addition surface resistance was set to a constant value of 70 s m 1 when calculating the reference evapotranspiration in allen et al 1998 and the increase of surface resistance under an increasing atmospheric co2 concentration is neglected leading to over estimation of future reference evapotranspiration yang et al 2019 it is highly necessary to incorporate the vegetation response to elevated atmospheric co2 concentration in crop water consumption projections in the future in addition xanthos is run offline with the future climate forcing from gcms but not fully coupling into gcms where the potential feedbacks were not presented e g the impacts of simulated evaporation by xanthos on precipitation from gcms schewe et al 2014 future works are needed for consistency between the xanthos simulation and whatever was done in the original climate models crop blue water consumption is assumed to be extracted from nonrenewable water resources when exceeding available water resources at a given grid and month i e no water constraints infrastructure development needs is implied to be met in the future land use scenario and this is not necessarily guaranteed these may lead to over estimation of irrigation water consumption in arid regions e g middle east central asia western us and northwest china where regional renewable water supplies can t fully satisfy crop water consumption as well as in some less developed regions where infrastructure development can t be met in the future land use change scenario furthermore additional evaporation from ponds in paddy rice is ignored leading to under estimation of crop blue water consumption for paddy rice in general future work needs to take the consideration of water constraints and irrigation water managements for different crop types 4 3 broader implications freshwater use has been identified as one of the nine planetary boundaries which provides human with a safe operating space in order to prevent unacceptable environmental change rockström et al 2009a b c the freshwater planetary boundary is defined as the maximum blue water consumption in the world beyond the preindustrial situation and set at 4000 6000 km3 year rockström et al 2014 steffen et al 2015 as the largest consumer of freshwater agricultural blue water consumption is estimated at about 900 1700 km3 year at the current stage rost et al 2008 liu and yang 2010 wisser et al 2010 hanasaki et al 2010 siebert and döll 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 chaturvedi et al 2015 fao 2016 and is projected to increase about 14 in 2100 under climate change effects as shown in this study and wada and bierkens 2014 furthermore when considering the effects of land use changes agricultural blue water consumption is projected to increase 70 by 2090s fig 4 notwithstanding that threshold of freshwater planetary boundary defined by steffen et al 2015 isn t yet transgressed blue water consumption in several regions is already beyond local tolerance limits and humanity has already experienced the widespread impacts of over consumption of blue water gerten et al 2011 rockström et al 2014 famiglietti et al 2011 reported that agricultural irrigation resulted in a decrease of groundwater level at a rate of 31 mm yr in the central valley of us and similar situations were also found in the north china tang et al 2013 india rodell et al 2009 and the middle east taylor et al 2013 with future climate and land use changes agricultural blue water consumption in some regions e g west asia middle east and north china continues to increase to meet the increasing food demand fig 4 also meeting environmental water requirements and human s demand for water consumption will be a growing challenge in these water scarce regions which could fundamentally change the environment for human production and socioeconomic development rockström et al 2009b c however despite the fact that the concept of freshwater planetary boundary strictly focuses on blue water consumption only green and blue water fluxes are interlinked rockström et al 2014 jaramillo and destouni 2015 the consumptive use of green water in upstream area of a basin typically alters blue water availability in downstream areas furthermore several studies have shown that human induced changes in land and water use e g irrigation greatly shift the total evapotranspiration further affect runoff and blue water consumption wang and hejazi 2011 destouni et al 2013 gordon et al 2005 as estimated in this studies global total crop green water consumption is projected to increase by 11 3 from 4886 km3 year during 1971 2000 to 5400 km3 year in 2070s under both climate and land use change effects increasing crop green water consumption would occupy blue water availability for humans which would consequently intensify local water scarcity conditions for example many regions have suffered from severe water scarcity e g middle east north china central asia and western us where local water availability can t fully satisfy human water demand vörösmarty et al 2010 wada et al 2013a famiglietti 2014 schewe et al 2014 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 veldkamp et al 2017 furthermore there is a rapidly rising trend of crop green and blue water consumption in these hotspot regions as cropland expands driven by growing demands for food and energy and the bwi increases a lot figs 4 5 which would occupy water supply to other sectors e g environment requirement domestic and industrial and break the criterion of the freshwater planetary boundary gerten et al 2013 thus the key challenge will be to invest in strategies for sustainable water consumption in relation to the freshwater planetary boundary conception within the integrated green and blue water framework which is an important aspect of the sustainable development goal for water i e sdg6 furthermore as global food production may need to rise by 50 70 to satisfy the food demand of an extra 2 billion people by 2050 mcintyre et al 2009 resulting in cropland area expansion fig 3 it is important to plan for an integrated climate land water framework to meet future food demand for society as well as reduce pressures on water and land resources rockström et al 2014 one of the most effective measures is to improve water productivity by enhancing soil moisture management and better breeding in crop yield since rainfed agriculture accounts for 80 of the world s total agricultural cropland improving management of green water is very important because upstream management of cropland and green water resources would improve the rainfall partition in a catchment further benefitting blue water availability to the downstream users foley et al 2011 for irrigated land besides large scale water supply enhancement through increasing storage of infrastructure and desalination facilities wada et al 2014a promoting use of waste water and integrating multiple use in irrigation system e g domestic and fisheries would also increase water productivity de fraiture and wichelns 2010 currently 16 of world population depends on food import to cover their demand for crop products fader et al 2013 trading agricultural products from highly productive regions with abundant water resources to water limited regions is helpful to reduce regional agriculture water consumption and reduce the risk of exceeding the freshwater planetary boundary with the growth of global population and associated food demand a fair and efficient global trade will be needed to sustain local food security and achieve the goal of sustainable development and trade agreements are expected to reach at global and regional scale which would promote the development of virtual water trade in addition climate change leads to 8 5 and 14 increase in crop green and blue water consumption respectively fig 6 due to warming in temperature and associated rising evaporation demand wada and bierkens 2014 countries pursuit to achieve their nationally determined contributions ndcs mid century strategies mcss and sdgs will have large implications on the levels of climate impacts and land use changes and their evolutions in the future thus future research should also explore how these forces may affect the co evolution of climate and land systems and how they in turn affect humanity s growing dependence on blue water resources the challenge lies in identifying potential tradeoffs and synergies across these goals to avoid unintended consequences in term of exacerbating water scarcity conditions hejazi et al 2015 5 conclusions in this study a crop water use module is incorporated into gcam system crop specific green and blue water consumption are calculated on monthly time step at global 0 5 0 5 grid scale with the aid of future climate forcing from gcms and land use projections from gcam wherein the future climate and land use conditions are consistent with concurrent socioeconomic and emissions pathways this provides a more comprehensive understanding of changes in global crop water consumption than earlier studies which usually examine this question through the lens of a single factor i e either climate change or land use change or ignore the inherent consistency between climate land and socioeconomics results show that global crop green water consumption is projected to increase by 11 7 from 4886 km3 year in the historical period 1971 2000 to 5460 km3 year by 2090s and the contribution of climate change on global crop green water consumption is larger than that of land use change global crop blue water consumption is projected to increase by 70 3 by the end of this century and expansion in irrigated area is the mainly driver to that in terms of the spatial patterns climate change dominates changes in crop green water consumption in most of regions except in some developing regions e g africa central asia middle east and pakistan where sharp cropland expansion occurs to meet the crop production demand and in some regions with significant cropland shrinkage e g india and eastern africa changes in irrigated area dominates the changes in crop blue water consumption in most of global regions especially in regions with significant irrigated land expansion e g africa central asia china mexico middle east russia south asia and argentina furthermore global crop blue water dependence will increase as the climate change and cropland expansion especially in arid regions in general the results in this study improve our understanding of the potential implications future climate and land use conditions on global agricultural green and blue water consumption which is critical to devise effective adaptation strategies for securing future food and water needs sustainably

6434,agriculture accounts for 90 of global freshwater consumption and it is expected to intensify in the future climate and land use changes are two major factors affecting crop green and blue water consumption and in this study we explicitly consider the effects of both factors in a consistent modeling framework two important research questions are addressed 1 how will global crop green and blue water consumption evolve over the 21st century under climate and land use changes and 2 what are the individual and combined effects of climate and land use changes on future crop green and blue water consumption to tackle these two questions a crop water use module is developed based on the global change assessment model gcam and its hydrology module i e xanthos crop specific green and blue water consumption are then calculated at global 0 5 0 5 grid scale results show that global crop green water consumption increases by 12 in 2090s when compared with that in 1971 2000 and climate change dominates over land use change in determining the trend of global crop green water consumption however expansion in global irrigated area dominates the changing trend of global crop blue water consumption which increases 70 by 2090s especially in regions with significant irrigated land expansion e g northern africa central asia china mexico the middle east russia southern asia and argentina furthermore global crop blue water dependence will increase under climate and land use changes especially in arid regions keywords integrated assessment model crop green water consumption crop blue

industrial and domestic purposes and indirectly e g converting natural vegetation into cropland boucher et al 2004 bondeau et al 2007 tang et al 2007 rost et al 2008 rodell et al 2009 wada et al 2010 haddeland et al 2014 leng et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2015 agricultural irrigation which is the largest human water consumer accounts for about 70 of global human freshwater withdrawal and about 90 of global human freshwater consumption rost et al 2008 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 wada and bierkens 2014 huang et al 2018 and has contributed to increasing evapotranspiration and decreasing river discharges rost et al 2008 müller schmied et al 2014 given the rapid growth of global population and increasing food demand over the past several decades crop green and blue water consumption have increased with the expansion of cropland especially irrigated land klein goldewijk and ramankutty 2004 siebert et al 2015 here crop green water consumption is known as the evapotranspiration from soil moisture replenished by precipitation in cropland while crop blue water consumption is the evapotranspiration from irrigation i e water abstracted from rivers lakes and aquifers savenije 2000 falkenmark and rockström 2006 rockström et al 2009a previous studies have reported that the annual mean global crop green water consumption about 5000 km3 year is about three times of global crop blue water consumption which is about 1000 1700 km3 year shiklomanov 2000 rost et al 2008 hanasaki et al 2010 liu and yang 2010 chaturvedi et al 2015 the increase of human water consumption is expected to intensify global water scarcity which is a significant issue in a number of countries oki and kanae 2006 vörösmarty et al 2010 hayashi et al 2013 hejazi et al 2014 wada et al 2016 thus assessing future global agricultural green and blue water consumption and their implications on the sustainable use of freshwater and related food security issue are critical especially in arid and semi arid regions e g north china central asia the middle east and northern africa agricultural green and blue water consumption at global scale have attracted considerable attention and various approaches have shed new light upon the estimates of the present and future state of global agricultural water consumption during the past two decades shiklomanov 2000 döll and siebert 2002 alcamo et al 2003 hanasaki et al 2008a rost et al 2008 siebert et al 2010 leng et al 2014 chaturvedi et al 2015 initial estimates of crop blue and green water consumption e g postel 1998 rockström and gordon 2001 shiklomanov and rodda 2004 were based on diverse irrigation water use statistics crop productivities and yields average evapotranspiration rates and vegetation distribution maps later many global hydrological models ghms have incorporated crop water use modules to assess crop green and blue water consumption döll and siebert 2002 tang et al 2007 hanasaki et al 2008b rost et al 2008 wisser et al 2008 siebert and döll 2010 wada et al 2011 pokhrel et al 2012 jaegermeyr et al 2015 however most studies have focused on historical reconstruction of crop blue water consumption and only a few simulations have addressed the effects of future global change e g climate and land use changes on both green and blue crop water consumption for example some studies have reported that future climate conditions will lead to an increase in global crop blue water consumption wada et al 2013b schewe et al 2014 elliott et al 2014 but didn t explore the effects of changes in cropland area induced by future socioeconomic development especially future irrigated land which is expected to expand to meet future crop demands for food feed and fuel hanasaki et al 2013 considered the effects of irrigated area expansion on crop blue water consumption but the future cropland projections were assumed exogenously based on expert judgement similar to that in shen et al 2008 and sulser et al 2010 thus projections of crop green and blue water consumption under an internally consistent set of future climate and land use conditions are still lacking in spite of their great significance furthermore the individual and combined effects of future climate and land use changes on crop green and blue water consumption which are of great significance to guide the sustainable use of freshwater are still unknown this study utilizes the global change assessment model gcam which simulates the complex interactions among economy energy land use water and climate systems in a consistent economic framework to assess how future crop specific cropland irrigated and rainfed will change through incorporating a crop water use module into the hydrological model in gcam namely xanthos li et al 2017 2018 crop specific green and blue water consumption under future climate and land use conditions are estimated globally this allows the trajectories of the land use change and climate change to be consistent under the same socioeconomics and emissions pathway which is a critical improvement to previous estimates of future crop water consumption which usually considered the single effects climate or land use or ignore their inherent consistency with concurrent socioeconomics and emissions pathway in this study we focus on two important scientific questions 1 how global crop green and blue water consumption will evolve over the 21st century under future climate and land use conditions 2 what are the individual and combined effects of climate and land use changes on future crop green and blue water consumption the remainder of this paper is organized as follows description of the data and modeling framework are represented in data and methods section findings about future global crop green and blue water consumption and uncertainties in our estimates are represented in the results section a comparison of estimation in this study with previous studies and broader implications of the results are discussed in the discussion section followed by conclusions 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets monthly meteorological data on a global 0 5 0 5 grid are obtained from the integrated project water and global change watch for the period 1951 2001 including precipitation surface mean air temperature maximum air temperature minimum air temperature relative humidity surface wind speed long wave downwelling radiation and short wave downwelling radiation weedon et al 2011 the watch climate data which is based on the reanalysis data set era 40 and bias corrected is served as historical climate input in this study for future simulations monthly climate datasets during the period 1951 2099 obtained from the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project isi mip https www isimip org were generated by five general circulation models gcms namely miroc esm chem nores1 m ipsl cm5a lr gfdl esm2m and hadgem2 es due to the biases between gcm outputs and observations piani et al 2010 climate datasets from these five gcms were all bias corrected using the watch climate data for the overlapping reference climate hempel et al 2013 the mirca2000 dataset which was generated based on multi census national and subnational statistics e g harvested crop area and cropping season provides the monthly crop harvested area and crop growing season for all the major rainfed and irrigated crops for the year around 2000 portmann et al 2010 in this study cropping period lists cpl from the mirca2000 dataset which provides the monthly growing area start and end month of cropping period for 26 irrigated and rainfed crops at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 for the years around 2000 are used we reclassified the 26 crops from the mirca2000 into 12 crops categories defined by the gcam model details in supplementary thus monthly growing area and the growing pattern of all 12 irrigated and rainfed crops for the years around 2000 at 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution are established 2 2 modeling framework the modeling framework consists of several models that are necessary to simulate future land use and land cover change lulcc and how both lulcc and future climate affect crop blue and green water consumption globally over the 21st century fig 1 more specifically gcam and two of its ancillary modeling tools demeter and xanthos are used gcam is used to simulate how land use may change over time given that gcam is an integrated human earth system model where land use decisions are made at regional scale e g water basin scale demeter a disaggregation tool is then used to map crop information from regional to grid scale cropland information is then incorporated into xanthos a global hydrologic model to simulate crop blue and green water consumption under future climate and land use conditions the following describes each of the three modeling tools in more details 2 2 1 gcam gcam is an open source community model with representation of relationships among economy energy land use climate and water systems clarke and edmonds 1993 edmonds et al 1997 kim et al 2006 gcam is often used to simulate different radiative forcing representative concentration pathways rcps and socioeconomic scenarios shared socioeconomic pathways ssps using a consistent accounting framework calvin et al 2014 2018 gcam is forced by present and future populations labor productivities resource availabilities and energy and agriculture technologies regional population and labor productivities assumptions drive the energy and land use system to produce transfer and provide energy services as well as to produce agriculture and forest products further to determine land use and land cover in this study the cropland areas for 12 crops both irrigated and rainfed are generated by gcam at the water basin level i e 235 basins globally liu et al 2018 from 2005 to 2100 under the ssp2 and rcp6 0 scenario see section 2 3 the 12 gcam crop categories are corn fiber crop fodder grass fodder herb miscellaneous crop misccrop oil crop other grain palm fruit rice root tuber sugar crop and wheat 2 2 2 demeter demeter is an open source community lulcc downscaling model which is designed to generate high resolution gridded time series representation of lulcc projections from country or region level to grid level west et al 2014 le page et al 2016 vernon et al 2018 the downscaling algorithm is supported by a number of user defined settings including the treatment order i e which lulcc type should be downscaled first and transition priorities i e which type of land swaps are favored e g irrigated rice expansion preferentially into rainfed rice rather than grassland demeter uses an intensification and extensification process applied to each lulcc type and downscales lulcc projections from region or zone to the resolution of the base layer i e observed spatial lulcc data e g mirca2000 notably lulcc types from both projected and observed data are harmonized in this study lulcc projections are simulated by gcam at basin level from 2005 to 2100 including changes in cropland area for 12 crops both irrigated and rainfed to assess the uncertainty associated with the parameters in demeter five alternative downscaling allocations i e treatment order and transition priorities are defined and 5 gridded lulcc datasets are generated therefore future gridded monthly growing area of 12 crops both irrigated and rainfed are established based on the gridded downscaled future results from demeter and historical monthly crop growing area in mirca2000 more details shown in supplementary 2 2 3 xanthos a crop water use module which estimates crop specific green and blue water consumption is built upon the hydrologic module in gcam i e xanthos li et al 2017 liu et al 2018 in this study the crop water consumption is simulated using the crop coefficient method for each 0 5 0 5 grid at a monthly time step allen et al 1998 monthly crop evapotranspiration etc mm month 1 which mainly depends on crop development stage and crop types is estimated as 1 e t c k c e t 0 where kc is the crop coefficient defined according to allen et al 1998 and siebert and döll 2010 and values for 12 crops are shown in supplementary supplementary table s1 et0 is the monthly reference evapotranspiration mm month 1 calculated by fao peman monteith method allen et al 1998 2 e t 0 0 408

using the maximum and minimum air temperature averaged over a given month tmax and tmin following instructions in allen et al 1998 for rainfed crops the crop specific actual evapotranspiration aetr during their growing seasons which is all green water is calculated by xanthos with soil water balance as follows liu et al 2018 3 ae t r p s n m δ s r e q d where δ s is the changes in soil moisture mm month 1 p is the precipitation mm month 1 snm is the snowmelt mm month 1 re is the groundwater recharge from soil mm month 1 qd is the directly runoff from soil mm month 1 fig 1 crop specific green water consumption for rainfed crops gwcr is 4 gw c r a e t r for irrigated crops we assume that there are no water constraints for irrigated crops and the crop specific actual evapotranspiration i e sum of green and blue consumption is equal to the crop evapotranspiration etc therefore crop specific green water consumption for irrigated crops gwci is the actual evapotranspiration aeti simulated by xanthos which is the same as that for aetr and blue water consumption bwci is the difference between etc and aeti calculated as follows 5 gw c i a e t i 6 bw c i e t c a e t i in addition fallow land is treated as bare soil both for irrigated and rainfed areas with a constant kc of 0 2 van beek et al 2011 total crop green water consumption gwc is the sum of green water consumption in irrigated and rainfed land while total crop blue water consumption bwc is the crop blue water consumption in irrigated land calculated as 7 gwc g w c i g w c r 8 bwc b w c i in addition to calculating crop blue and green water consumption we estimate the blue water index bwi which is defined as the ratio of crop blue water consumption to total water consumption to represent the dependence of crop production on blue water johansson et al 2016 a bwi value of 1 indicates that all crop water consumption comes from blue water i e irrigation and a bwi value of 0 means that precipitation is sufficient for maximum crop yield or no irrigation is implemented the bwi helps to identify hotspots where crop demands more water from irrigation than soil moisture as a result of high consumption of agricultural blue water where socioeconomic and environmental systems may face increasing conflicts over water resources johansson et al 2016 2 3 rcp6 0 ssp2 scenario this study targets rcp 6 0 and ssp2 scenarios which is a suitable combination of the scenario matrix architecture and describes a middle of the road development in climate change mitigation and adaption o neill et al 2014 van vuuren et al 2014 fricko et al 2017 this combination depicts a moderate evolution of climate change and socioeconomics in the future avoiding extreme pathways that are less likely to happen with the ongoing international efforts dedicated to mitigating climate change and seeking sustainable development goals sdgs un 2015 the projected global population under the middle of road scenario i e ssp2 grows to around 9 17 billion in the 2050s peaks around 9 4 billion in the 2070s and then declines to about 9 billion by the end of this century samir and wolfgang 2017 based on gcam simulation under the ssp2 scenario global total cropland area increases by 1 4 from 10 69 million km2 in 2000 to 10 84 million km2 in 2100 with most of the increase 5 7 occurring by 2070 and a subsequent slight decrease of 3 2 between 2070 and 2100 figs s1 2 generally global irrigated and rainfed cropland areas increase 11 4 and 4 2 by 2070 respectively therein expansion of rainfed cropland area is mainly for corn 14 4 fodder herb 62 9 and root tuber 87 9 and expansion of irrigated cropland is mainly for corn 40 0 fodder herb 83 2 and rice 17 4 which dominate the changing trend of total global rainfed and irrigated cropland area fig 2 detail description of changing patterns of future cropland are represented in supplementary figs s3 5 rcp 6 0 is a stabilization without overshoot scenario in which total radiative forcing level reaches a value of 6 w m2 at stabilization after 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 rcp6 0 depicts a global warming of about 4 c by 2100 with the most rapid increase in temperature in the northern high latitudes areas fig s6 global mean precipitation increases by about 5 7 and precipitation increases significantly in the northern high latitudes areas and decreases in the semi arid areas such as southern africa southeastern south america and areas near the mediterranean sea fig s6 2 4 experimental design four experiments are conducted in this study to assess the effects of climate and land use changes on crop blue and green water consumption both individually and in tandem table 1 the first experiment which is forced by the watch data for the period 1971 2001 with a 20 year spin up 1951 1970 is used as a benchmark and also for comparison to previous studies cropland area from mirca 2000 is used and kept static during the historical period the second experiment which is forced by climate inputs from 5 gcms under rcp6 0 during the period of 1971 2099 is designed to simulate the combined effects of future climate and land use changes on crop water consumption therein land use inputs use the mirca2000 data for the period 1971 2010 and land use projections from gcam for the period 2011 2099 experiment 3 and 4 are control experiments which are designed to reflect the individual effects of climate and land use changes on crop water consumption respectively different from experiment 2 cropland input in experiment 3 is kept consistent i e mirca2000 during 1971 2099 while climate input in experiment 4 during 2011 2099 is based on the monthly average value of each of the gcms but with transient land use data for the future period i e gcam and demeter estimates and is the same as that in experiment 2 experiments 2 and 4 include 25 model runs each 5 gcms 5 land use inputs while experiment 3 includes 5 model runs 5 gcms 1 historical land use input the results focus on the ensemble mean of the multiple simulations in each experiment and the uncertainty arising from various climate inputs i e gcms and land use inputs are also discussed 2 5 uncertainty analysis in this study the coefficient of variation cv defined as the standard deviation divided by the ensemble mean value of 25 runs in experiment 2 i e 5 gcms and 5 lulcc downscaling allocations in demeter is used to evaluate the uncertainty from future climate and land use projections to separate the fractional uncertainty in simulated crop water consumption arising from climate and land use inputs we use the method of hawkins and sutton 2009 and wada et al 2013b who calculated the fractional variance of each uncertainty source by assuming that each source is independent the uncertainties in simulated crop green and blue water consumption are separated into two sources climate inputs i e gcms and land use inputs i e lulcc allocations in demeter and the total variance vt of crop green and blue water consumption is the sum of the variance from climate inputs vc and land use inputs vl 9 v t v c v l here we use the simulation of gridded crop green and blue water consumption by experiment 2 25 runs 5gcms 5 land use inputs to calculate the fractional variance by climate and land use inputs for vc we first calculate the variance at grid level for annual average crop green or blue water during 2071 2099 across the 5 gcms for a given land use input i e 5 runs 5gcms 1 land use inputs and by repeating this for each land use input and the average variance of them is vc similar processes are also adopted for calculation of vl then the fractional variance of each uncertainty source can be distinguished 3 results 3 1 changes in future crop water consumption global crop green water consumption increases about 8 5 by 2099 relative to that of 1971 2000 due to future climate condition on the other hand under future land use conditions global total cropland area continues to increase by 2070 and then slightly decreases between 2070 and 2100 resulting in a moderate increase 6 0 of global crop green water consumption by 2070s and a mild decrease 0 8 during 2071 2099 fig 3 a generally global crop green water consumption is projected to increase by 11 3 from 4886 km3 year in the historical period 1971 2000 to 5400 km3 year by 2070s under both climate and land use change effects and continues to increase to 5460 km3 year by 2090s despite the decline of cropland area indicating that the effects of climate change on global crop green water consumption is larger than that of land use change in addition global crop blue water consumption is projected to increase by 14 1 46 6 and 70 3 by the end of this century under the three simulation scenarios i e climate change effects only land use change effects only and both climate and land use changes effects respectively fig 3b under climate change effects only scenario global crop blue water consumption continues to increase slightly in the 21st century however global crop blue water consumption simulated under the combined climate and land use effects scenario shows a similar changing pattern with that under land use change effects only with the peak occurring in 2070s and a slight decline during 2010 2099 indicating that changes in global irrigated cropland dominate the trend of global crop blue water consumption than climate change effects in fact even though global total irrigated area increases only 11 4 by 2070 most of the increases occur in arid and semi arid areas e g central asia north china and western us where crop blue water consumption per unit of irrigated area is higher than some more humid areas with a decline in irrigated cropland e g southern china japan central us and some europe areas therefore changes in global irrigated area lead to large increase in global total crop blue water consumption and dominate its changing trend over climate change due to pronounced warming conditions and associated precipitation change fig s6 crop green water consumption during 2071 2099 increases by about 15 when compared with that in 1971 2000 fig s7 with the most pronounced changes in the us european countries sub sahara regions and eastern china climate change also enhances crop blue water consumption globally especially in the eastern us by 30 northern brazil about 25 some european countries by 40 and southern china by 25 fig 4 a b when only considering the effects of changes in cropland area changes in crop green and blue water consumption shows similar changing pattern with changes in total cropland area and irrigated area respectively fig 4c d and fig s5 for example in some developed countries e g japan south korea uk sweden and finland population growth rates are very low and crop green water consumption decreases as cropland area shrinks but in some developing countries e g pakistan mexico vietnamese laos and countries in central asia crop green water consumption continues to increase as cropland expands to meet the growing demand of crop production due to population and economic growth irrigated cropland area also shows increasing trend e g corn in north china rice in vietnam laos and pakistan fig s4 which leads to large increase in crop blue water consumption when considering the combined effects of climate and land use changes fig 4e f crop green water consumption increases more than that only under climate change in many regions e g middle asia central china western us and eastern russia due to expansion of cropland area furthermore land use change aggravates global crop blue water consumption especially in area with significant irrigated area expansion e g western us spain france germany central asia middle east and southeast asia nonetheless for some regions the negative effects of land use change exceed the positive effects of climate change on crop green and blue water consumption further resulting in a decrease in crop water consumption for example crop green water consumption decreases in south sudan england sweden finland northern india and southeast china because the decrease in green water consumption as a result of reduction in cropland area outweigh the increase induced by climate change similarly crop blue water consumption decreases in northern india southeast china and japan because the decrease in blue water consumption caused by significant decrease in irrigated area overshadows the increase associated with climate change in general as shown in table 2 climate change dominates the changes in crop green water consumption in most of regions except for some developing regions e g africa central asia middle east and pakistan where sharp cropland expansions occur to meet the increasing crop production demand and for some regions with significant cropland decrease e g india and eastern africa as for changes in crop blue water consumption land use change plays a dominant role in regions with significant irrigated land expansion e g africa central asia china mexico middle east russia south asia and argentina and also in regions with sharp decreases in irrigated land e g japan south korea and eastern africa in terms of crop types large green water consumption lies in misccrop 718 km3 year oil crop 658 km3 year fodder herb 629 km3 year and rice 605 km3 year during 1971 2000 which also are the dominant global crops in terms of acreage table 3 due to future climate and land use changes green water consumption is expected to increase for most of crops e g corn by 30 fiber crop 30 fodder herb 49 where cropland expansion dominates their changing pattern than climate change as for blue water rice 247 km3 year and wheat 245 km3 year are the two major blue water consumer during 1971 2000 but change by 107 and 7 respectively during 2071 2099 as irrigated area increases significantly for rice but decreases for wheat the increase of irrigated area for rice mainly occurs in vietnam laos cambodia pakistan and afghanistan where rice is the major agricultural product both for food and trade in addition global blue water consumption also increases for corn 155 fiber crop 57 fodder herb 246 misc crop 50 by 2071 2099 relative to that in 1971 2000 expansion of irrigated area for corn mainly occur in china and us while irrigated area for fodder herb increases a lot in eastern us spain turkey and france fig s4 due to a significant decrease of irrigated area for sugar occurring in india europe and south asia which surpasses the positive effects of climate change global blue water consumption for sugar crop also decreases by about 20 3 2 crop blue water dependence it is evident that bwi in arid regions is larger than that in humid areas because of limited precipitation for crop growth in arid regions for example crop green water consumption is the dominant water consumption in most regions with bwi 0 25 like europe eastern us southern china southeast asia and eastern south america fig s8 blue water on the other hand plays a dominant role for crop production over green water in arid area where irrigated agriculture is the main source of crop production globally global crop bwi increases from 18 6 during 1971 2000 to 26 0 during 2071 2099 and future cropland expansion dominates this increase table s2 at the regional level climate change tends to induce a moderate increase about 20 of bwi in most of regions e g eastern us southern brazil and eastern china because future climate conditions lead to a greater relative increase in crop blue water consumption than in green water except for india and eastern africa where the percentage change of crop green water consumption is higher than that of blue water as shown in fig 5 a and table 2 as for the effects of land use change bwi increases significantly in regions with large irrigated cropland expansion e g china middle east central asia mexico and south africa and decreases in regions like australia japan and south korea where irrigated area shrinks in the future table 2 generally when considering the combined effects of future climate and land use changes fig 5b bwi increases significantly in western china us eastern africa middle east and some european countries in addition as the expansion of cropland area and changing climate conditions arid regions e g northern africa central asia middle east and south africa where local precipitation can t fully satisfy the demand for optimal growth of crops and irrigation is needed are expected to move towards higher bwi i e greater fraction of crop blue water consumption and these regions may face greater competition over water resources 3 3 uncertainty analysis the results presented above are the ensemble mean of global crop green and blue consumption however the uncertainties arising from the climate data from gcms and simulated land use data are still substantial in many regions as shown in fig 6 the uncertainties in estimated future crop green water consumption are rather high cv 0 5 in western us central asia and middle east the dominant factor driving the uncertainties of simulated crop green water consumption is climate input i e gcms in south america africa australia and southeast asia on the other hand land use inputs i e lulcc downscaling allocations in demeter dominates the uncertainty in regions like eastern us central asia middle east and west china fig 7 as for crop blue water consumption large uncertainties cv 0 5 mainly occur in central asia japan middle east and some european countries the dominant factor driving the uncertainty is gcms in the eastern us western africa southern india southeast asia and some european countries e g germany and poland and is land use inputs in regions like southwest us central asia japan and middle east in general in regions with large cropland expansion or reduction demeter will generate gridded land use data with large uncertainty when using different lulcc downscaling allocations as a result land use inputs dominate the uncertainties of estimated crop water consumption furthermore the pre processes of generating future gridded monthly growing area for 12 crops also lead to large uncertainty in land use data especially in grids without cropland in historical year but with cropland expansion in future in addition due to large variability in future climate projection e g precipitation arising from different gcms the uncertainties arising from gcms can t be neglected in spite of bias correction 4 discussions 4 1 comparison to previous studies 4 1 1 comparison to historical estimates at global scale estimates of historical global crop green and blue water consumption are compared against previous studies table 4 in this study global crop green and blue water consumption around the year 2000 average 1997 2001 are estimated as 4954 km3 year and 1095 km3 year respectively global crop green water consumption was almost the same as estimates from gepic liu and yang 2010 but about 10 20 less than estimates by other studies rost et al 2008 hanasaki et al 2010 siebert and döll 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 chaturvedi et al 2015 global crop blue water consumption was less than that of h08 hanasaki et al 2010 wbmplus wisser et al 2008 and lpjml rost et al 2008 and higher than that of gcam chaturvedi et al 2015 cropwat mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 and gepic liu and yang 2010 simulated crop water consumption highly depends on not only model framework e g formulation used to calculate reference evapotranspiration but also cropland extend consideration e g whether fallow land has been included and climate input wisser et al 2008 siebert and döll 2010 4 1 2 comparison to fao estimates at country scale at the country level estimates of annual crop blue water consumption around the year 2000 also show good agreement with a correlation coefficient of 0 96 fig 8 with estimates of irrigation water requirement from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao http www fao org nr water aquastat data query index html however for countries with large area of paddy rice e g india china indonesia and thailand blue water consumption were over 20 lower than fao estimation which might be explained by the reason that fao model computes irrigation water requirement in paddy rice by adding an additional amount of water 200 mm for land preparation and flooding for plant protection and the extra water for paddy rice will be mostly returned to rivers or aquifers and is not part of blue water consumption fao 2016 furthermore estimates of crop blue water consumption in this study were about 10 higher than fao estimates in some countries like the us spain and pakistan and the disagreement of blue water estimates between this study and fao might be attributed by the discrepancies in climate inputs crop growing areas and imprecise crop growing seasons which have also been reported in previous studies wisser et al 2008 wada et al 2013b 4 1 3 comparison to isimip historical estimates at grid scale spatial patterns of annual mean crop blue water consumption during 1971 2000 in this study also show a general match with estimates from isimip estimates supplementary fig s9 which are the ensemble mean of irrigation water consumption generated by 4 ghms i e watergap döll and siebert 2002 alcamo et al 2003 müller schmied et al 2014 lpjml rost et al 2008 h08 hanasaki et al 2008a b and pcr globwb van beek et al 2011 wada et al 2011 2014b however crop blue water consumption in this study was over 20 higher than the ensemble mean of isimip estimates in regions with large irrigation water requirement e g western us india north china and middle east and were about 20 lower than isimip estimates in some humid areas supplementary fig s9 differences in model structures assumptions and formulations use in ghms result in different crop water consumption estimates and uncertainty from ghms has been proven to be the largest uncertainty source on impacts assessment wada et al 2013b piontek et al 2014 the spatial patterns of crop blue water consumption in this work is within the uncertainties range of isimip estimates elliott et al 2014 4 1 4 comparison to previous future projections the effects of climate change on crop blue water consumption have been estimated in previous studies döll 2002 wada and bierkens 2014 elliott et al 2014 in this study global crop blue water consumption is projected to increase by 14 1 in 2099 when compared with that in 1971 2000 only under climate change effects this result is in agreement with the estimates of wada and bierkens 2014 who reported that global crop blue water consumption is projected to increase by about 14 between 2010 and 2100 under rcp6 0 but the global blue water consumption estimates in this study are lower than those by elliott et al 2014 who reported that global crop blue water consumption increase by 25 with uncertainty range 20 40 in 2090s when compared with that in 1980 2010 by 10 ghms under rcp8 5 and higher than the simulation by döll 2002 who estimated that climate change would induce about 7 increase in global irrigation water requirement by 2070s when compared with that in 1961 1990 these uncertainties come from different climate projection i e rcps and model framework ghms land use change is also an important factors driving crop water consumption fischer et al 2007 in this study we show that assuming land use static overtime could lead to underestimating humanity s need for water resources especially in regions that are likely to expand their cropland productions in the future as shown in fig s1 the amount of land expansion from gcam is generally lower than previous estimates such as hanasaki et al 2013 in which irrigated area was assumed to grow at rate of 0 3 yr under the ssp2 scenario in gcam irrigation expansion is an economic decision that relies on competing demands for agricultural commodities that are traded in global and regional markets calvin et al 2014 piontek et al 2014 have shown that the effects of human activities on water scarcity is comparable to the climate effect in general and that the human effect dominate in arid and semiarid regions this is consistent with this work where we show that the land use signal is comparable to the climate signal and tend to dominate in water scarce regions and regions that are projecting large shifts in agriculture productions 4 2 limitation and future improvements the uncertainties of crop water consumption estimates between this study and previous studies come from three parts model structures climate forcing and land use inputs wada et al 2013b reported that the structural uncertainty arising from different ghms is dominant over that from climate forcing i e gcms and rcps although this study has relied on a single ghm the estimation of crop blue water consumption is consistent with the results of the 10 ghms from isimip simulation elliott et al 2014 furthermore this study addresses another important source of uncertainty that is often neglected which is the lulcc downscaling step we use demeter to generate five gridded land use products based on regional gcam simulation the uncertainty from lulcc downscaling allocation is comparable to that from gcms and lulcc downscaling tend to dominate the uncertainty of crop water consumption than gcms especially in regions with large cropland expansion or reduction fig 7 future work should focus on understanding the sources of uncertainty with gridded land use projections to reduce these uncertainties in future simulations of crop water consumption unlike other ghms which simulate crop growth i e crop calendar under changing climate conditions bondeau et al 2007 hanasaki et al 2008b rost et al 2008 wisser et al 2008 we use a prescribed crop calendar compiled by portmann et al 2010 in line with that in some models siebert and döll 2010 wada et al 2014b notably the specific crop calendar in a specific region remains static over time thus more dynamic representation of crop information including crop coefficient crop categories crop calendar with future changing environment would improve the estimation of crop water consumption in addition surface resistance was set to a constant value of 70 s m 1 when calculating the reference evapotranspiration in allen et al 1998 and the increase of surface resistance under an increasing atmospheric co2 concentration is neglected leading to over estimation of future reference evapotranspiration yang et al 2019 it is highly necessary to incorporate the vegetation response to elevated atmospheric co2 concentration in crop water consumption projections in the future in addition xanthos is run offline with the future climate forcing from gcms but not fully coupling into gcms where the potential feedbacks were not presented e g the impacts of simulated evaporation by xanthos on precipitation from gcms schewe et al 2014 future works are needed for consistency between the xanthos simulation and whatever was done in the original climate models crop blue water consumption is assumed to be extracted from nonrenewable water resources when exceeding available water resources at a given grid and month i e no water constraints infrastructure development needs is implied to be met in the future land use scenario and this is not necessarily guaranteed these may lead to over estimation of irrigation water consumption in arid regions e g middle east central asia western us and northwest china where regional renewable water supplies can t fully satisfy crop water consumption as well as in some less developed regions where infrastructure development can t be met in the future land use change scenario furthermore additional evaporation from ponds in paddy rice is ignored leading to under estimation of crop blue water consumption for paddy rice in general future work needs to take the consideration of water constraints and irrigation water managements for different crop types 4 3 broader implications freshwater use has been identified as one of the nine planetary boundaries which provides human with a safe operating space in order to prevent unacceptable environmental change rockström et al 2009a b c the freshwater planetary boundary is defined as the maximum blue water consumption in the world beyond the preindustrial situation and set at 4000 6000 km3 year rockström et al 2014 steffen et al 2015 as the largest consumer of freshwater agricultural blue water consumption is estimated at about 900 1700 km3 year at the current stage rost et al 2008 liu and yang 2010 wisser et al 2010 hanasaki et al 2010 siebert and döll 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 chaturvedi et al 2015 fao 2016 and is projected to increase about 14 in 2100 under climate change effects as shown in this study and wada and bierkens 2014 furthermore when considering the effects of land use changes agricultural blue water consumption is projected to increase 70 by 2090s fig 4 notwithstanding that threshold of freshwater planetary boundary defined by steffen et al 2015 isn t yet transgressed blue water consumption in several regions is already beyond local tolerance limits and humanity has already experienced the widespread impacts of over consumption of blue water gerten et al 2011 rockström et al 2014 famiglietti et al 2011 reported that agricultural irrigation resulted in a decrease of groundwater level at a rate of 31 mm yr in the central valley of us and similar situations were also found in the north china tang et al 2013 india rodell et al 2009 and the middle east taylor et al 2013 with future climate and land use changes agricultural blue water consumption in some regions e g west asia middle east and north china continues to increase to meet the increasing food demand fig 4 also meeting environmental water requirements and human s demand for water consumption will be a growing challenge in these water scarce regions which could fundamentally change the environment for human production and socioeconomic development rockström et al 2009b c however despite the fact that the concept of freshwater planetary boundary strictly focuses on blue water consumption only green and blue water fluxes are interlinked rockström et al 2014 jaramillo and destouni 2015 the consumptive use of green water in upstream area of a basin typically alters blue water availability in downstream areas furthermore several studies have shown that human induced changes in land and water use e g irrigation greatly shift the total evapotranspiration further affect runoff and blue water consumption wang and hejazi 2011 destouni et al 2013 gordon et al 2005 as estimated in this studies global total crop green water consumption is projected to increase by 11 3 from 4886 km3 year during 1971 2000 to 5400 km3 year in 2070s under both climate and land use change effects increasing crop green water consumption would occupy blue water availability for humans which would consequently intensify local water scarcity conditions for example many regions have suffered from severe water scarcity e g middle east north china central asia and western us where local water availability can t fully satisfy human water demand vörösmarty et al 2010 wada et al 2013a famiglietti 2014 schewe et al 2014 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 veldkamp et al 2017 furthermore there is a rapidly rising trend of crop green and blue water consumption in these hotspot regions as cropland expands driven by growing demands for food and energy and the bwi increases a lot figs 4 5 which would occupy water supply to other sectors e g environment requirement domestic and industrial and break the criterion of the freshwater planetary boundary gerten et al 2013 thus the key challenge will be to invest in strategies for sustainable water consumption in relation to the freshwater planetary boundary conception within the integrated green and blue water framework which is an important aspect of the sustainable development goal for water i e sdg6 furthermore as global food production may need to rise by 50 70 to satisfy the food demand of an extra 2 billion people by 2050 mcintyre et al 2009 resulting in cropland area expansion fig 3 it is important to plan for an integrated climate land water framework to meet future food demand for society as well as reduce pressures on water and land resources rockström et al 2014 one of the most effective measures is to improve water productivity by enhancing soil moisture management and better breeding in crop yield since rainfed agriculture accounts for 80 of the world s total agricultural cropland improving management of green water is very important because upstream management of cropland and green water resources would improve the rainfall partition in a catchment further benefitting blue water availability to the downstream users foley et al 2011 for irrigated land besides large scale water supply enhancement through increasing storage of infrastructure and desalination facilities wada et al 2014a promoting use of waste water and integrating multiple use in irrigation system e g domestic and fisheries would also increase water productivity de fraiture and wichelns 2010 currently 16 of world population depends on food import to cover their demand for crop products fader et al 2013 trading agricultural products from highly productive regions with abundant water resources to water limited regions is helpful to reduce regional agriculture water consumption and reduce the risk of exceeding the freshwater planetary boundary with the growth of global population and associated food demand a fair and efficient global trade will be needed to sustain local food security and achieve the goal of sustainable development and trade agreements are expected to reach at global and regional scale which would promote the development of virtual water trade in addition climate change leads to 8 5 and 14 increase in crop green and blue water consumption respectively fig 6 due to warming in temperature and associated rising evaporation demand wada and bierkens 2014 countries pursuit to achieve their nationally determined contributions ndcs mid century strategies mcss and sdgs will have large implications on the levels of climate impacts and land use changes and their evolutions in the future thus future research should also explore how these forces may affect the co evolution of climate and land systems and how they in turn affect humanity s growing dependence on blue water resources the challenge lies in identifying potential tradeoffs and synergies across these goals to avoid unintended consequences in term of exacerbating water scarcity conditions hejazi et al 2015 5 conclusions in this study a crop water use module is incorporated into gcam system crop specific green and blue water consumption are calculated on monthly time step at global 0 5 0 5 grid scale with the aid of future climate forcing from gcms and land use projections from gcam wherein the future climate and land use conditions are consistent with concurrent socioeconomic and emissions pathways this provides a more comprehensive understanding of changes in global crop water consumption than earlier studies which usually examine this question through the lens of a single factor i e either climate change or land use change or ignore the inherent consistency between climate land and socioeconomics results show that global crop green water consumption is projected to increase by 11 7 from 4886 km3 year in the historical period 1971 2000 to 5460 km3 year by 2090s and the contribution of climate change on global crop green water consumption is larger than that of land use change global crop blue water consumption is projected to increase by 70 3 by the end of this century and expansion in irrigated area is the mainly driver to that in terms of the spatial patterns climate change dominates changes in crop green water consumption in most of regions except in some developing regions e g africa central asia middle east and pakistan where sharp cropland expansion occurs to meet the crop production demand and in some regions with significant cropland shrinkage e g india and eastern africa changes in irrigated area dominates the changes in crop blue water consumption in most of global regions especially in regions with significant irrigated land expansion e g africa central asia china mexico middle east russia south asia and argentina furthermore global crop blue water dependence will increase as the climate change and cropland expansion especially in arid regions in general the results in this study improve our understanding of the potential implications future climate and land use conditions on global agricultural green and blue water consumption which is critical to devise effective adaptation strategies for securing future food and water needs sustainably
