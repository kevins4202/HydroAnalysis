11020,crop water productivity is one of the important aspects of water use of crop most especially where water is a limiting factor this study was carried out to assess and compare water relations and productivity of two lines of pearl millet grown on lysimeters with two soil types the study was carried out at the lysimeter unit of the department of soil crop and climate sciences experimental farm kenilworth university of the free state bloemfontein one row of the unit contains a clovelly soil and the other row bainsvlei soil the two lines of pearl millet used for the study were gci 17 improved variety and monyaloti a local variety irrigation treatments were applied such that water was withheld at the beginning of different growth stages of the crop to impose water stress these treatments were well watered ww vegetative stage stress vs reproductive stage stress rs and grain filling stage stress gs the treatments were replicated two times per line of pearl millet per soil type the results show that the lowest leaf water potential was observed in the gs stress plants for both lines of pearl millet on bainsvlei soil form the highest stomatal conductance observed on clovelly soil was around 400 mmol m 2 s 1 while it was around 300 mmol m 2 s 1 on bainsvlei soil for the two lines of pearl millet the highest and lowest grain yields for gci 17 were from clovelly soil the highest grain yield for monyaloti was 10 74 t ha 1from the ww found on clovelly soil type while the lowest was 3 93 t ha 1 from gs found on bainsvlei soil type the mean water productivity for biomass wpbm of gci 17 was 0 036 t ha 1 mm 1for both soil types while monyaloti had wpbm of 0 037 and 0 035 t ha 1 mm 1 on bainsvlei and clovelly respectively clovelly soil type proved to exhibit high water

productivity with various parameters including water use efficiency wue and water productivity wp water use efficiency is the measure of the conversion ability of water to biomass or grain yield by a crop during the cropping season tanner and sinclair 1983 kunrath et al 2018 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 refer to wue as the marketable crop yield produced per unit actual crop evapotranspiration et the marketable crop yield could be biomass grain or any form of economic yield of a specific crop and et is the sum of soil surface evaporation e and crop transpiration t however there have been lots of criticisms of the term water use efficiency as it is better to use the term water productivity wp one of the reasons is the lack of clarity and large number of different parameters that have been used in the calculation of wue the separation of et into evaporation e and transpiration t shows that t is the only productive amount of water used by the crop water productivity is defined as the biomass produced per unit land area per unit of water transpired steduto et al 2007 edreira et al 2018 in some literature wp is called transpiration efficiency or transpiration use efficiency zhang et al 1998 kunrath et al 2018 khan et al 2019 water productivity is preferred to wue due to the fact that it has been found relatively stable for a particular crop and environment tanner and sinclair 1983 steduto et al 2007 sinclair 2018 khan et al 2019 the concept of wp in relation to pear millet production in semi arid areas is important and may have implications in dry land farming pearl millet is an example of indigenous cereals found mainly in the northern and western part of south africa this crop was indigenised to this area due to many years of cultivation as well as natural and farmer selection however now the production of pearl millet is limited to certain areas that are not considered as cereals producing areas in the country bichard 2002 taylor 2016 pearl millet is called a high energy cereal as it contains higher oil content and protein than maize grains as well as having relatively higher vitamin a content than some of the cereals icrisat 2004 kugbe et al 2015 pearl millet is easy to cultivate and can be grown in arid and semi arid regions where water is often a limiting factor due its drought tolerant attributes naeem et al 2007 santos et al 2017 however it responds very favourably to slight improvements in growing conditions such as supplementary irrigation leisinger et al 1995 one of the way of coping with water stress by pearl millet is through production of recovery leaf growth that supports good grain filling by productive tillers in order to limit the yield losses of the main shoot winkel et al 1997 tadele 2016 planting the crop at a period that will enable the sensitive stages of crop development to avoid the hazards of water stress that can occur during the water stress period of the season de rouw 2004 de rouw and winkel 1998 tadele 2016 little is known about pearl millet response to irrigation from planting through to maturity as it is mostly grown under rain fed conditions there is also insufficient information on the cultivation of pearl millet under the south africa climatic conditions particularly considering their water use and water relations lysimeter studies provide means of simulating actual field conditions but with more accurate measurements this is because lysimeter is exposed to the same environmental conditions as the field study but measurements are more intensive and precise data generated from lysimeter studies are very useful in evaluating the crop performance under various manipulated conditions such as water applications different soil types and conditions and most especially partitioning of evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration therefore the purpose of this study was to assess and compare both the water relations and productivity of two lines of pearl millet grown on lysimeters with two different types of soils 2 material and methods 2 1 facility description and treatments the drainage lysimeter unit is located at the department of soil crop and climate sciences experimental farm kenilworth near bloemfontein located at latitude of 29 02 s and longitude 26 15 e and altitude of 1354 m the facility was constructed in 1999 to investigate the contribution of root accessible water tables towards the irrigation requirements of crops ehlers et al 2003 the mean annual temperature of the area is 15 9 c with an average maximum of 30 8 c during january and 16 8 c during july and an average minimum temperature of 15 3 c during january and 2 0 c in july the mean annual rainfall is 559 mm and the maximum is received in february with 111 mm precipitation the unit has 30 round plastic drainage lysimeters of which 16 were used for this study due to the fact that other lysimeters were already in use each lysimeter is 1 8 m in diameter and 2 m deep and they are buried in two parallel rows one row contains a clovelly soil and the other row bainsvlei soil each horizon of both soils was removed separately and packed in the same order into the lysimeters to reconstruct that specific soil the field capacity fc for the soils were 0 236 mm mm 1 or 425 mm for the clovelly soil profile of 1800 mm and 0 260 mm mm 1 or 468 mm for bainsvlei soil profile of 1800 mm the lower limit ll was calculated to be 0 047 mm mm 1 or 85 mmf for clovelly profile and 0 083 mm mm 1 or 151 for bainsvlei profile of 1800 mm haka 2010 the particle size distribution for the two soils is illustrated in table 1 each lysimeter is equipped with two neutron probe access tubes to a depth of 1900 mm a drip irrigation system with dripper lines installed at the surface of the soil of each lysimeter with equally spaced drippers for uniform application and redistribution of water allows water to be applied manually using 20 litres containers connected to dripper lines soil water was monitored twice a week at 30 cm intervals down to 1800 mm depth with the aid of neutron moisture meter campbell pacific neutron water meter model 503dr a rain shelter was used to exclude rain from the facility during the study period the study was carried out during the 2010 2011 season preparation of the facility started with manual tillage and addition of two bags of compost to the top soil of each tank of the lysimeter unit two lines of pearl millet gci 17 and local variety monyaloti were used for this trial fertilizer was applied before sowing at a rate of 40 kg n ha 1 20 kg p ha 1 and 20 kg k ha 1 by scattering each lysimeter was planted with 15 plants as the stand per tank at the spacing of 90 cm between rows and 20 cm within rows fig 1 weeding was done manually as required the soil surface of each lysimeter was covered with quartz gravel to eliminate soil evaporation after the emergence of plants dlamini et al 2016 irrigation treatments were applied such that water was withheld at the beginning of different growth stages of the crop to impose water stress the treatments are the following ww well watered treatment vs vegetative stage stress rs reproductive stage stress gs grain filling stage stress the treatments were replicated two times per line of pearl millet per soil type soil water content was kept between approximately 30 depletion of plant available water content each lysimeter was irrigated to replenish soil water deficit before or at the point of exceeding the depletion limit while irrigation was withheld for lysimeters under the stress treatments each lysimeter was replenished back to field capacity at the end of each growth stage stress treatment water use of each of the lines of pearl millet grown on each lysimeter was considered to be the amount of transpired water evapotranspiration et is widely considered to be water use by field crops however partitioning of the et into e and t provides the opportunity to quantify the actual amount of water uptake and lost by the crop as transpiration t through the leaves which is the only productive water within the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac therefore for the lysimeter study transpiration was observed as water use by the crop because soil evaporation e was negligible due to the quartz gravel covering the surface soil of the lysimeter transpiration was calculated using eq 1 rainfall p was zero as rainfall was excluded with the aid of rain shelter throughout the study period drainage d and runoff r were zero because the water table was kept constant

pressure chamber pms 600 model pms instrument company albany ny and stomatal conductance with a leaf porometer decagon devices inc pullman wa five leaves that were fully expanded and fully exposed were sampled per treatment the measurements were carried out at midday on sunny days under cloudless conditions during the leaf water potential measurements transparent plastics were used to cover the leaf before cutting to minimize loss of water through transpiration mounting of detached leaves were done within minimum amount of time 30 s to avoid water loss from the point of incision of the leaves pressure was applied slowly until water film started to appear from the point of incision protruding from the pressure chamber lid a magnifying glass was used to view and determine the point in time when water appears on the incision and the pressure reading was taken immediately stomatal conductance measurements were also taken around midday between 12 00 and 14 00 h five fully expanded and fully exposed leaves per treatment were sampled for these measurements all leaves were sampled randomly and at the same upper level on the stem of the plant 2 3 crop parameters 2 3 1 dry matter production yield and yield components crop physiological maturity was identified at a stage when the crop had lost 100 of green colour talukder et al 2014 biomass was only measured at the end of physiological maturity when all the plants in each lysimeter tank for each treatment were harvested as the total aboveground biomass produced the plants were cut by hand sickle above the soil surface in each lysimeter and labelled according to the treatments per lysimeter the plant material collected were oven dried at 65 c for 36 48 hours to determine aboveground dry mass the number of heads were determined by counting before oven drying while harvest index hi were determined by using the equation 2 total heads per lysimeter for each treatment were separated shelled and weighed the grain yields were then converted to total yield per hectare harvest index hi t o t a l g r a i n y i e l d t o t a l a b o v e g r o u n d b i o m a s s 2 2 4 water use and productivity the following parameter was used to evaluate the productivity of the two lines of pearl millets in terms of yield produced by a unit amount of water and on a unit of land area 2 4 1 water productivity wp since transpiration is the only productive loss of water by et wp is the measure of the efficient use of transpired water for conversion into biomass or economic yield it is said to be constant for a given crop and climatic condition de wit 1958 hanks 1983 tanner and sinclair 1983 w p y t 3 where y can be grain yield or total biomass at harvest and t is cumulative transpiration all wp are in t ha 1 mm 1while et is in mm 2 5 statistical analysis data collected from all the experiments were statistically analysed with the aid of statistical analysis system sas program 9 2 package for windows v8 statistical analysis system institute inc 1999 2010 means were compared using the least significant difference lsd test at a probability level of 5 using the duncan multiple range tests empirical relationships of the parameters were also derived using regression procedures 3 results and discussion 3 1 application of irrigation the total irrigation amount supplied during the trial shows that the two lines of pearl millet cultivated on bainsvlei soil require less water than when cultivated on clovelly soil under the no stress condition ww table 2 this may be due to the higher clay content property of the bainsvlei soil than that of the clovelly soil which increased its water holding capacity ehlers et al 2003 the least amount of water supplied was required in the treatment that was stressed during the grain filling growth stages stress gs for both the forms of soils 3 2 leaf water potential leaf water potential of the two lines of pearl millet was affected by water stress at different growth stages fig 2 leaf water potential declined throughout the study period for all the treatments and the two lines of pearl millet on the two soil forms however the lowest leaf water potential was measured during the gs stress for both lines of pearl millet on bainsvlei soil form this is a reflection of the impact of water stress at this growth stage the rate of decline was occasionally disturbed by changes in soil water status due to application of irrigation water 3 3 stomatal conductance stomatal conductance of the two lines of pearl millet were different for all the treatments for the two types of soil fig 3 the stomatal conductance of the two lines of pearl millet from clovelly were higher than bainsvlei the highest stomatal conductance observed on clovelly soil was around 400 mmol m 2 s 1 while it was around 300 mmol m 2 s 1 on bainsvlei soil for the two lines of pearl millet except for gci 17 plants on lysimeter with clovelly soil at the end of the study stomatal conductance of plants from gs treatment tanks was zero indicating that they were already into senescence at this particular time the big difference between the well watered and gs shows the severity of this water stress at the end of the study the relationship between the stomatal conductance and leaf water potential was determined to investigate the adjustment mechanism of the two lines of pearl millet on the two soil types fig 4 for this purpose data for all the treatments were pooled and two linear trend lines were constructed from this group regression equations from these two lines were used to form a system of simultaneous equations which was used to determine the optimum point for the two variables this procedure was described by cate and nelson 1971 the regression lines illustrated the relationship between the stomatal conductance and leaf water potential according to the levels of water stress sensitivity conditions fig 4 shows that stomatal conductance decreases with decrease in leaf water potential for the two lines of pearl millet on both soil types though the relationship is linear but the stress sensitivity point for the leaf water potential and stomatal conductance determined for the two lines of pearl millet and soil types were different however the determined point is the point that could be identified as adjustment stage for the crop on bainsvlei soil the sensivity point for gci 17 and monyaloti are 98 and 147 m mol m 2 s 1 at the leaf water potential of 2 5 and 2 3 mpa respectively the sensitivity point on clovelly soil is higher than that of bainsvlei soil type the stomatal conductance below 163 and 281 m mol m 2 s 1are the sensitivity points of the gci 17 and monyaloti on the clovelly soil variations in stomatal conductance could be partly explained by changes in plant water supply and loss as a result of soil texture which is the key factor responsible for soil water content peng et al 2015 katerji et al 1997 also observed that soil texture has an influence on stomatal conductance with soil of lower clay content performing better than the rest of the soil engaged in the study the better adjustment was found in clovelly in this study which probably due to its lower clay content than bainsvlei soil type monyaloti has greater adjustment with higher stomatal conductance in reference to higher leaf water potential compare to those of gci 17 during soil drying plants control the stomata aperture to reduce water transpiration even before the water status declines in the root and shoot gaion et al 2018 the sensitive point as a sign of adjustment in the two lines of pearl millet could be explained as the point at which stomata closes to prevent excessive loss of water but maintaining constant leaf water potential to be able to keep the leaf turgid and prevent wilting 3 4 productivity and transpired water use the transpiration t estimated for the two lines of pearl millet from the two soil forms shows that there were significant differences for all the treatments for water use on the two soil forms fig 5 the lowest water use was found in gs treatment for bainsvlei soil tanks irrespective of the two lines of pearl millet though water use by monyaloti plants from rs was lower than that of monyaloti plants from gs treatments on clovelly soil but they were not significantly different the amount of irrigation supplied is in agreement with the low water use of these treatments due to low soil water availability for these two treatments the amount of t by the two lines of pearl millet ranges from 345 to 582 mm table 3 these are the minimum and maximum t for the two soils and were found on the clovelly soil form plants from the ww treatment produced the highest total aboveground biomass and grain yield irrespective of lines of pearl millet and soil forms table 3 this was in accordance with the assumption of the study that the crop from this treatment are not expected to experience any stress during this study and should perform well under no stress condition there was significant difference between the treatments for the number of heads per hectare as a yield component table 3 however it was observed that this component may not be affected by imposition of stress at different growth stages this was due to the fact that there was no clear trend of the effect of stress on this yield component number of heads did not have any positive impact on grain yield as the yield does not follow the pattern of this yield component table 3 the highest grain yields for gci 17 and monyaloti were found in the ww treatment tanks in the monyaloti tanks the highest grain yield was 10 74 t ha 1 from the ww found on clovelly soil type while the lowest was 2 57 t ha 1 from rs found on bainsvlei soil type this observation emphasised the impact of water stress during the reproductive stage on pearl millet production the grain yield reflects the trend of harvest index hi for each treatment on an average hi observed on bainsvlei soil for monyaloti was the smallest across the two lines of pearl millet and the two soil forms also water stress affected water productivity of gci 17 on bainsvlei soil form the gci 17 plants from the rs and gs treatments exhibited similar water productivity wp for biomass wpbm and grain yield wpgy production with 0 036 t ha 1 mm 1and 0 016 t ha 1 mm 1 for both treatments respectively on bainsvlei soil reproductive stress rs resulted in the highest wpgy of 0 016 t ha 1 mm 1 in gci 17 but the lowest wpgy of 0 006 t ha 1 mm 1 in monyaloti on bainsvlei soil in this treatment for monyaloti it was suspected that flower pollination and development might have been affected by the water stress at this stage in cereals apical morphogenesis is sensitive to water deficit water stress during flower induction and inflorescence development leads to a delay in flowering or even to complete inhibition karim and rahman 2015 this study is in accordance with the results from previous studies mahalakshmi and bidinger 1985 marteaua et al 2011 they reported that water stress caused delay in flowering and development of pearl millet and thereby reducing grain number and consequently reduced grain yield it also supports the observation of blum 2005 and fried et al 2019 that water use efficiency of a crop increased as a means of water stress tolerance but it is at the expense of its potential yield the relationships between water use t mm and biomass t ha 1 produced dry mass and grain yields for the two lines of pearl millet on two types of soil are illustrated in fig 6 and table 4 irrespective of the two soil types it can be observed that the relationships between t and produced dry mass or grain yields for the two lines of pearl millet were linear fig 6 confirms that wp irrespective of dry mass or grain yield of monyaloti is higher if cultivated on clovelly than bainsvlei soil type statistically the relationship was significant for total aboveground biomass produced on both soil types for monyaloti while the relationship was only significant for total aboveground biomass produced on bainsvlei soil type by gci 17 table 4 irrespective for both lines of pearl millet when all the aboveground biomass and grain yields were pooled together for each soil form there were significant relationships between t and total aboveground biomass or grain yield table 4 however from the relationships it was observed that the rate of conversion to dry mass or grain yield per unit t in monyaloti is higher than that of gci 17 4 conclusion this study was carried out to investigate water relations and productivity of two lines of pearl millet grown on lysimeter facility with two different soil types water stress was imposed at different growth stages of the two lines of pearl millet the soil type with higher water holding capacity bainsvlei will require lower average irrigation water compare to the one with lower water holding capacity clovelly water stress influenced plant water status of the two lines of pearl millet differently at different growth stages though leaf water potential and stomatal conductance decreased with age of the two lines of the crop but the decrease was aggravated when water stress was imposed during the later stages of the crop growth which falls within the reproductive stages this shows that the two lines of pearl millet are more sensitive to water stress during this stage a relationship was determined between the leaf water potential and stomatal conductance the crop adjustment to the severe water stress condition was observed in pearl millet with a crop under severe water stress condition having lower leaf water potential than the plants under mild water stress at the same stomatal conductance in terms of productivity monyaloti local variety recorded higher water productivity in producing biomass compared to gci 17 in both lines of pearl millet imposition of water stress induced higher water productivity especially in gci 17 plants stressed at grain filling stage this could be a means of coping with water stress crops were able to reduce water use under water stress as a means of coping with water stress thus increasing the water use efficiency clovelly soil type proved to exhibit more water productivity for grain yield most especially for monyaloti the local variety the results from this study will help to understand the performance of pearl millet in relation to water availability considering the semi arid nature of the central region of south africa this will also help in developing and improving decision support tools such as crop model for better advice in terms of optimum production of the crop acknowledgements thanks to water research commission of

pressure chamber pms 600 model pms instrument company albany ny and stomatal conductance with a leaf porometer decagon devices inc pullman wa five leaves that were fully expanded and fully exposed were sampled per treatment the measurements were carried out at midday on sunny days under cloudless conditions during the leaf water potential measurements transparent plastics were used to cover the leaf before cutting to minimize loss of water through transpiration mounting of detached leaves were done within minimum amount of time 30 s to avoid water loss from the point of incision of the leaves pressure was applied slowly until water film started to appear from the point of incision protruding from the pressure chamber lid a magnifying glass was used to view and determine the point in time when water appears on the incision and the pressure reading was taken immediately stomatal conductance measurements were also taken around midday between 12 00 and 14 00 h five fully expanded and fully exposed leaves per treatment were sampled for these measurements all leaves were sampled randomly and at the same upper level on the stem of the plant 2 3 crop parameters 2 3 1 dry matter production yield and yield components crop physiological maturity was identified at a stage when the crop had lost 100 of green colour talukder et al 2014 biomass was only measured at the end of physiological maturity when all the plants in each lysimeter tank for each treatment were harvested as the total aboveground biomass produced the plants were cut by hand sickle above the soil surface in each lysimeter and labelled according to the treatments per lysimeter the plant material collected were oven dried at 65 c for 36 48 hours to determine aboveground dry mass the number of heads were determined by counting before oven drying while harvest index hi were determined by using the equation 2 total heads per lysimeter for each treatment were separated shelled and weighed the grain yields were then converted to total yield per hectare harvest index hi t o t a l g r a i n y i e l d t o t a l a b o v e g r o u n d b i o m a s s 2 2 4 water use and productivity the following parameter was used to evaluate the productivity of the two lines of pearl millets in terms of yield produced by a unit amount of water and on a unit of land area 2 4 1 water productivity wp since transpiration is the only productive loss of water by et wp is the measure of the efficient use of transpired water for conversion into biomass or economic yield it is said to be constant for a given crop and climatic condition de wit 1958 hanks 1983 tanner and sinclair 1983 w p y t 3 where y can be grain yield or total biomass at harvest and t is cumulative transpiration all wp are in t ha 1 mm 1while et is in mm 2 5 statistical analysis data collected from all the experiments were statistically analysed with the aid of statistical analysis system sas program 9 2 package for windows v8 statistical analysis system institute inc 1999 2010 means were compared using the least significant difference lsd test at a probability level of 5 using the duncan multiple range tests empirical relationships of the parameters were also derived using regression procedures 3 results and discussion 3 1 application of irrigation the total irrigation amount supplied during the trial shows that the two lines of pearl millet cultivated on bainsvlei soil require less water than when cultivated on clovelly soil under the no stress condition ww table 2 this may be due to the higher clay content property of the bainsvlei soil than that of the clovelly soil which increased its water holding capacity ehlers et al 2003 the least amount of water supplied was required in the treatment that was stressed during the grain filling growth stages stress gs for both the forms of soils 3 2 leaf water potential leaf water potential of the two lines of pearl millet was affected by water stress at different growth stages fig 2 leaf water potential declined throughout the study period for all the treatments and the two lines of pearl millet on the two soil forms however the lowest leaf water potential was measured during the gs stress for both lines of pearl millet on bainsvlei soil form this is a reflection of the impact of water stress at this growth stage the rate of decline was occasionally disturbed by changes in soil water status due to application of irrigation water 3 3 stomatal conductance stomatal conductance of the two lines of pearl millet were different for all the treatments for the two types of soil fig 3 the stomatal conductance of the two lines of pearl millet from clovelly were higher than bainsvlei the highest stomatal conductance observed on clovelly soil was around 400 mmol m 2 s 1 while it was around 300 mmol m 2 s 1 on bainsvlei soil for the two lines of pearl millet except for gci 17 plants on lysimeter with clovelly soil at the end of the study stomatal conductance of plants from gs treatment tanks was zero indicating that they were already into senescence at this particular time the big difference between the well watered and gs shows the severity of this water stress at the end of the study the relationship between the stomatal conductance and leaf water potential was determined to investigate the adjustment mechanism of the two lines of pearl millet on the two soil types fig 4 for this purpose data for all the treatments were pooled and two linear trend lines were constructed from this group regression equations from these two lines were used to form a system of simultaneous equations which was used to determine the optimum point for the two variables this procedure was described by cate and nelson 1971 the regression lines illustrated the relationship between the stomatal conductance and leaf water potential according to the levels of water stress sensitivity conditions fig 4 shows that stomatal conductance decreases with decrease in leaf water potential for the two lines of pearl millet on both soil types though the relationship is linear but the stress sensitivity point for the leaf water potential and stomatal conductance determined for the two lines of pearl millet and soil types were different however the determined point is the point that could be identified as adjustment stage for the crop on bainsvlei soil the sensivity point for gci 17 and monyaloti are 98 and 147 m mol m 2 s 1 at the leaf water potential of 2 5 and 2 3 mpa respectively the sensitivity point on clovelly soil is higher than that of bainsvlei soil type the stomatal conductance below 163 and 281 m mol m 2 s 1are the sensitivity points of the gci 17 and monyaloti on the clovelly soil variations in stomatal conductance could be partly explained by changes in plant water supply and loss as a result of soil texture which is the key factor responsible for soil water content peng et al 2015 katerji et al 1997 also observed that soil texture has an influence on stomatal conductance with soil of lower clay content performing better than the rest of the soil engaged in the study the better adjustment was found in clovelly in this study which probably due to its lower clay content than bainsvlei soil type monyaloti has greater adjustment with higher stomatal conductance in reference to higher leaf water potential compare to those of gci 17 during soil drying plants control the stomata aperture to reduce water transpiration even before the water status declines in the root and shoot gaion et al 2018 the sensitive point as a sign of adjustment in the two lines of pearl millet could be explained as the point at which stomata closes to prevent excessive loss of water but maintaining constant leaf water potential to be able to keep the leaf turgid and prevent wilting 3 4 productivity and transpired water use the transpiration t estimated for the two lines of pearl millet from the two soil forms shows that there were significant differences for all the treatments for water use on the two soil forms fig 5 the lowest water use was found in gs treatment for bainsvlei soil tanks irrespective of the two lines of pearl millet though water use by monyaloti plants from rs was lower than that of monyaloti plants from gs treatments on clovelly soil but they were not significantly different the amount of irrigation supplied is in agreement with the low water use of these treatments due to low soil water availability for these two treatments the amount of t by the two lines of pearl millet ranges from 345 to 582 mm table 3 these are the minimum and maximum t for the two soils and were found on the clovelly soil form plants from the ww treatment produced the highest total aboveground biomass and grain yield irrespective of lines of pearl millet and soil forms table 3 this was in accordance with the assumption of the study that the crop from this treatment are not expected to experience any stress during this study and should perform well under no stress condition there was significant difference between the treatments for the number of heads per hectare as a yield component table 3 however it was observed that this component may not be affected by imposition of stress at different growth stages this was due to the fact that there was no clear trend of the effect of stress on this yield component number of heads did not have any positive impact on grain yield as the yield does not follow the pattern of this yield component table 3 the highest grain yields for gci 17 and monyaloti were found in the ww treatment tanks in the monyaloti tanks the highest grain yield was 10 74 t ha 1 from the ww found on clovelly soil type while the lowest was 2 57 t ha 1 from rs found on bainsvlei soil type this observation emphasised the impact of water stress during the reproductive stage on pearl millet production the grain yield reflects the trend of harvest index hi for each treatment on an average hi observed on bainsvlei soil for monyaloti was the smallest across the two lines of pearl millet and the two soil forms also water stress affected water productivity of gci 17 on bainsvlei soil form the gci 17 plants from the rs and gs treatments exhibited similar water productivity wp for biomass wpbm and grain yield wpgy production with 0 036 t ha 1 mm 1and 0 016 t ha 1 mm 1 for both treatments respectively on bainsvlei soil reproductive stress rs resulted in the highest wpgy of 0 016 t ha 1 mm 1 in gci 17 but the lowest wpgy of 0 006 t ha 1 mm 1 in monyaloti on bainsvlei soil in this treatment for monyaloti it was suspected that flower pollination and development might have been affected by the water stress at this stage in cereals apical morphogenesis is sensitive to water deficit water stress during flower induction and inflorescence development leads to a delay in flowering or even to complete inhibition karim and rahman 2015 this study is in accordance with the results from previous studies mahalakshmi and bidinger 1985 marteaua et al 2011 they reported that water stress caused delay in flowering and development of pearl millet and thereby reducing grain number and consequently reduced grain yield it also supports the observation of blum 2005 and fried et al 2019 that water use efficiency of a crop increased as a means of water stress tolerance but it is at the expense of its potential yield the relationships between water use t mm and biomass t ha 1 produced dry mass and grain yields for the two lines of pearl millet on two types of soil are illustrated in fig 6 and table 4 irrespective of the two soil types it can be observed that the relationships between t and produced dry mass or grain yields for the two lines of pearl millet were linear fig 6 confirms that wp irrespective of dry mass or grain yield of monyaloti is higher if cultivated on clovelly than bainsvlei soil type statistically the relationship was significant for total aboveground biomass produced on both soil types for monyaloti while the relationship was only significant for total aboveground biomass produced on bainsvlei soil type by gci 17 table 4 irrespective for both lines of pearl millet when all the aboveground biomass and grain yields were pooled together for each soil form there were significant relationships between t and total aboveground biomass or grain yield table 4 however from the relationships it was observed that the rate of conversion to dry mass or grain yield per unit t in monyaloti is higher than that of gci 17 4 conclusion this study was carried out to investigate water relations and productivity of two lines of pearl millet grown on lysimeter facility with two different soil types water stress was imposed at different growth stages of the two lines of pearl millet the soil type with higher water holding capacity bainsvlei will require lower average irrigation water compare to the one with lower water holding capacity clovelly water stress influenced plant water status of the two lines of pearl millet differently at different growth stages though leaf water potential and stomatal conductance decreased with age of the two lines of the crop but the decrease was aggravated when water stress was imposed during the later stages of the crop growth which falls within the reproductive stages this shows that the two lines of pearl millet are more sensitive to water stress during this stage a relationship was determined between the leaf water potential and stomatal conductance the crop adjustment to the severe water stress condition was observed in pearl millet with a crop under severe water stress condition having lower leaf water potential than the plants under mild water stress at the same stomatal conductance in terms of productivity monyaloti local variety recorded higher water productivity in producing biomass compared to gci 17 in both lines of pearl millet imposition of water stress induced higher water productivity especially in gci 17 plants stressed at grain filling stage this could be a means of coping with water stress crops were able to reduce water use under water stress as a means of coping with water stress thus increasing the water use efficiency clovelly soil type proved to exhibit more water productivity for grain yield most especially for monyaloti the local variety

11021,as a central process in the hydrological system and the climate system terrestrial evapotranspiration is a key factor furthering our understanding of the climate change processes knowledge of factors controlling the variability in evapotranspiration is crucial for the prediction of the fate of terrestrial ecosystems under environmental changes based on long term 2005 2014 eddy covariance flux data observed at a rainfed maize site in northeast china the purpose of this study was to clarify the environmental regulation of actual evapotranspiration et and the extent to which the

the rainfed maize site in comparison with 575 169 mm of precipitation prec with an et prec ratio ranging from 0 43 2012 to 1 14 2014 it was revealed that net radiation rn was the primary controlling

et of the maize growing season etgs for dry normal and moist years respectively rn and vpd dominated etgs in an increasing order of dry normal and moist years conversely the effects of lai and ta on etgs followed the opposite trend this indicated that drought may increase the sensitivity of maize et to temperature changes and decrease the sensitivity of maize et to radiation changes in sem

addressed correlations between variables while a few studies such as zhang et al 2016a dealt with the causality and pathways of the effects of these drivers on et so far it s still not very clear about to what extent the climate factors effects on et are direct or indirectly mediated by changes in biotic factors such as leaf area index lai lai is a primary descriptor of vegetation function and structure and is functionally related to the exchange of water energy between vegetation and the atmosphere law et al 2001 liu et al 2016 running 1984 the study of forzieri et al 2018 suggested that a

2014 are shown in fig 1 air temperature ta and rn showed similar single peak curve seasonal patterns in the study years fig 1a d whereas the peak values of rn usually occurred earlier in late june or early july than ta in late july or early august the lowest monthly value of ta was 7 4 c generally occurring in january and the highest monthly ta value was 24 7 c observed in july the mean annual value of ta ranged from 9 30 c in 2012 to 11 06 c in 2007 with the 10 year mean value being 10 30 0 64 standard deviation c which was close to the long term 1985 2014 mean value of 10 07 c rn exhibited relatively larger day to day fluctuations especially during the growing season of maize may september the highest daily mean rn was 249 1 w m 2 observed in july 2009 and the average annually integrated rn over the 10 year period was 2372 172 mj m 2 y 1 most of the precipitation fig 1b e approximately 83 of the annual precipitation fell during the growing season especially in summer from june to august approximately 67 during the study period there were 3 daily precipitation values above 100 mm day 1 however according to the monitoring indices of precipitation extremes qx t 303 2015 put forward by china meteorological administration no extreme precipitation events occurred the longest consecutive dry days during the growing season of each year ranged from 14 to 29 days and 6 out of 10 years occurred in september corresponding to the seasonal distribution of precipitation soil water content swc showed distinct seasonal patterns among the 10 years fig 1b e generally soil water content reached a peak value in middle or late august except during 2009 and 2014 when the peak swc values occurred in mid june and then decreased throughout the remainder of the growing season the seasonal variation of vapor pressure deficit vpd generally exhibited bimodal curves fig 1c f with the first peak in may being higher than the second one in september of each year this indicated that may had the highest atmospheric water demand whereas the peak growing season for maize june and july had a relatively low evaporative demand the highest vpd 2 6 kpa was observed in late may 2013 clear seasonal and inter annual variation was observed for leaf area index lai lai peaks were generally observed in early to mid july fig 1c corresponding to the transition period from the vegetative stage to the reproductive stage in all 10 years lai changed rapidly during the growing season with only a short period at the maximum lai the major environmental difference among the campaign years was the amount of precipitation received and the resulting swc fig 2 annual precipitation was highest in 2012 869 mm 50 higher than the long term mean of 580 mm and lowest in 2014 336 mm 42 lower than the long term mean the mean swc for the growing season of each year ranged from 13 to 28 with an average value of 19 according to fig 2 2006 2008 and 2011 were chosen to represent normal years normal water condition 2012 was chosen to represent a moist year and 2009 and 2014 were chosen to represent dry years 3 2 temporal variability in et daily et increased gradually from february through july and peaked in late july or early august and then decreased to near zero during the winter months fig 3 a the 2010 growing season had a higher peak daily et value 6 31 mm day 1 than values observed in other years when the highest daily et was less than 5 mm day 1 in winter et dominated by weak radiation and low air temperature and the values of et were small normally 0 5 mm day 1 the average daily et values for the maize growing season during 2005 2014 ranged from 1 58 mm day 1 to 2 22 mm day 1 the cumulative values of et and precipitation for each year are shown in fig 3b in 2005 2014 annual et over the maize ecosystem varied from 333 mm 2007 to 444 mm 2005 with an average of 397 35 mm annual precipitation was 575 169 mm on average for 2005 2014 its inter annual variation was large with a coefficient of variance cv of 29 whereas et exhibited a less significant year to year variation during the study period cv 9 as fig 3b shows the cumulative annual et values were lower than the annual precipitation during the study years except in 2014 at this maize site the annual et prec ratio ranged from 0 43 2012 to 1 14 2014 with a mean value of 0 75 a ratio et prec larger than 1 indicates the magnitude of water consumption through evapotranspiration beyond the precipitation that the ecosystem received and this proportion of water could be water storage in deep soil or groundwater conversely in 2010 and 2012 annual rainfall was more than 800 mm and the annual et reached only 399 and 374 mm respectively this indicated that a large proportion of the rainfall ran off or infiltrated into the soil 3 3 environmental controls on et 3 3 1 at daily scale stepwise multiple linear regression was used to identify climatic factors that affected et based on daily data from 2005 to 2014 referring to the previous published studies rn ta ws rh vpd swc and prec were considered in the analysis the regression showed that rn ta vpd and swc explained 67 of the seasonal variation in daily et p 0 001 with rn ta and swc exhibiting significant positive effects and vpd having a negative effect however the model explained a smaller proportion of the seasonal variability in et during the growing season etgs adjusted r2 0 56 further an integration of lai with rn ta vpd and swc could improv the model performance adjusted r2 0 60 to further evaluate how climate factors controlling etgs were modulated by lai sem was used to identify pathways determining the responses of etgs the adjusted sem fig 4 had a close fit with the data χ2 3 38 χ2 df 1 69 p 0 18 agfi 0 99 rmsea 0 02 overall this model explained 60 of the variation in etgs the sem results showed that rn had the strongest effect on etgs and was the primary controlling factor of it followed by lai vpd ta and swc table 1 the total effect of rn lai ta and swc on etgs was positive whereas the total effect of vpd on etgs was negative rn and vpd had significant direct effect on etgs while the direct effects of ta and swc were non significant all four climatic factors had indirect effects on etgs mediated through lai 3 3 2 at annual scale unlike previous research results mackay et al 2007 suyker and verma 2009 wilson and baldocchi 2000 the correlations between annual et and rn vpd ta precipitation lai or growing season length of this maize ecosystem were low with the values of r2 less than 0 15 recent research showed that the occurrence of favorable conditions i e most active hours day had an important effect on the inter annual variability of et zscheischler et al 2016 most active days mad were defined as days when et exceeded a certain high percentile all percentiles of 50 51 99 for daily et were computed over 2005 2014 for each year the number of days that exceeded these percentiles was counted and then the resulting annual counts formed the mad time series of et for each percentile then we conducted a test to determine if there is a close relationship between annual et and most active days mad the correlations for the time series of annual et against each time series of mad showed that the optimal percentile where the correlation reached its maximum was the 79th fig 5 a and it was used to define mad for et of this study site annual et showed significant positive linearity p 0 01 with mad having an r2 value of 0 81 fig 5b this indicated that mad could be used as a robust total predictor of annual et of this maize ecosystem the strong linearity also suggested that mad reduced by 10 days decreased annual et by 26 mm 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of maize et compared with other maize sites peak daily et values of 4 1 6 3 mm day 1 for the maize site in this study were comparable to the values reported for rainfed maize 4 0 5 1 mm day 1 of the weishan site in the north china plain and irrigated maize 6 9 mm day 1 of the pingchuan site in northwest china as shown in table 2 but were smaller than the values reported for irrigated maize in the texas high plains 7 3 mm day 1 and at the yingke site in northwest china 7 8 mm day 1 during the non growing season et mainly resulting from soil evaporation exhibited relatively smaller day to day variation and daily values of et at this maize site were generally less than 0 5 mm day 1 which was similar to values reported for irrigated maize in northwest china zhang et al 2016c approximately 73 10 year average of annual et occurred during the maize growing season total growing season et values 242 340 mm at the study site were in the range of results from rainfed maize sites 212 482 mm but were substantially smaller than the values reported for irrigated maize sites 396 573 mm table 2 it is difficult to conclude that irrigated maize consumed more water through evapotranspiration than did rainfed maize more to date research has focused on irrigated maize and more research is needed on rainfed maize before conclusions are made 4 2 constraints on maize et crop evapotranspiration was controlled by factors such as climate vegetation and soil characteristics alberto et al 2014 for this maize site multiple linear regression showed that the intra annual variability of daily et was primarily controlled by rn sem analysis confirmed the significant relationship between etgs and rn and rn affected et mainly through a direct pathway fig 4 table 1 this suggested that et of the studied maize site was primarily controlled by radiation energy or available energy previous syntheses using eddy covariance measures of et in irrigated maize sites alberto et al 2014 ding et al 2013 zhang et al 2016a reported that rn was the major driving factor of et and had a greater effect on seasonal variability of daily et among the meteorological factors which agrees with our results vegetation especially lai had a significant impact on et li et al 2008 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016b c based on the sem model this study demonstrated that lai played an important role in the evapotranspiration processes its standardized total effect on et was only smaller than rn table 1 furthermore lai mediated the responses of et for environmental change at the study site all the main drivers of et rn vpd ta and swc had indirect influences on et through lai in particular temperature and soil moisture only had indirect effects on et through lai the equilibrium evaporation rate eteq represented the amount of surface available energy obtained eichinger et al 1996 monteith 1981 thus the priestley taylor coefficient α which represented a comparison of actual et to a climatologically expected et ryu et al 2008 could be used to diagnose how biotic factors control daily et relative to the amount of available energy arain et al 2003 eichinger et al 1996 zhang et al 2016c fig 6 shows that α had a significant logarithm relationship with gs under low gs α was low and increased with gs rapidly which indicated that et was greatly influenced by canopy conductance when gs was approximately greater than 11 mm s 1 α increased with gs slowly suggesting that α was insensitive to gs the threshold values of gs were similar to the observations for an irrigated seed maize ecosystem 10 mm s 1 zhang et al 2016c and lower than the observations for an irrigated maize field with mulching 15 20 mm s 1 ding et al 2013 4 3 environmental controls of et under different hydro climatic conditions previous studies showed that the intra annual et variability was dominated by different factors among different climate conditions zhang et al 2016b we hypothesized that the possible pathways through which climatic factors and lai influenced etgs and or the magnitude of these factors effects would be different for different hydro climatic conditions in this study we considered 3 kinds of hydro climatic conditions dry normal and moist which were determined by precipitation and soil moisture see section 3 1 and fig 2 sem analysis showed that the rn ta vpd swc and lai explained 71 67 and 67 of the variation in daily etgs in dry normal and moist years respectively fig 7 the dominated factors for variation in daily etgs were the same being rn ta vpd swc and lai but the pathways and the effects were different among different hydro climatic conditions under all hydro climatic conditions considered in this study dry normal and moist the four climatic factors rn ta vpd and swc had significant indirect effects on etgs mediated by lai but the direct influence pathways differed fig 7 table 3 in normal moist years rn and vpd showed significant direct effects in dry years only rn showed significant direct effect the effects of rn and ta on etgs were positive whereas those of vpd on etgs were negative regarding swc its standardized effects on etgs were positive in normal and moist years whereas they were negative in dry years which may have mainly resulted from the converse seasonal patterns of et and swc during the main growing season june august in dry years fig 1b fig 2a sem results showed that rn was the most important controlling factor for etgs at the study site and the effects increased in the order of dry years normal years moist years table 3 which means the influence of rn on etgs increased with increased water availability the direct effects of vpd on etgs showed the same increasing trend conversely the effects of lai decreased with increasing water availability and the effects of lai on daily etgs variation were relatively lower in moist years medium in normal years and relatively higher in dry years concerning the influence of ta on etgs mediated by lai the effects also showed a decreasing trend with increasing water availability these results indicated that drought may increase the sensitivity of maize et to temperature changes and decrease the sensitivity of maize et to radiation changes 5 conclusions using long term ec flux data of a maize site located in northeast china from 2005 to 2014 seasonal and inter annual patterns of et and its environmental controls were investigated our results showed that rn had the strongest effect on daily et and lai played an important mediating role in the relationship between climate soil variables and etgs the sem models including rn lai vpd ta and swc explained 67 71 of the variability in etgs under different hydro climatic conditions with rn lai and ta showing significant positive effects whereas vpd had a negative effect regarding swc its effect on et during the growing season was positive except for dry years the total effect of rn and the direct effect of vpd on daily etgs increased in the order of dry normal and moist years whereas the effects of lai and ta on daily etgs exhibited a decreasing trend at the annual scale total et ranged from 333 mm to 444 mm with a mean value of 397 35 mm it showed less variability than annual precipitation which ranged from 336 mm to 869 mm this suggested that more rainfall would not result in greater evapotranspiration in this rainfed maize site and et at this site was energy limited rather than being water limited acknowledgements this work is financially supported by the china special

11021,as a central process in the hydrological system and the climate system terrestrial evapotranspiration is a key factor furthering our understanding of the climate change processes knowledge of factors controlling the variability in evapotranspiration is crucial for the prediction of the fate of terrestrial ecosystems under environmental changes based on long term 2005 2014 eddy covariance flux data observed at a rainfed maize site in northeast china the purpose of this study was to clarify the environmental regulation of actual evapotranspiration et and the extent to which the regulatory effects on et are directly or indirectly mediated by changes in biotic factors using the structural equation modeling sem method the results showed that annual total et was 397 35 mm for the rainfed maize site in comparison with 575 169 mm of precipitation prec with an et prec ratio ranging from 0 43 2012 to 1 14 2014 it was revealed that net radiation rn was the primary controlling factor of the maize et followed by leaf area index lai vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature ta and soil water content swc the adjusted sem models explained 71 67 and 67 of the variation in daily et of the maize growing season etgs for dry normal and moist years respectively rn and vpd dominated etgs in an increasing order of dry normal and moist years conversely the effects of lai and ta on etgs followed the opposite trend this indicated that drought may increase the sensitivity of maize et to temperature changes and decrease the sensitivity of maize et to radiation changes in sem analysis lai played an important mediating role in the relationship among climate soil variables and etgs rn vpd ta and swc all had significant indirect effects on etgs mediated through lai at the

evapotranspiration et is a major component of water balance for terrestrial ecosystems which uniquely links water energy and carbon cycles fisher et al 2017 zhou and zhou 2009 as a central process in the hydrological system and the climate system et has substantial influences on weather patterns at the local scale and is a key factor in the elucidation of climate change processes jung et al 2010 suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2017 knowledge of the controlling factors of variability in et and its response to these factors is crucial for the prediction of the fate of terrestrial ecosystems

addressed correlations between variables while a few studies such as zhang et al 2016a dealt with the causality and pathways of the effects of these drivers on et so far it s still not very clear about to what extent the climate factors effects on et are direct or indirectly mediated by changes in biotic factors such as leaf area index lai lai is a primary descriptor of vegetation function and structure and is functionally related to the exchange of water energy between vegetation and the atmosphere law et al 2001 liu et al 2016 running 1984 the study of forzieri et al 2018 suggested that a better representation of the control of lai on the surface energy fluxes could improve our capability to mimic the energy exchanges in land surface models lsms the eddy covariance ec method which can directly measure water vapor and heat fluxes is now widely used to measure et at the ecosystem level baldocchi et al 2001 based on ec flux data and the concurrent measurements of environmental variables researchers have conducted numerous investigations on the variation of maize et and its driving factors herein we take advantages of long term 2005 2014 flux records observed at a rainfed maize site in northeast china 1 to identify the controlling factors of the seasonal variations of daily et and quantify the direct and indirect effects mediated through lai of these factors 2 to compare the controlling mechanisms of daily et across different hydro climatic conditions 3 to examine factors that determine the inter annual variations of et 2 methods 2 1 site description the study

et al 2015 ryu et al 2008 2 5 structural equation modeling we employed the structural equation modeling sem method to analyze the hypothetical pathways of climate and vegetation variable effects on daily et and to elucidate the degree of influence for all factors using amos 21 0 software amos development corporation chicago il usa in this study we first considered a full model that included all possible pathways and then sequentially eliminated non significant pathways according to the p value until we attained the final model adequacy of sem models was determined using χ2 tests p 0 05 adjusted goodness of fit index agfi 0 9 and root mean square error of approximation rmsea 0 05 sem is a multivariate statistical technique that has emerged as a synthesis of path analysis factor analysis and maximum likelihood estimation grace 2006 sem has several advantages over traditional regression analysis e g 1 it allows environmental variables to interact 2 it provides a way to partition the net effect into direct and indirect effects and 3 instead of isolating a single controlling factor from others sem aims to systematically study the effects imposed by multi factors in a holistic manner grace 2006 helman et al 2017 lamb 2008 wang et al 2018 3 results 3 1 environmental and crop conditions seasonal variations in weather conditions at the site for the study period 2005 2014 are shown in fig 1 air temperature ta and rn showed similar single peak curve seasonal patterns in the study years fig 1a d whereas the peak values of rn usually occurred earlier in late june or early july than ta in late july or early august the lowest monthly value of ta was 7 4 c generally occurring in january and the highest monthly ta value was 24 7 c observed in july the mean annual value of ta ranged from 9 30 c in 2012 to 11 06 c in 2007 with the 10 year mean value being 10 30 0 64 standard deviation c which was close to the long term 1985 2014 mean value of 10 07 c rn exhibited relatively larger day to day fluctuations especially during the growing season of maize may september the highest daily mean rn was 249 1 w m 2 observed in july 2009 and the average annually integrated rn over the 10 year period was 2372 172 mj m 2 y 1 most of the precipitation fig 1b e approximately 83 of the annual precipitation fell during the growing season especially in summer from june to august approximately 67 during the study period there were 3 daily precipitation values above 100 mm day 1 however according to the monitoring indices of precipitation extremes qx t 303 2015 put forward by china meteorological administration no extreme precipitation events occurred the longest consecutive dry days during the growing season of each year ranged from 14 to 29 days and 6 out of 10 years occurred in september corresponding to the seasonal distribution of precipitation soil water content swc showed distinct seasonal patterns among the 10 years fig 1b e generally soil water content reached a peak value in middle or late august except during 2009 and 2014 when the peak swc values occurred in mid june and then decreased throughout the remainder of the growing season the seasonal variation of vapor pressure deficit vpd generally exhibited bimodal curves fig 1c f with the first peak in may being higher than the second one in september of each year this indicated that may had the highest atmospheric water demand whereas the peak growing season for maize june and july had a relatively low evaporative demand the highest vpd 2 6 kpa was observed in late may 2013 clear seasonal and inter annual variation was observed for leaf area index lai lai peaks were generally observed in early to mid july fig 1c corresponding to the transition period from the vegetative stage to the reproductive stage in all 10 years lai changed rapidly during the growing season with only a short period at the maximum lai the major environmental difference among the campaign years was the amount of precipitation received and the resulting swc fig 2 annual precipitation was highest in 2012 869 mm 50 higher than the long term mean of 580 mm and lowest in 2014 336 mm 42 lower than the long term mean the mean swc for the growing season of each year ranged from 13 to 28 with an average value of 19 according to fig 2 2006 2008 and 2011 were chosen to represent normal years normal water condition 2012 was chosen to represent a moist year and 2009 and 2014 were chosen to represent dry years 3 2 temporal variability in et daily et increased gradually from february through july and peaked in late july or early august and then decreased to near zero during the winter months fig 3 a the 2010 growing season had a higher peak daily et value 6 31 mm day 1 than values observed in other years when the highest daily et was less than 5 mm day 1 in winter et dominated by weak radiation and low air temperature and the values of et were small normally 0 5 mm day 1 the average daily et values for the maize growing season during 2005 2014 ranged from 1 58 mm day 1 to 2 22 mm day 1 the cumulative values of et and precipitation for each year are shown in fig 3b in 2005 2014 annual et over the maize ecosystem varied from 333 mm 2007 to 444 mm 2005 with an average of 397 35 mm annual precipitation was 575 169 mm on average for 2005 2014 its inter annual variation was large with a coefficient of variance cv of 29 whereas et exhibited a less significant year to year variation during the study period cv 9 as fig 3b shows the cumulative annual et values were lower than the annual precipitation during the study years except in 2014 at this maize site the annual et prec ratio ranged from 0 43 2012 to 1 14 2014 with a mean value of 0 75 a ratio et prec larger than 1 indicates the magnitude of water consumption through evapotranspiration beyond the precipitation that the ecosystem received and this proportion of water could be water storage in deep soil or groundwater conversely in 2010 and 2012 annual rainfall was more than 800 mm and the annual et reached only 399 and 374 mm respectively this indicated that a large proportion of the rainfall ran off or infiltrated into the soil 3 3 environmental controls on et 3 3 1 at daily scale stepwise multiple linear regression was used to identify climatic factors that affected et based on daily data from 2005 to 2014 referring to the previous published studies rn ta ws rh vpd swc and prec were considered in the analysis the regression showed that rn ta vpd and swc explained 67 of the seasonal variation in daily et p 0 001 with rn ta and swc exhibiting significant positive effects and vpd having a negative effect however the model explained a smaller proportion of the seasonal variability in et during the growing season etgs adjusted r2 0 56 further an integration of lai with rn ta vpd and swc could improv the model performance adjusted r2 0 60 to further evaluate how climate factors controlling etgs were modulated by lai sem was used to identify pathways determining the responses of etgs the adjusted sem fig 4 had a close fit with the data χ2 3 38 χ2 df 1 69 p 0 18 agfi 0 99 rmsea 0 02 overall this model explained 60 of the variation in etgs the sem results showed that rn had the strongest effect on etgs and was the primary controlling factor of it followed by lai vpd ta and swc table 1 the total effect of rn lai ta and swc on etgs was positive whereas the total effect of vpd on etgs was negative rn and vpd had significant direct effect on etgs while the direct effects of ta and swc were non significant all four climatic factors had indirect effects on etgs mediated through lai 3 3 2 at annual scale unlike previous research results mackay et al 2007 suyker and verma 2009 wilson and baldocchi 2000 the correlations between annual et and rn vpd ta precipitation lai or growing season length of this maize ecosystem were low with the values of r2 less than 0 15 recent research showed that the occurrence of favorable conditions i e most active hours day had an important effect on the inter annual variability of et zscheischler et al 2016 most active days mad were defined as days when et exceeded a certain high percentile all percentiles of 50 51 99 for daily et were computed over 2005 2014 for each year the number of days that exceeded these percentiles was counted and then the resulting annual counts formed the mad time series of et for each percentile then we conducted a test to determine if there is a close relationship between annual et and most active days mad the correlations for the time series of annual et against each time series of mad showed that the optimal percentile where the correlation reached its maximum was the 79th fig 5 a and it was used to define mad for et of this study site annual et showed significant positive linearity p 0 01 with mad having an r2 value of 0 81 fig 5b this indicated that mad could be used as a robust total predictor of annual et of this maize ecosystem the strong linearity also suggested that mad reduced by 10 days decreased annual et by 26 mm 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of maize et compared with other maize sites peak daily et values of 4 1 6 3 mm day 1 for the maize site in this study were comparable to the values reported for rainfed maize 4 0 5 1 mm day 1 of the weishan site in the north china plain and irrigated maize 6 9 mm day 1 of the pingchuan site in northwest china as shown in table 2 but were smaller than the values reported for irrigated maize in the texas high plains 7 3 mm day 1 and at the yingke site in northwest china 7 8 mm day 1 during the non growing season et mainly resulting from soil evaporation exhibited relatively smaller day to day variation and daily values of et at this maize site were generally less than 0 5 mm day 1 which was similar to values reported for irrigated maize in northwest china zhang et al 2016c approximately 73 10 year average of annual et occurred during the maize growing season total growing season et values 242 340 mm at the study site were in the range of results from rainfed maize sites 212 482 mm but were substantially smaller than the values reported for irrigated maize sites 396 573 mm table 2 it is difficult to conclude that irrigated maize consumed more water through evapotranspiration than did rainfed maize more to date research has focused on irrigated maize and more research is needed on rainfed maize before conclusions are made 4 2 constraints on maize et crop evapotranspiration was controlled by factors such as climate vegetation and soil characteristics alberto et al 2014 for this maize site multiple linear regression showed that the intra annual variability of daily et was primarily

evapotranspiration processes its standardized total effect on et was only smaller than rn table 1 furthermore lai mediated the responses of et for environmental change at the study site all the main

influence of ta on etgs mediated by lai the effects also showed a decreasing trend with increasing water availability these results indicated that drought may increase the sensitivity of maize et to temperature changes and decrease the sensitivity of maize et to radiation changes 5 conclusions using long term ec flux data of a maize site located in northeast china from 2005 to 2014 seasonal and inter annual patterns of et and its environmental controls were investigated our results showed that rn had the strongest effect on daily et and lai played an important mediating role in the

11022,ozonated water has been extensively used in the food industry as an effective sanitizer to prolong the shelf life of fruit and vegetables during the postharvest recently the disinfection of water used in primary production has been a critical point in preventing plant losses during the growing of the crop especially in the nursery crop in this study two different irrigation treatments have been used ozonated water ow 750 mv and electrolyzed water ew 495 mv compared to a control treatment using water without any sanitizer treatment in capsicum seedling plants grown under greenhouse conditions the results showed the control to have the highest ca mg and zn values with respect to the ow and ew treatments however no significant differences were observed in these minerals in the vegetal plant tissue capsicum leaves irrigated with ew and ow showed a minor content in b and na moreover the sanitizing treatments provided plants with a higher number of leaves sanitizer treatments did not affect the net photosynthesis or antioxidant compounds total phenolic compounds nor the vitamin c at day 49 lower dhaa and lipid peroxidation were observed in treated samples a higher catalase activity was measured in ow and ew irrigation treatments compared to the control preventing the lipid peroxidation additionally ow and ew reduced the microbial load in the water e coli and total enterobacteriae and ow reduced the mould and yeast of water and the mesophilic load of capsicum seedlings keywords catalase electrolyzed water lipid peroxidation microbial load ozonated water total polyphenols content 1 introduction ozone o3 is injected into water and is immediately decomposed into potent oxidizer agents hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl anion oh thus increasing its effectiveness and avoiding chemical residues in the plant o3 has been used as an important sanitizer in maintaining the quality of fresh cut fruit and vegetables aguayo et al 2006 2014 additionally the use of o3 has rapidly expanded in plant production to control pathogens in the soil fujiwara et al 2006 and in hydroponic culture graham et al 2011 seedlings are usually grown in a seedbed under controlled climatic conditions in a greenhouse however the water used for irrigation and fertirrigation treatments can be an important source of crop contamination in nursery plants and therefore different treatments such as thermal treatment 95 c 30 s uv c radiation or chlorine have been applied the use of ozonated water in primary production has been on the increase in recent years as it enhances water penetration improves crop resistance against diseases and can also reduce the fertilizers needed for the crop raub et al 2001 allende et al 2015 this type of water has been used as an alternative to chemical disinfectants to control powdery mildew erysiphe cichoracearum and sphaerotheca fuliginea fujiwara et al 2002 however some studies have shown that there can be a negative effect with high atmospheric o3 doses reducing the photosynthetic rate causing water losses increase of maturity rate and damage to flowers cho et al 2011 the o3 gas or its decomposition into reactive oxygen species ros can react with components of the cell wall and plasma membrane generating the ros vegetable cells have two antioxidant defence systems enzymatic or non enzymatic to reduce the excess of ros and maintain the oxidative status the enzymatic defence mechanism of cells includes superoxide dismutases sod catalase and glutathione peroxidase among others on the other hand the non enzymatic defence system consists of the synthesis of ascorbate glutathione phenolic compounds tocopherols and other secondary metabolites sharma et al 2012 eltayeb et al 2006 associated the increase of ascorbic acid content with a higher resistance to o3 in other previous studies the o3 treatments increased the phenolic compound content in banana and pineapple alothman et al 2010 therefore the antioxidant cell input and the cell capacity to regenerate the cell antioxidants could be the key to protecting the cell from the negative effects of o3 consequently suitable doses of o3 could improve plant resistance by stimulating antioxidant and other defence mechanisms kangasjärvi et al 2006 iriti and faoro 2009a a new water treatment with a new way to generate electrolyzed water treatment has recently been used in the industry in order to produce a liquid solution with high oxidant potential which combines hocl as the main active form clo o3 and h2o2 to date there have been few studies on the efficacy of spraying ozonated water and electrolyzed water directly onto plants for controlling the seedling development as well as the plant antioxidant status therefore the goal of this research was to determine if ozonated or new electrolyzed water applied as overhead sprinkler irrigation affects the photosynthesis rate seedling development the antioxidant status and the microbial load in the capsicum seed crop in a commercial nursery under greenhouse conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material growth conditions and disinfection of irrigation water capsicum or capsicum capsicum annuum l plant seeds california type bendigo cv were germinated on 7th february 2017 and grown from 9th february to 4th april in a greenhouse the average temperature in the greenhouse was around 19 9 c at the beginning and 26 2 c at the end of the experiment seeds were grown in poliespan trays with 216 cells seedlings and growing conditions were under the commercial conditions of the company semilleros plantas carthago s l in the campo de cartagena torre pacheco murcia spain irrigation water was taken directly from a common reservoir which was fed with water from different sources well and river three different irrigation treatments were applied control treatment using the water directly from the reservoir electrolyzed water ew and ozonated water ow the ew was generated under an industrial electrolytic cell and reverse osmosis generator biodyozone sob distribuidores s l which produced a liquid solution which was composed of four elements hocl the main compound clo o3 and h2o2 this liquid is obtained by passing water from the reservoir through a salt bin containing vacuum salt softening it and then passing it through a reactor where a patent electrolytic process takes place the concentrated ew solution was stored in a black plastic container and then applied in irrigation or fertirrigation treatments on the other hand ozonated water was generated under an industrial ozone generator cosemar ozono s l using a supply of 95 oxygen generated by an oxygen concentrator pca by the injection of ozone gas into a stainless steel water deposit the water in the deposit came from the common reservoir the generator electrolyzed water and o3 were located in a room watering header situated approximately 400 m from the greenhouse in the three treatments the water was pumped into the irrigation network as needed and was applied by overhead micro sprinkler irrigation in the greenhouse the distance of the sprinkler from the plant was of 0 6 m the redox potential determined in ow was 870 mv in the watering header and around 750 mv in the micro sprinklers with the fertilizer solution which was around 0 35 0 40 ppm of o3 on the other hand ew showed a redox potential around 495 mv in the micro sprinklers with the fertilizer solution and free chlorine around 3 ppm determined in the exit of the micro sprinklers these measurements were taken using a portable analyser hi 96771c hanna instruments spain for each irrigation treatment 27 trays with a total of 5832 plants were used distributed in three replicates of nine trays with 216 seedlings tray trays were 70 cm from the floor and trays from the same treatment were in the same sector of the greenhouse and close to the trays for the rest of treatments 2 2 irrigation treatments irrigation with ew ow or ctrl treatments were applied with automatic aerial micro sprinklers for 20 min 7 l m2 until saturation although the time and frequency of irrigation treatments was determined by the temperature inside the greenhouse the nutrient solution frequency and time of irrigation treatments used are described in the supplementary material 2 3 analysis plant soil and water analyses were performed periodically throughout the development of the plant or only at the end of the experiment depending on the type of analysis 2 3 1 gas exchange plant parameters gas exchange parameters were

previously described by conesa et al 2016 2 3 2 plant development aerial and radicular part at the beginning of the trial nine plants per replicate and treatment were selected to measure the height and the number of leaves every sampling day in the greenhouse another nine plants per replicate and treatment were selected to determine the fresh weight of the aerial part and the development of the radicular part additionally a further nine plants per replicate and treatment were selected for the biochemical analyses plants were transported in a tray by car for 35 km to the upct laboratory to determine the weight of the aerial part 30 holes of 1 5 cm diameter from the leaves of the nine plants were weighed in addition plant density was determined as the proportion of fresh weight and total area of the holes on the other hand the radicular part was carefully cleaned with tap water to remove the substrate excess water on the root system was removed with paper and finally the weight and length of the root system were determined for biochemical analysis the leaves of nine plants per replicate and treatment were frozen with liquid n2 grounded and maintained frozen at 80 c until

not considering the oxidation reaction development in the substrate this fact is not overly important in our experiment since the substrate used in the array presented adequate macronutrients and microelement contents for the period in which the seedlings remained in the tray on the other hand at the end of the experiment the macronutrient and micronutrient content of the plant material was

avoiding any crossover contamination of samples nine plants per replicate and treatment these were placed in sterile bags and transported under refrigerated conditions to the upct laboratory the natural microflora concerned with mesophilic bacteria yeast and mould were analysed in 15 g of capsicum leaf samples by standard enumeration methods mesophilic were pour plated with plate count agar pca scharlau chemie barcelona spain and incubated at 30 c for 48 h yeast and mould were spread plated in a rose bengal agar scharlab barcelona spain and incubated for 3 5 days at 26 c all microbial

order sco 778 2009 sco 2009c salmonella spp were determined according to the normative iso 19 250 2010 iso 2010 2 4 statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova was performed for comparing different treatments and sampling dates at a significance level of p 0 05 using pasw statistics 23 for windows spss inc chicago il usa in some cases when significant differences were observed the tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test was applied 3 results and discussion 3 1 plant gas exchange parameters a similar photosynthesis rate was found in capsicum seedlings without significant differences among irrigation treatments fig 1 a after 37 days capsicum plants treated with ew or ow showed a similar stomatal conductance but higher than the ctrl fig 1b with the ow treatment showing a higher stomatal conductance until the 49th day of cultivation on the other hand no significant differences were observed in transpiration in any of the treatments applied fig 1c similar results have been described in hydroponic tomato plants irrigated with ozonated water 0 5 and 3 ppm where similar values were detected in the net co2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance among the different treatments graham et al 2011 according to this fujiwara and fujii 2002 reported the antifungal properties of ozonated water against mildew in cucumber 4 ppm applied four times in two weeks without affecting the net photosynthesis of cucumber leaves relating photosynthesis with chlorophyll synthesis guo and wang 2017 applied different ozonized water concentrations in brassica campestris ssp chinensis by spraying for 15 days observing an increase in the chlorophyll content at o3 concentrations below 8 ppm 2 ppm increase around 3 4 ppm increase around 14 9 6 ppm increase around 17 7 and 8 ppm increase around 18 2 however the ozonated water at 10 ppm showed a decrease in the chlorophyll content of around 3 31 and also the leaves showed visible damage in our experiment plants did not suffer a reduction in leaf gas exchange of capsicum seedlings when irrigated with ew or ow indicating that the concentration used was low enough to avoid damaging the plant 3 2 plant development plant development was measured through the development of aerial and radicular parts of the capsicum seedlings a higher number of leaves nine leaves were found in plants treated with ow or ew than in control seedlings seven leaves after 56 days of development in the seedbed fig 2 a furthermore the seedling was taller in the ow treatment than in the control fig 2b although no significant differences were observed between ow and ew similarly no changes were found in the foliar density in the irrigation treatments applied fig 2c maybe this similar result among treatments could be explained by the restricted cells volume in poliespan trays standardizing the plant growth ohashi kaneko et al 2009 observed a higher number of flowers and increase in fresh and dry weight of stalk in hydroponically grown tomatoes irrigated with 1 5 ppm of o3 furthermore four week old cabbage seedlings brassica oleracea var capitata f alba fumigated with 70 ppb of o3 for three days before being transplanted into the growing field showed a greater size of rosettes and number of leaves after 3 7 weeks reaching commercial maturity before the control plants without an impact in the productivity or yield in broccoli or cabbage rozpadek et al 2015 however high o3 doses can have a negative effect on the plant and showed a decrease in the fresh weight at the dose of 10 ppm applied daily for 15 days in brassica campestris ssp chinensis guo and wang 2017 on the other hand in the radicular part no significant differences were found in the root weight among irrigation treatments fig 3 a the root length was similar in all irrigation treatments after day 49 until the end of growth in the nursery fig 3b nevertheless it is important to highlight that the seedlings treated with ow showed a higher ratio of root mass versus root length this could be because of a higher number of secondary roots than in the control seedlings fig 4 several researchers have previously demonstrated the non toxic effect of o3 in the radicular system and described that o3 treatment improves the respiration of the roots or decreases the rotting in the root increasing the absorption of nutrients and the biomass production ohashi kaneko et al 2009 on the contrary veronico et al 2017 recently observed an improvement in the radicular system of tomato plants irrigated with o3 10 ppm for four days and they described a negative effect in the growth parameters of tomato plants previously graham et al 2009 reported no effect on the radicular system after treatments of o3 at 10 4 31 2 μmol l but greater concentrations around 62 5 and 125 μmol l caused a reduction in the dry weight of the radicular system of different vegetable species in our experiment plants did not suffer a radicular growth reduction 3 3 macronutrients and micronutrients of substrate and plant the substrate from the poliespan cells tray from capsicum plants irrigated with ow showed a ph 7 50 0 10 slightly higher than the control 7 20 0 10 although without any significant differences with the ew treatment 7 45 0 10 table 1 these differences in the ph could be due to ow and ew reacting with the organic material and producing biodegradable by products nicoletto et al 2017 this organic material could be present in the water used for irrigation in the fertilizer solution or in the substrate additionally the electrical conductivity ec of substrate was higher in the control treatment with respect to ow and ew table 1 on the contrary raub et al 2001 described a ph decrease and increased ec in o3 treatments these changes were attributed to the destruction of organic material becoming more acidic and hydrophilic by o3 and the subsequent release of ions into the soil however in our study the ow treatment showed a contrary effect increasing the ph slightly and decreasing the ec with respect to the control and without significant differences with respect to ew concerning the substrate the control treatment showed the highest concentration in calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na and zinc zn with respect to ow and ew table 1 no differences were found in the rest of the macronutrients and micronutrients analysed from the substrate there was an increase in na in all treatments applied including the control due to the external na input from the water and the fertilizer since the original substrate showed a low na concentration table 1 on the other hand leaves of capsicum seedlings showed a lower na concentration in the treated samples table 2 while the ow leaves showed the lowest content in potassium k and phosphorus p however the highest content in the ca mg and zn foliar concentrations where observed in the ctrl samples and no significant differences were observed between the ow and ew therefore the lowest concentrations in ca mg and zn in the ow and ew substrates did not affect the absorption of these nutrients by the seedlings additionally ow and ew reduced the boron b content in the leaves probably due to the different ph of these treatments with respect to the control and ec since the content of b in the original substrate was low the highest levels detected in the leaves could be explained by the concentration of this element in the water sarafi et al 2018 described a toxic b level when this was more than 250 mg kg 1 d w for leaves of c annuum cv arlequin although similar levels detected in other cultivars showed no toxicity symptoms of b usually described as chlorosis or a significant decrease in mn and zn in the leaves no differences were found in the rest of the macronutrients and micronutrients analysed from the leaves in spite of the differences measured in the content of macronutrients and micronutrients in the substrate and leaves these changes did not affect the vegetative growth and radicular development of capsicum seedlings furthermore the slight increase in ph measured in ow did not affect the absorption and translocation of nutrients in the seedlings 3 4 total phenolic content tpc total phenolic content did not show significant differences among the irrigation treatments applied and at the end of the growth period in the nursery the tpc ranged from 453 51 14 89 in the ctrl to 488 51 35 53in ew fig 5 a phenolic compounds are secondary metabolites which increase under stress mishra et al 2013 the treatment of four week old cabbage and broccoli with o3 for three days before being planted in the field was analysed after 10 weeks when plants reached marketable maturity the broccoli buds increased their vitamin e content and the cabbage buds showed an increase in the anthocyanins and β carotene content rozpadek et al 2015 an enhancement in the content of chicoric acids was also described in radicchio rosso treated with ozone nicoletto et al 2017 in postharvest treatments with electrolyzed water an increase in phenolic compounds has been described as helping to extend the shelf life of blueberries chen et al 2019 3 5 total vitamin c content the total vitamin c content ascorbic acid aa dehydroascorbic acid dhaa did not show significant differences among the treatments applied in capsicum seedlings fig 5b the main form of total vitamin c was aa and no significant changes were observed among treatments aa and total vitamin c showed the lowest values at day 37 however significant differences were observed in the content of dhaa the ow treatment maintained the dhaa content during the growing period while ew showed the lowest dhaa content at day 37 at day 49 the control treatment showed a significant increase in the dhaa content with those samples having the highest dhaa content while no significant differences were observed between ow and ew finally at day 56 no significant differences were observed among irrigation treatments peykanpour et al 2016 described a decrease in vitamin c content as the o3 concentration increased in the ozonated water treatments applied in cucumber the oxidative status of the plant has been correlated with its susceptibility to o3 and the antioxidant capacity of vitamin c depends on the capacity of the cell to regenerate the reduced form ascorbic acid castagna and ranieri 2009 furthermore in our experiment according to these results the capsicum seedlings maintained their redox state of aa dhaa under the different treatments applied 3 6 antioxidant capacity the antioxidant capacity evaluated by the dpph array showed the highest values in ow treatment at day 45 although no significant differences were observed among the treatments in the rest of the days in the capsicum seedlings fig 5c these results are in line with previous research work where an increase in the antioxidant activity was described in plants grown under ozone conditions such as in bean seeds from phaseolus vulgaris l cv borlotto nano lingua di fuoco iriti et al 2009b 3 7 catalase activity throughout the capsicum development catalase activity showed higher values in the ow and ew treatments than the control fig 5d previous studies have reported an increase in catalase activity after o3 exposition mishra et al 2013 veronico et al 2017 catalase increased in cabbage treated with 2 4 6 and 8 ppm of o3 for 15 days but a high dose 10 ppm caused a decrease in catalase activity guo and wang 2017 catalase is a very important enzyme linked to the detoxification process of h2o2 therefore the increase in this enzyme is associated with the neutralization of ros however elevated o3 levels can produce excessive ros affecting the antioxidant capacity of the plant and causing irreversible cellular damage caregnato et al 2013 therefore adequate doses of o3 improve the plant s resistance by increasing the antioxidant compounds and other defence mechanisms such as catalase sandermann et al 1998 in our experiment catalase was the indicator of slight stress in plants under ow and ew irrigation which was able to neutralize ros showing levels of tpc vitamin c and antioxidant capacity similar to the control 3 8 lipid peroxidation the different irrigation treatments applied did not show significant differences in lipid peroxidation except on day 49 where ow and ew showed the lowest values with respect to the control samples fig 6 however other authors have reported that a higher o3 concentration 10 ppm resulted in a higher mda content in tomato plants veronico et al 2017 the lipid peroxidation or oxidation of membrane lipids provokes a loss of membrane functionality sharma et al 2012 therefore to maintain the oxidative status in the cell it is very important to prevent damage and ultimately cell death and the antioxidant system of the cell is a key factor gechev et al 2006 in our experiment the stability of mda levels during the plant development when irrigated with ew or ow would indicate the stability of the membrane as it was free from damage 3 9 microbiological counts in water samples salmonella spp was not detected 1 log u f g 100 m l 1 in any irrigation treatments however e coli was positive in the control 1 03 0 03 log u f c 100 m l 1 but not detected in the ow and ew samples 1 log u f c 100 m l 1 ew and ow were also effective treatments to control the total enterobacteriae 2 68 0 01 log u f c 100 m l 1 and 2 74 0 03 log u f c 100 m l 1 respectively while control water showed higher counts 3 08 0 06 log u f c 100 m l 1 additionally ow showed lower counts in mould and yeast 3 76 0 15 log u f c 100 m l 1 than ew and control 4 05 0 18 log u f c 100 m l 1 and 4 14 0 06 log u f c 100 m l 1 respectively concerning microbial counts determined in plants ow reduced the mesophilic bacteria in capsicum seedling leaves 2 24 0 40 log u f c 100 m l 1 was obtained in ow followed by 2 90 0 13 log u f c 100 m l 1 in control leaves and 2 95 0 13 log u f c 100 m l 1 detected in ew however in moulds no significant differences were observed among irrigation treatments the count was in the range of 2 00 2 30 log u f c 100 m l 1 in agreement with this guo and wang 2017 described ow as an effective disinfectant in the control of pathogenic bacteria since a treatment of ozonated water 0 5 ppm applied in cabbage inactivated erwinia carotovora furthermore the irrigation at 10 4 and 31 2 ppm of ozonated water applied by sprinkling at 0 3 m were both useful in the pathogen and biofilm control in five woody perennial nursery crops graham et al 2009 in our experiment ow and ew did not cause damage in capsicum seedlings additionally capsicum seedlings treated with ow showed higher microbial reductions than the rest of the samples however the results to inhibit microbial counts were limited as compared to those of other authors probably the results could be better if the irrigation treatments had been applied by drip irrigation and not as overhead sprinkler irrigation graham et al 2009 reported around 70 of o3 losses in sprinkling overhead ozonated water irrigation at a height of 0 47 m in addition the root of airing will be higher by drip irrigation since o3 is a superficial treatment whose depth of penetration during the soil moistening is no higher than 2 mm from the surface raub et al 2001 4 conclusion capsicum seedlings did not enhance the antioxidant compounds with ew and ow applied as overhead sprinkler irrigation although an increase in catalase activity was found in these treatments indicating slight stress in the plants ew and in particular ow decreased the microbial load in the water moreover both these sanitizers provided a higher number of leaves in the plant and also in the ow treatment increased the number or mass of secondary roots which could improve the adaptability and yield of seedling plants when they are transplanted into the field both sanitizers and particularly the ow treatment improved capsicum seedling development and microbiological water quality declarations of interest authors declare that there is no conflict of interest

has rapidly expanded in plant production to control pathogens in the soil fujiwara et al 2006 and in hydroponic culture graham et al 2011 seedlings are usually grown in a seedbed under controlled climatic conditions in a greenhouse however the water used for irrigation and fertirrigation treatments can be an important source of crop contamination in nursery plants and therefore different treatments such as thermal treatment 95 c 30 s uv c radiation or chlorine have been applied the use of ozonated water in primary production has been on the increase in recent years as it enhances water penetration improves crop resistance against diseases and can also reduce the fertilizers needed for the crop raub et al 2001 allende et al 2015 this type of water has been used as an alternative to chemical disinfectants to control powdery mildew erysiphe cichoracearum and sphaerotheca fuliginea fujiwara et al 2002 however some studies have shown that there can be a negative effect with high atmospheric o3 doses reducing the photosynthetic rate causing water losses increase of maturity rate and damage to flowers cho et al 2011 the o3 gas or its decomposition into reactive oxygen species ros can react with components of the cell wall and plasma membrane generating the ros vegetable cells have two antioxidant defence systems enzymatic or non enzymatic to reduce the excess of ros and maintain the oxidative status the enzymatic defence mechanism of cells includes superoxide dismutases sod catalase and glutathione peroxidase among others on the other hand the non enzymatic defence system consists of the synthesis of ascorbate glutathione phenolic compounds tocopherols and other secondary metabolites sharma et al 2012 eltayeb et al 2006 associated the increase of ascorbic acid content with a higher resistance to o3 in other previous studies the o3 treatments increased the phenolic compound content in banana and pineapple alothman et al 2010 therefore the antioxidant cell input and the cell capacity to regenerate the cell antioxidants could be the key to protecting the cell from the negative effects of o3 consequently suitable doses of o3 could improve plant resistance by stimulating antioxidant and other defence mechanisms kangasjärvi et al 2006 iriti and faoro 2009a a new water treatment with a new way to generate electrolyzed water treatment has recently been used in the industry in order to produce a liquid solution with high oxidant potential which combines hocl as the main active form clo o3 and h2o2 to date there have been few studies on the efficacy of spraying ozonated water and electrolyzed water directly onto plants for controlling the seedling development as well as the plant antioxidant status therefore the goal of this research was to determine if ozonated or new electrolyzed water applied as overhead sprinkler irrigation affects the photosynthesis rate seedling development the antioxidant status and the microbial load in the capsicum seed crop in a commercial nursery under greenhouse conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material growth conditions and disinfection of irrigation water capsicum or capsicum capsicum annuum l plant seeds california type bendigo cv were germinated on 7th february 2017 and grown from 9th february to 4th april in a greenhouse the average temperature in the greenhouse was around 19 9 c at the beginning and 26 2 c at the end of the experiment seeds were grown in poliespan trays with 216 cells seedlings and growing conditions were under the commercial conditions of the company semilleros plantas carthago s l in the campo de cartagena torre pacheco murcia spain irrigation water was taken directly from a common reservoir which was fed with water from different sources well and river three different irrigation treatments were applied control treatment using the water directly from the reservoir electrolyzed water ew and ozonated water ow the ew was generated under an industrial electrolytic cell and reverse osmosis generator biodyozone sob distribuidores s l which produced a liquid solution which was composed of four elements hocl the main compound clo o3 and h2o2 this liquid is obtained by passing water from the reservoir through a salt bin containing vacuum salt softening it and then passing it through a reactor where a patent electrolytic process takes place the concentrated ew solution was stored in a black plastic container and then applied in irrigation or fertirrigation treatments on the other hand ozonated water was generated under an industrial ozone generator cosemar ozono s l using a supply of 95 oxygen generated by an oxygen concentrator pca by the injection of ozone gas into a stainless steel water deposit the water in the deposit came from the common reservoir the generator electrolyzed water and o3 were located in a room watering header situated approximately 400 m from the greenhouse in the three treatments the water was pumped into the irrigation network as needed and was applied by overhead micro sprinkler irrigation in the greenhouse the distance of the sprinkler from the plant was of 0 6 m the redox potential determined in ow was 870 mv in the watering header and around 750 mv in the micro sprinklers with the fertilizer solution which was around 0 35 0 40 ppm of o3 on the other hand ew showed a redox potential around 495 mv in the micro sprinklers with the fertilizer solution and free chlorine around 3 ppm determined in the exit of the micro sprinklers these measurements were taken using a portable analyser hi 96771c hanna instruments spain for each irrigation treatment 27 trays with a total of 5832 plants were used distributed in three replicates of nine trays with 216 seedlings tray trays were 70 cm from the floor and trays from the same treatment were in the same sector of the greenhouse and close to the trays for the rest of treatments 2 2 irrigation treatments irrigation with ew ow or ctrl treatments were applied with automatic aerial micro sprinklers for 20 min 7 l m2 until saturation although the time and frequency of irrigation treatments was determined by the temperature inside the greenhouse the nutrient solution frequency and time of irrigation treatments used are described in the supplementary material 2 3 analysis plant soil and water analyses were performed periodically throughout the development of the plant or only at the end of the experiment depending on the type of analysis 2 3 1 gas exchange plant parameters gas exchange parameters were

previously described by conesa et al 2016 2 3 2 plant development aerial and radicular part at the beginning of the trial nine plants per replicate and treatment were selected to measure the height and the number of leaves every sampling day in the greenhouse another nine plants per replicate and treatment were selected to determine the fresh weight of the aerial part and the development of the radicular part additionally a further nine plants per replicate and treatment were selected for the biochemical analyses plants were transported in a tray by car for 35 km to the upct laboratory to determine the weight of the aerial part 30 holes of 1 5 cm diameter from the leaves of the nine plants were weighed in addition plant density was determined as the proportion of fresh weight and total area of the holes on the other hand the radicular part was carefully cleaned with tap water to remove the substrate excess water on the root system was removed with paper and finally the weight and length of the root system were determined for biochemical analysis the leaves of nine plants per replicate and treatment were frozen with liquid n2 grounded and maintained frozen at 80 c until

not considering the oxidation reaction development in the substrate this fact is not overly important in our experiment since the substrate used in the array presented adequate macronutrients and microelement contents for the period in which the seedlings remained in the tray on the other hand at the end of the experiment the macronutrient and micronutrient content of the plant material was

avoiding any crossover contamination of samples nine plants per replicate and treatment these were placed in sterile bags and transported under refrigerated conditions to the upct laboratory the natural microflora concerned with mesophilic bacteria yeast and mould were analysed in 15 g of capsicum leaf samples by standard enumeration methods mesophilic were pour plated with plate count agar pca scharlau chemie barcelona spain and incubated at 30 c for 48 h yeast and mould were spread plated in a rose bengal agar scharlab barcelona spain and incubated for 3 5 days at 26 c all microbial

different treatments and sampling dates at a significance level of p 0 05 using pasw statistics 23 for windows spss inc chicago il usa in some cases when significant differences were observed the tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test was applied 3 results and discussion 3 1 plant gas exchange parameters a similar photosynthesis rate was found in capsicum seedlings without significant differences among irrigation treatments fig 1 a after 37 days capsicum plants treated with ew or ow showed a similar stomatal conductance but higher than the ctrl fig 1b with the ow treatment showing a higher stomatal conductance until the 49th day of cultivation on the other hand no significant differences were observed in transpiration in any of the treatments applied fig 1c similar results have been described in hydroponic tomato plants irrigated with ozonated water 0 5 and 3 ppm where similar values were detected in the net co2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance among the different treatments graham et al 2011 according to this fujiwara and fujii 2002 reported the antifungal properties of ozonated water against mildew in cucumber 4 ppm applied four times in two weeks without affecting the net photosynthesis of cucumber leaves relating photosynthesis with chlorophyll synthesis guo and wang 2017 applied different ozonized water concentrations in brassica campestris ssp chinensis by spraying for 15 days observing an increase in the chlorophyll content at o3 concentrations below 8 ppm 2 ppm increase around 3 4 ppm increase around 14 9 6 ppm increase around 17 7 and 8 ppm increase around 18 2 however the ozonated water at 10 ppm showed a decrease in the chlorophyll content of around 3 31 and also the leaves showed visible damage in our experiment plants did not suffer a reduction in leaf gas exchange of capsicum seedlings when irrigated with ew or ow indicating that the concentration used was low enough to avoid damaging the plant 3 2 plant development plant development was measured through the development of aerial and radicular parts of the capsicum seedlings a higher number of leaves nine leaves were found in plants treated with ow or ew than in control seedlings seven leaves after 56 days of development in the seedbed fig 2 a furthermore the seedling was taller in the ow treatment than in the control fig 2b although no significant differences were observed between ow and ew similarly no changes were found in the foliar density in the irrigation treatments applied fig 2c maybe this similar result among treatments could be explained by the restricted cells volume in poliespan trays standardizing the plant growth ohashi kaneko et al 2009 observed a higher number of flowers and increase in fresh and dry weight of stalk in hydroponically grown tomatoes irrigated with 1 5 ppm of o3 furthermore four week old cabbage seedlings brassica oleracea var capitata f alba fumigated with 70 ppb of o3 for three days before being transplanted into the growing field showed a greater size of rosettes and number of leaves after 3 7 weeks reaching commercial maturity before the control plants without an impact in the productivity or yield in broccoli or cabbage rozpadek et al 2015 however high o3 doses can have a negative effect on the plant and showed a decrease in the fresh weight at the dose of 10 ppm applied daily for 15 days in brassica campestris ssp chinensis guo and wang 2017 on the other hand in the radicular part no significant differences were found in the root weight among irrigation treatments fig 3 a the root length was similar in all irrigation treatments after day 49 until the end of growth in the nursery fig 3b nevertheless it is important to highlight that the seedlings treated with ow showed a higher ratio of root mass versus root length this could be because of a higher number of secondary roots than in the control seedlings fig 4 several researchers have previously demonstrated the non toxic effect of o3 in the radicular system and described that o3 treatment improves the respiration of the roots or decreases the rotting in the root increasing the absorption of nutrients and the biomass production ohashi kaneko et al 2009 on the contrary veronico et al 2017 recently observed an improvement in the radicular system of tomato plants irrigated with o3 10 ppm for four days and they described a negative effect in the growth parameters of tomato plants previously graham et al 2009 reported no effect on the radicular system after treatments of o3 at 10 4 31 2 μmol l but greater concentrations around 62 5 and 125 μmol l caused a reduction in the dry weight of the radicular system of different vegetable species in our experiment plants did not suffer a radicular growth reduction 3 3 macronutrients and micronutrients of substrate and plant the substrate from the poliespan cells tray from capsicum plants irrigated with ow showed a ph 7 50 0 10 slightly higher than the control 7 20 0 10 although without any significant differences with the ew treatment 7 45 0 10 table 1 these differences in the ph could be due to ow and ew reacting with the organic material and producing biodegradable by products nicoletto et al 2017 this organic material could be present in the water used for irrigation in the fertilizer solution or in the substrate additionally the electrical conductivity ec of substrate was higher in the control treatment with respect to ow and ew table 1 on the contrary raub et al 2001 described a ph decrease and increased ec in o3 treatments these changes were attributed to the destruction of organic material becoming more acidic and hydrophilic by o3 and the subsequent release of ions into the soil however in our study the ow treatment showed a contrary effect increasing the ph slightly and decreasing the ec with respect to the control and without significant differences with respect to ew concerning the substrate the control treatment showed the highest concentration in calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na and zinc zn with respect to ow and ew table 1 no differences were found in the rest of the macronutrients and micronutrients analysed from the substrate there was an increase in na in all treatments applied including the control due to the external na input from the water and the fertilizer since the original substrate showed a low na concentration table 1 on the other hand leaves of capsicum seedlings showed a lower na concentration in the treated samples table 2 while the ow leaves showed the lowest content in potassium k and phosphorus p however the highest content in the ca mg and zn foliar concentrations where observed in the ctrl samples and no significant differences were observed between the ow and ew therefore the lowest concentrations in ca mg and zn in the ow and ew substrates did not affect the absorption of these nutrients by the seedlings additionally ow and ew reduced the boron b content in the leaves probably due to the different ph of these treatments with respect to the control and ec since the content of b in the original substrate was low the highest levels detected in the leaves could be explained by the concentration of this element in the water sarafi et al 2018 described a toxic b level when this was more than 250 mg kg 1 d w for leaves of c annuum cv arlequin although similar levels detected in other cultivars showed no toxicity symptoms of b usually described as chlorosis or a significant decrease in mn and zn in the leaves no differences were found in the rest of the macronutrients and micronutrients analysed from the leaves in spite of the differences measured in the content of macronutrients and micronutrients in the substrate and leaves these changes did not affect the vegetative growth and radicular development of capsicum seedlings furthermore the slight increase in ph measured in ow did not affect the absorption and translocation of nutrients in the seedlings 3 4 total phenolic content tpc total phenolic content did not show significant differences among the irrigation treatments applied and at the end of the growth period in the nursery the tpc ranged from 453 51 14 89 in the ctrl to 488 51 35 53in ew fig 5 a phenolic compounds are secondary metabolites which increase under stress mishra et al 2013 the treatment of four week old cabbage and broccoli with o3 for three days before being planted in the field was analysed after 10 weeks when plants reached marketable maturity the broccoli buds increased their vitamin e content and the cabbage buds showed an increase in the anthocyanins and β carotene content rozpadek et al 2015 an enhancement in the content of chicoric acids was also described in radicchio rosso treated with ozone nicoletto et al 2017 in postharvest treatments with electrolyzed water an increase in phenolic compounds has been described as helping to extend the shelf life of blueberries chen et al 2019 3 5 total vitamin c content the total vitamin c content ascorbic acid aa dehydroascorbic acid dhaa did not show significant differences among the treatments applied in capsicum seedlings fig 5b the main form of total vitamin c was aa and no significant changes were observed among treatments aa and total vitamin c showed the lowest values at day 37 however significant differences were observed in the content of dhaa the ow treatment maintained the dhaa content during the growing period while ew showed the lowest dhaa content at day 37 at day 49 the control treatment showed a significant increase in the dhaa content with those samples having the highest dhaa content while no significant differences were observed between ow and ew finally at day 56 no significant differences were observed among irrigation treatments peykanpour et al 2016 described a decrease in vitamin c content as the o3 concentration increased in the ozonated water treatments applied in cucumber the oxidative status of the plant has been correlated with its susceptibility to o3 and the antioxidant capacity of vitamin c depends on the capacity of the cell to regenerate the reduced form ascorbic acid castagna and ranieri 2009 furthermore in our experiment according to these results the capsicum seedlings maintained their redox state of aa dhaa under the different treatments applied 3 6 antioxidant capacity the antioxidant capacity evaluated by the dpph array showed the highest values in ow treatment at day 45 although no significant differences were observed among the treatments in the rest of the days in the capsicum seedlings fig 5c these results are in line with previous research work where an increase in the antioxidant activity was described in plants grown under ozone conditions such as in bean seeds from phaseolus vulgaris l cv borlotto nano lingua di fuoco iriti et al 2009b 3 7 catalase activity throughout the capsicum development catalase activity showed higher values in the ow and ew treatments than the control fig 5d previous studies have reported an increase in catalase activity after o3 exposition mishra et al 2013 veronico et al 2017 catalase increased in cabbage treated with 2 4 6 and 8 ppm of o3 for 15 days but a high dose 10 ppm caused a decrease in catalase activity guo and wang 2017 catalase is a very important enzyme linked to the detoxification process of h2o2 therefore the increase in this enzyme is associated with the neutralization of ros however elevated o3 levels can produce excessive ros affecting the antioxidant capacity of the plant and causing irreversible cellular damage caregnato et al 2013 therefore adequate doses of o3 improve the plant s resistance by increasing the antioxidant compounds and other defence mechanisms such as catalase sandermann et al 1998 in our experiment catalase was the indicator of slight stress in plants under ow and ew irrigation which was able to neutralize ros showing levels of tpc vitamin c and antioxidant capacity similar to the control 3 8 lipid peroxidation the different irrigation treatments applied did not show significant differences in lipid peroxidation except on day 49 where ow and ew showed the lowest values with respect to the control samples fig 6 however other authors have reported that a higher o3 concentration 10 ppm resulted in a higher mda content in tomato plants veronico et al 2017 the lipid peroxidation or oxidation of membrane lipids provokes a loss of membrane functionality sharma et al 2012 therefore to maintain the oxidative status in the cell it is very important to prevent damage and ultimately cell death and the antioxidant system of the cell is a key factor gechev et al 2006 in our experiment the stability of mda levels during the plant development when irrigated with ew or ow would indicate the stability of the membrane as it was free from damage 3 9 microbiological counts in water samples salmonella spp was not detected 1 log u f g 100 m l 1 in any irrigation treatments however e coli was positive in the control 1 03 0 03 log u f c 100 m l 1 but not detected in the ow and ew samples 1 log u f c 100 m l 1 ew and ow were also effective treatments to control the total enterobacteriae 2 68 0 01 log u f c 100 m l 1 and 2 74 0 03 log u f c 100 m l 1 respectively while control water showed higher counts 3 08 0 06 log u f c 100 m l 1 additionally ow showed lower counts in mould and yeast 3 76 0 15 log u f c 100 m l 1 than ew and control 4 05 0 18 log u f c 100 m l 1 and 4 14 0 06 log u f c 100 m l 1 respectively concerning microbial counts determined in plants ow reduced the mesophilic bacteria in capsicum seedling leaves 2 24 0 40 log u f c 100 m l 1 was obtained in ow followed by 2 90 0 13 log u f c 100 m l 1 in control leaves and 2 95 0 13 log u f c 100 m l 1 detected in ew however in moulds no significant differences were observed among irrigation treatments the count was in the range of 2 00 2 30 log u f c 100 m l 1 in agreement with this guo and wang 2017 described ow as an effective disinfectant in the control of pathogenic bacteria since a treatment of ozonated water 0 5 ppm applied in cabbage inactivated erwinia carotovora furthermore the irrigation at 10 4 and 31 2 ppm of ozonated water applied by sprinkling at 0 3 m were both useful in the pathogen and biofilm control in five woody perennial nursery crops graham et al 2009 in our experiment ow and ew did not cause damage in capsicum seedlings additionally capsicum seedlings treated with ow showed higher microbial reductions than the rest of the samples however the results to inhibit microbial counts were limited as compared to those of other authors probably the results could be better if the irrigation treatments had been applied by drip irrigation and not as overhead sprinkler irrigation graham et al 2009 reported around 70 of o3 losses in sprinkling overhead ozonated water irrigation at a height of 0 47 m in addition the root of airing will be higher by drip irrigation since o3 is a superficial treatment whose depth of penetration during the soil moistening is no higher than 2 mm from the surface raub et al 2001 4 conclusion capsicum seedlings did not enhance the antioxidant compounds with ew and ow applied as overhead sprinkler irrigation although an increase in catalase activity was found in these treatments indicating slight stress in the plants ew and in particular ow decreased the microbial load in the water moreover both these sanitizers provided a higher number of leaves in the plant and also in the ow treatment increased the number or mass of secondary roots which could improve the adaptability and yield of seedling plants when they are transplanted into the field both sanitizers and particularly the ow treatment improved capsicum seedling development and microbiological water quality declarations of interest authors declare that there is no conflict of interest

11023,the natural environment of corn crops is being affected by climate changes this research is aimed at evaluating the climate change scenarios resulting from the downscaling using the eta regional climate model nested in the global model canesm2 and assessing the consequences of climate changes in the runoff and root water uptake of corn crops in the region of parana brazil this research also describes the climatology and the possible changes in the climate of the area according to the different emission scenarios and infer how these changes will affect the dynamics of water in the corn crop in the region simulated by hydrus model simulations comprise of the historical period 1981 2005 and the future projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 between the years 2046 to 2070 eta model nested with the global model canesm2 presented high ability to reproduce the climate in the region simulations showed changes in precipitation and an increasing trend of maximum and minimum temperatures when compared with the baseline the root water uptake showed increasing trends predominantly in the rcp8 5 scenario these climate changes can strongly affect corn production in the region of parana brazil as it can lead to increasing runoff and runoff extremes runoff above 100 mm day this situation poses a risk to crop production since it causes losses by leaching and destruction of plants as well as other factors such as lack of aeration and increased incidence of plant diseases similarly the projected increase in temperature can result in increased evapotranspiration which affects root water uptake and the crop water demand keywords hydrus model eta model climate change 1 introduction many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc solomon 2007 in the 20th century the earth experienced an increase in temperature of approximately 0 65 c changes in temperature are also expected in the future in research conducted by kalnay and cai 2003 they concluded that the temperature may rise to 0 088 c per decade o neill et al 2017 presented the reasons for concern regarding climate change risks they presented the conceptual basis and the risk judgments made in the ipcc report confirming those judgments through literature and identifying their limitations rogelj et al 2012 estimated the temperature increase 2090 2099 above the pre industrial levels based on for four rcps rcp3 pd rcp4 5 rcp6 rcp8 5 and they concluded that the increase range is from 1 5 c up to 4 6 c also it is expected that due to global warming more extreme events related to droughts floods and heat waves will occur more often salati et al 2004 global and regional climate models gcm s and rcm s respectively have been used as a tool to evaluate the impacts of climate changes in different sectors like agriculture health industry and others regional models incorporate higher resolution topography which helps to represent the effects of orographic phenomena on the spatial distribution of the rain in the area of interest and reduce problems due to the coarse horizontal resolution initial and boundary conditions and the representation of surface processes however these models may present some errors due to the parametrization necessary in these models and due to the streamline equations to describe a chaotic system the primary economic activity in brazil is agriculture according to food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao in 2016 brazil was ranked as the third biggest country in maize production just behind the united states and china fao 2018 in this context the state of parana has a significant influence over this production considering that is the area with the highest production in brazil seab 2018 furthermore the corn yield in parana is higher than the average yield in brazil and has been increasing over the years fig 1 despite the improvements in technology used in agriculture the climate has considerable influence on crop productivity and profitability the influence of precipitation and evapotranspiration seems to be even more

changes impacts on food security and water availability in russia between 2020 and 2070s and concluded that food production might be affected by the increase of average water availability and frequency of high runoff events due to the desire to achieve precise and timely research outcomes computational models become an essential tool for the prevention of environmental impacts miranda et al 2005 and to assess the risk that climate presents to crops by theoretically describing the physical processes occurring in the soil combined with numerical techniques to solve the resulting equations and adequate computational resources it is possible to predict the risk and impacts that climate change can cause in the soil water and plants in this context the hydrus model is often used to simulate hydrological variables such as runoff and root water uptake among others simunek et al 2005 to evaluate soil water dynamics it is necessary to have available local parameters of soil culture and climate also most researches are made using climate data with low horizontal resolution which does not have a good capacity to represent the regional effects of climate change therefore this paper was aimed to evaluate the climate scenarios given by eta regional climate model and the effects of climate change on runoff and root water uptake of corn crops in the region of parana brazil this region is part of a critical zone that has important impacts on corn production in brazil in addition we intend to describe the climatology and the possible changes in climate in the region according to different projection scenarios and infer how these changes will affect the dynamics of water in corn crop in the area 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and observed data the study area is composed of 7 cities in parana state brazil fig 2 these cities were selected based on the available meteorological observed data source instituto nacional de meteorologia inmet in the region and their importance in the brazilian corn production the observational daily data includes the variables precipitation mm maximum and minimum temperature ºc mean wind velocity m s and relative humidity this data used to study the regional climatology and to evaluate the climate model the period of analysis was from 1981 to 2005 2 2 eta climate model the eta model is a regional model and therefore requires global models to provide information on the atmosphere in the lateral contours for eta in rcm mode the reliability over simulations for high resolution depends on the quality of the lateral boundary condition and on the ability of the regional model to develop realistic features of this climate chou et al 2000 2002 regional models incorporate higher resolution topography which helps to represent the effects of orographic phenomena on the spatial distribution of the rain in the area of interest in the dynamical downscaling technique regional climate models rcm s reduce problems due to the coarse horizontal resolution initial and boundary conditions and the representation of surface processes the eta model mesinger et al 1988 black 1994 has a complex representation of the physical and dynamic processes of the atmosphere including explicitly mesoscale processes a particularity of the model is the use of the vertical eta ƞ coordinate mesinger 1984 considered more suitable for simulations in regions of complex and steep topography such as the andes region and the brazilian highlands antico et al 2017 seluchi et al 2003 the eta model version to generate projections of climate change scenarios over brazil were carried out by pesquero et al 2010 chou et al 2012 and marengo et al 2012 chou et al 2014 and lyra et al 2017 performed integrations of future climate ipcc ar5 scenarios with the eta model driven by cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 global climate models the downscaling was produced in the spatial resolution of 20 km these simulations and projections of future climate were used in the third brazilian communication of the united nations framework convention on climate change mcti 2016 and had been used to provide support several impact studies tavares et al 2018 viola et al 2015 in this research the eta model was driven by the global climate model canesm2 arora et al 2011 chylek et al 2011 arora and boer 2010 outputs in the horizontal resolution of 20 km called from now on as eta canesm the canesm2 canadian model system second generation model from the canadian center for climate modeling and analysis cccma is a junction of the cancm4 ocean atmosphere coupled model with the terrestrial carbon cycle and dynamic vegetation model ctem canadian terrestrial ecosystem model future climate integrations using this model were based on concentrations of greenhouse gases ghg and their radiative forcing in the climate known as representative concentration pathway rcp moss et al 2010 rcp s are the concentration scenarios proposed by the ipcc and consist of different trajectories of ghg concentration constructed from socioeconomic models that evaluated in an integrated way the demographic growth land use and new technologies of energy generation as an example the rcp8 5 is the trajectory in which the concentration of ghgs continuously increases in the atmosphere over the years and reaches a change in the radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere of about 8 5 wm 2 at the end of the 21st century the baseline period of simulation was taken from 1981 to 2005 and the future projections of climate change were taken from 2046 to 2070 two scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used in this study the meteorological variables used from the eta model outputs were precipitation relative humidity 10 m wind solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature this data is used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics in the hydrus model considering projected climate scenarios 2 3 hydrus model according to rienzner et al 2013 water fluxes in the unsaturated zone affect water status development and production of crops water movements can be described in the unsaturated zone using mathematical models based on different approaches to implementing the numerical solution of the richards differential equation gandolfi et al 2006 kroes and van dam 2003 simunek et al 2005 while necessary for plant water demand the investigation of groundwater dynamics of water and its redistribution within the soil and root zone is complex because it involves processes that depend on the soil type and plant characteristics howell 2001 garrigues et al 2006 shah et al 2007 soil hydraulic properties depth to the water table soil moisture content infiltration root morphology and plant physiological status strongly control water uptake at the root zone scale and consequently the productivity according to hallema et al 2014 soil water dynamics depends on the local weather precipitation solar radiation temperature and the wind vegetation distribution of the root system growth stage soil characteristics texture soil type porosity and upstream drainage area the hydrus model based on the use of finite elements is used to simulate the movement of water solutes and heat in the soil simunek et al 2005 it requires a knowledge of the soil properties atmospheric and boundary conditions the impacts of climate change on soil water dynamics was evaluated considering fields planted with corn crops from meteorological station or climate models it was necessary to obtain specific meteorological data that will be used as an input for the mathematical model used to describe soil water dynamics for hydrus information was needed on 1 solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 2 relative humidity 3 average maximum and minimum temperature c and k 4 rainfall cm and 5 wind speed km day 1 some research evaluated the accuracy of hydrus model melo and louzada 2013 leterme and mallants 2011 cordeiro et al 2015 the limitations of these studies are mostly related to the regional application and to the fact that those are focused on partial growing seasons also the quality of hydrus model simulations depends on the quality of the input data for this reason the input data from the eta model was previously evaluated hydrus was used to determine daily variations in transpiration corresponding to variations in the potential transpiration rate during the day the potential evapotranspiration et was calculated in hydrus model using the fao recommended penman monteith combination equation monteith 1981 allen et al 1998 the penman monteith approach defines reference evapotranspiration et0 as the rate of evapotranspiration from a hypothetic crop height of 12 cm a fixed canopy resistance of 70 sm 1 and an albedo of 0 23 the hydraulic properties of the soil were described using the van genuchten mualem single porosity model as follows 2 1 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m w h e n h 0 or 2 2 θ h θ s w h e n h 0 2 3 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where h is the air entry value θ s is the saturated water content θ r is the residual water content α m and n are empirical parameters se is the effective water content ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at pressure head h we considered the soil as a hypothetical silty loam soil since is the predominant soil in the study region the parameters used in the hydrus model to describe this soil can be found in table 1 a limitation of this research is the lack of experimental data to calibrate the parameters the letter l indicates the tortuosity parameter dimensionless in the conductivity function eq 2 3 for water flow boundary conditions the upper boundary of the soil surface is the atmosphere the height of the surface water layer increases due to precipitation and reduces due to infiltration and evaporation the water uptake model follows feddes et al 1974 typical values of corn water needs were taken from simunek et al 1996 based on wesseling 1991 and are presented in table 2 according to simunek et al 2005 the parameter hcrita is the minimum allowed pressure head at the soil surface and this value can be activated only by evaporation as long as the pressure head at the soil surface is higher than hcrita the actual evapotranspiration rate is equal to the potential evapotranspiration rate once hcrita value is reached the actual evaporation rate is decreased from the potential value since the soil is then too dry to deliver the potential rate this value is obtained with eq 2 4 2 4 h r e x p h m g r t where hr is the relative humidity decimal g is the gravitational acceleration ms 2 m is the molecular weight of water m mol 1 r is the universal gas constant j mol 1 k 1 t is the absolute temperature k and h is the pressure head m aside from precipitation and hcrita users need to specify the latitude and altitude m and also provide information on the angstrom parameters as the recommended value is 0 25 and bs 0 5 a1 0 9 and b1 0 1 for calculating the effect of cloudiness on longwave radiation cloudiness factors from solar radiation ac and bc were also needed and were set to 1 35 and 0 35 respectively parameters a1 0 34 and b1 0 139 were used for calculating the effect of emissivity on long wave radiation to calculate potential evapotranspiration using penman monteith equations temperature and humidity are measured at considered as 2 m and wind speed at 10 m to complete the model set up the crop data had to be specified this data included crop height used as 150 cm albedo 0 2 lai 2 5 and root depth 120 cm radiation extinction was set to 0 49 in the hydrus the richard s equation includes a term for root water uptake the parameters were specified as recommended in simunek et al 2005 3 results and discussions the following results are divided into the study of the climatology of the region the evaluation of the eta climate model in the baseline period and finally the assessment of the projections of soil water by the hydrus model discussions on the impact of climate changes in the runoff on corn crops in parana brazil are drawn 3 1 climatology of the study area climatology was constructed based on observed data in the region and presented in the boxplot in fig 3 which indicates the variability of the climate conditions in the different locations in parana brazil from 1981 to 2005 fig 3 indicates that the average precipitation is similar in the 7 cities approximately 137 mm although the city of paranaguá showed higher variability indicating the occurrence of extreme events in the area the maximum and minimum temperatures are around 25 9 c and 15 2 c respectively according to the climatology the region does not show maximum temperature higher than 34 c which represents a favorable condition for corn production considering that in the vegetative period and the maturation average daily temperatures higher than 26 c can promote the acceleration of these phases berger 1962 the data shows that the cities of castro irati and ivai indicated lower values of temperature maximum and minimum this pattern is explained by the fact that these cities are located at high altitudes 1008 80 836 95 and 808 00 m respectively fig 3 also indicates that the wind speed is variable according to the study city which is probably related to the local circulations near the meteorological station relative humidity also is showed as a variable with high variability with extremes of 96 9 in paranaguá and 46 4 in maringá from fig 3 it is possible to assess the spatial variability of climate variables but it is difficult to infer if there is any pattern of changes over the years fig 4 indicates the variables in the different locations from 1981 to 2005 it is also presented the tendencies of this variables when significant at a confidence level of 95 calculated using spearman rank correlation as presented in zar 2005 in general the observed data of precipitation indicate a large variation over the years in agreement with the results founded in previous studies in the region silva and guetter 2003 guetter 1998 silva and guetter 2003 evaluated climatic data in paraná state and observed increasing of extreme events of precipitation in several areas gueter 1988 indicated that the region of união da vitória pr has gradually presented an increase in the intensity of daily maximum rainfall since the middle of 1970s on the other hand the author also observed an increase in the drought period in this region regarding the maximum and minimum temperatures there is a significant trend to increase in these variables over the years in some of the cities fig 4 this trend agrees with the results found in several surveys both locally and globally according to sansigolo et al 1992 the southern and southeastern regions of brazil have presented systematic warming since the beginning of the 20th century and this warming may be associated with increasing urbanization venegas et al 1996 1998 also pointed the systematic increase of the temperatures in the atlantic south as a factor to increase the temperature in southern and southeastern regions of brazil when analyzing the wind speed some cities indicate a significant trend in reducing over the years this general trend of decreasing wind speed over the years can be explained by the increase in surface friction given the overall rise of buildings related to the process of urbanization finally observed data from the city of castro indicates that the relative humidity trend over the years tends to increase in the other cities these trends are non significant at 95 of confidence level these trends demonstrated by fig 4 indicate changes in the climate over the years and are essential in the context of climate change the climate variability presented in fig 4 play a very important role in corn production lobell and field 2007 used data from fao to evaluate the global scale climate crop yield relationships and the impacts of recent warming their results indicate that simple measures of growing season temperatures and precipitation explain 30 or more of year to year variations in global average yields they conclude that for maize negative yield impacts for the 1980s and 1990 2002 indicate that recent climate trends have unless addressed through adaptation measures suppressed global yield progress for this crop junior et al 2006 studied the effects that the increases in average temperature and precipitation as presented by ipcc may have on corn production in sao paulo state brazil their indicates that increases in precipitation will not be enough to equalize the impacts due to increases in average temperatures a temperature increase of 5 8 c will decrease the suitability for corn production drastically in spite of soil texture also they estimate that no increase in suitable areas for corn production was observed when increasing the temperature and precipitation 3 2 eta model evaluation the eta model was evaluated by comparing the simulations from 1981 to 2005 and observation of the same period fig 5 shows the correlation mean bias error and mean absolute error between the monthly climatology of the eta model climate simulations and the observed data correlation indicates the meaning of statistical relationships between two or more random variables or observed data values the mean bias error mbe was used in order to show information about the performance of the model in the long term simulation positive values indicate overestimation and negative values indicate underestimation however caution is necessary when using this index as positive values can be canceled by negative values resulting in erroneously low bias values for this reason a good approach is to analyze mbe together with the mean absolute error mae mae accumulate the errors independently of the sign and indicates the distance from the predicted values to the observed values in fig 5 we can identify that the eta model overestimates precipitation around 128 51 mm month in paranaguá and 34 27 mm month in maringá and minimum temperature around 0 8 c in londrina and 2 32 c in campo mourão the eta model errors vary with the location considering other variables in general there is an underestimation of maximum temperature and relative humidity and an overestimation of the wind speed the overestimation of precipitation in eta model it was also founded in lyra et al 2018 the authors evaluated climate change projections over three metropolitan regions in southeast brazil using the eta regional climate model at 5 km resolution the results indicated that over the state of paraná eta model 20 km driven by hadgem2 es tends to overestimate precipitation over 60 mm month in some regions in central and south area of parana and over 300 mm month in the coastal zone the results founded by lyra et al 2018 are in agreement with the errors observed in fig 5 which shows an overestimation of precipitation see bias mostly in the coastal area paranagua station fig 5 also indicates that there is a high correlation between simulated and observed data considering temperatures maximum and minimum in general the relative humidity also presents high correlations regarding precipitation the correlation varies between high and moderate wind speed is the variable with the lowest correlations this fact can be explained by the influence of the microclimate on the wind speed that is the location where the stations are located may be influencing the variable the correlations are positively significant according to student s t test at the 95 significance level not shown except for the ur in paranaguá negatively significant and the wind in paranaguá not significant 3 3 climate projections the changes between the climate scenario rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 2046 2070 and the baseline historical simulation 1981 2005 simulated by the eta model is presented in fig 6 the changes were calculated based on monthly values of climatic variables in the different analyzed locations the tukey significant test was applied at a confidence level of 99 the significant changes were indicated with asterisk in fig 6 fig 6 indicated the changes in the future according to the differences between climate projections rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and the baseline also the percentile of this changes is indicated in the figure fig 6 shows an increase in maximum and minimum temperatures throughout the study region from 1 8 up to 4 8 c considering maximum temperatures and from 2 4 up to 3 3 c for minimum temperatures this increase is significant at a 99 confidence level in terms of percentile of changes the largest increase is in rcp8 5 and occurs in the minimum temperature in general the average changes of maximum temperature is about 9 8 and 15 1 in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and for the minimum temperature is about 15 and 20 the percentile of changes in precipitation varies according to the study location in the cities of castro irati and ivai projections show an increase in precipitation compared to the baseline in both rcps and this change is greater in the rcp4 5 in londrina and maringa it is expected a reduction of precipitation and this reduction is greater in the rcp8 5 the cities campo mourão and paranaguá showed a tendency to increase precipitation in rcp4 5 and a decrease in rcp8 5 it can be seen from the results that rcp8 5 indicates a drier scenario than rcp4 5 it is also worth noting that this change can increase 9 5 in rcp4 5 and decrease of 10 2 in rcp8 5 it is important to highlight the incertainties under the climate projections for example in the region of paranaguá that currently presents a great amount of precipitation see fig 3 the rcp4 5 indicates an average increase of 2857 mm year while the rcp8 5 indicates decreasing of 1657 mm year changes in wind speed are minimal the highest tendency to increase is 5 8 and to decrease is 5 considering absolute values these average changes would represent less than 0 3 m s this same pattern of small changes can also be identified in the solar radiation variable less than 3 w m 2 however the reduction of solar radiation may be associated with changes in cloudiness that can be related to the air pollution volcanic activities among others ramanathan and feng 2009 about relative humidity there is a tendency of decrease in the future comparing to the baseline this decrease is greater in rcp8 5 and can reach 14 2 3 4 hydrus simulations simulations of the dynamic of water using hydrus model were carried out driven by etacanesm output fig 7 shows in the boxplot the runoff simulation in the different locations and scenarios the figure shows that the average values of daily runoff are near zero however there is a considerable number of extreme events pointed out as outliers in fig 7 the blue line indicates the runoff at 100 mm day which corresponds to the 99 99 percentile in the region the number of days when runoff exceeded 100 mm day was 5 in the baseline 9 in the rcp4 5 and 8 in the rcp8 5 future scenario the number of days with runoff above 50 mm day also increase over the years in the simulations this increase is greater in rcp4 5 because in the rcp8 5 scenario the climate is see fig 6 during the baseline period we identified 261 events when runoff exceeded 50 mm day in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this threshold was exceeded 372 and 322 respectively specifically the city of paranagua the city with the highest runoff extremes as showed in fig 7 the number of cases with runoff events above 100 mm day increased from 2 events in the baseline period to 8 and 6 events in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this higher occurrence of runoff extremes may imply leaching of soil nutrients destruction of plants and therefore directly affect corn production in the region the runoff is strongly dependent on the intensity of rainfall fig 8 shows the runoff and precipitation and its variation over the years in the simulations of the historical period and future scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 fig 9 showed the percentile of change of the runoff and root water uptake when the projections of the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were compared to the baseline period results from fig 9 indicates a similar trend of a percentile of changes between precipitation and runoff and between root water uptake and evapotranspiration however it is important to highlight that this trend is non linear and for this reason is important to quantify how changes in climate will reflect in runoff and root water uptake although the trends are similar the percentiles of change are different in magnitude in addition concerning the precipitation for example we had as standard the fact that rcp8 5 is drier than rcp4 5 however considering the runoff the highest percentile of positive significant changes is found in scenario rcp8 5 reaching 33 5 of increasing the rcp8 5 scenario still represents the largest percentile of negative significant changes indicating that in the future the runoff may decrease by about 17 2 this large increase of the percentile of change of runoff 33 5 is worrisome since this increase may result in the decreasing of aeration and increasing of lixiviation and erosion also runoff control is essential to mitigate agricultural water quality problems according to bertol et al 2010 the no till system has been intensively used in the state of paraná brazil and it has increased the nutrients level at the soil surface the authors stated that this has contributed to nutrient losses via runoff and consequently off site water pollution the percentile of changes of the root water uptake is indicated in fig 9 it is identified that this variable tends to increase in the future since the percentile of changes are positive although lower than the percentiles related to the temperatures maximum and minimum it is indicated that root water uptake follows the same temperature pattern with a tendency to increase in the future being this increase more expressive in rcp8 5 taking as an example the city of castro we can verify an increase of 9 5 and 7 5 in future precipitation rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 concerning the baseline which will represent an increase of 31 4 and 33 5 in the occurrence of runoff in the region another example is the paranaguá region in which we observed in rcp4 5 that a 7 6 increase in precipitation could result in a 16 9 increase in runoff however when we analyze only the runoff cases with values above 100 mm day this increase becomes even higher with a percentile of changes of 300 this phenomenon also occurs in the rcp8 5 scenario the increase of 200 runoff above 100 mm day finally it can be concluded that climate changes can strongly affect corn production in the region of parana brazil as it can lead to increased runoff and runoff extremes runoff above 100 mm day this situation poses a risk to the crop since it reflects losses due to leaching and destruction of plants as well as other factors such as lack of aeration and increased incidence of plant diseases likewise the increased temperatures provided by climate change will result in increased evapotranspiration which affects root water uptake thus the increase of root water uptake may result in the need for management changes in the field as a way to meet the water demand of the plants 4 conclusions the downscaling by the eta regional climate model of the canesm global climate model was used as boundary conditions for hydrus model to simulate changes in runoff and root water uptake of corn crops under climate changes scenarios in parana brazil the conclusions are 1 the observed data between 1982 and 2005 showed changes in precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures in the study region 2 eta model downscaling of the canesm runs showed high skill to reproduce the climate of the region according to the correlations between simulated and observed precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures 3 the maximum increase in precipitation was 9 5 in rcp4 5 and the maximum decrease was 10 2 in rcp8 5 when compared to the baseline period projections also indicated an increase in maximum temperature of about 9 8 and 15 1 in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and an increase in minimum temperature of about 15 and 20 the pattern of reduction of relative humidity occurs in both scenarios the changes in wind and solar radiation are minimum 4 the number of days with runoff greater than 100 mm day was 5 in the historical period 9 in rcp4 5 and 8 in rcp8 5 the number of days with runoff above 50 mm day also showed an increase this increase of runoff extremes may imply leaching of soil nutrients destruction of plants and therefore directly affect corn production in the region 5 the percentile of changes of the root water uptake increased in the future particularly in rcp8 5 for example in the city of paranaguá where the precipitation increase of 7 6 in rcp4 5 could result in a 16 9 increase in runoff however with the increase of runoff cases above 100 mm day the root water uptake increase becomes even higher with a change of 300 the increase of root water uptake represents an increase of the water demand by the corn due to the climatic conditions expected in future a contribution of this research is the analysis based on high resolution projections which can better represent the local characteristics of the region and lead to a better skill of climatic extremes than coarse resolution atmospheric projections from global models still the research considered general homogeneous soil conditions which is a limitation as the real soil conditions are not homogeneous and there are variations in the composition and structure that affect the soil water dynamics in a local scale another limitation of this research is that the meteorological station that provides the observed data may not be located in an area that represents the field conditions this fact may influence the results as the urban development changes local conditions as the wind relevant part of the penman monteith equation and the temperature due to the increasing urban heat island effect we conclude that local climate change can affect corn production in the region of parana brazil as it can lead to increased runoff and runoff extremes runoff above 100 mm day this situation poses a threat to the crop since it reflects losses due to leaching and destruction of plants as well as other factors such as lack of aeration and increased incidence of plant diseases pote et al 1996 bundy et al 2001 merten et al 2015 likewise the increased temperatures will result in increased evapotranspiration which affects root water uptake and the crop water demand acknowledgments the authors

11023,the natural environment of corn crops is being affected by climate changes this research is aimed at evaluating the climate change scenarios resulting from the downscaling using the eta regional climate model nested in the global model canesm2 and assessing the consequences of climate changes in the runoff and root water uptake of corn crops in the region of parana brazil this research also describes the climatology and the possible changes in the climate of the area according to the different emission scenarios and infer how these changes will affect the dynamics of water in the corn crop in the region simulated by hydrus model simulations comprise of the historical period 1981 2005 and the future projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 between the years 2046 to 2070 eta model nested with the global model canesm2 presented high ability to reproduce the climate in the region simulations showed changes in precipitation and an increasing trend of maximum and minimum temperatures when compared with the baseline the root water uptake showed increasing trends predominantly in the rcp8 5 scenario these climate changes can strongly affect corn production in the region of parana brazil as it can lead to increasing runoff and runoff extremes runoff above 100 mm day this situation poses a risk to crop production since it causes losses by leaching and destruction of plants as well as other factors such as lack of aeration and increased incidence of plant diseases similarly the projected increase in temperature can result in increased evapotranspiration which affects root water uptake and the crop water demand keywords hydrus model eta model climate change 1 introduction many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc solomon 2007 in the 20th century the earth experienced an increase in temperature of approximately 0 65 c changes in temperature are also expected in the future in research conducted by kalnay and cai 2003 they concluded that the temperature may rise to 0 088 c per decade o neill et al 2017 presented the reasons for concern regarding climate change risks they presented the conceptual basis and the risk judgments made in the ipcc report confirming those judgments through literature and identifying their limitations rogelj et al 2012 estimated the temperature increase 2090 2099 above the pre industrial levels based on for four rcps rcp3 pd rcp4 5 rcp6 rcp8 5 and they concluded that the increase range is from 1 5 c up to 4 6 c also it is expected that due to global warming more extreme events related to droughts floods and heat waves will occur more often salati et al 2004 global and regional climate models gcm s and rcm s respectively have been used as a tool to evaluate the impacts of climate changes in different sectors like agriculture health industry and others regional models incorporate higher resolution topography which helps to represent the effects of orographic phenomena on the spatial distribution of the rain in the area of interest and reduce problems due to the coarse horizontal resolution initial and boundary conditions and the representation of surface processes however these models may present some errors due to the parametrization necessary in these models and due to the streamline equations to describe a chaotic system the primary economic activity in brazil is agriculture according to food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao in 2016 brazil was ranked as the third biggest country in maize production just behind the united states and china fao 2018 in this context the state of parana has a significant influence over this production considering that is the area with the highest production in brazil seab 2018 furthermore the corn yield in parana is higher than the average yield in brazil and has been increasing over the years fig 1 despite the improvements in technology used in agriculture the climate has considerable influence on crop productivity and profitability the influence of precipitation and evapotranspiration seems to be even more

equations and adequate computational resources it is possible to predict the risk and impacts that climate change can cause in the soil water and plants in this context the hydrus model is often used to simulate hydrological variables such as runoff and root water uptake among others simunek et al 2005 to evaluate soil water dynamics it is necessary to have available local parameters of soil culture and climate also most researches are made using climate data with low horizontal resolution which does not have a good capacity to represent the regional effects of climate change therefore this paper was aimed to evaluate the climate scenarios given by eta regional climate model and the effects of climate change on runoff and root water uptake of corn crops in the region of parana brazil this region is part of a critical zone that has important impacts on corn production in brazil in addition we intend to describe the climatology and the possible changes in climate in the region according to different projection scenarios and infer how these changes will affect the dynamics of water in corn crop in the area 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and observed data the study area is composed of 7 cities in parana state brazil fig 2 these cities were selected based on the available meteorological observed data source instituto nacional de meteorologia inmet in the region and their importance in the brazilian corn production the observational daily data includes the variables precipitation mm maximum and minimum temperature ºc mean wind velocity m s and relative humidity this data used to study the regional climatology and to evaluate the climate model the period of analysis was from 1981 to 2005 2 2 eta climate model the eta model is a regional model and therefore requires global models to provide information on the atmosphere in the lateral contours for eta in rcm mode the reliability over simulations for high resolution depends on the quality of the lateral boundary condition and on the ability of the regional model to develop realistic features of this climate chou et al 2000 2002 regional models incorporate higher resolution topography which helps to represent the effects of orographic phenomena on the spatial distribution of the rain in the area of interest in the dynamical downscaling technique regional climate models rcm s reduce problems due to the coarse horizontal resolution initial and boundary conditions and the representation of surface processes the eta model mesinger et al 1988 black 1994 has a complex representation of the physical and dynamic processes of the atmosphere including explicitly mesoscale processes a particularity of the model is the use of the vertical eta ƞ coordinate mesinger 1984 considered more suitable for simulations in regions of complex and steep topography such as the andes region and the brazilian highlands antico et al 2017 seluchi et al 2003 the eta model version to generate projections of climate change scenarios over brazil were carried out by pesquero et al 2010 chou et al 2012 and marengo et al 2012 chou et al 2014 and lyra et al 2017 performed integrations of future climate ipcc ar5 scenarios with the eta model driven by cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 global climate models the downscaling was produced in the spatial resolution of 20 km these simulations and projections of future climate were used in the third brazilian communication of the united nations framework convention on climate change mcti 2016 and had been used to provide support several impact studies tavares et al 2018 viola et al 2015 in this research the eta model was driven by the global climate model canesm2 arora et al 2011 chylek et al 2011 arora and boer 2010 outputs in the horizontal resolution of 20 km called from now on as eta canesm the canesm2 canadian model system second generation model from the canadian center for climate modeling and analysis cccma is a junction of the cancm4 ocean atmosphere coupled model with the terrestrial carbon cycle and dynamic vegetation model ctem canadian terrestrial ecosystem model future climate integrations using this model were based on concentrations of greenhouse gases ghg and their radiative forcing in the climate known as representative concentration pathway rcp moss et al 2010 rcp s are the concentration scenarios proposed by the ipcc and consist of different trajectories of ghg concentration constructed from socioeconomic models that evaluated in an integrated way the demographic growth land use and new technologies of energy generation as an example the rcp8 5 is the trajectory in which the concentration of ghgs continuously increases in the atmosphere over the years and reaches a change in the radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere of about 8 5 wm 2 at the end of the 21st century the baseline period of simulation was taken from 1981 to 2005 and the future projections of climate change were taken from 2046 to 2070 two scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used in this study the meteorological variables used from the eta model outputs were precipitation relative humidity 10 m wind solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature this data is used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics in the hydrus model considering projected climate scenarios 2 3 hydrus model according to rienzner et al 2013 water fluxes in the unsaturated zone affect water status development and production of crops water movements can be described in the unsaturated zone using mathematical models based on different approaches to implementing the numerical solution of the richards differential equation gandolfi et al 2006 kroes and van dam 2003 simunek et al 2005 while necessary for plant water demand the investigation of groundwater dynamics of water and its redistribution within the soil and root zone is complex because it involves processes that depend on the soil type and plant characteristics howell 2001 garrigues et al 2006 shah et al 2007 soil hydraulic properties depth to the water table soil moisture content infiltration root morphology and plant physiological status strongly control water uptake at the root zone scale and consequently the productivity according to hallema et al 2014 soil water dynamics depends on the local weather precipitation solar radiation temperature and the wind vegetation distribution of the root system growth stage soil characteristics texture soil type porosity and upstream drainage area the hydrus model based on the use of finite elements is used to simulate the movement of water solutes and heat in the soil simunek et al 2005 it requires a knowledge of the soil properties atmospheric and boundary conditions the impacts of climate change on soil water dynamics was evaluated considering fields planted with corn crops from meteorological station or climate models it was necessary to obtain specific meteorological data that will be used as an input for the mathematical model used to describe soil water dynamics for hydrus information was needed on 1 solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 2 relative humidity 3 average maximum and minimum temperature c and k 4 rainfall cm and 5 wind speed km day 1 some research evaluated the accuracy of hydrus model melo and louzada 2013 leterme and mallants 2011 cordeiro et al 2015 the limitations of these studies are mostly related to the regional application and to the fact that those are focused on partial growing seasons also the quality of hydrus model simulations depends on the quality of the input data for this reason the input data from the eta model was previously evaluated hydrus was used to determine daily variations in transpiration corresponding to variations in the potential transpiration rate during the day the potential evapotranspiration et was calculated in hydrus model using the fao recommended penman monteith combination equation monteith 1981 allen et al 1998 the penman monteith approach defines reference evapotranspiration et0 as the rate of evapotranspiration from a hypothetic crop height of 12 cm a fixed canopy resistance of 70 sm 1 and an albedo of 0 23 the hydraulic properties of the soil were described using the van genuchten mualem single porosity model as follows 2 1 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m w h e n h 0 or 2 2 θ h θ s w h e n h 0 2 3 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where h is the air entry value θ s is the saturated water content θ r is the residual water content α m and n are empirical parameters se is the effective water content ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at pressure head h we considered the soil as a hypothetical silty loam soil since is the predominant soil in the study region the parameters used in the hydrus model to describe this soil can be found in table 1 a limitation of this research is the lack of experimental data to calibrate the parameters the letter l indicates the tortuosity parameter dimensionless in the conductivity function eq 2 3 for water flow boundary conditions the upper boundary of the soil surface is the atmosphere the height of the surface water layer increases due to precipitation and reduces due to infiltration and evaporation the water uptake model follows feddes et al 1974 typical values of corn water needs were taken from simunek et al 1996 based on wesseling 1991 and are presented in table 2 according to simunek et al 2005 the parameter hcrita is the minimum allowed pressure head at the soil surface and this value can be activated only by evaporation as long as the pressure head at the soil surface is higher than hcrita the actual evapotranspiration rate is equal to the potential evapotranspiration rate once hcrita value is reached the actual evaporation rate is decreased from the potential value since the soil is then too dry to deliver the potential rate this value is obtained with eq 2 4 2 4 h r e x p h m g r t where hr is the relative humidity decimal g is the gravitational acceleration ms 2 m is the molecular weight of water m mol 1 r is the universal gas constant j mol 1 k 1 t is the absolute temperature k and h is the pressure head m aside from precipitation and hcrita users need to specify the latitude and altitude m and also provide information on the angstrom parameters as the recommended value is 0 25 and bs 0 5 a1 0 9 and b1 0 1 for calculating the effect of cloudiness on longwave radiation cloudiness factors from solar radiation ac and bc were also needed and were set to 1 35 and 0 35 respectively parameters a1 0 34 and b1 0 139 were used for calculating the effect of emissivity on long wave radiation to calculate potential evapotranspiration using penman monteith equations temperature and humidity are measured at considered as 2 m and wind speed at 10 m to complete the model set up the crop data had to be specified this data included crop height used as 150 cm albedo 0 2 lai 2 5 and root depth 120 cm radiation extinction was set to 0 49 in the hydrus the richard s equation includes a term for root water uptake the parameters were specified as recommended in simunek et al 2005 3 results and discussions the following results are divided into the study of the climatology of the region the evaluation of the eta climate model in the baseline period and finally the assessment of the projections of soil water by the hydrus model discussions on the impact of climate changes in the runoff on corn crops in parana brazil are drawn 3 1 climatology of the study area climatology was constructed based on observed data in the region and presented in the boxplot in fig 3 which indicates the variability of the climate conditions in the different locations in parana brazil from 1981 to 2005 fig 3 indicates that the average precipitation is similar in the 7 cities approximately 137 mm although the city of paranaguá showed higher variability indicating the occurrence of extreme events in the area the maximum and minimum temperatures are around 25 9 c and 15 2 c respectively according to the climatology the region does not show maximum temperature higher than 34 c which represents a favorable condition for corn production considering that in the vegetative period and the maturation average daily temperatures higher than 26 c can promote the acceleration of these phases berger 1962 the data shows that the cities of castro irati and ivai indicated lower values of temperature maximum and minimum this pattern is explained by the fact that these cities are located at high altitudes 1008 80 836 95 and 808 00 m respectively fig 3 also indicates that the wind speed is variable according to the study city which is probably related to the local circulations near the meteorological station relative humidity also is showed as a variable with high variability with extremes of 96 9 in paranaguá and 46 4 in maringá from fig 3 it is possible to assess the spatial variability of climate variables but it is difficult to infer if there is any pattern of changes over the years fig 4 indicates the variables in the different locations from 1981 to 2005 it is also presented the tendencies of this variables when significant at a confidence level of 95 calculated using spearman rank correlation as presented in zar 2005 in general the observed data of precipitation indicate a large variation over the years in agreement with the results founded in previous studies in the region silva and guetter 2003 guetter 1998 silva and guetter 2003 evaluated climatic data in paraná state and observed increasing of extreme events of precipitation in several areas gueter 1988 indicated that the region of união da vitória pr has gradually presented an increase in the intensity of daily maximum rainfall since the middle of 1970s on the other hand the author also observed an increase in the drought period in this region regarding the maximum and minimum temperatures there is a significant trend to increase in these variables over the years in some of the cities fig 4 this trend agrees with the results found in several surveys both locally and globally according to sansigolo et al 1992 the southern and southeastern regions of brazil have presented systematic warming since the beginning of the 20th century and this warming may be associated with increasing urbanization venegas et al 1996 1998 also pointed the systematic increase of the temperatures in the atlantic south as a factor to increase the temperature in southern and southeastern regions of brazil when analyzing the wind speed some cities indicate a significant trend in reducing over the years this general trend of decreasing wind speed over the years can be explained by the increase in surface friction given the overall rise of buildings related to the process of urbanization finally observed data from the city of castro indicates that the relative humidity trend over the years tends to increase in the other cities these trends are non significant at 95 of confidence level these trends demonstrated by fig 4 indicate changes in the climate over the years and are essential in the context of climate change the climate variability presented in fig 4 play a very important role in corn production lobell and field 2007 used data from fao to evaluate the global scale climate crop yield relationships and the impacts of recent warming their results indicate that simple measures of growing season temperatures and precipitation explain 30 or more of year to year variations in global average yields they conclude that for maize negative yield impacts for the 1980s and 1990 2002 indicate that recent climate trends have unless addressed through adaptation measures suppressed global yield progress for this crop junior et al 2006 studied the effects that the increases in average temperature and precipitation as presented by ipcc may have on corn production in sao paulo state brazil their indicates that increases in precipitation will not be enough to equalize the impacts due to increases in average temperatures a temperature increase of 5 8 c will decrease the suitability for corn production drastically in spite of soil texture also they estimate that no increase in suitable areas for corn production was observed when increasing the temperature and precipitation 3 2 eta model evaluation the eta model was evaluated by comparing the simulations from 1981 to 2005 and observation of the same period fig 5 shows the correlation mean bias error and mean absolute error between the monthly climatology of the eta model climate simulations and the observed data correlation indicates the meaning of statistical relationships between two or more random variables or observed data values the mean bias error mbe was used in order to show information about the performance of the model in the long term simulation positive values indicate overestimation and negative values indicate underestimation however caution is necessary when using this index as positive values can be canceled by negative values resulting in erroneously low bias values for this reason a good approach is to analyze mbe together with the mean absolute error mae mae accumulate the errors independently of the sign and indicates the distance from the predicted values to the observed values in fig 5 we can identify that the eta model overestimates precipitation around 128 51 mm month in paranaguá and 34 27 mm month in maringá and minimum temperature around 0 8 c in londrina and 2 32 c in campo mourão the eta model errors vary with the location considering other variables in general there is an underestimation of maximum temperature and relative humidity and an overestimation of the wind speed the overestimation of precipitation in eta model it was also founded in lyra et al 2018 the authors evaluated climate change projections over three metropolitan regions in southeast brazil using the eta regional climate model at 5 km resolution the results indicated that over the state of paraná eta model 20 km driven by hadgem2 es tends to overestimate precipitation over 60 mm month in some regions in central and south area of parana and over 300 mm month in the coastal zone the results founded by lyra et al 2018 are in agreement with the errors observed in fig 5 which shows an overestimation of precipitation see bias mostly in the coastal area paranagua station fig 5 also indicates that there is a high correlation between simulated and observed data considering temperatures maximum and minimum in general the relative humidity also presents high correlations regarding precipitation the correlation varies between high and moderate wind speed is the variable with the lowest correlations this fact can be explained by the influence of the microclimate on the wind speed that is the location where the stations are located may be influencing the variable the correlations are positively significant according to student s t test at the 95 significance level not shown except for the ur in paranaguá negatively significant and the wind in paranaguá not significant 3 3 climate projections the changes between the climate scenario rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 2046 2070 and the baseline historical simulation 1981 2005 simulated by the eta model is presented in fig 6 the changes were calculated based on monthly values of climatic variables in the different analyzed locations the tukey significant test was applied at a confidence level of 99 the significant changes were indicated with asterisk in fig 6 fig 6 indicated the changes in the future according to the differences between climate projections rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and the baseline also the percentile of this changes is indicated in the figure fig 6 shows an increase in maximum and minimum temperatures throughout the study region from 1 8 up to 4 8 c considering maximum temperatures and from 2 4 up to 3 3 c for minimum temperatures this increase is significant at a 99 confidence level in terms of percentile of changes the largest increase is in rcp8 5 and occurs in the minimum temperature in general the average changes of maximum temperature is about 9 8 and 15 1 in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and for the minimum temperature is about 15 and 20 the percentile of changes in precipitation varies according to the study location in the cities of castro irati and ivai projections show an increase in precipitation compared to the baseline in both rcps and this change is greater in the rcp4 5 in londrina and maringa it is expected a reduction of precipitation and this reduction is greater in the rcp8 5 the cities campo mourão and paranaguá showed a tendency to increase precipitation in rcp4 5 and a decrease in rcp8 5 it can be seen from the results that rcp8 5 indicates a drier scenario than rcp4 5 it is also worth noting that this change can increase 9 5 in rcp4 5 and decrease of 10 2 in rcp8 5 it is important to highlight the incertainties under the climate projections for example in the region of paranaguá that currently presents a great amount of precipitation see fig 3 the rcp4 5 indicates an average increase of 2857 mm year while the rcp8 5 indicates decreasing of 1657 mm year changes in wind speed are minimal the highest tendency to increase is 5 8 and to decrease is 5 considering absolute values these average changes would represent less than 0 3 m s this same pattern of small changes can also be identified in the solar radiation variable less than 3 w m 2 however the reduction of solar radiation may be associated with changes in cloudiness that can be related to the air pollution volcanic activities among others ramanathan and feng 2009 about relative humidity there is a tendency of decrease in the future comparing to the baseline this decrease is greater in rcp8 5 and can reach 14 2 3 4 hydrus simulations simulations of the dynamic of water using hydrus model were carried out driven by etacanesm output fig 7 shows in the boxplot the runoff simulation in the different locations and scenarios the figure shows that the average values of daily runoff are near zero however there is a considerable number of extreme events pointed out as outliers in fig 7 the blue line indicates the runoff at 100 mm day which corresponds to the 99 99 percentile in the region the number of days when runoff exceeded 100 mm day was 5 in the baseline 9 in the rcp4 5 and 8 in the rcp8 5 future scenario the number of days with runoff above 50 mm day also increase over the years in the simulations this increase is greater in rcp4 5 because in the rcp8 5 scenario the climate is see fig 6 during the baseline period we identified 261 events when runoff exceeded 50 mm day in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this threshold was exceeded 372 and 322 respectively specifically the city of paranagua the city with the highest runoff extremes as showed in fig 7 the number of cases with runoff events above 100 mm day increased from 2 events in the baseline period to 8 and 6 events in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this higher occurrence of runoff extremes may imply leaching of soil nutrients destruction of plants and therefore directly affect corn production in the region the runoff is strongly dependent on the intensity of rainfall fig 8 shows the runoff and precipitation and its variation over the years in the simulations of the historical period and future scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 fig 9 showed the percentile of change of the runoff and root water uptake when the projections of the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were compared to the baseline period results from fig 9 indicates a similar trend of a percentile of changes between precipitation and runoff and between root water uptake and evapotranspiration however it is important to highlight that this trend is non linear and for this reason is important to quantify how changes in climate will reflect in runoff and root water uptake although the trends are similar the percentiles of change are different in magnitude in addition concerning the precipitation for example we had as standard the fact that rcp8 5 is drier than rcp4 5 however considering the runoff the highest percentile of positive significant changes is found in scenario rcp8 5 reaching 33 5 of increasing the rcp8 5 scenario still represents the largest percentile of negative significant changes indicating that in the future the runoff may decrease by about 17 2 this large increase of the percentile of change of runoff 33 5 is worrisome since this increase may result in the decreasing of aeration and increasing of lixiviation and erosion also runoff control is essential to mitigate agricultural water quality problems according to bertol et al 2010 the no till system has been intensively used in the state of paraná brazil and it has increased the nutrients level at the soil surface the authors stated that this has contributed to nutrient losses via runoff and consequently off site water pollution the percentile of changes of the root water uptake is indicated in fig 9 it is identified that this variable tends to increase in the future since the percentile of changes are positive although lower than the percentiles related to the temperatures maximum and minimum it is indicated that root water uptake follows the same temperature pattern with a tendency to increase in the future being this increase more expressive in rcp8 5 taking as an example the city of castro we can verify an increase of 9 5 and 7 5 in future precipitation rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 concerning the baseline which will represent an increase of 31 4 and 33 5 in the occurrence of runoff in the region another example is the paranaguá region in which we observed in rcp4 5 that a 7 6 increase in precipitation could result in a 16 9 increase in runoff however when we analyze only the runoff cases with values above 100 mm day this increase becomes even higher with a percentile of changes of 300 this phenomenon also occurs in the rcp8 5 scenario the increase of 200 runoff above 100 mm day finally it can be concluded that climate changes can strongly affect corn production in the region of parana brazil as it can lead to increased runoff and runoff extremes runoff above 100 mm day this situation poses a risk to the crop since it reflects losses due to leaching and destruction of plants as well as other factors such as lack of aeration and increased incidence of plant diseases likewise the increased temperatures provided by climate change will result in increased evapotranspiration which affects root water uptake thus the increase of root water uptake may result in the need for management changes in the field as a way to meet the water demand of the plants 4 conclusions the downscaling by the eta regional climate model of the canesm global climate model was used as boundary conditions for hydrus model to simulate changes in runoff and root water uptake of corn crops under climate changes scenarios in parana brazil the conclusions are 1 the observed data between 1982 and 2005 showed changes in precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures in the study region 2 eta model downscaling of the canesm runs showed high skill to reproduce the climate of the region according to the correlations between simulated and observed precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures 3 the maximum increase in precipitation was 9 5 in rcp4 5 and the maximum decrease was 10 2 in rcp8 5 when compared to the baseline period projections also indicated an increase in maximum temperature of about 9 8 and 15 1 in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and an increase in minimum temperature of about 15 and 20 the pattern of reduction of relative humidity occurs in both scenarios the changes in wind and solar radiation are minimum 4 the number of days with runoff greater than 100 mm day was 5 in the historical period 9 in rcp4 5 and 8 in rcp8 5 the number of days with runoff above 50 mm day also showed an increase this increase of runoff extremes may imply leaching of soil nutrients destruction of plants and therefore directly affect corn production in the region 5 the percentile of changes of the root water uptake increased in the future particularly in rcp8 5 for example in the city of paranaguá where the precipitation increase of 7 6 in rcp4 5 could result in a 16 9 increase in runoff however with the increase of runoff cases above 100 mm day the root water uptake increase becomes even higher with a change of 300 the increase of root water uptake represents an increase of the water demand by the corn due to the climatic conditions expected in future a contribution of this research is the analysis based on high resolution projections which can better represent the local characteristics of the region and lead to a better skill of climatic extremes than coarse resolution atmospheric projections from global models still the research considered general homogeneous soil conditions which is a limitation as the real soil conditions are not homogeneous and there are variations in the composition and structure that affect the soil water dynamics in a local scale another limitation of this research is that the meteorological station that provides the observed data may not be located in an area that represents the field conditions this fact may influence the results as the urban development changes local conditions as the wind relevant part of the penman monteith equation and the temperature due to the increasing urban heat island effect we conclude that local climate change can affect corn production in the region of parana brazil as it can lead to increased runoff and runoff extremes runoff above 100 mm day this situation poses a threat to the crop since it reflects losses due to leaching and destruction of plants as well as other factors such as lack of aeration and increased incidence of plant diseases pote et al 1996 bundy et al 2001 merten et al 2015 likewise the increased temperatures will result in increased evapotranspiration which affects root water uptake and the crop water demand acknowledgments the authors

11024,urmia lake ul located in the northwest of iran is one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world in recent years most of the lake has been rendered to unusable lands drought and rapid increase in agricultural activities are the most important reasons behind the shrinkage of the lake in this study hydro climatic data landsat satellite images and image processing techniques were used to detect the spatio temporal land cover changes and salinization progress in urmia lake basin ulb between 1975 and 2019 increasing the area of irrigated lands from 1265 km2 in 1975 to 5525 km2 in 2011 in contrast to decreasing the water surface area of ul from 5982 km2 in 1995 to 586 km2 in 2014 and extension of salinization in the basin are the most important and thoughtful results of this study even the agricultural lands in the regions close to the lake have been affected by this environmental problem the climatic conditions have gradually improved after 2014 and the government has released more water from dams to the lake on the other hand the area of irrigated lands has gradually decreased by 12 in the same period as a result of these positive changes the water surface area of the lake has gradually increased over 1000 km2 based on the results of this study both anthropogenic and climatic factors have played a positive role in ul restoration improvement of agricultural

changes and overuse of water resources on ul their results indicated that the exploitation of the lake along with the added salinity from irrigation has caused increasing of soil salinity in the basin leading up to desertification these environmental changes may cause negative impacts such as the spread of diseases destruction of agricultural lands and massive damage to the local economy resulting in mass migration of local people similar to what has happened in the aral sea over the past decades zarghami 2011 unep 2012 aghakouchak et al 2015 satellite data and image processing techniques were

data in an area of 5000 ha close to ul their results indicated an inverse correlation between top soil salinity and distance from the lake sima and tajrishy 2014 used spatial interpolation methods to analyze the spatial heterogeneity and temporal changes of the physiochemical parameters of ul and found seasonal water quality changes alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 investigated the climatic conditions and the main factors behind the drying up of ul they concluded that the impacts of climate change on lake desiccation were about 20 and anthropogenic factors correspond for decline in lake

human induced activities account for shrinkage in the lake by 86 in a recent study khazaei et al 2019 used available hydro climatic and vegetation cover data to explain the main reasons behind the lake desiccation since 2000 their results indicated that human induced activities and increasing vegetation cover in the basin correlates with the lake water level fluctuations however they didn t separate crops from other vegetation cover types and this was one of the limitations of their study most of these studies contributed to the coastline changes of ul and the effects of climate change

agricultural policies along with climate change have had negative impacts on ul environment leading up to salinization and desertification in the basin in this study maximum likelihood classification mlc method was used to monitor land cover changes and agricultural development in the basin vegetation changes and salinization progress were investigated using normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and soil salinity index si respectively in addition to the process of ul desiccation the main factors influencing the lake recovery in recent years have also been studied to evaluate the role of anthropogenic and climatic factors in the lake revitalization 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area urmia lake ul has a surface area ranging between 5000 and 6000 km2 eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 this hypersaline lake is located in the northwest of iran n 37 5 e 45 5 between west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan provinces with a catchment area of 51 876 km2 eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 the size of this basin is approximately 3 of the entire area of iran the basin contains 21 permanent and 39 episodic rivers ghaheri and baghal vayjooee 1999 ul is the largest inland lake of iran and the second largest hypersaline lake in the world eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 zarghami 2011 hassanzadeh et al 2012 more than 6 million people live in ulb and the lake supports housing needs of this people statistical center of iran 2016 ulrp 2017 the agricultural sector accounts for 30 of employment around the lake but its contribution to the economic prosperity of the regions is about 15 ulrp 2017 world bank 2017 there are 102 islands in ul and this lake is home to different species of mammals birds amphibians and reptiles it is an internationally registered protected area and the habitat of artemia urmiana which is a unique bisexual artemia species unep 2012 fig 1 indicates the location map of ul and its basin in iran the geology of the area ranges from pre cambrian to quaternary alipour 2006 by many aspects of chemistry sediments and morphology ul is similar to great salt lake in state of utah in usa eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 saline lakes are susceptible to environmental changes because their properties vary with changes in their hydrologic budgets romero and melack 1996 the lake is divided into northern and southern parts these parts are separated by a causeway that has a 1500 m long bridge allowing little water exchange between the two parts eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 rezvantalab and amrollahi 2011 sima et al 2013 its continental climate has been affected by the surrounding mountains and air temperature usually ranges between 0 c and 20 c in winter and up to 40 c in summer the basin has an average annual precipitation between 200 mm and 300 mm eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 the measured maximum and minimum water elevation of urmia lake were about 1278 386 m and 1270 168 m in june 1995 and september 2014 respectively iran water resources management company 2016 2 2 methodology remote sensing techniques either directly or indirectly are being used to determine soil salinity changes by using the direct approach remote sensing techniques are applied to the terrain surface to examine the crusts or salinity properties of soil in indirect approach biophysical characteristics of vegetation types that are affected by salinity are taken into account soil salinity can also be identified by electrical conductivity of a solution that is extracted from a water saturated soil in agricultural terms saline soils have an electrical conductivity of more than 4 ds decismens per meter at 25 c al khaier 2003 as reported in previous studies abbas and khan 2007 abdul qadir and benni 2010 abbas et al 2013 allbed and kumar 2013 arnous and green 2015 there exists a strong contrast between normal and salt affected salinized soils with respect to their ground surface conditions salt affected soils have a distinctive feature that make it easier to characterize them salt efflorescence when has accumulated over the soil surface by the capillary rise of low quality water this feature is prominent on top of the soil and is easy to capture by satellite data since salt affected soils have a high spectral reflectance metternicht and zinck 2003 especially in the blue band of the visible window their spectral response is higher than normal soils remote sensing technology was used in this study to analyze decadal land cover changes and salinization progress in ulb 2 2 1 image preprocessing landsat satellite data archives of united states geological survey usgs were investigated to choose the most appropriate data containing a low cloud cover percentage less than 10 while obtained in august and april months of different years two landsat frames were needed to cover urmia lake maximum area of about 6000 km2 but at least eight landsat frames were needed to cover all parts of the basin area of 51 876 km2 in this study 150 landsat satellite images dated between 1975 and 2019 were used to identify the land cover changes in the study area radiometric calibration was performed for all satellite images to minimize the radiometric effects and convert digital numbers dns to top of atmospheric toa reflectance values liang 2004 schroeder et al 2006 afterwards atmospheric conditions of all satellite data were conducted using atcor to decrease aerosols clouds their shadows and other atmospheric effects from imagery at satellite reflectance values were converted to ground surface reflectance values in full absolute correction using atcor algorithm shunlin 2004 schroeder et al 2006 then geometric accuracy of each satellite image was checked to ensure accurate pixel based comparison of multi temporal images the steps of satellite images processing are given in fig 2 2 2 2 image processing in the next step eight landsat frames were mosaicked to output images to cover all parts of ulb then maximum likelihood classification mlc method a pixel based classification method was applied to monitor land cover change in ul and development of irrigated lands in the basin levin 1999 foody and mathur 2004 lillesand et al 2008 land use maps of west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan provinces prepared between 2000 and 2003 were used to separate forest and other vegetation cover types from crops the corrected satellite images were interpreted using various interpretation keys such as shape tone texture location and the association mlc was controlled by the analyst in this process training areas which represent different land cover features were selected by the analyst to be input for the classification algorithm mlc algorithm assumes that the histograms of the bands of data have normal distribution and it is based on the probability that a pixel belongs to a particular class lillesand et al 2008 si and ndvi were used for monitoring soil salinity changes and vegetation cover changes in the basin to understand the consequences and threats of drying up of ul the salinity index si is given by 1 s i ρ g r e e n ρ r e d 2 where ρ green and ρ red are ground surface reflectance values of green and red bands respectively with values ranging between 0 and 1 high salinity index si values show high salt affected areas while low values indicate less salt affected areas ahmed and al khafaji 2013 the ndvi is given by 2 n d v i ρ n i r ρ r e d ρ n i r ρ r e d where ρ nir and ρ red are ground surface reflectance values of near infrared and red bands respectively with values ranging between 1 and 1 ndvi is used to identify vegetated areas in the study area ndvi values less than zero refers to non vegetated areas while positive values indicate vegetated lands see table 1 anderson et al 2003 ritter 2006 rawashdeh 2012 usgs 2019 2 2 3 quantitative accuracy assessment more than 500 photos taken from different parts of ul and 1000 ground truth data collected using gps and google earth in august month of 2010 2011 2013 and 2014 were used to check the accuracy of the results quantitative accuracy assessment process was used to evaluate the results of mlc this assessment compares collected ground truth data with classified data it performs a pixel by pixel comparison of the classified data with truth data lillesand et al 2008 the results of this process contain a confusion matrix this matrix can be derived to several measures of accuracy including overall accuracy mapping accuracy producer accuracy user accuracy and kappa co efficient of agreement which are strong estimators of classification accuracy lillesand et al 2008 2 2 4 hydro climatic data analysis the runoff data of 16 rivers including 10 main rivers and 6 minor rivers and meteorological data of 8 synoptic stations urmia tabriz sardasht piranshahr maragheh mahabad khoy and ahar around the lake were used for understanding the climatic conditions in the study area the annual runoff changes were calculated using daily data monthly temperature and precipitation data were used to calculate the annual temperature and precipitation changes in the basin in addition to the negative effects of climate change on the lake desiccation the hydro climatic data were used to evaluate the positive impacts of climatic factors in urmia lake restoration during recent years 3 results in field survey study about 1000 ground truth data collected using gps and google earth and more than 500 photos were used to compare the spectral signature of different land cover types select training areas for classification and check the accuracy of results fig 3 shows the salinization and desertification progress as recorded by sample photos over the past years the body has either dried completely fig 3 b or withdrawn from coastal parts to the center of the lake fig 3 d shrinking water body leaves salt and saline soils that increase albedo and affect the regional climate these dry and saline lands have negative impacts on the air quality of the region as well as the agricultural lands around the lake the wind blowing in different directions causes moving of salt particles in the air these particles are dangerous to human health and other organisms 3 1 land cover changes in urmia lake fig 4 presents the results of mlc in the 45 year period the progress of desertification over urmia lake in august month of different years can be seen in this figure white magenta blue brown and green colors indicate salt salty soil water soil and agricultural bodies respectively the water surface area of urmia lake was estimated about 5412 km2 in 1975 based on the results of this study there were little changes between 1975 and 1990 the water surface area of the lake increased in the 1990s and the lake reached to its maximum area 5982 km2 in 1995 in the study period salt and salty soil bodies increased dramatically between 1995 and 2014 more than 5000 km2 of ul s water body was turned into salt or salty soil bodies water surface area decreased by 32 in 2006 and by 90 in 2014 the minimum water surface area was estimated for 2014 with a total value of 586 km2 although ul lost more than 5000 km2 of its surface area between 1995 and 2014 after 2014 an increase in the water surface area of the lake is significant the water surface area increased by 1490 km2 and salt body decreased by 348 km2 in 2016 there were little changes between 2016 and 2018 the water surface area of the lake was estimated about 1624 km2 in august 2018 which was close to its area in august 2013 1852 km2 therefore it can be concluded that the lake has stabilized since 2016 this issue has led to a debate among experts on what has led to an increase in the lake water level after 2014 anthropogenic or climatic factors the anthropogenic factors and hydro climatic data were analyzed carefully in section 4 4 to clarify the main reasons influencing the lake recovery in recent years 3 2 seasonal water surface area changes of urmia lake in addition to analysis of decadal land cover changes between 1975 and 2018 the seasonal coastline changes of ul were quantified in spring and summer seasons of some selected years quantifying of seasonal water surface area changes is important for understanding the impacts of seasonal weather conditions on the water level fluctuations of ul fig 5 and 6 indicate the seasonal water surface area changes of ul from 1987 to 2019 the area of the lake decreases in summer comparing with spring increase in precipitation during winter and spring is one of the reasons influencing seasonal water surface area changes of ul on the other hand an increase in temperature during summer causes increasing evaporation from the lake anthropogenic factors may cause increasing the water surface area of ul in spring too the government releases water from some dams during spring to prevent the compelete drying up of ul base on the results of this study the difference in seasonal water surface area changes of ul has increased in recent years comparing with past decades the difference in seasonal water surface area changes of ul was about 250 km2 in the 1980s and 1990s while it was about 530 km2 1150 km2 and 631 km2 in 2007 2013 and 2018 respectively increasing the difference in seasonal water surface area changes of ul indicated that the water level fluctuations of ul have been risen due to the impacts of seasonal weather conditions on ul in recent years the water surface area of ul was estimated about 2885 km2 in april 2019 which was close to its area in april 2013 3000 km2 3 3 interaction between agricultural lands and urmia lake ecosystem in order to analyze agricultural development in the basin the study area was divided into three parts namely the western southern and eastern parts fig 7 the area of irrigated lands was calculated for each part of the basin individually then the total area of irrigated lands in the basin were derived from the summation of the area of irrigated lands of these sections the mlc method was applied to quantify the area of irrigated lands in each part the results of land cover changes in ul and agricultural development in the basin are given in fig 8 and 9 the area of irrigated lands has rapidly increased in all parts of the basin over the past decades increasing the area of irrigated lands from 1265 km2 in 1975 to 5525 km2 in 2011 in contrast to decreasing the water surface area of ul from 5982 km2 in 1995 to 586 km2 in 2014 and extension of salinization in the basin are the most important and thoughtful results of this study based on the results of this study the area of irrigated lands has increased by 437 over the past decades increasing the area of irrigated lands in the basin means increasing the water demand for development of agricultural lands and decreasing annual inflow to ul according to fig 8 there is an inverse relationship between the water surface area changes of ul and agricultural development in the basin with a correlation coefficient of 0 78 furthermore agricultural development in the basin strongly correlates with salt correlation coefficient of 0 92 and salty soil correlation coefficient of 0 80 bodies fig 9 helps to have a better visual interpretation about the agricultural development over the past decades the area of irrigated lands has dramatically increased around the lake from 1975 to 2018 while the water surface area of ul has gradually decreased during this period based on the results of this study the area of irrigated lands in the south part of the basin was more than other parts and the dryness of the lake was more intense in the southern and eastern parts the area of irrigated lands was estimated about 4850 km2 in 2018 which indicated a decrease by 12 comparing with its maximum area 5525 km2 in 2011 in the study period at the final step of satellite image processing the quantitative accuracy assessment process has conducted for comparison of a classified data against truth field survey information for the same place the overall classification accuracy and overall kappa statistics of sampled dates 2010 2011 2013 and 2014 are showed in table 2 the statistical results of table 2 indicated that the classification results can be acceptable the database of the ministry of agriculture of iran was used to better undersatnd the agriculture development policy in the north western iran even though the area of ulb is not equal to the area of these provinces combined about 90 of the basin is located in these provinces the maximum area of irrigated lands in west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan provinces was about 5590 km2 in 2011 table 3 indicates the area covered by some products in west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan provinces from 2003 to 2014 according to this table and the annual reports of the ministry total agricultural production has increased due to increasing the area of both irrigated and arable lands the results of quantitative accuracy assessment and the reports of ministry of agriculture of iran emphasized on the accuracy of the results of this investigation agriculutral development accounts for more than 80 of water consumption in ulb ulrp 2017 dams and groundwater resources especially deep wells and partial deep wells provide the required water for developing irrigated lands in the basin fig 10 shows the relationship between annual discharge water from dams and groundwater resources in the basin annual inflow water from rivers to ul and the total annual rainfall directly entering the lake according to this figure even in the years with heavy rainfall the annual inflow has decreased due to increasing discharge water from dams and wells regional development policies based on the agricultural activities and increase in population can be known as the main reasons for the agricultural development in the basin the population statistics of the study area were extracted from the reports of statistical center of iran 2016 the total population of west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan combined was about 5 million west azerbaijan with a population of 2 million and east azerbaijan with a population of 3 million in 1985 while it increased to about 7 2 million west azerbaijan with a population of 3 2 million and east azerbaijan with a population of 4 million in 2016 the increase in population will require more food and agricultural production and it may have led to the dramatically increase in agricultural areas 3 4 the role of anthropogenic and climatic factors in ul restoration the scientific reports of the meteorological office of iran 2016 and the urmia lake restoration program ulrp 2016 indicated that precipitation has increased from 2014 to 2019 fig 11 a shows the annual precipitation changes between 1989 and 2016 the annual mean precipitation value was about 408 mm in the study period the maximum and minimum annual precipitation were estimated about 560 mm and 250 mm in 1995 and 2008 respectively according to this figure the annual precipitation increased from 350 mm in 2014 to 476 mm and 471 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 11 b indicates the annual mean temperature in the basin according to this figure the annual mean temperature has increased since 1997 the minimum and maximum annual mean temperature were about 10 c and 14 5 c in 1992 and 2010 respectively the temperature decreased from 13 5 c in 2014 to 13 13 c in 2016 reducing the temperature means reducing the evaporation from the lake therefore the better climatic conditions increase in precipitation and decrease in temperature can be known as one of the reasons behind the increasing water surface area of ul after 2014 in addition the government claims that more water has been released from dams to ul to prevent its drying the runoff data of closest stations to ul were used to determine the annual inflow changes the mean annual inflow was about 3119 mcm during the study period the maximum and minimum inflow were estimated about 8325 mcm and 602 mcm in 1994 and 2014 respectively the annual inflow increased from 602 mcm in 2014 to 891 mcm and 3454 mcm in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 11 c in the other words the annual inflow from rivers to lake increased by 574 in 2016 comparing with 2014 according to the statistical center of urmia lake restoration program ulrp 2019 in total 1003 mcm water released from dams to the lake and 2451 mcm water entered from rivers to ul in 2016 furthermore ulrp contributed to restoration of ul by teaching local people to save water improvement of agricultural methods and dredging of some rivers ulrp 2019 on the other hand the results of this study indicated that the area of irrigated lands decreased by 12 since 2014 decreasing the area of irrigated lands means decreasing the water demand for irrigation in the basin therefore it can be concluded that both anthropogenic and climatic factors have played a positive role in ul restoration 3 5 consequences and threats of drying urmia lake extension of salinization and desertification salinization and desertification progress are not limited to just the dried bottom of ul ndvi and soil salinity index si maps of ulb derived between 1975 and 2018 were analyzed to indicate salt affected lands and increasing of soil salinity in the basin fig 12 a shows the vegetation cover changes in ulb between 1975 and 2018 the areas marked with yellow and pale green colors indicate dry arable and desert lands while the dark green color indicates dense vegetation cover in the basin the dense vegetation cover irrigated lands has increased around ul over the past decades the results of ndvi maps are in agreement with the results of mlc method fig 12 b shows the si changes in the basin which can be used for understanding the extension of salinization in the basin in terms of spectral content of satellite images green and red colors indicate less and more salt affected areas respectively the results of ndvi and si emphasized on the extension of salinization and desertification in all parts of the study area especially in the eastern and southern parts of the basin the positive changes in the basin were started by increasing the area of ul after 2014 4 discussion mismanagement of water resources in any lake basin not only results in water being wasted but also in the degradation of soil too soil salinization causes massive losses in agricultural productivity and it damages regional economies the analysis of satellite images showed that ul lost more than 90 of its area until 2014 which is in line with findings of aghakouchak et al 2015 and other previous studies alesheikh et al 2007 sima et al 2012 kabiri et al 2012 rokni et al 2014 however these studies referred only to coastline changes of ul and they did not discuss land cover changes in ul misguided agricultural polices along with climate change has directly caused the lake desiccation and extension of salinization and desertification in the basin salinization and desertification have spread across all parts of the basin soil salinization and desertification due to drying up of ul and dust emitted from the dried bottom of the lake are known as the most substantial problems accelerating desertification and air pollution in the northwest of iran the main findings of hamzehpour et al 2014 and fathian et al 2015 regarding soil salinity changes around ul are consistent with the findings of this study the complete destruction of the lake will lead to severe ecological crisis in the region the gradual increase in the area of ul after 2014 showed that lake recovery is possible both anthropogenic and climatic factors have played a positive role in urmia lake restoration based on the findings of this research the area of irrigated lands has increased more than 4 times during the study period considering that northwest part of iran is one of the main agricultural centers in the country and a variety of products such as apple wheat sugar beet tomato potato and grapes are grown in this region the government s policy was agricultural development strategy over the past decades hassanzadeh et al 2012 there are in total 103 dams in the west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan provinces iran water resources management company 2016 of these dams 56 are located in the basin and 42 of them were built between 1990 and 2014 the total cultivation area using dams in the basin is equal to 1926 28 km2 and the annual power generated using them is equal to 80 20 gw hour groundwater and surface water resources correspond to irrigation of the remaining agricultural lands the annual discharge water from groundwater resources has increased during recent years being about 2156 mcm in 2012 while it was about 702 mcm in 1972 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 therefore dams and wells prevent water from entering the lake and with direct effects on the gradual destruction of ul the results of this study indicated that a decrease in the area of irrigated lands has started since 2014 although the previous studies chaudhari et al 2018 khazaei et al 2019 analyzed the agricultural development and vegetation cover changes in different periods but they didn t focus on decreasing the area of irrigated lands in recent years the positive changes in ul conditions have not been investigated in their studies however the results of these studies are in agreement with the main findings of this investigation the reasons behind the decrease in the area of irrigated lands in recent years is an interesting topic and it should be investigated two hypotheses to explain this event could be the lack of water for irrigation and salinization progress or water policy change in the basin to restore ul soil salinity affects biomass production in both arable and irrigated lands based on the results of this study and the annual reports of ulrp even the agricultural lands in the regions close to ul have been affected by this environmental problem and some villages around the lake have been inhabited migration from villages to cities and land use change around ul may be one of the reason behind the decreasing the area of agricultural lands increasing soil salinity affects vegetation cover and agricultural lands in many ways it affects the quality of groundwater resources which are used for irrigation of agricultural lands in the basin salinization and water quality degradation may be the other reasons of reducing the area of irrigated lands in the basin on the other hand the recovery plans of ulrp aimed to reduce the area of irrigated lands in the basin and release more water from dams to the lake therefore it can be concluded that increasing soil salinity water quality degradation and water policy change caused the decline in agricultural lands in recent years the complete dryness of the lake will undoubtedly lead to an environmental crisis in the region the lake desiccation will leave a desert and saline body with an area of about 6000 km2 which will be the source of dust storms and air pollution in the region the aral sea is a good example to understand and interpret the reasons and effects of drying up of ul the aral sea has been extensively shrunk over the last decades largely due to water usage from the amu darya and syr darya rivers for land irrigation cretaux et al 2013 the aralkum region which is a new desert caused by the drying aral sea is the source of dust storms which have negative effects on people s life and climate as well indoitu et al 2015 restoration of ul is the only solution of the environmental problem in the north western iran compromise with climate change and providing a sustainable water resources management system under a changing climate can be the most effective ways to revive the lake teaching the local people to understand the importance of water training water saving skills improvement of agricultural methods agricultural water management and cultivation of low water use crops can play positive role in the lake rehabilitation 5 conclusion in this study hydro climatic data landsat satellite images and image processing techniques were used to detect the spatio temporal land cover changes and salinization progress in urmia lake basin between 1975 and 2019 misguided water and agricultural policies along with climate change have had negative impacts on ul environment leading up to salinization and desertification in the basin the results of this study indicated that the water surface area of ul decreased from 5982 km2 in 1995 to 4058 km2 in 2006 in other words slightly over one third of the lake dried up during the period of 1995 until 2006 nearly 90 of the total area dried up by 2014 the water surface area has increased after 2014 due to increase in precipitation and releasing more water from dams to ul the area of irrigated lands was estimated about 4850 km2 in 2018 which indicated a decrease by 12 comparing with its maximum area 5525 km2 in 2011 in the study period inverse correlation between shrinking urmia lake and expanding the area of salt and salt affected lands is concerning the final results of land cover change in ulb indicated that the current conditions of ul 2018 2019 is very similar to its conditions in 2013 and lake recovery is possible the decision makers and responsible administrators can use the results of this study to have a clear view about the process consequences and threats of drying ul and ecosystem changes in the northwest part of iran and neighboring countries although this study contributed to long term land cover changes and salinization progress in ulb but there were limitations too lack of access to detailed data about dams to analyze the effects of releasing water from dams to ul in different periods was one of the limitations of this study on the other hand it was impossible to have a detailed study on soil salinity changes due to the lack of sampling data the results of remotely sensed data could be correlated with the results of sampling data in order to provide soil salinity maps in terms of electrical conductivity satellite images with high spatial and spectral resolution could improve the quality of findings too in the light of this study simultaneous monitoring projects using remote sensing rs technology geographical information systems gis in conjunction with field survey are recommended to monitor and further study the changes in soil salinity and vegetation cover in ulb the future research can focus on developing the predator prey model using system dynamics simulation for ulb this model is necessary to estimate the existing interactions between ul and factors affecting it the main advantage of this model can be providing the balanced water allocation between stakeholders in order to have a sustainable water management system for ulb the effects of various factors on the water level fluctuations of the lake can be analyzed dynamically and the strategies for reducing the agricultural water consumption can be investigated carefully the results of this study and applied methodology have potentials to be used for determining land cover changes and salinization progress in other basins around the world such as salt lake and burdur lake in turkey to monitor and compare the desired areas whit urmia lake in order to have a sustainable water management system and ecosystem conservation to avoid what happened to ulb 
11024,urmia lake ul located in the northwest of iran is one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world in recent years most of the lake has been rendered to unusable lands drought and rapid increase in agricultural activities are the most important reasons behind the shrinkage of the lake in this study hydro climatic data landsat satellite images and image processing techniques were used to detect the spatio temporal land cover changes and salinization progress in urmia lake basin ulb between 1975 and 2019 increasing the area of irrigated lands from 1265 km2 in 1975 to 5525 km2 in 2011 in contrast to decreasing the water surface area of ul from 5982 km2 in 1995 to 586 km2 in 2014 and extension of salinization in the basin are the most important and thoughtful results of this study even the agricultural lands in the regions close to the lake have been affected by this environmental problem the climatic conditions have gradually improved after 2014 and the government has released more water from dams to the lake on the other hand the area of irrigated lands has gradually decreased by 12 in the same period as a result of these positive changes the water surface area of the lake has gradually increased over 1000 km2 based on the results of this study both anthropogenic and climatic factors have played a positive role in ul restoration improvement of agricultural methods and providing a sustainable agricultural water management system under a changing climate can play the most effective role in the lake rehabilitation keywords urmia lake agricultural lands salinization desertification agricultural water management 1 introduction soil salinity is an environmental hazard that leads to soil degradation especially in arid and semiarid regions bhatt et al 2008 soil salinization due to irrigation and other intensified agricultural activities is one of the most severe problems among the many forms of soil degradation akramkhanov et al 2011 other rapid issues include population growth and natural hazards such as drought monitoring salt affected lands and analysis of salinity changes can be effective ways in environmental management and preventing

increase in agricultural activities are the most important reasons behind the shrinkage of the lake alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 fathian et al 2015 investigated the impacts of temperature changes and overuse of water resources on ul their results indicated that the exploitation of the lake along with the added salinity from irrigation has caused increasing of soil salinity in the basin leading up to desertification these environmental changes may cause negative impacts such as the spread of diseases destruction of agricultural lands and massive damage to the local economy resulting in mass migration of local people similar to what has happened in the aral sea over the past decades zarghami 2011 unep 2012 aghakouchak et al 2015 satellite data and image processing techniques were used in many studies alesheikh et al 2007 sima et al 2012 kabiri et al 2012 rokni et al 2014 to determine coastline changes of ul the results of these studies indicated that ul lost most of its surface area over the past decades aghakouchak et al 2015 used landsat satellite data to detect water surface area changes of ul between 1972 and 2014 according to their results the area of the lake has decreased by about 90 over the study period which is in agreement with previous studies hamzehpour et al 2014 analyzed the spatial variation of top soil salinity using groundwater sar and sampling data in an area of 5000 ha close to ul their results indicated an inverse correlation between top soil salinity and distance from the lake sima and tajrishy 2014 used spatial interpolation methods to analyze the spatial heterogeneity and temporal changes of the physiochemical parameters of ul and found seasonal water quality changes alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 investigated the climatic conditions and the main factors behind the drying up of ul they concluded that the impacts of climate change on lake desiccation were about 20 and anthropogenic factors correspond for decline in lake water level by 80 chaudhari et al 2018 used a hydrological model higw mat and remote sensing data to indicate the anthropogenic and natural changes in the hydrology of ul their results showed that human induced activities account for shrinkage in the lake by 86 in a recent study khazaei et al 2019 used available hydro climatic and vegetation cover data to explain the main reasons behind the lake desiccation since 2000 their results indicated that human induced activities and increasing vegetation cover in the basin correlates with the lake water level fluctuations however they didn t separate crops from other vegetation cover types and this was one of the limitations of their study most of these studies contributed to the coastline changes of ul and the effects of climate change on the lake they didn t focus on analysis of decadal land use land cover lulc changes agricultural development and salinization progress in urmia lake basin ulb in recent decades population growth urbanization and development of industries and agricultural lands have caused rapid land use land cover lulc changes in the northwest of iran these changes are accompanied by substantial consequences such as deforestation environmental pollution destruction of natural resources and drying up of ul understanding the dynamics of lulc is one of the main issues to have a sustainable water management system in ulb remote sensing technology and geographical information systems giss can help to determine the systematic and random changes over time to provide an environmental management system prevent environmental degradation and act correctly and effectively this paper contributes to long term salinization progress land cover changes and development of irrigated lands in ulb between 1975 and 2019 this investigation uses hydro climatic data landsat satellite images and image processing techniques in conjunction with field survey data to analyze the interaction between agricultural lands and ul ecosystem understanding the interaction between agricultural lands and ul ecosystem helps to determine a lake recovery plan and a sustainable water resources management system in the north western iran this study shows how urbanization land use change and agricultural expansion over time have led to disruption of water cycle and gradual drying up of ul misguided water and agricultural policies along with climate change have had negative impacts on ul environment leading up to salinization and desertification in the basin in this study maximum likelihood classification mlc method was used to monitor land cover changes and agricultural development in the basin vegetation changes and salinization progress were investigated using normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and soil salinity index si respectively in addition to the process of ul desiccation the main factors influencing the lake recovery in recent years have also been studied to evaluate the role of anthropogenic and climatic factors in the lake revitalization 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area urmia lake ul has a surface area ranging between 5000 and 6000 km2 eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 this hypersaline lake is located in the northwest of iran n 37 5 e 45 5 between west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan provinces with a catchment area of 51 876 km2 eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 the size of this basin is approximately 3 of the entire area of iran the basin contains 21 permanent and 39 episodic rivers ghaheri and baghal vayjooee 1999 ul is the largest inland lake of iran and the second largest hypersaline lake in the world eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 zarghami 2011 hassanzadeh et al 2012 more than 6 million people live in ulb and the lake supports housing needs of this people statistical center of iran 2016 ulrp 2017 the agricultural sector accounts for 30 of employment around the lake but its contribution to the economic prosperity of the regions is about 15 ulrp 2017 world bank 2017 there are 102 islands in ul and this lake is home to different species of mammals birds amphibians and reptiles it is an internationally registered protected area and the habitat of artemia urmiana which is a unique bisexual artemia species unep 2012 fig 1 indicates the location map of ul and its basin in iran the geology of the area ranges from pre cambrian to quaternary alipour 2006 by many aspects of chemistry sediments and morphology ul is similar to great salt lake in state of utah in usa eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 saline lakes are susceptible to environmental changes because their properties vary with changes in their hydrologic budgets romero and melack 1996 the lake is divided into northern and southern parts these parts are separated by a causeway that has a 1500 m long bridge allowing little water exchange between the two parts eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 rezvantalab and amrollahi 2011 sima et al 2013 its continental climate has been affected by the surrounding mountains and air temperature usually ranges between 0 c and 20 c in winter and up to 40 c in summer the basin has an average annual precipitation between 200 mm and 300 mm eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 the measured maximum and minimum water elevation of urmia lake were about 1278 386 m and 1270 168 m in june 1995 and september 2014 respectively iran water resources management company 2016 2 2 methodology remote sensing techniques either directly or indirectly are being used to determine soil salinity changes by using the direct approach remote sensing techniques are applied to the terrain surface to examine the crusts or salinity properties of soil in indirect approach biophysical characteristics of vegetation types that are affected by salinity are taken into account soil salinity can also be identified by electrical conductivity of a solution that is extracted from a water saturated soil in agricultural terms saline soils have an electrical conductivity of more than 4 ds decismens per meter at 25 c al khaier 2003 as reported in previous studies abbas and khan 2007 abdul qadir and benni 2010 abbas et al 2013 allbed and kumar 2013 arnous and green 2015 there exists a strong contrast between normal and salt affected salinized soils with respect to their ground surface conditions salt affected soils have a distinctive feature that make it easier to characterize them salt efflorescence when has accumulated over the soil surface by the capillary rise of low quality water this feature is prominent on top of the soil and is easy to capture by satellite data since salt affected soils have a high spectral reflectance metternicht and zinck 2003 especially in the blue band of the visible window their spectral response is higher than normal soils remote sensing technology was used in this study to analyze decadal land cover changes and salinization progress in ulb 2 2 1 image preprocessing landsat satellite data archives of united states geological survey usgs were investigated to choose the most appropriate data containing a low cloud cover percentage less than 10 while obtained in august and april months of different years two landsat frames were needed to cover urmia lake maximum area of about 6000 km2 but at least eight landsat frames were needed to cover all parts of the basin area of 51 876 km2 in this study 150 landsat satellite images dated between 1975 and 2019 were used to identify the land cover changes in the study area radiometric calibration was performed for all satellite images to minimize the radiometric effects and convert digital numbers dns to top of atmospheric toa reflectance values liang 2004 schroeder et al 2006 afterwards atmospheric conditions of all satellite data were conducted using atcor to decrease aerosols clouds their shadows and other atmospheric effects from imagery at satellite reflectance values were converted to ground surface reflectance values in full absolute correction using atcor algorithm shunlin 2004 schroeder et al 2006 then geometric accuracy of each satellite image was checked to ensure accurate pixel based comparison of multi temporal images the steps of satellite images processing are given in fig 2 2 2 2 image processing in the next step eight landsat frames were mosaicked to output images to cover all parts of ulb then maximum likelihood classification mlc method a pixel based classification method was applied to monitor land cover change in ul and development of irrigated lands in the basin levin 1999 foody and mathur 2004 lillesand et al 2008 land use maps of west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan provinces prepared between 2000 and 2003 were used to separate forest and other vegetation cover types from crops the corrected satellite images were interpreted using various interpretation keys such as shape tone texture location and the association mlc was controlled by the analyst in this process training areas which represent different land cover features were selected by the analyst to be input for the classification algorithm mlc algorithm assumes that the histograms of the bands of data have normal distribution and it is based on the probability that a pixel belongs to a particular class lillesand et al 2008 si and ndvi were used for monitoring soil salinity changes and vegetation cover changes in the basin to understand the consequences and threats of drying up of ul the salinity index si is given by 1 s i ρ g r e e n ρ r e d 2 where ρ green and ρ red are ground surface reflectance values of green and red bands respectively with values ranging between 0 and 1 high salinity index si values show high salt affected areas while low values indicate less salt affected areas ahmed and al khafaji 2013 the ndvi is given by 2 n d v i ρ n i r ρ r e d ρ n i r ρ r e d where ρ nir and ρ red are ground surface reflectance values of near infrared and red bands respectively with values ranging between 1 and 1 ndvi is used to identify vegetated areas in the study area ndvi values less than zero refers to non vegetated areas while positive values indicate vegetated lands see table 1 anderson et al 2003 ritter 2006 rawashdeh 2012 usgs 2019 2 2 3 quantitative accuracy assessment more than 500 photos taken from different parts of ul and 1000 ground truth data collected using gps and google earth in august month of 2010 2011 2013 and 2014 were used to check the accuracy of the results quantitative accuracy assessment process was used to evaluate the results of mlc this assessment compares collected ground truth data with classified data it performs a pixel by pixel comparison of the classified data with truth data lillesand et al 2008 the results of this process contain a confusion matrix this matrix can be derived to several measures of accuracy including overall accuracy mapping accuracy producer accuracy user accuracy and kappa co efficient of agreement which are strong estimators of classification accuracy lillesand et al 2008 2 2 4 hydro climatic data analysis the runoff data of 16 rivers including 10 main rivers and 6 minor rivers and meteorological data of 8 synoptic stations urmia tabriz sardasht piranshahr maragheh mahabad khoy and ahar around the lake were used for understanding the climatic conditions in the study area the annual runoff changes were calculated using daily data monthly temperature and precipitation data were used to calculate the annual temperature and precipitation changes in the basin in addition to the negative effects of climate change on the lake desiccation the hydro climatic data were used to evaluate the positive impacts of climatic factors in urmia lake restoration during recent years 3 results in field survey study about 1000 ground truth data collected using gps and google earth and more than 500 photos were used to compare the spectral signature of different land cover types select training areas for classification and check the accuracy of results fig 3 shows the salinization and desertification progress as recorded by sample photos over the past years the body has either dried completely fig 3 b or withdrawn from coastal parts to the center of the lake fig 3 d shrinking water body leaves salt and saline soils that increase albedo and affect the regional climate these dry and saline lands have negative impacts on the air quality of the region as well as the agricultural lands around the lake the wind blowing in different directions causes moving of salt particles in the air these particles are dangerous to human health and other organisms 3 1 land cover changes in urmia lake fig 4 presents the results of mlc in the 45 year period the progress of desertification over urmia lake in august month of different years can be seen in this figure white magenta blue brown and green colors indicate salt salty soil water soil and agricultural bodies respectively the water surface area of urmia lake was estimated about 5412 km2 in 1975 based on the results of this study there were little changes between 1975 and 1990 the water surface area of the lake increased in the 1990s and the lake reached to its maximum area 5982 km2 in 1995 in the study period salt and salty soil bodies increased dramatically between 1995 and 2014 more than 5000 km2 of ul s water body was turned into salt or salty soil bodies water surface area decreased by 32 in 2006 and by 90 in 2014 the minimum water surface area was estimated for 2014 with a total value of 586 km2 although ul lost more than 5000 km2 of its surface area between 1995 and 2014 after 2014 an increase in the water surface area of the lake is significant the water surface area increased by 1490 km2 and salt body decreased by 348 km2 in 2016 there were little changes between 2016 and 2018 the water surface area of the lake was estimated about 1624 km2 in august 2018 which was close to its area in august 2013 1852 km2 therefore it can be concluded that the lake has stabilized since 2016 this issue has led to a debate among experts on what has led to an increase in the lake water level after 2014 anthropogenic or climatic factors the anthropogenic factors and hydro climatic data were analyzed carefully in section 4 4 to clarify the main reasons influencing the lake recovery in recent years 3 2 seasonal water surface area changes of urmia lake in addition to analysis of decadal land cover changes between 1975 and 2018 the seasonal coastline changes of ul were quantified in spring and summer seasons of some selected years quantifying of seasonal water surface area changes is important for understanding the impacts of seasonal weather conditions on the water level fluctuations of ul fig 5 and 6 indicate the seasonal water surface area changes of ul from 1987 to 2019 the area of the lake decreases in summer comparing with spring increase in precipitation during winter and spring is one of the reasons influencing seasonal water surface area changes of ul on the other hand an increase in temperature during summer causes increasing evaporation from the lake anthropogenic factors may cause increasing the water surface area of ul in spring too the government releases water from some dams during spring to prevent the compelete drying up of ul base on the results of this study the difference in seasonal water surface area changes of ul has increased in recent years comparing with past decades the difference in seasonal water surface area changes of ul was about 250 km2 in the 1980s and 1990s while it was about 530 km2 1150 km2 and 631 km2 in 2007 2013 and 2018 respectively increasing the difference in seasonal water surface area changes of ul indicated that the water level fluctuations of ul have been risen due to the impacts of seasonal weather conditions on ul in recent years the water surface area of ul was estimated about 2885 km2 in april 2019 which was close to its area in april 2013 3000 km2 3 3 interaction between agricultural lands and urmia lake ecosystem in order to analyze agricultural development in the basin the study area was divided into three parts namely the western southern and eastern parts fig 7 the area of irrigated lands was calculated for each part of the basin individually then the total area of irrigated lands in the basin were derived from the summation of the area of irrigated lands of these sections the mlc method was applied to quantify the area of irrigated lands in each part the results of land cover changes in ul and agricultural development in the basin are given in fig 8 and 9 the area of irrigated lands has rapidly increased in all parts of the basin over the past decades increasing the area of irrigated lands from 1265 km2 in 1975 to 5525 km2 in 2011 in contrast to decreasing the water surface area of ul from 5982 km2 in 1995 to 586 km2 in 2014 and extension of salinization in the basin are the most important and thoughtful results of this study based on the results of this study the area of irrigated lands has increased by 437 over the past decades increasing the area of irrigated lands in the basin means increasing the water demand for development of agricultural lands and decreasing annual inflow to ul according to fig 8 there is an inverse relationship between the water surface area changes of ul and agricultural development in the basin with a correlation coefficient of 0 78 furthermore agricultural development in the basin strongly correlates with salt correlation coefficient of 0 92 and salty soil correlation coefficient of 0 80 bodies fig 9 helps to have a better visual interpretation about the agricultural development over the past decades the area of irrigated lands has dramatically increased around the lake from 1975 to 2018 while the water surface area of ul has gradually decreased during this period based on the results of this study the area of irrigated lands in the south part of the basin was more than other parts and the dryness of the lake was more intense in the southern and eastern parts the area of irrigated lands was estimated about 4850 km2 in 2018 which indicated a decrease by 12 comparing with its maximum area 5525 km2 in 2011 in the study period at the final step of satellite image processing the quantitative accuracy assessment process has conducted for comparison of a classified data against truth field survey information for the same place the overall classification accuracy and overall kappa statistics of sampled dates 2010 2011 2013 and 2014 are showed in table 2 the statistical results of table 2 indicated that the classification results can be acceptable the database of the ministry of agriculture of iran was used to better undersatnd the agriculture development policy in the north western iran even though the area of ulb is not equal to the area of these provinces combined about 90 of the basin is located in these provinces the maximum area of irrigated lands in west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan provinces was about 5590 km2 in 2011 table 3 indicates the area covered by some products in west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan provinces from 2003 to 2014 according to this table and the annual reports of the ministry total agricultural production has increased due to increasing the area of both irrigated and arable lands the results of quantitative accuracy assessment and the reports of ministry of agriculture of iran emphasized on the accuracy of the results of this investigation agriculutral development accounts for more than 80 of water consumption in ulb ulrp 2017 dams and groundwater resources especially deep wells and partial deep wells provide the required water for developing irrigated lands in the basin fig 10 shows the relationship between annual discharge water from dams and groundwater resources in the basin annual inflow water from rivers to ul and the total annual rainfall directly entering the lake according to this figure even in the years with heavy rainfall the annual inflow has decreased due to increasing discharge water from dams and wells regional development policies based on the agricultural activities and increase in population can be known as the main reasons for the agricultural development in the basin the population statistics of the study area were extracted from the reports of statistical center of iran 2016 the total population of west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan combined was about 5 million west azerbaijan with a population of 2 million and east azerbaijan with a population of 3 million in 1985 while it increased to about 7 2 million west azerbaijan with a population of 3 2 million and east azerbaijan with a population of 4 million in 2016 the increase in population will require more food and agricultural production and it may have led to the dramatically increase in agricultural areas 3 4 the role of anthropogenic and climatic factors in ul restoration the scientific reports of the meteorological office of iran 2016 and the urmia lake restoration program ulrp 2016 indicated that precipitation has increased from 2014 to 2019 fig 11 a shows the annual precipitation changes between 1989 and 2016 the annual mean precipitation value was about 408 mm in the study period the maximum and minimum annual precipitation were estimated about 560 mm and 250 mm in 1995 and 2008 respectively according to this figure the annual precipitation increased from 350 mm in 2014 to 476 mm and 471 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 11 b indicates the annual mean temperature in the basin according to this figure the annual mean temperature has increased since 1997 the minimum and maximum annual mean temperature were about 10 c and 14 5 c in 1992 and 2010 respectively the temperature decreased from 13 5 c in 2014 to 13 13 c in 2016 reducing the temperature means reducing the evaporation from the lake therefore the better climatic conditions increase in precipitation and decrease in temperature can be known as one of the reasons behind the increasing water surface area of ul after 2014 in addition the government claims that more water has been released from dams to ul to prevent its drying the runoff data of closest stations to ul were used to determine the annual inflow changes the mean annual inflow was about 3119 mcm during the study period the maximum and minimum inflow were estimated about 8325 mcm and 602 mcm in 1994 and 2014 respectively the annual inflow increased from 602 mcm in 2014 to 891 mcm and 3454 mcm in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 11 c in the other words the annual inflow from rivers to lake increased by 574 in 2016 comparing with 2014 according to the statistical center of urmia lake restoration program ulrp 2019 in total 1003 mcm water released from dams to the lake and 2451 mcm water entered from rivers to ul in 2016 furthermore ulrp contributed to restoration of ul by teaching local people to save water improvement of agricultural methods and dredging of some rivers ulrp 2019 on the other hand the results of this study indicated that the area of irrigated lands decreased by 12 since 2014 decreasing the area of irrigated lands means decreasing the water demand for irrigation in the basin therefore it can be concluded that both anthropogenic and climatic factors have played a positive role in ul restoration 3 5 consequences and threats of drying urmia lake extension of salinization and desertification salinization and desertification progress are not limited to just the dried bottom of ul ndvi and soil salinity index si maps of ulb derived between 1975 and 2018 were analyzed to indicate salt affected lands and increasing of soil salinity in the basin fig 12 a shows the vegetation cover changes in ulb between 1975 and 2018 the areas marked with yellow and pale green colors indicate dry arable and desert lands while the dark green color indicates dense vegetation cover in the basin the dense vegetation cover irrigated lands has increased around ul over the past decades the results of ndvi maps are in agreement with the results of mlc method fig 12 b shows the si changes in the basin which can be used for understanding the extension of salinization in the basin in terms of spectral content of satellite images green and red colors indicate less and more salt affected areas respectively the results of ndvi and si emphasized on the extension of salinization and desertification in all parts of the study area especially in the eastern and southern parts of the basin the positive changes in the basin were started by increasing the area of ul after 2014 4 discussion mismanagement of water resources in any lake basin not only results in water being wasted but also in the degradation of soil too soil salinization causes massive losses in agricultural productivity and it damages regional economies the analysis of satellite images showed that ul lost more than 90 of its area until 2014 which is in line with findings of aghakouchak et al 2015 and other previous studies alesheikh et al 2007 sima et al 2012 kabiri et al 2012 rokni et al 2014 however these studies referred only to coastline changes of ul and they did not discuss land cover changes in ul misguided agricultural polices along with climate change has directly caused the lake desiccation and extension of salinization and desertification in the basin salinization and desertification have spread across all parts of the basin soil salinization and desertification due to drying up of ul and dust emitted from the dried bottom of the lake are known as the most substantial problems accelerating desertification and air pollution in the northwest of iran the main findings of hamzehpour et al 2014 and fathian et al 2015 regarding soil salinity changes around ul are consistent with the findings of this study the complete destruction of the lake will lead to severe ecological crisis in the region the gradual increase in the area of ul after 2014 showed that lake recovery is possible both anthropogenic and climatic factors have played a positive role in urmia lake restoration based on the findings of this research the area of irrigated lands has increased more than 4 times during the study period considering that northwest part of iran is one of the main agricultural centers in the country and a variety of products such as apple wheat sugar beet tomato potato and grapes are grown in this region the government s policy was agricultural development strategy over the past decades hassanzadeh et al 2012 there are in total 103 dams in the west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan provinces iran water resources management company 2016 of these dams 56 are located in the basin and 42 of them were built between 1990 and 2014 the total cultivation area using dams in the basin is equal to 1926 28 km2 and the annual power generated using them is equal to 80 20 gw hour groundwater and surface water resources correspond to irrigation of the remaining agricultural lands the annual discharge water from groundwater resources has increased during recent years being about 2156 mcm in 2012 while it was about 702 mcm in 1972 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 therefore dams and wells prevent water from entering the lake and with direct effects on the gradual destruction of ul the results of this study indicated that a decrease in the area of irrigated lands has started since 2014 although the previous studies chaudhari et al 2018 khazaei et al 2019 analyzed the agricultural development and vegetation cover changes in different periods but they didn t focus on decreasing the area of irrigated lands in recent years the positive changes in ul conditions have not been investigated in their studies however the results of these studies are in agreement with the main findings of this investigation the reasons behind the decrease in the area of irrigated lands in recent years is an interesting topic and it should be investigated two hypotheses to explain this event could be the lack of water for irrigation and salinization progress or water policy change in the basin to restore ul soil salinity affects biomass production in both arable and irrigated lands based on the results of this study and the annual reports of ulrp even the agricultural lands in the regions close to ul have been affected by this environmental problem and some villages around the lake have been inhabited migration from villages to cities and land use change around ul may be one of the reason behind the decreasing the area of agricultural lands increasing soil salinity affects vegetation cover and agricultural lands in many ways it affects the quality of groundwater resources which are used for irrigation of agricultural lands in the basin salinization and water quality degradation may be the other reasons of reducing the area of irrigated lands in the basin on the other hand the recovery plans of ulrp aimed to reduce the area of irrigated lands in the basin and release more water from dams to the lake therefore it can be concluded that increasing soil salinity water quality degradation and water policy change caused the decline in agricultural lands in recent years the complete dryness of the lake will undoubtedly lead to an environmental crisis in the region the lake desiccation will leave a desert and saline body with an area of about 6000 km2 which will be the source of dust storms and air pollution in the region the aral sea is a good example to understand and interpret the reasons and effects of drying up of ul the aral sea has been extensively shrunk over the last decades largely due to water usage from the amu darya and syr darya rivers for land irrigation cretaux et al 2013 the aralkum region which is a new desert caused by the drying aral sea is the source of dust storms which have negative effects on people s life and climate as well indoitu et al 2015 restoration of ul is the only solution of the environmental problem in the north western iran compromise with climate change and providing a sustainable water resources management system under a changing climate can be the most effective ways to revive the lake teaching the local people to understand the importance of water training water saving skills improvement of agricultural methods agricultural water management and cultivation of low water use crops can play positive role in the lake rehabilitation 5 conclusion in this study hydro climatic data landsat satellite images and image processing techniques were used to detect the spatio temporal land cover changes and salinization progress in urmia lake basin between 1975 and 2019 misguided water and agricultural policies along with climate change have had negative impacts on ul environment leading up to salinization and desertification in the basin the results of this study indicated that the water surface area of ul decreased from 5982 km2 in 1995 to 4058 km2 in 2006 in other words slightly over one third of the lake dried up during the period of 1995 until 2006 nearly 90 of the total area dried up by 2014 the water surface area has increased after 2014 due to increase in precipitation and releasing more water from dams to ul the area of irrigated lands was estimated about 4850 km2 in 2018 which indicated a decrease by 12 comparing with its maximum area 5525 km2 in 2011 in the study period inverse correlation between shrinking urmia lake and expanding the area of salt and salt affected lands is concerning the final results of land cover change in ulb indicated that the current conditions of ul 2018 2019 is very similar to its conditions in 2013 and lake recovery is possible the decision makers and responsible administrators can use the results of this study to have a clear view about the process consequences and threats of drying ul and ecosystem changes in the northwest part of iran and neighboring countries although this study contributed to long term land cover changes and salinization progress in ulb but there were limitations too lack of access to detailed data about dams to analyze the effects of releasing water from dams to ul in different periods was one of the limitations of this study on the other hand it was impossible to have a detailed study on soil salinity changes due to the lack of sampling data the results of remotely sensed data could be correlated with the results of sampling data in order to provide soil salinity maps in terms of electrical conductivity satellite images with high spatial and spectral resolution could improve the quality of findings too in the light of this study simultaneous monitoring projects using remote sensing rs technology geographical information systems gis in conjunction with field survey are recommended to monitor and further study the changes in soil salinity and vegetation cover in ulb the future research can focus on developing the predator prey model using system dynamics simulation for ulb this model is necessary to estimate the existing interactions between ul and factors affecting it the main advantage of this model can be providing the balanced water allocation between stakeholders in order to have a sustainable water management system for ulb the effects of various factors on the water level fluctuations of the lake can be analyzed dynamically and the strategies for reducing the agricultural water consumption can be investigated carefully the results of this study and applied methodology have potentials to be used for determining land cover changes and salinization progress in other basins around the world such as salt lake and burdur lake in turkey to monitor and compare the desired areas whit urmia lake in order to have a sustainable water management system and ecosystem conservation to avoid what happened to ulb
