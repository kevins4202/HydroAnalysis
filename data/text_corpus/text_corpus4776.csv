23880,non hydrostatic ocean models are widely required in coastal and estuarine studies but are limited in their application due to their very high computational expense to alleviate this issue this study developed a highly computationally efficient non hydrostatic ocean model named merf v3 0 the third version of the marine environment research and forecasting model in which a semi implicit and variable layers sivl scheme is proposed for dynamic pressure calculation the sivl scheme provides freedom to choose the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers as required moreover the model adopted numerical calculation framework openarray and petsc portable extensible toolkit for scientific computation to achieve implicit parallelism and a concise code structure five classical numerical experiments were performed to validate the simulation capacity of this non hydrostatic ocean model including the standing wave in a closed basin surface solitary wave lock exchange problem periodic wave over a bar and tidally induced internal lee wave the numerical simulation results are consistent with the analytical solutions and experimental data published in the literature benefitting from the advantages of openarray and petsc merf v3 0 achieves an 87 8 parallel efficiency in the strong scaling test and an 84 1 parallel efficiency in the weak scaling test on 3584 processes whereas the openarray limits the parallel efficiency of merf v3 0 on more processes which is beyond the scope of this article and will be further examined in our next study keywords non hydrostatic terrain following coordinate implicit parallelism 1 introduction in the early stage and the following decades of numerical ocean model development hydrostatic approximation has been widely used in ocean dynamics research due to the lack of computing resources the hydrostatic approximation is acceptable under conditions where the ratio between the horizontal scale and vertical scale of motion is much larger than 1 and vertical acceleration is small enough to be ignored such as wind driven currents and the antarctic circumpolar current however large scale motions are influenced by many small scale processes including but not limited to deep convection killworth 1983 marshall and schott 1999 turbulent mixing induced by tides munk and wunsch 1998 ledwell et al 2000 and descending gravity currents price and baringer 1994 gordon et al 2001 these significant small scale processes remain unresolved and are only empirically parameterized because the model resolution is insufficient and many ocean models whose target is large scale circulation are based on the hydrostatic approximation matsumura and hasumi 2008 with the growth in computing power and interest in processes at small scale and submeso scale nikurashin et al 2013 callies et al 2015 molemaker et al 2015 the non hydrostatic model is urgently required in the ocean modeling community to our knowledge there have been several ocean models that are capable of handling non hydrostatic physics namely mitgcm m i t general circulation model marshall et al 1997b pom princeton ocean model kanarska and maderich 2003 bom bergen ocean model heggelund et al 2004 suntans stanford unstructured non hydrostatic terrain following adaptive navier stokes simulator fringer et al 2006 roms regional ocean modeling system kanarska et al 2007 fvcom finite volume community ocean model lai et al 2010a symphonie auclair et al 2011 getm general estuarine transport model klingbeil and burchard 2013 and merf the marine environment research and forecasting model liu et al 2016 the non hydrostatic ocean model can make marine scientists capable of investigating almost the entire range of internal waves convection processes symmetric instability etc in realistic ocean motions guillaume et al 2017 and bridge the gap with les large eddy simulation sullivan et al 1994 it has become a necessary tool for the simulation of surface dispersive waves ma et al 2012 chen et al 2014 and internal waves xing and davies 2006 berntsen et al 2008 lai et al 2010b zhang et al 2011 compared to the model based on hydrostatic approximation a practical non hydrostatic ocean model faces at least two difficulties first the vertical momentum equation should be prognostic and an additional 3d poisson equation in regard to the dynamic pressure needs to be solved at each time step which will be more challenging in σ coordinate system second a high resolution configuration is necessary for the simulation of non hydrostatic processes which yields a large linear system of equations for the dynamic pressure the number of these coupled equations is almost the same as the number of grid points and solving this system properly has been a classical hpc high performance computing problem owing to these two difficulties the runtime of the non hydrostatic model is several to dozens of times longer than that of its hydrostatic counterpart fringer et al 2006 shi et al 2015 magaldi and haine 2015 vertical velocity determination is straightforward which is not time consuming and imitates the operations in the horizontal direction regarding the requirement to solve the 3d poisson equation of the dynamic pressure one possible way to circumvent this problem is to simultaneously relax the incompressibility constraint the pressure can then be obtained by integrating the compressible physics over time considering the cfl constraint a time splitting technique is necessary because sound wave is introduced and its phase speed is much larger than the advective speed this approach has been implemented in the wrf weather research and forecasting atmosphere model skamarock and klemp 2008 however the ratio between the sound wave speed and the advective speed in the ocean is almost two orders of magnitude larger than that in the atmosphere which adversely impacts the required time splitting decelerating the sound wave speed with artificial incompressibility can reduce the time splitting ratio but the divergence freeness constraint of the flow is not strictly satisfied as mentioned by guillaume et al 2017 the direct method may possibly avoid inversion of the 3d poisson equation orlanski 1981 dietrich et al 1987 dietrich and ko 1994 lin and dietrich 1994 dietrich and lin 2002 klingbeil and burchard 2013 the missing contribution of the dynamic pressure is considered by explicitly integrating the non hydrostatic term in the vertical momentum equation and applying this integration term in the subsequent horizontal pressure gradient calculations however the decoupled treatment of momentum equations generates stability issues which may degrade the efficiency and applicability of this straightforward approach more iterations and smaller time steps may alleviate these instability issues this approach can only be applied to the weakly non hydrostatic area where the flow is nearly hydrostatic but does not replace the classical pressure correcting projection method klingbeil and burchard 2013 the pressure correcting projection method is the most commonly used technique to consider the non hydrostatic effect in existing hydrostatic model kernels this is not a specific method but refers to a class of methods that rely on fractional step and implicit coupling of momentum and continuity equations chorin 1968 van kan 1986 bell et al 1989 kanarska et al 2007 at the fractional step a provisional velocity field is first obtained by integrating the momentum equations over time ignoring the contribution of dynamic pressure subsequently the implicit coupling of the momentum and continuity equations induces the requirement to solve an additional 3d poisson equation for the dynamic pressure in the orthogonal z coordinate system a compact and symmetric 7 point stencil is usually adopted in poisson equation discretization and classical iterative algorithms such as cg and gmres handle this problem well marshall et al 1997a in the nonorthogonal terrain following σ coordinate system which has been widely used in many non hydrostatic ocean models e g kanarska and maderich 2003 berntsen and furnes 2005 lai et al 2010a auclair et al 2011 ma et al 2012 due to its ability to suitably represent the complex topography of the ocean nonorthogonality greatly deteriorates the 3d poisson equation for the dynamic pressure for instance the horizontal pressure gradient cannot be simply calculated based on the finite difference between two neighboring horizontal grid cells application of the chain rule in the gradient and divergence operators generates additional mixed derivative terms and a larger stencil usually a 15 point stencil is needed to discretize the poisson equation thereby making the discrete equation more nonzero elements and no longer symmetric the most straightforward consequences include increased amount of data storage increased number of floating point operations and data movements between the cpu and memory guillaume et al 2017 which will be a bottleneck for high performance according to the modern computer architecture williams et al 2009 in addition the choice of iterative solver for asymmetric systems is limited a simplified algorithm has been proposed to eliminate the asymmetry by directly establishing the non hydrostatic pressure correction equation and continuity equation in the σ coordinate system kocyigit et al 2002 berntsen and furnes 2005 then the discrete poisson equation for the dynamic pressure again becomes compact and symmetric however these new equations are not equivalent to the original equations in a mathematical sense keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 another simplified algorithm explicitly discretizes the mixed derivative terms in the transformed continuity equation and adopts an iterative strategy to solve a series of 7 diagonal systems for the dynamic pressure heggelund et al 2004 however it remains uncertain which strategy solving an asymmetric 15 diagonal system or a series of symmetric 7 diagonal systems is more efficient kanarska et al 2007 in contrast to these fully implicit or fully explicit treatments for the mixed derivative terms liu et al 2016 proposed a partially implicit finite difference pifd scheme for the σ coordinate system to include the effect of the dynamic pressure which ensures that the structure of the resulting discrete equation is the same as that of the z coordinate system liu et al 2016 the pifd scheme has been implemented in a serial ocean model named merf and several test cases have verified its reliability another novel algorithm proposed by guillaume et al 2017 implements a compact and symmetric 15 point stencil for the poisson system based on the fact that the velocity contains covariant and contravariant sets of components due to the nonorthogonality of the grid but a new complex equation form must be derived which may not be applicable to existing hydrostatic ocean model kernels regarding the other difficulty many research efforts have demonstrated that a high resolution is necessary for realistic non hydrostatic simulations dietrich and lin argued that realistic simulations of convective adjustment via non hydrostatic models may be limited by a coarse resolution dietrich and lin 2002 with decreasing grid size the non hydrostatic effects on the momentum field and tracer field increase berntsen et al 2009 thus the difference between the simulation results of regional ocean circulation obtained with hydrostatic and non hydrostatic ocean models increases e g tseng et al 2005 sannino et al 2014 magaldi and haine 2015 kämpf and backhaus confirmed that accurate non hydrostatic plume dynamics may require a spatial resolution of o 10 m kämpf and backhaus 1998 vitousek also verified that satisfaction of δ x h 1 may be a notable resolution requirement in non hydrostatic ocean modeling vitousek and fringer 2011 where δ x is the horizontal grid spacing and h 1 is the depth of the internal interface however the size of the poisson discrete equation exponentially increases with decreasing grid spacing a grid switching strategy between hydrostatic and non hydrostatic regions may be a feasible approach to reduce the size of this discrete equation botelho et al 2009 however obtaining the switching time and the grid used as a priori information is not always convenient changing the vertical coordinate may be another way to reduce the size of the discrete equation as reported by vitousek and fringer 2014 the adoption of isopycnal coordinate system reduced the number of grid points in the vertical direction but a new set of equations needs to be derived which is costly for the existing hydrostatic model kernels fortunately although a sufficient grid resolution is necessary to capture the density and flow structure in simulations of density flows and mass transport problems with non hydrostatic models accurate prediction of the dynamic pressure may only require a few vertical layers van reeuwijk 2002 thus shi et al 2015 developed a pressure decimation and interpolation pdi scheme for the nhwave non hydrostatic wave model and rijnsdorp et al 2017 proposed a subgrid approach for efficient simulations of wave motion and the vertical structure of the wave induced mean flow field in coastal regions in terms of the computation efficiency both methods have exhibited the potential of determining the dynamic pressure and the velocity field with different sets of grids in addition high efficiency parallel computation is another important way to solve the issue of the very high computational expense of non hydrostatic models as mentioned above although determining the dynamic pressure and the velocity field based on different sets of grids may greatly reduce the size of the discrete poisson equation the asymmetry and additional nonzero elements caused by the nonorthogonality of the σ coordinate system remain which limit the choice of solver and may impose a negative influence on the convergence rate of the solver in this study the sivl semi implicit and variable layers scheme is designed to quickly calculate the dynamic pressure and is implemented in a non hydrostatic ocean model i e merf v3 0 the sivl scheme combines the advantages of both the pifd and pdi schemes it provides the freedom to choose the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers as required and simultaneously eliminates the asymmetry and additional nonzero elements in addition merf v3 0 is constructed based on numerical calculation framework openarray huang et al 2019 and petsc portable extensible toolkit for scientific computation these bring an implicit parallelism and a concise code structure for the model here implicit parallelism indicates that parallel operations are not explicitly contained in the model code and are all implicitly encapsulated in openarray and petsc the main contributions of this study are in two aspects first the newly proposed sivl scheme further improved the computational efficiency of the dynamic pressure module through decreasing the scale of the poisson equation for the dynamic pressure second the merf was reconstructed using auto parallel numerical calculation frameworks openarray and petsc which brought a high parallel efficiency and an enhanced portability for the model the new version of merf with a highly computational efficiency provides the possibility for the simulation of non hydrostatic ocean processes in a large space area our paper is organized as follows the model description is briefly introduced in section 2 validation experiments with merf v3 0 are provided in section 3 a discussion and performance evaluation are presented in section 4 in section 5 our conclusion is drawn and future work is envisioned 2 model description 2 1 introduction of merf the complete governing equations of merf describing the free surface non hydrostatic process baroclinic forcing turbulent mixing and complete thermodynamics have been presented in detail in liu et al 2016 the model also includes a module of diagnosing the water residence time lin and liu 2019a with a high efficiency advection scheme i e tvdal total variation diminishing scheme with alternating limiters lin and liu 2019b only equations associated with the dynamic pressure are described in the present study regarding the advantages of the natural representation of the bottom and surface boundary layers the terrain following σ coordinate system developed by phillips 1957 is adopted in the model the two equation turbulence closure model my2 5 proposed by mellor and yamada 1982 is implemented in the model to determine the values of the vertical viscosity coefficient and diffusion coefficient hu et al 2020 the smagorinsky equation is employed to calculate the value of the horizontal viscosity coefficient it should be noted that the turbulence parameterization scheme is beyond the scope of the present study and all viscosity and diffusion coefficients are defined as constants in the subsequent validation experiments for calculation convenience the widely used pressure decomposition method is adopted to decompose the total pressure into hydrostatic and dynamic components following the common practice in many non hydrostatic ocean models e g marshall et al 1997b berntsen and furnes 2005 fringer et al 2006 kanarska et al 2007 lai et al 2010a shi et al 2015 the finite difference scheme on the staggered arakawa c grid is used for the spatial discretization of the governing equations scalar variables except for the dynamic pressure are located at the centers of the grid cells and velocity components are located at the cell interfaces with u located at the east west interfaces v located at the north south interfaces and w and ω located at the upper lower interfaces where u v and w follow the same definitions of liu et al 2016 and ω denotes the vertical velocity in the sigma coordinate it should be noted that the dynamic pressure q is located at the upper lower interfaces for a natural representation of the boundary conditions the above variable arrangement is shown in fig 1 in this model the pressure correction method is used the pressure correction method splits the time integration of the momentum equations into a hydrostatic predictor step and a non hydrostatic corrector step in the non hydrostatic corrector step the dynamic pressure is calculated the dynamic pressure q at the new time step is updated according to q n 1 a q n q where a is the weight coefficient of the dynamic pressure at the previous time step q n which is set to 0 5 considering the stability issue casulli 1999 and q is the dynamic pressure correction which is solved via the poisson equation of q 2 2 semi implicit and variable layers scheme for q calculation 2 2 1 the pifd scheme to clearly reveal the improvement in the sivl scheme over the pifd scheme the pifd scheme is first briefly introduced below more details have been presented in liu et al 2016 first a provisional velocity field u is determined through time integration of the momentum equations excluding the pg z q component of the dynamic pressure gradient 2 1 u u n δ t r pg σ n q where u d u d v d w t d is the total water depth δ t is the time step and r denotes all other terms advection coriolis force hydrostatic pressure gradient explicit component of the dynamic pressure gradient and diffusion excluding the implicit component of the dynamic pressure gradient pg z and pg σ are expressed as pg z q d ρ 0 q x d ρ 0 q y 1 ρ 0 q σ t pg σ q d ρ 0 a 1 q σ d ρ 0 a 2 q σ 0 t with a 1 σ x and a 2 σ y the explicit treatment of pg σ n q is achieved by approximation q n 1 q n and hence q 1 a q n second the poisson equation eq 2 4 of the dynamic pressure correction q can be obtained by substituting the pressure correction equation eq 2 2 into the continuity equation eq 2 3 2 2 u n 1 u δ t pg z n 1 q 2 3 u x v y a 1 u σ a 2 v σ 1 d w σ n 1 0 2 q x 2 2 q y 2 1 d 2 2 q σ 2 ρ 0 δ t u x v y a 1 u σ a 2 v σ 1 d w σ 2 4 a 1 2 1 a q n x σ a 2 2 1 a q n y σ the mixed derivative terms in eq 2 4 are explicitly treated with q 1 a q n after proper discretization with the space centered finite difference scheme a 7 diagonal linear system is derived whose coefficient matrix is symmetric and positive definite when the poisson equation eq 2 4 is inverted the velocity field at the new time step can be updated according to eq 2 2 as we mentioned in section 1 although the pifd scheme eliminates the asymmetry and the additional nonzero elements caused by the nonorthogonality of the σ coordinate system the exponentially increasing size of the discrete poisson equation due to the high resolution simulation trend is unacceptable 2 2 2 the sivl scheme in the work of van reeuwijk 2002 and shi et al 2015 the possibility of solving the dynamic pressure and velocity based on different sets of grids has been examined this method has shown a great potential to improve the efficiency of dynamic pressure computation based on a coarse grid after which the result is again interpolated to a fine grid the sivl scheme is designed to provide the freedom to choose the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers as required and eliminate both the asymmetry and additional nonzero elements the difference between the sivl scheme and the pifd scheme is reflected in the non hydrostatic corrector phase in contrast to the second step of the pifd scheme a provisional velocity field u v w on the dynamic pressure layers is first constructed via the piecewise averaging method as expressed in eq 2 5 the dynamic pressure layers are configured at the initial stage of the model according to a parameter rdv the rdv is defined as the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers which denotes the relative resolution of the coarse grid over the fine grid if rdv 1 the coarse grid will get the same resolution with the fine grid and the sivl scheme will go back to the pifd scheme the horizontal resolution and variable arrangement on the dynamic pressure layers are the same as those on the velocity layers both the layer thickness of the dynamic pressure and velocity layers are uniform in the sigma coordinate it should be noted that there is no need to make the dynamic pressure layers part of the velocity layers in eq 2 5 k is an index related to the dynamic pressure layer n k is the number of u v points within the dynamic pressure layer k and i k is the smallest velocity layer index within the dynamic pressure layer k m k and j k follow the same definitions as those of n k and i k and a small difference may occur because of the different arrangements of the u v points and w points 2 5 u k 1 n k i i k i k n k 1 u i v k 1 n k i i k i k n k 1 v i w k 1 m k j j k j k m k 1 w j assuming the intermediate dynamic pressure correction is denoted as q a poisson equation for q can then be derived by substituting the pressure correction equation eq 2 6 into the continuity equation eq 2 7 2 6 u n 1 u δ t pg z n 1 q 2 7 u x v y a 1 u σ a 2 v σ 1 d w σ n 1 0 with the use of the definition of q n 1 a q n q and an approximate explicit treatment of q n 1 q n regarding the mixed derivative terms the poisson equation for q can be simplified as 2 q x 2 2 q y 2 1 d 2 2 q σ 2 ρ 0 δ t u x v y a 1 u σ a 2 v σ 1 d w σ 2 8 a 1 2 1 a q n x σ a 2 2 1 a q n y σ after the poisson equation eq 2 8 is solved the cubic spline interpolation method is used to determine the dynamic pressure correction q on the velocity layers and the new velocity field can then be updated according to eq 2 2 2 3 implicit parallelism merf v3 0 is constructed based on numerical calculation framework openarray for more details on openarray please refer to huang et al 2019 compared to the existing non hydrostatic ocean models merf v3 0 is concise and has the potential to be compatible with different hardware architectures because of the advantages of openarray thus the model code hardly requires modification when modelers change computing platforms these characteristics make merf v3 0 more attractive than machine dependent models after proper discretization of the poisson equation eq 2 8 with the space centered finite difference method a 7 diagonal sparse linear system of n x n y n p n x n y n p is derived where n x and n y are the total numbers of grid cells along two horizontal directions respectively and n p is the number of dynamic pressure layers this linear system shares the same structure as that of the discrete poisson equation in the z coordinate system petsc is used to solve the discrete poisson equation and the restarted generalized minimal residual gmres method with a default block jacobi preconditioner is adopted in the subsequent experiments similarly petsc is employed to solve the equation of water elevation η n 1 which is discretized with the semi implicit θ method because no cross process operations are explicitly contained in the model code and all parallel operations are implicitly encapsulated in openarray and petsc merf v3 0 exhibits a characteristic of implicit parallelism 2 4 solution procedure of merf v3 0 the solution procedure of merf v3 0 includes time stepping for the free surface and baroclinic equations inversion of the poisson equation to yield a nondivergent velocity field time stepping for the conservation equations and updating of the state equation a split scheme is used in merf v3 0 for the separate calculations of the different physical processes the main steps are described below and a flow diagram is shown in fig 2 step 1 the provisional velocity field u is calculated by the time stepping of the momentum equations excluding the pressure gradient force associated with the sea surface elevation considering the definition q n 1 a q n q in the pressure correction method the explicit component a q n of the dynamic pressure is also included in this step 2 9 u u n δ t d n r pg z n a q pg σ n a q where u u v w and r denotes all other terms advection coriolis force baroclinic pressure gradient and diffusion excluding the pressure gradient associated with the sea surface elevation and dynamic pressure step 2 the semi implicit θ method is applied to calculate the sea surface elevation a five diagonal linear system with unknowns of η n 1 is derived after discretization with the space centered finite difference method then the provisional horizontal velocities u and v can be updated after the inversion of this linear system step 3 the sivl scheme is used in this step the provisional velocity field u is first updated with 2 10 u u δ t d n 1 pg σ n q where q is explicitly approximated as 1 a q n then the provisional velocity field u v w on the dynamic pressure layers can be determined with eq 2 5 after proper discretization of eq 2 8 via the space centered finite difference method a 7 diagonal linear system of the intermediate dynamic pressure correction q is derived a 1 q i j k a 2 q i 1 j k a 3 q i 1 j k a 4 q i j 1 k 2 11 a 5 q i j 1 k a 6 q i j k 1 a 7 q i j k 1 r h s coefficients a 1 a 7 of eq 2 11 are similar to those presented in liu et al 2016 here we apply the boundary condition q 0 at the free surface and q n 0 at other boundaries where n is the normal vector of the boundaries after the linear system eq 2 11 is inverted the dynamic pressure correction q on the velocity layers can be obtained via the cubic spline interpolation method along the vertical direction with boundary condition 2 q σ 2 0 at the free surface and bottom then the new velocity field u can be derived according to eq 2 2 and the total dynamic pressure q n 1 can be updated as a q n q step 4 after the velocity field u at time step n 1 is updated the contravariant vertical velocity ω at the new time step can be determined then the two equation turbulence closure model is called to determine the values of the vertical viscosity coefficient k m and diffusion coefficient k h and the smagorinsky equation is adopted to determine the value of the horizontal viscosity coefficient a m step 5 the temperature t and salinity s are updated by advancing the conservation equations in time only the time stepping procedure for t is presented here and the procedure for s is similar the intermediate temperature field t is determined by d n 1 t d n t n δ t l n 1 2 t n where l n 1 2 d n 1 2 u n 1 2 x d n 1 2 v n 1 2 y ω n 1 2 σ and u n 1 2 1 2 u n u n 1 v n 1 2 1 2 v n v n 1 ω n 1 2 1 2 ω n ω n 1 d n 1 2 1 2 d n d n 1 the tvd scheme with several limiters such as superbee van leer and minmod is provided in merf v3 0 to discretize tracer advection and the upwind scheme is also an available option in our model in terms of stability horizontal dissipation and vertical dissipation are treated explicitly and implicitly respectively then a series of tridiagonal linear systems must be solved to determine the t field at the next time step step 6 after the temperature t and salinity s are updated the density ρ can be updated with the state equation 3 validation experiments several numerical simulations of relevant geophysical problems where the dynamic behaviors have been widely studied in the literature are performed in this section these test cases are usually selected as benchmarks in the assessment of the accuracy and efficiency of a newly proposed non hydrostatic model fringer et al 2006 ma et al 2012 liu et al 2016 the standing wave in a deep basin surface solitary wave propagating along a flat bottom channel lock exchange problem periodic wave propagating over a submerged bar and tidally induced internal wave are simulated with merf v3 0 all validation experiments are performed with a 2d configuration for simplicity only 4 grid cells are configured in the y direction and all gradients and velocities are set to zero along this direction following the experiment configurations reported in liu et al 2016 extension to 3d simulation is straightforward the numerical results obtained with merf v3 0 are compared to analytical solution experimental data and numerical results retrieved from published literature for the surface solitary wave propagation the lock exchange problem and the tidally induced internal wave the numerical results under rdv 1 are selected as baselines to examine the accuracy of the sivl scheme in these cases 3 1 standing wave in a deep basin this case characterizes short surface gravity wave oscillation with small amplitude in a rectangular basin this case is simple to set up and can be used to expose important wave dispersion behavior since the hydrostatic approximation is not applicable to short waves with a wavelength of a comparable magnitude to that of the water depth this case has become a common test for a newly proposed non hydrostatic model casulli 1999 lai et al 2010a ma et al 2012 in addition the analytical solution of the standing wave in a closed 2d x σ basin makes the comparison more reliable in the present study the length and depth of the basin are both set to 10 m and the numerical results are compared to the analytical solution the initial state of the water elevation is described as 3 1 η 1 10 c o s π x 10 according to lai et al 2010a the period of this standing wave is 3 59 s and the linearized analytical solution is given by eq 3 2 3 2 η 1 10 c o s π x 10 c o s 2 π t t a uniform grid spacing of 0 1 m is used to discretize the basin in the horizontal direction forty uniform σ layers are employed for the velocity field a time step of 0 001 s is used to integrate this model over 20 s numerical simulations with different values of rdv are compared to the analytical solution at the position of x 0 05 m comparison details are shown in fig 3 to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the sivl scheme the l 2 norm is defined as follows l 2 m 1 m x m x m 2 m 1 m x m 2 where m is the total number of data and x m and x m denote the data retrieved from the numerical simulations with different values of rdv and the baseline respectively here the linearized analytical solution serves as the baseline the l 2 norm for the surface elevation after 5 simulation periods is shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the l 2 norm is greatly reduced when the value of rdv increases from 0 05 to 0 2 at r d v 0 2 the l 2 norm does not exceed 0 015 and gradually decreases 3 2 surface solitary wave propagating along a flat bottom channel in this section solitary wave propagation along a flat bottom channel is considered to test merf v3 0 according to the potential flow theory a solitary wave with a small amplitude propagates across a flat bottom at a constant speed without any change in its form as long as the viscosity is neglected the non hydrostatic effect is notable in the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion in this test the solitary wave is considered to have an amplitude of 1 8 m and propagates from the west to the east along a channel where the depth is 10 m and the length is 1000 m a uniform grid spacing of 1 m is applied to discretize the channel in the horizontal direction and 40 uniform σ layers are used for the velocity field using a time step of 0 1 s this model is integrated over 70 s at the beginning time series of the surface elevation and velocity field are specified at the west inflow boundary based on the analytical solution laitone 1960 numerical results throughout the whole propagation process are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the sivl scheme demonstrates its potential in this test with the value of rdv set to 0 15 this model produces the same simulation result as the baseline similarly the l 2 norm is used to measure the deviation from the baseline as shown in fig 6 the l 2 norm is greatly reduced when the value of rdv increases from 0 05 to 0 1 when the value of rdv increases to 0 15 the l 2 norm decreases to approximately 0 02 thereafter a further increase in the value of rdv exerts no significant impact on the l 2 norm 3 3 the lock exchange problem lock exchange is a representative and notable non hydrostatic process describing the gravitational adjustment between two fluids of different densities hereafter referred to as heavy and light fluids the lock exchange problem has become a standard test case to assess the capacity of a non hydrostatic ocean model to simulate density currents berntsen et al 2006 fringer et al 2006 kanarska et al 2007 shi et al 2015 liu et al 2016 in this study the lock exchange experiment is carried out in a rectangular tank of 0 8 m in length and 0 1 m in depth following the configuration adopted by lai et al 2010a the density is assumed to be linearly proportional to the salinity and given as 3 3 ρ 999 972 1 0 75 1 0 4 s where s x z 1 3592 x 0 4 m 0 x 0 4 m the light fluid is freshwater with a zero salinity and the heavy fluid is set to saline water with a salinity of 1 3592 psu a wall is placed in the middle of the tank to separate these two fluids at the beginning a uniform grid spacing of 0 001 m is used to discretize the tank in the horizontal direction and 100 uniform σ layers are used for the velocity field both the horizontal and vertical viscosity coefficients are assumed to remain constant and set to 1 1 0 6 m 2 s 1 free slip boundary conditions are considered at the tank boundaries this case is integrated over 200 s and the time step is 0 005 s the gravitational adjustment process began after the wall was removed at t 0 s the heavy fluid flowed underneath the light fluid and the velocities across the density interface were of opposite signs because of the kelvin helmholtz instability a chain of vortices developed along the density interface when the velocity shear exceeded the restoring force which was determined by the density gradient lai et al 2010a when the heads of the two liquids reached the boundaries reflection at the boundary reverted the direction of this gravity driven flow and a complex flow field was then developed characterized by strong mixing overturning and vortices not shown in the figure figs 7 and 8 show the ability of merf v3 0 to simulate this gravity current and to capture instability structures which is in good agreement with the results described in the published literature berntsen et al 2006 kanarska et al 2007 lai et al 2010a liu et al 2016 as shown in fig 9 the l 2 norm rapidly decreased when the value of rdv increased from 0 1 to 0 25 thereafter the impact on accuracy improvement with increasing value of rdv became less notable 3 4 periodic wave propagating over a bar when a periodic wave propagates over a submerged bar the interactions between the generated harmonics and nonlinear waves are complicated capturing these wave interactions is a great challenge for many numerical models this case was considered to test the ability of merf v3 0 to reproduce these complex wave interactions following ma et al 2012 the experiment was carried out in a wave flume as shown in fig 10 the flume was 0 4 m in depth and 30 m in length and a submerged bar was designed in the middle of the flume which was 0 3 m in height a 1 20 slope and a 1 10 slope were configured at the front and leeward sides of the bar respectively according to the work of larsen and dancy 1983 sponge layers were configured in the last 5 m of this flume to absorb any incident short waves a periodic wave with an amplitude of 0 01 m was imposed at the position of x 0 m with a period of 2 02 s the flume was discretized with a uniform grid spacing of 0 025 m in the horizontal direction and 40 uniform σ layers were employed for the velocity field with the use of a time step of 0 01 s this model was integrated over 40 s as the wave shoaled bound higher harmonics were formed which steepened the wave front as the water depth increased on the leeward side of the bar these harmonics became unbound and each propagated at a different phase speed hence complex wave patterns were generated experimental data measured by beji and battjes 1993 1994 was used for the comparison fig 11 shows a comparison between the numerical results and the experimental data in terms of the surface elevation and subfigures a f correspond to locations a f of the wave gauges as shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows that the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental data and the numerical simulation with rdv 0 7 produced almost the same results as the baseline the average l 2 norm at 6 observation locations for different values of rdv is shown in fig 12 during the period from 33 s to 39 s 3 5 tidally induced lee wave in coastal ocean modeling the simulation of internal waves is important as mentioned by xing and davies 2006 and berntsen et al 2009 considering non hydrostatic dynamics is necessary and of great importance for the simulation of tidally induced internal lee waves based on existing investigations of the region of loch etive via both measurements and numerical simulations an idealized experiment was designed to test merf v3 0 in the simulation of tidally induced mixing and flow following the work of xing and davies 2006 berntsen et al 2009 and liu et al 2016 an idealized topography and initial temperature stratification were defined according to berntsen et al 2009 as shown in fig 13 a uniform grid spacing of 10 m was used to discretize the model domain and 40 uniform σ layers were adopted for the velocity field an m 2 barotropic tide was forced into the model domain at the western open boundary by specifying the horizontal velocity u u 0 s i n ω m 2 t m s where u 0 0 3 m s and ω m 2 0 000140526 rad s a time step of 0 2 s was used to integrate the model over 6 h during which the maximum flow crossed the sill there occurred inflow through the western boundary and outflow through the eastern boundary throughout the entire simulation period at the flood stage internal waves were generated on the leeward side of the sill and flow separation was observed near the top of the sill generating convective vortices above the isotherm oscillation incident waves were trapped and gradually amplified during this period thus cross isotherm internal mixing was induced as shown in fig 14 as mentioned by keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 the flow was strongly supercritical during the period from t 8 to t 4 and the complexity of these physical processes was far greater than that of the tank scale experiment therefore it is not suitable to consider the l 2 norm to measure the instantaneous deviation in this experiment because a small shift in space and time of the vortices may generate large pointwise discrepancies referring to the case of wave propagating over bar a comparative experiment was performed with rdv 0 7 as shown in fig 14 the general features of these two instantaneous temperature fields were similar and robust except that the exact positions of the vortices were slightly shifted the numerical solutions heavily depend on the choice of viscosity and diffusivity values keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 and there remains a large degree of uncertainty in the choice of the parameterization schemes griffies 2004 in addition capturing the mean flow characteristics and correctly representing the hydrography are more important than capturing all details as reported in many studies berntsen et al 2009 thus we computed the time averaged fields t and u according to 3 4 t u 1 t 8 t 8 t 4 t u d t we also applied the norm defined in keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 to measure the difference between the two time averaged horizontal velocity fields of u 1 and u 2 3 5 u 1 u 2 1 a r e a 0 m 2000 m h x η x t u 1 u 2 2 d x d z where a r e a denotes the area of the integration domain and h is the static water depth as shown in figs 15 and 16 the time averaged fields were very robust and almost the same and the difference between the two time averaged horizontal velocity fields computed with eq 3 5 was 0 0046 m s for comparison two sets of constant values for the viscosity and diffusivity were used to reveal the sensitivity of the model results to subgrid scale closure following the settings used by keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 s1 a set of low values namely a m 1 0 1 m 2 s 1 k m 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 a h 1 0 7 m 2 s 1 k h 1 0 7 m 2 s 1 s2 a set of high values namely a m 1 m 2 s 1 k m 1 0 2 m 2 s 1 a h 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 k h 1 0 4 m 2 s 1 the choices for these values were arbitrary to a certain extent but competent to filter out the grid scale noise and represent the small scale physical processes simultaneously then the difference between the model results based on the above two settings may provide insights into the errors due to the uncertainty of parameterization the difference between the two time averaged horizontal velocity fields corresponding to these two parameter settings was 0 1162 m s which is consistent with fig 10 in keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 in terms of the magnitude the difference caused by the sivl scheme was at least one order smaller than the discrepancy caused by the parameterization uncertainty 4 discussion 4 1 guide the choice of rdv in numerical ocean modeling errors occur due to many factors such as the lack of high quality measurements inaccurate initial and boundary conditions and uncertainties in subgrid scale closure berntsen et al 2009 keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 an error range of 5 was selected in the present study in hydrodynamic simulations the propagation speed of a wave is an important variable the sivl scheme substantially reduces the size of the discrete poisson equation but the value of rdv must be carefully determined to capture the wave characteristics the number of dynamic pressure layers must be sufficient a relation coupling the wave shortness k h to the number of dynamic pressure layers is derived for the standing wave case the closed basin described in section 3 1 is used and the length remains unchanged while the depth is varied the initial water elevation is again defined with eq 3 1 so the wavelength λ is fixed and the wavenumber k 2 π λ remains constant then the wave shortness k h only changes with the depth we vary the basin depth to guarantee a relatively broad spectrum of the wave shortness from shallow water waves k h 0 31 to deep water waves k h 25 13 it is expected that this model captures the characteristics of deeper water waves with increasing number of dynamic pressure layers to generate various wave shortness the basin depth is set to 1 0 m 2 5 m 5 0 m 10 0 m 20 0 m 40 0 m and 80 0 m as indicated in table 1 according to the linear wave theory the analytical phase velocity c a n a is determined as 4 1 c a n a g λ 2 π t a n h 2 π h λ where λ is the wavelength fig 17 shows the propagation speed simulated with different numbers of dynamic pressure layers for the integrity of the figure any missing values at h 1 0 m 2 5 m 5 0 m 10 0 m and 20 0 m are replaced with values retrieved from simulations with rdv 1 which is obviously acceptable the dependence of the normalized propagation speed on the wave shortness and the number of dynamic pressure layers is shown in fig 18 however figs 17 and 18 are not intuitive enough considering the important variable δ σ p which denotes the relative layer thickness of the dynamic pressure layer a new figure can be generated if we treat the normalized propagation speed as a function of the dimensionless variable k h δ σ p all curves coincide as shown in fig 19 then visual observation of fig 19 leads to an empirical relation in which the wave propagation speed can be simulated at a 95 accuracy based on 4 2 k h δ σ p 1 if the number of velocity layers is n σ the relative layer thickness of the dynamic pressure layer δ σ p can be denoted as 1 n σ r d v then the empirical relation 4 2 can be rewritten as 4 3 r d v k h n σ note that the above is not a necessary condition for stability and violation of this condition does not lead to an unstable solution but rather to a severely underestimated propagation speed as demonstrated in validation experiments the choice of rdv varies case by case and is strongly related to the specific non hydrostatic process the empirical relation 4 3 was derived for the case of standing wave and the general formula considered to guide the choice of rdv in other cases currently remains unclear where the trial and error approach is needed in problems without prior knowledge an initial rdv value of 0 7 is recommended which is empirically determined based on the validation experiments it is worth mentioning that the sivl scheme is not appropriate to use in horizontal directions the study results of berntsen et al 2009 showed that the effects of dynamic pressure on the velocity and temperature fields are sensitive to the grid resolution shi et al 2015 also pointed out that the effects of dynamic pressure gradient are more significant in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction in the non hydrostatic baroclinic processes these studies suggest the interpolation of the dynamic pressure in the horizontal grid can introduce a big bias for the non hydrostatic model in addition huang et al 2016 pointed out that the aspect ratio has an impact on the condition number of the coefficient matrix thus the aspect ratio of the model grid could have an effect on the efficiency of solving the poisson equation of the dynamic pressure however this kind of impact is common to the fifd scheme pifd scheme and sivl scheme the sivl scheme reduces the computation by reducing the matrix size of the poisson equation of the dynamic pressure compared with the pifd and fifd schemes therefore the adjustment of model grid could have limited effect on the improvement of the computational efficiency of the sivl scheme relative to the pifd and fifd schemes 4 2 performance evaluation all test cases of this study were conducted on the commercial auxiliary computing platform of the national supercomputing center in wuxi each computing node consists of 2 intel xeon e5 12 cores 2 5 ghz processors and all nodes are connected through the infiniband network the newly proposed sivl scheme with a properly selected value of rdv has been verified to be reliable in the five ideal test cases above the cpu time of these test cases in serial operations were shown in tables 2 and 3 no turbulence closure calculation was included because the diffusion coefficients were considered to be constant as shown in table 2 the sivl scheme substantially reduced the cpu time of the whole simulation process compared with the fully implicit finite difference scheme fifd the speedup of the sivl scheme ranged from 1 14 to 5 40 and compared with the pifd scheme the speedup of the sivl scheme ranged from 1 08 to 3 75 this speedup strongly depends on the value of rdv and the runtime proportion of the non hydrostatic module because the sivl scheme is designed for the dynamic pressure calculation table 3 shows the speedup of the sivl scheme in the non hydrostatic calculation phase compared with the fifd scheme and the pifd scheme according to table 3 the speedup of the sivl scheme over the pifd scheme is approximately consistent with the value of rdv which is in line with our expectations the main purpose of the sivl scheme is to improve the computational efficiency of 3d large scale simulation when rdv was set to the empirical value of 0 7 the speedup of the cpu cost of the sivl scheme to that of the pifd scheme was about 30 for the whole model and about 50 for the non hydrostatic calculation phase in a strong scaling test as shown in fig 20 in general the sivl scheme has more potential for a larger scale of simulation and situations where the cpu cost of the non hydrostatic module is higher 4 3 scalability the advantage of the sivl scheme is to choose the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers according to the problem nature a low ratio may be sufficient in weakly non hydrostatic problems and a high ratio even equal to unity may be needed in problems of a strongly non hydrostatic nature benefitting from the advantages of openarray and petsc the parallel performance of merf v3 0 without additional parallel optimization was quite impressive the 3d lee wave case which is an extension of the 2d lee wave case except that the 2d sill is replaced with an isolated seamount was considered to reveal the performance of merf v3 0 in a parallel environment by fixing the total size of the model to 2048 2048 50 fig 21 shows the strong scaling evaluation of merf v3 0 the performance of 64 processes distributed on 4 nodes was regarded as the baseline as shown in fig 21 a our model achieved a parallel efficiency level of 87 8 in the strong scaling test with a parallelism of 3584 processes when we used 3840 processes the parallel efficiency reduced to 82 8 as the most time consuming part of a non hydrostatic ocean model the strong scaling evaluation of the non hydrostatic solver is also shown in fig 21 b the solver achieved parallel efficiency levels of 95 1 and 92 6 with the parallelisms of 3584 processes and 3840 processes respectively in the weak scaling test a fixed model size of 64 64 50 was assigned to each process and the number of processes was increased from 64 to 3840 considering the performance of 64 processes distributed on 4 nodes as the baseline fig 22 shows the weak scalability of merf v3 0 as shown in fig 22 a our model achieved a parallel efficiency level of 84 1 in the weak scaling test with a parallelism of 3584 processes and the parallel efficiency reduced to 82 0 in the case with a parallelism of 3840 processes similarly the weak scaling evaluation of the non hydrostatic solver is shown in fig 22 b where parallel efficiency levels of 90 0 and 88 8 were achieved with the parallelisms of 3584 processes and 3840 processes respectively in general regardless of the strong scaling test or the weak scaling test merf v3 0 attains a good parallel efficiency the parallel efficiency of merf v3 0 strongly depends on the parallel efficiency of the solver for the dynamic pressure however when the number of processes exceeds 3584 the parallel efficiency of the model is mainly limited by the parallel framework openarray which has been shown in figs 21 and 22 and will be further examined in our next study 5 conclusion in the present study a parallel non hydrostatic ocean model namely merf v3 0 is constructed based on openarray and petsc which result in implicit parallelism and a concise code structure of the model implicit parallelism indicates that parallel operations are not explicitly contained in the model code but are all implicitly encapsulated in openarray and petsc a semi implicit and variable layers scheme is proposed to improve the computational efficiency of the dynamic pressure this enables a freedom of choosing the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers according to the nature of the problem with a low ratio for weakly non hydrostatic problems and a high ratio for strongly non hydrostatic problems in general an empirical ratio of 0 7 is recommended according to the validation experiments in addition an empirical relation is obtained for the surface gravity wave problem which may provide some guidance on the value of rdv for this kind of problem five ideal tests are performed to test the ability of merf v3 0 in non hydrostatic simulation all results are consistent with the analytical solution experimental data and numerical results reported in the published literature in addition the good parallel efficiency of merf v3 0 is validated in the strong and weak scaling tests in the parallelism tests with more than 3584 processes the parallel efficiency of merf v3 0 is mainly limited by the parallel framework openarray which is beyond the scope of this article and will be further examined in our next study the recommended ratio of 0 7 achieves an overall speedup of more than 30 without introducing unacceptable errors which is at least one order

23880,non hydrostatic ocean models are widely required in coastal and estuarine studies but are limited in their application due to their very high computational expense to alleviate this issue this study developed a highly computationally efficient non hydrostatic ocean model named merf v3 0 the third version of the marine environment research and forecasting model in which a semi implicit and variable layers sivl scheme is proposed for dynamic pressure calculation the sivl scheme provides freedom to choose the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers as required moreover the model adopted numerical calculation framework openarray and petsc portable extensible toolkit for scientific computation to achieve implicit parallelism and a concise code structure five classical numerical experiments were performed to validate the simulation capacity of this non hydrostatic ocean model including the standing wave in a closed basin surface solitary wave lock exchange problem periodic wave over a bar and tidally induced internal lee wave the numerical simulation results are consistent with the analytical solutions and experimental data published in the literature benefitting from the advantages of openarray and petsc merf v3 0 achieves an 87 8 parallel efficiency in the strong scaling test and an 84 1 parallel efficiency in the weak scaling test on 3584 processes whereas the openarray limits the parallel efficiency of merf v3 0 on more processes which is beyond the scope of this article and will be further examined in our next study keywords non hydrostatic terrain following coordinate implicit parallelism 1 introduction in the early stage and the following decades of numerical ocean model development hydrostatic approximation has been widely used in ocean dynamics research due to the lack of computing resources the hydrostatic approximation is acceptable under conditions where the ratio between the horizontal scale and vertical scale of motion is much larger than 1 and vertical acceleration is small enough to be ignored such as wind driven currents and the antarctic circumpolar current however large scale motions are influenced by many small scale processes including but not limited to deep convection killworth 1983 marshall and schott 1999 turbulent mixing induced by tides munk and wunsch 1998 ledwell et al 2000 and descending gravity currents price and baringer 1994 gordon et al 2001 these significant small scale processes remain unresolved and are only empirically parameterized because the model resolution is insufficient and many ocean models whose target is large scale circulation are based on the hydrostatic approximation matsumura and hasumi 2008 with the growth in computing power and interest in processes at small scale and submeso scale nikurashin et al 2013 callies et al 2015 molemaker et al 2015 the non hydrostatic model is urgently required in the ocean modeling community to our knowledge there have been several ocean models that are capable of handling non hydrostatic physics namely mitgcm m i t general circulation model marshall et al 1997b pom princeton ocean model kanarska and maderich 2003 bom bergen ocean model heggelund et al 2004 suntans stanford unstructured non hydrostatic terrain following adaptive navier stokes simulator fringer et al 2006 roms regional ocean modeling system kanarska et al 2007 fvcom finite volume community ocean model lai et al 2010a symphonie auclair et al 2011 getm general estuarine transport model klingbeil and burchard 2013 and merf the marine environment research and forecasting model liu et al 2016 the non hydrostatic ocean model can make marine scientists capable of investigating almost the entire range of internal waves convection processes symmetric instability etc in realistic ocean motions guillaume et al 2017 and bridge the gap with les large eddy simulation sullivan et al 1994 it has become a necessary tool for the simulation of surface dispersive waves ma et al 2012 chen et al 2014 and internal waves xing and davies 2006 berntsen et al 2008 lai et al 2010b zhang et al 2011 compared to the model based on hydrostatic approximation a practical non hydrostatic ocean model faces at least two difficulties first the vertical momentum equation should be prognostic and an additional 3d poisson equation in regard to the dynamic pressure needs to be solved at each time step which will be more challenging in σ coordinate system second a high resolution configuration is necessary for the simulation of non hydrostatic processes which yields a large linear system of equations for the dynamic pressure the number of these coupled equations is almost the same as the number of grid points and solving this system properly has been a classical hpc high performance computing problem owing to these two difficulties the runtime of the non hydrostatic model is several to dozens of times longer than that of its hydrostatic counterpart fringer et al 2006 shi et al 2015 magaldi and haine 2015 vertical velocity determination is straightforward which is not time consuming and imitates the operations in the horizontal direction regarding the requirement to solve the 3d poisson equation of the dynamic pressure one possible way to circumvent this problem is to simultaneously relax the incompressibility constraint the pressure can then be obtained by integrating the compressible physics over time considering the cfl constraint a time splitting technique is necessary because sound wave is introduced and its phase speed is much larger than the advective speed this approach has been implemented in the wrf weather research and forecasting atmosphere model skamarock and klemp 2008 however the ratio between the sound wave speed and the advective speed in the ocean is almost two orders of magnitude larger than that in the atmosphere which adversely impacts the required time splitting decelerating the sound wave speed with artificial incompressibility can reduce the time splitting ratio but the divergence freeness constraint of the flow is not strictly satisfied as mentioned by guillaume et al 2017 the direct method may possibly avoid inversion of the 3d poisson equation orlanski 1981 dietrich et al 1987 dietrich and ko 1994 lin and dietrich 1994 dietrich and lin 2002 klingbeil and burchard 2013 the missing contribution of the dynamic pressure is considered by explicitly integrating the non hydrostatic term in the vertical momentum equation and applying this integration term in the subsequent horizontal pressure gradient calculations however the decoupled treatment of momentum equations generates stability issues which may degrade the efficiency and applicability of this straightforward approach more iterations and smaller time steps may alleviate these instability issues this approach can only be applied to the weakly non hydrostatic area where the flow is nearly hydrostatic but does not replace the classical pressure correcting projection method klingbeil and burchard 2013 the pressure correcting projection method is the most commonly used technique to consider the non hydrostatic effect in existing hydrostatic model kernels this is not a specific method but refers to a class of methods that rely on fractional step and implicit coupling of momentum and continuity equations chorin 1968 van kan 1986 bell et al 1989 kanarska et al 2007 at the fractional step a provisional velocity field is first obtained by integrating the momentum equations over time ignoring the contribution of dynamic pressure subsequently the implicit coupling of the momentum and continuity equations induces the requirement to solve an additional 3d poisson equation for the dynamic pressure in the orthogonal z coordinate system a compact and symmetric 7 point stencil is usually adopted in poisson equation discretization and classical iterative algorithms such as cg and gmres handle this problem well marshall et al 1997a in the nonorthogonal terrain following σ coordinate system which has been widely used in many non hydrostatic ocean models e g kanarska and maderich 2003 berntsen and furnes 2005 lai et al 2010a auclair et al 2011 ma et al 2012 due to its ability to suitably represent the complex topography of the ocean nonorthogonality greatly deteriorates the 3d poisson equation for the dynamic pressure for instance the horizontal pressure gradient cannot be simply calculated based on the finite difference between two neighboring horizontal grid cells application of the chain rule in the gradient and divergence operators generates additional mixed derivative terms and a larger stencil usually a 15 point stencil is needed to discretize the poisson equation thereby making the discrete equation more nonzero elements and no longer symmetric the most straightforward consequences include increased amount of data storage increased number of floating point operations and data movements between the cpu and memory guillaume et al 2017 which will be a bottleneck for high performance according to the modern computer architecture williams et al 2009 in addition the choice of iterative solver for asymmetric systems is limited a simplified algorithm has been proposed to eliminate the asymmetry by directly establishing the non hydrostatic pressure correction equation and continuity equation in the σ coordinate system kocyigit et al 2002 berntsen and furnes 2005 then the discrete poisson equation for the dynamic pressure again becomes compact and symmetric however these new equations are not equivalent to the original equations in a mathematical sense keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 another simplified algorithm explicitly discretizes the mixed derivative terms in the transformed continuity equation and adopts an iterative strategy to solve a series of 7 diagonal systems for the dynamic pressure heggelund et al 2004 however it remains uncertain which strategy solving an asymmetric 15 diagonal system or a series of symmetric 7 diagonal systems is more efficient kanarska et al 2007 in contrast to these fully implicit or fully explicit treatments for the mixed derivative terms liu et al 2016 proposed a partially implicit finite difference pifd scheme for the σ coordinate system to include the effect of the dynamic pressure which ensures that the structure of the resulting discrete equation is the same as that of the z coordinate system liu et al 2016 the pifd scheme has been implemented in a serial ocean model named merf and several test cases have verified its reliability another novel algorithm proposed by guillaume et al 2017 implements a compact and symmetric 15 point stencil for the poisson system based on the fact that the velocity contains covariant and contravariant sets of components due to the nonorthogonality of the grid but a new complex equation form must be derived which may not be applicable to existing hydrostatic ocean model kernels regarding the other difficulty many research efforts have demonstrated that a high resolution is necessary for realistic non hydrostatic simulations dietrich and lin argued that realistic simulations of convective adjustment via non hydrostatic models may be limited by a coarse resolution dietrich and lin 2002 with decreasing grid size the non hydrostatic effects on the momentum field and tracer field increase berntsen et al 2009 thus the difference between the simulation results of regional ocean circulation obtained with hydrostatic and non hydrostatic ocean models increases e g tseng et al 2005 sannino et al 2014 magaldi and haine 2015 kämpf and backhaus confirmed that accurate non hydrostatic plume dynamics may require a spatial resolution of o 10 m kämpf and backhaus 1998 vitousek also verified that satisfaction of δ x h 1 may be a notable resolution requirement in non hydrostatic ocean modeling vitousek and fringer 2011 where δ x is the horizontal grid spacing and h 1 is the depth of the internal interface however the size of the poisson discrete equation exponentially increases with decreasing grid spacing a grid switching strategy between hydrostatic and non hydrostatic regions may be a feasible approach to reduce the size of this discrete equation botelho et al 2009 however obtaining the switching time and the grid used as a priori information is not always convenient changing the vertical coordinate may be another way to reduce the size of the discrete equation as reported by vitousek and fringer 2014 the adoption of isopycnal coordinate system reduced the number of grid points in the vertical direction but a new set of equations needs to be derived which is costly for the existing hydrostatic model kernels fortunately although a sufficient grid resolution is necessary to capture the density and flow structure in simulations of density flows and mass transport problems with non hydrostatic models accurate prediction of the dynamic pressure may only require a few vertical layers van reeuwijk 2002 thus shi et al 2015 developed a pressure decimation and interpolation pdi scheme for the nhwave non hydrostatic wave model and rijnsdorp et al 2017 proposed a subgrid approach for efficient simulations of wave motion and the vertical structure of the wave induced mean flow field in coastal regions in terms of the computation efficiency both methods have exhibited the potential of determining the dynamic pressure and the velocity field with different sets of grids in addition high efficiency parallel computation is another important way to solve the issue of the very high computational expense of non hydrostatic models as mentioned above although determining the dynamic pressure and the velocity field based on different sets of grids may greatly reduce the size of the discrete poisson equation the asymmetry and additional nonzero elements caused by the nonorthogonality of the σ coordinate system remain which limit the choice of solver and may impose a negative influence on the convergence rate of the solver in this study the sivl semi implicit and variable layers scheme is designed to quickly calculate the dynamic pressure and is implemented in a non hydrostatic ocean model i e merf v3 0 the sivl scheme combines the advantages of both the pifd and pdi schemes it provides the freedom to choose the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers as required and simultaneously eliminates the asymmetry and additional nonzero elements in addition merf v3 0 is constructed based on numerical calculation framework openarray huang et al 2019 and petsc portable extensible toolkit for scientific computation these bring an implicit parallelism and a concise code structure for the model here implicit parallelism indicates that parallel operations are not explicitly contained in the model code and are all implicitly encapsulated in openarray and petsc the main contributions of this study are in two aspects first the newly proposed sivl scheme further improved the computational efficiency of the dynamic pressure module through decreasing the scale of the poisson equation for the dynamic pressure second the merf was reconstructed using auto parallel numerical calculation frameworks openarray and petsc which brought a high parallel efficiency and an enhanced portability for the model the new version of merf with a highly computational efficiency provides the possibility for the simulation of non hydrostatic ocean processes in a large space area our paper is organized as follows the model description is briefly introduced in section 2 validation experiments with merf v3 0 are provided in section 3 a discussion and performance evaluation are presented in section 4 in section 5 our conclusion is drawn and future work is envisioned 2 model description 2 1 introduction of merf the complete governing equations of merf describing the free surface non hydrostatic process baroclinic forcing turbulent mixing and complete thermodynamics have been presented in detail in liu et al 2016 the model also includes a module of diagnosing the water residence time lin and liu 2019a with a high efficiency advection scheme i e tvdal total variation diminishing scheme with alternating limiters lin and liu 2019b only equations associated with the dynamic pressure are described in the present study regarding the advantages of the natural representation of the bottom and surface boundary layers the terrain following σ coordinate system developed by phillips 1957 is adopted in the model the two equation turbulence closure model my2 5 proposed by mellor and yamada 1982 is implemented in the model to determine the values of the vertical viscosity coefficient and diffusion coefficient hu et al 2020 the smagorinsky equation is employed to calculate the value of the horizontal viscosity coefficient it should be noted that the turbulence parameterization scheme is beyond the scope of the present study and all viscosity and diffusion coefficients are defined as constants in the subsequent validation experiments for calculation convenience the widely used pressure decomposition method is adopted to decompose the total pressure into hydrostatic and dynamic components following the common practice in many non hydrostatic ocean models e g marshall et al 1997b berntsen and furnes 2005 fringer et al 2006 kanarska et al 2007 lai et al 2010a shi et al 2015 the finite difference scheme on the staggered arakawa c grid is used for the spatial discretization of the governing equations scalar variables except for the dynamic pressure are located at the centers of the grid cells and velocity components are located at the cell interfaces with u located at the east west interfaces v located at the north south interfaces and w and ω located at the upper lower interfaces where u v and w follow the same definitions of liu et al 2016 and ω denotes the vertical velocity in the sigma coordinate it should be noted that the dynamic pressure q is located at the upper lower interfaces for a natural representation of the boundary conditions the above variable arrangement is shown in fig 1 in this model the pressure correction method is used the pressure correction method splits the time integration of the momentum equations into a hydrostatic predictor step and a non hydrostatic corrector step in the non hydrostatic corrector step the dynamic pressure is calculated the dynamic pressure q at the new time step is updated according to q n 1 a q n q where a is the weight coefficient of the dynamic pressure at the previous time step q n which is set to 0 5 considering the stability issue casulli 1999 and q is the dynamic pressure correction which is solved via the poisson equation of q 2 2 semi implicit and variable layers scheme for q calculation 2 2 1 the pifd scheme to clearly reveal the improvement in the sivl scheme over the pifd scheme the pifd scheme is first briefly introduced below more details have been presented in liu et al 2016 first a provisional velocity field u is determined through time integration of the momentum equations excluding the pg z q component of the dynamic pressure gradient 2 1 u u n δ t r pg σ n q where u d u d v d w t d is the total water depth δ t is the time step and r denotes all other terms advection coriolis force hydrostatic pressure gradient explicit component of the dynamic pressure gradient and diffusion excluding the implicit component of the dynamic pressure gradient pg z and pg σ are expressed as pg z q d ρ 0 q x d ρ 0 q y 1 ρ 0 q σ t pg σ q d ρ 0 a 1 q σ d ρ 0 a 2 q σ 0 t with a 1 σ x and a 2 σ y the explicit treatment of pg σ n q is achieved by approximation q n 1 q n and hence q 1 a q n second the poisson equation eq 2 4 of the dynamic pressure correction q can be obtained by substituting the pressure correction equation eq 2 2 into the continuity equation eq 2 3 2 2 u n 1 u δ t pg z n 1 q 2 3 u x v y a 1 u σ a 2 v σ 1 d w σ n 1 0 2 q x 2 2 q y 2 1 d 2 2 q σ 2 ρ 0 δ t u x v y a 1 u σ a 2 v σ 1 d w σ 2 4 a 1 2 1 a q n x σ a 2 2 1 a q n y σ the mixed derivative terms in eq 2 4 are explicitly treated with q 1 a q n after proper discretization with the space centered finite difference scheme a 7 diagonal linear system is derived whose coefficient matrix is symmetric and positive definite when the poisson equation eq 2 4 is inverted the velocity field at the new time step can be updated according to eq 2 2 as we mentioned in section 1 although the pifd scheme eliminates the asymmetry and the additional nonzero elements caused by the nonorthogonality of the σ coordinate system the exponentially increasing size of the discrete poisson equation due to the high resolution simulation trend is unacceptable 2 2 2 the sivl scheme in the work of van reeuwijk 2002 and shi et al 2015 the possibility of solving the dynamic pressure and velocity based on different sets of grids has been examined this method has shown a great potential to improve the efficiency of dynamic pressure computation based on a coarse grid after which the result is again interpolated to a fine grid the sivl scheme is designed to provide the freedom to choose the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers as required and eliminate both the asymmetry and additional nonzero elements the difference between the sivl scheme and the pifd scheme is reflected in the non hydrostatic corrector phase in contrast to the second step of the pifd scheme a provisional velocity field u v w on the dynamic pressure layers is first constructed via the piecewise averaging method as expressed in eq 2 5 the dynamic pressure layers are configured at the initial stage of the model according to a parameter rdv the rdv is defined as the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers which denotes the relative resolution of the coarse grid over the fine grid if rdv 1 the coarse grid will get the same resolution with the fine grid and the sivl scheme will go back to the pifd scheme the horizontal resolution and variable arrangement on the dynamic pressure layers are the same as those on the velocity layers both the layer thickness of the dynamic pressure and velocity layers are uniform in the sigma coordinate it should be noted that there is no need to make the dynamic pressure layers part of the velocity layers in eq 2 5 k is an index related to the dynamic pressure layer n k is the number of u v points within the dynamic pressure layer k and i k is the smallest velocity layer index within the dynamic pressure layer k m k and j k follow the same definitions as those of n k and i k and a small difference may occur because of the different arrangements of the u v points and w points 2 5 u k 1 n k i i k i k n k 1 u i v k 1 n k i i k i k n k 1 v i w k 1 m k j j k j k m k 1 w j assuming the intermediate dynamic pressure correction is denoted as q a poisson equation for q can then be derived by substituting the pressure correction equation eq 2 6 into the continuity equation eq 2 7 2 6 u n 1 u δ t pg z n 1 q 2 7 u x v y a 1 u σ a 2 v σ 1 d w σ n 1 0 with the use of the definition of q n 1 a q n q and an approximate explicit treatment of q n 1 q n regarding the mixed derivative terms the poisson equation for q can be simplified as 2 q x 2 2 q y 2 1 d 2 2 q σ 2 ρ 0 δ t u x v y a 1 u σ a 2 v σ 1 d w σ 2 8 a 1 2 1 a q n x σ a 2 2 1 a q n y σ after the poisson equation eq 2 8 is solved the cubic spline interpolation method is used to determine the dynamic pressure correction q on the velocity layers and the new velocity field can then be updated according to eq 2 2 2 3 implicit parallelism merf v3 0 is constructed based on numerical calculation framework openarray for more details on openarray please refer to huang et al 2019 compared to the existing non hydrostatic ocean models merf v3 0 is concise and has the potential to be compatible with different hardware architectures because of the advantages of openarray thus the model code hardly requires modification when modelers change computing platforms these characteristics make merf v3 0 more attractive than machine dependent models after proper discretization of the poisson equation eq 2 8 with the space centered finite difference method a 7 diagonal sparse linear system of n x n y n p n x n y n p is derived where n x and n y are the total numbers of grid cells along two horizontal directions respectively and n p is the number of dynamic pressure layers this linear system shares the same structure as that of the discrete poisson equation in the z coordinate system petsc is used to solve the discrete poisson equation and the restarted generalized minimal residual gmres method with a default block jacobi preconditioner is adopted in the subsequent experiments similarly petsc is employed to solve the equation of water elevation η n 1 which is discretized with the semi implicit θ method because no cross process operations are explicitly contained in the model code and all parallel operations are implicitly encapsulated in openarray and petsc merf v3 0 exhibits a characteristic of implicit parallelism 2 4 solution procedure of merf v3 0 the solution procedure of merf v3 0 includes time stepping for the free surface and baroclinic equations inversion of the poisson equation to yield a nondivergent velocity field time stepping for the conservation equations and updating of the state equation a split scheme is used in merf v3 0 for the separate calculations of the different physical processes the main steps are described below and a flow diagram is shown in fig 2 step 1 the provisional velocity field u is calculated by the time stepping of the momentum equations excluding the pressure gradient force associated with the sea surface elevation considering the definition q n 1 a q n q in the pressure correction method the explicit component a q n of the dynamic pressure is also included in this step 2 9 u u n δ t d n r pg z n a q pg σ n a q where u u v w and r denotes all other terms advection coriolis force baroclinic pressure gradient and diffusion excluding the pressure gradient associated with the sea surface elevation and dynamic pressure step 2 the semi implicit θ method is applied to calculate the sea surface elevation a five diagonal linear system with unknowns of η n 1 is derived after discretization with the space centered finite difference method then the provisional horizontal velocities u and v can be updated after the inversion of this linear system step 3 the sivl scheme is used in this step the provisional velocity field u is first updated with 2 10 u u δ t d n 1 pg σ n q where q is explicitly approximated as 1 a q n then the provisional velocity field u v w on the dynamic pressure layers can be determined with eq 2 5 after proper discretization of eq 2 8 via the space centered finite difference method a 7 diagonal linear system of the intermediate dynamic pressure correction q is derived a 1 q i j k a 2 q i 1 j k a 3 q i 1 j k a 4 q i j 1 k 2 11 a 5 q i j 1 k a 6 q i j k 1 a 7 q i j k 1 r h s coefficients a 1 a 7 of eq 2 11 are similar to those presented in liu et al 2016 here we apply the boundary condition q 0 at the free surface and q n 0 at other boundaries where n is the normal vector of the boundaries after the linear system eq 2 11 is inverted the dynamic pressure correction q on the velocity layers can be obtained via the cubic spline interpolation method along the vertical direction with boundary condition 2 q σ 2 0 at the free surface and bottom then the new velocity field u can be derived according to eq 2 2 and the total dynamic pressure q n 1 can be updated as a q n q step 4 after the velocity field u at time step n 1 is updated the contravariant vertical velocity ω at the new time step can be determined then the two equation turbulence closure model is called to determine the values of the vertical viscosity coefficient k m and diffusion coefficient k h and the smagorinsky equation is adopted to determine the value of the horizontal viscosity coefficient a m step 5 the temperature t and salinity s are updated by advancing the conservation equations in time only the time stepping procedure for t is presented here and the procedure for s is similar the intermediate temperature field t is determined by d n 1 t d n t n δ t l n 1 2 t n where l n 1 2 d n 1 2 u n 1 2 x d n 1 2 v n 1 2 y ω n 1 2 σ and u n 1 2 1 2 u n u n 1 v n 1 2 1 2 v n v n 1 ω n 1 2 1 2 ω n ω n 1 d n 1 2 1 2 d n d n 1 the tvd scheme with several limiters such as superbee van leer and minmod is provided in merf v3 0 to discretize tracer advection and the upwind scheme is also an available option in our model in terms of stability horizontal dissipation and vertical dissipation are treated explicitly and implicitly respectively then a series of tridiagonal linear systems must be solved to determine the t field at the next time step step 6 after the temperature t and salinity s are updated the density ρ can be updated with the state equation 3 validation experiments several numerical simulations of relevant geophysical problems where the dynamic behaviors have been widely studied in the literature are performed in this section these test cases are usually selected as benchmarks in the assessment of the accuracy and efficiency of a newly proposed non hydrostatic model fringer et al 2006 ma et al 2012 liu et al 2016 the standing wave in a deep basin surface solitary wave propagating along a flat bottom channel lock exchange problem periodic wave propagating over a submerged bar and tidally induced internal wave are simulated with merf v3 0 all validation experiments are performed with a 2d configuration for simplicity only 4 grid cells are configured in the y direction and all gradients and velocities are set to zero along this direction following the experiment configurations reported in liu et al 2016 extension to 3d simulation is straightforward the numerical results obtained with merf v3 0 are compared to analytical solution experimental data and numerical results retrieved from published literature for the surface solitary wave propagation the lock exchange problem and the tidally induced internal wave the numerical results under rdv 1 are selected as baselines to examine the accuracy of the sivl scheme in these cases 3 1 standing wave in a deep basin this case characterizes short surface gravity wave oscillation with small amplitude in a rectangular basin this case is simple to set up and can be used to expose important wave dispersion behavior since the hydrostatic approximation is not applicable to short waves with a wavelength of a comparable magnitude to that of the water depth this case has become a common test for a newly proposed non hydrostatic model casulli 1999 lai et al 2010a ma et al 2012 in addition the analytical solution of the standing wave in a closed 2d x σ basin makes the comparison more reliable in the present study the length and depth of the basin are both set to 10 m and the numerical results are compared to the analytical solution the initial state of the water elevation is described as 3 1 η 1 10 c o s π x 10 according to lai et al 2010a the period of this standing wave is 3 59 s and the linearized analytical solution is given by eq 3 2 3 2 η 1 10 c o s π x 10 c o s 2 π t t a uniform grid spacing of 0 1 m is used to discretize the basin in the horizontal direction forty uniform σ layers are employed for the velocity field a time step of 0 001 s is used to integrate this model over 20 s numerical simulations with different values of rdv are compared to the analytical solution at the position of x 0 05 m comparison details are shown in fig 3 to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the sivl scheme the l 2 norm is defined as follows l 2 m 1 m x m x m 2 m 1 m x m 2 where m is the total number of data and x m and x m denote the data retrieved from the numerical simulations with different values of rdv and the baseline respectively here the linearized analytical solution serves as the baseline the l 2 norm for the surface elevation after 5 simulation periods is shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the l 2 norm is greatly reduced when the value of rdv increases from 0 05 to 0 2 at r d v 0 2 the l 2 norm does not exceed 0 015 and gradually decreases 3 2 surface solitary wave propagating along a flat bottom channel in this section solitary wave propagation along a flat bottom channel is considered to test merf v3 0 according to the potential flow theory a solitary wave with a small amplitude propagates across a flat bottom at a constant speed without any change in its form as long as the viscosity is neglected the non hydrostatic effect is notable in the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion in this test the solitary wave is considered to have an amplitude of 1 8 m and propagates from the west to the east along a channel where the depth is 10 m and the length is 1000 m a uniform grid spacing of 1 m is applied to discretize the channel in the horizontal direction and 40 uniform σ layers are used for the velocity field using a time step of 0 1 s this model is integrated over 70 s at the beginning time series of the surface elevation and velocity field are specified at the west inflow boundary based on the analytical solution laitone 1960 numerical results throughout the whole propagation process are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the sivl scheme demonstrates its potential in this test with the value of rdv set to 0 15 this model produces the same simulation result as the baseline similarly the l 2 norm is used to measure the deviation from the baseline as shown in fig 6 the l 2 norm is greatly reduced when the value of rdv increases from 0 05 to 0 1 when the value of rdv increases to 0 15 the l 2 norm decreases to approximately 0 02 thereafter a further increase in the value of rdv exerts no significant impact on the l 2 norm 3 3 the lock exchange problem lock exchange is a representative and notable non hydrostatic process describing the gravitational adjustment between two fluids of different densities hereafter referred to as heavy and light fluids the lock exchange problem has become a standard test case to assess the capacity of a non hydrostatic ocean model to simulate density currents berntsen et al 2006 fringer et al 2006 kanarska et al 2007 shi et al 2015 liu et al 2016 in this study the lock exchange experiment is carried out in a rectangular tank of 0 8 m in length and 0 1 m in depth following the configuration adopted by lai et al 2010a the density is assumed to be linearly proportional to the salinity and given as 3 3 ρ 999 972 1 0 75 1 0 4 s where s x z 1 3592 x 0 4 m 0 x 0 4 m the light fluid is freshwater with a zero salinity and the heavy fluid is set to saline water with a salinity of 1 3592 psu a wall is placed in the middle of the tank to separate these two fluids at the beginning a uniform grid spacing of 0 001 m is used to discretize the tank in the horizontal direction and 100 uniform σ layers are used for the velocity field both the horizontal and vertical viscosity coefficients are assumed to remain constant and set to 1 1 0 6 m 2 s 1 free slip boundary conditions are considered at the tank boundaries this case is integrated over 200 s and the time step is 0 005 s the gravitational adjustment process began after the wall was removed at t 0 s the heavy fluid flowed underneath the light fluid and the velocities across the density interface were of opposite signs because of the kelvin helmholtz instability a chain of vortices developed along the density interface when the velocity shear exceeded the restoring force which was determined by the density gradient lai et al 2010a when the heads of the two liquids reached the boundaries reflection at the boundary reverted the direction of this gravity driven flow and a complex flow field was then developed characterized by strong mixing overturning and vortices not shown in the figure figs 7 and 8 show the ability of merf v3 0 to simulate this gravity current and to capture instability structures which is in good agreement with the results described in the published literature berntsen et al 2006 kanarska et al 2007 lai et al 2010a liu et al 2016 as shown in fig 9 the l 2 norm rapidly decreased when the value of rdv increased from 0 1 to 0 25 thereafter the impact on accuracy improvement with increasing value of rdv became less notable 3 4 periodic wave propagating over a bar when a periodic wave propagates over a submerged bar the interactions between the generated harmonics and nonlinear waves are complicated capturing these wave interactions is a great challenge for many numerical models this case was considered to test the ability of merf v3 0 to reproduce these complex wave interactions following ma et al 2012 the experiment was carried out in a wave flume as shown in fig 10 the flume was 0 4 m in depth and 30 m in length and a submerged bar was designed in the middle of the flume which was 0 3 m in height a 1 20 slope and a 1 10 slope were configured at the front and leeward sides of the bar respectively according to the work of larsen and dancy 1983 sponge layers were configured in the last 5 m of this flume to absorb any incident short waves a periodic wave with an amplitude of 0 01 m was imposed at the position of x 0 m with a period of 2 02 s the flume was discretized with a uniform grid spacing of 0 025 m in the horizontal direction and 40 uniform σ layers were employed for the velocity field with the use of a time step of 0 01 s this model was integrated over 40 s as the wave shoaled bound higher harmonics were formed which steepened the wave front as the water depth increased on the leeward side of the bar these harmonics became unbound and each propagated at a different phase speed hence complex wave patterns were generated experimental data measured by beji and battjes 1993 1994 was used for the comparison fig 11 shows a comparison between the numerical results and the experimental data in terms of the surface elevation and subfigures a f correspond to locations a f of the wave gauges as shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows that the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental data and the numerical simulation with rdv 0 7 produced almost the same results as the baseline the average l 2 norm at 6 observation locations for different values of rdv is shown in fig 12 during the period from 33 s to 39 s 3 5 tidally induced lee wave in coastal ocean modeling the simulation of internal waves is important as mentioned by xing and davies 2006 and berntsen et al 2009 considering non hydrostatic dynamics is necessary and of great importance for the simulation of tidally induced internal lee waves based on existing investigations of the region of loch etive via both measurements and numerical simulations an idealized experiment was designed to test merf v3 0 in the simulation of tidally induced mixing and flow following the work of xing and davies 2006 berntsen et al 2009 and liu et al 2016 an idealized topography and initial temperature stratification were defined according to berntsen et al 2009 as shown in fig 13 a uniform grid spacing of 10 m was used to discretize the model domain and 40 uniform σ layers were adopted for the velocity field an m 2 barotropic tide was forced into the model domain at the western open boundary by specifying the horizontal velocity u u 0 s i n ω m 2 t m s where u 0 0 3 m s and ω m 2 0 000140526 rad s a time step of 0 2 s was used to integrate the model over 6 h during which the maximum flow crossed the sill there occurred inflow through the western boundary and outflow through the eastern boundary throughout the entire simulation period at the flood stage internal waves were generated on the leeward side of the sill and flow separation was observed near the top of the sill generating convective vortices above the isotherm oscillation incident waves were trapped and gradually amplified during this period thus cross isotherm internal mixing was induced as shown in fig 14 as mentioned by keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 the flow was strongly supercritical during the period from t 8 to t 4 and the complexity of these physical processes was far greater than that of the tank scale experiment therefore it is not suitable to consider the l 2 norm to measure the instantaneous deviation in this experiment because a small shift in space and time of the vortices may generate large pointwise discrepancies referring to the case of wave propagating over bar a comparative experiment was performed with rdv 0 7 as shown in fig 14 the general features of these two instantaneous temperature fields were similar and robust except that the exact positions of the vortices were slightly shifted the numerical solutions heavily depend on the choice of viscosity and diffusivity values keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 and there remains a large degree of uncertainty in the choice of the parameterization schemes griffies 2004 in addition capturing the mean flow characteristics and correctly representing the hydrography are more important than capturing all details as reported in many studies berntsen et al 2009 thus we computed the time averaged fields t and u according to 3 4 t u 1 t 8 t 8 t 4 t u d t we also applied the norm defined in keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 to measure the difference between the two time averaged horizontal velocity fields of u 1 and u 2 3 5 u 1 u 2 1 a r e a 0 m 2000 m h x η x t u 1 u 2 2 d x d z where a r e a denotes the area of the integration domain and h is the static water depth as shown in figs 15 and 16 the time averaged fields were very robust and almost the same and the difference between the two time averaged horizontal velocity fields computed with eq 3 5 was 0 0046 m s for comparison two sets of constant values for the viscosity and diffusivity were used to reveal the sensitivity of the model results to subgrid scale closure following the settings used by keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 s1 a set of low values namely a m 1 0 1 m 2 s 1 k m 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 a h 1 0 7 m 2 s 1 k h 1 0 7 m 2 s 1 s2 a set of high values namely a m 1 m 2 s 1 k m 1 0 2 m 2 s 1 a h 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 k h 1 0 4 m 2 s 1 the choices for these values were arbitrary to a certain extent but competent to filter out the grid scale noise and represent the small scale physical processes simultaneously then the difference between the model results based on the above two settings may provide insights into the errors due to the uncertainty of parameterization the difference between the two time averaged horizontal velocity fields corresponding to these two parameter settings was 0 1162 m s which is consistent with fig 10 in keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 in terms of the magnitude the difference caused by the sivl scheme was at least one order smaller than the discrepancy caused by the parameterization uncertainty 4 discussion 4 1 guide the choice of rdv in numerical ocean modeling errors occur due to many factors such as the lack of high quality measurements inaccurate initial and boundary conditions and uncertainties in subgrid scale closure berntsen et al 2009 keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 an error range of 5 was selected in the present study in hydrodynamic simulations the propagation speed of a wave is an important variable the sivl scheme substantially reduces the size of the discrete poisson equation but the value of rdv must be carefully determined to capture the wave characteristics the number of dynamic pressure layers must be sufficient a relation coupling the wave shortness k h to the number of dynamic pressure layers is derived for the standing wave case the closed basin described in section 3 1 is used and the length remains unchanged while the depth is varied the initial water elevation is again defined with eq 3 1 so the wavelength λ is fixed and the wavenumber k 2 π λ remains constant then the wave shortness k h only changes with the depth we vary the basin depth to guarantee a relatively broad spectrum of the wave shortness from shallow water waves k h 0 31 to deep water waves k h 25 13 it is expected that this model captures the characteristics of deeper water waves with increasing number of dynamic pressure layers to generate various wave shortness the basin depth is set to 1 0 m 2 5 m 5 0 m 10 0 m 20 0 m 40 0 m and 80 0 m as indicated in table 1 according to the linear wave theory the analytical phase velocity c a n a is determined as 4 1 c a n a g λ 2 π t a n h 2 π h λ where λ is the wavelength fig 17 shows the propagation speed simulated with different numbers of dynamic pressure layers for the integrity of the figure any missing values at h 1 0 m 2 5 m 5 0 m 10 0 m and 20 0 m are replaced with values retrieved from simulations with rdv 1 which is obviously acceptable the dependence of the normalized propagation speed on the wave shortness and the number of dynamic pressure layers is shown in fig 18 however figs 17 and 18 are not intuitive enough considering the important variable δ σ p which denotes the relative layer thickness of the dynamic pressure layer a new figure can be generated if we treat the normalized propagation speed as a function of the dimensionless variable k h δ σ p all curves coincide as shown in fig 19 then visual observation of fig 19 leads to an empirical relation in which the wave propagation speed can be simulated at a 95 accuracy based on 4 2 k h δ σ p 1 if the number of velocity layers is n σ the relative layer thickness of the dynamic pressure layer δ σ p can be denoted as 1 n σ r d v then the empirical relation 4 2 can be rewritten as 4 3 r d v k h n σ note that the above is not a necessary condition for stability and violation of this condition does not lead to an unstable solution but rather to a severely underestimated propagation speed as demonstrated in validation experiments the choice of rdv varies case by case and is strongly related to the specific non hydrostatic process the empirical relation 4 3 was derived for the case of standing wave and the general formula considered to guide the choice of rdv in other cases currently remains unclear where the trial and error approach is needed in problems without prior knowledge an initial rdv value of 0 7 is recommended which is empirically determined based on the validation experiments it is worth mentioning that the sivl scheme is not appropriate to use in horizontal directions the study results of berntsen et al 2009 showed that the effects of dynamic pressure on the velocity and temperature fields are sensitive to the grid resolution shi et al 2015 also pointed out that the effects of dynamic pressure gradient are more significant in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction in the non hydrostatic baroclinic processes these studies suggest the interpolation of the dynamic pressure in the horizontal grid can introduce a big bias for the non hydrostatic model in addition huang et al 2016 pointed out that the aspect ratio has an impact on the condition number of the coefficient matrix thus the aspect ratio of the model grid could have an effect on the efficiency of solving the poisson equation of the dynamic pressure however this kind of impact is common to the fifd scheme pifd scheme and sivl scheme the sivl scheme reduces the computation by reducing the matrix size of the poisson equation of the dynamic pressure compared with the pifd and fifd schemes therefore the adjustment of model grid could have limited effect on the improvement of the computational efficiency of the sivl scheme relative to the pifd and fifd schemes 4 2 performance evaluation all test cases of this study were conducted on the commercial auxiliary computing platform of the national supercomputing center in wuxi each computing node consists of 2 intel xeon e5 12 cores 2 5 ghz processors and all nodes are connected through the infiniband network the newly proposed sivl scheme with a properly selected value of rdv has been verified to be reliable in the five ideal test cases above the cpu time of these test cases in serial operations were shown in tables 2 and 3 no turbulence closure calculation was included because the diffusion coefficients were considered to be constant as shown in table 2 the sivl scheme substantially reduced the cpu time of the whole simulation process compared with the fully implicit finite difference scheme fifd the speedup of the sivl scheme ranged from 1 14 to 5 40 and compared with the pifd scheme the speedup of the sivl scheme ranged from 1 08 to 3 75 this speedup strongly depends on the value of rdv and the runtime proportion of the non hydrostatic module because the sivl scheme is designed for the dynamic pressure calculation table 3 shows the speedup of the sivl scheme in the non hydrostatic calculation phase compared with the fifd scheme and the pifd scheme according to table 3 the speedup of the sivl scheme over the pifd scheme is approximately consistent with the value of rdv which is in line with our expectations the main purpose of the sivl scheme is to improve the computational efficiency of 3d large scale simulation when rdv was set to the empirical value of 0 7 the speedup of the cpu cost of the sivl scheme to that of the pifd scheme was about 30 for the whole model and about 50 for the non hydrostatic calculation phase in a strong scaling test as shown in fig 20 in general the sivl scheme has more potential for a larger scale of simulation and situations where the cpu cost of the non hydrostatic module is higher 4 3 scalability the advantage of the sivl scheme is to choose the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers according to the problem nature a low ratio may be sufficient in weakly non hydrostatic problems and a high ratio even equal to unity may be needed in problems of a strongly non hydrostatic nature benefitting from the advantages of openarray and petsc the parallel performance of merf v3 0 without additional parallel optimization was quite impressive the 3d lee wave case which is an extension of the 2d lee wave case except that the 2d sill is replaced with an isolated seamount was considered to reveal the performance of merf v3 0 in a parallel environment by fixing the total size of the model to 2048 2048 50 fig 21 shows the strong scaling evaluation of merf v3 0 the performance of 64 processes distributed on 4 nodes was regarded as the baseline as shown in fig 21 a our model achieved a parallel efficiency level of 87 8 in the strong scaling test with a parallelism of 3584 processes when we used 3840 processes the parallel efficiency reduced to 82 8 as the most time consuming part of a non hydrostatic ocean model the strong scaling evaluation of the non hydrostatic solver is also shown in fig 21 b the solver achieved parallel efficiency levels of 95 1 and 92 6 with the parallelisms of 3584 processes and 3840 processes respectively in the weak scaling test a fixed model size of 64 64 50 was assigned to each process and the number of processes was increased from 64 to 3840 considering the performance of 64 processes distributed on 4 nodes as the baseline fig 22 shows the weak scalability of merf v3 0 as shown in fig 22 a our model achieved a parallel efficiency level of 84 1 in the weak scaling test with a parallelism of 3584 processes and the parallel efficiency reduced to 82 0 in the case with a parallelism of 3840 processes similarly the weak scaling evaluation of the non hydrostatic solver is shown in fig 22 b where parallel efficiency levels of 90 0 and 88 8 were achieved with the parallelisms of 3584 processes and 3840 processes respectively in general regardless of the strong scaling test or the weak scaling test merf v3 0 attains a good parallel efficiency the parallel efficiency of merf v3 0 strongly depends on the parallel efficiency of the solver for the dynamic pressure however when the number of processes exceeds 3584 the parallel efficiency of the model is mainly limited by the parallel framework openarray which has been shown in figs 21 and 22 and will be further examined in our next study 5 conclusion in the present study a parallel non hydrostatic ocean model namely merf v3 0 is constructed based on openarray and petsc which result in implicit parallelism and a concise code structure of the model implicit parallelism indicates that parallel operations are not explicitly contained in the model code but are all implicitly encapsulated in openarray and petsc a semi implicit and variable layers scheme is proposed to improve the computational efficiency of the dynamic pressure this enables a freedom of choosing the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers according to the nature of the problem with a low ratio for weakly non hydrostatic problems and a high ratio for strongly non hydrostatic problems in general an empirical ratio of 0 7 is recommended according to the validation experiments in addition an empirical relation is obtained for the surface gravity wave problem which may provide some guidance on the value of rdv for this kind of problem five ideal tests are performed to test the ability of merf v3 0 in non hydrostatic simulation all results are consistent with the analytical solution experimental data and numerical results reported in the published literature in addition the good parallel efficiency of merf v3 0 is validated in the strong and weak scaling tests in the parallelism tests with more than 3584 processes the parallel efficiency of merf v3 0 is mainly limited by the parallel framework openarray which is beyond the scope of this article and will be further examined in our next study the recommended ratio of 0 7 achieves an overall speedup of more than 30 without introducing unacceptable errors which is at least one order smaller than the discrepancy due to the parameterization uncertainty in terms of magnitude credit authorship contribution statement qiang tang conceptualization methodology software validation

23881,a 22 year 1994 2015 hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom global reanalysis is used to study the generation mechanism of the counter wind characteristic of the south china sea warm current scswc in winter seasons our analysis clearly demonstrates that the counter wind scswc in winter is driven by wind relaxation an extended empirical orthogonal function eeof analysis of the hourly sea surface height ssh and wind stresses reveals that the most dominant ssh mode is an ekman mode when the wind relaxes the ekman transport anomaly is offshore and generates a favorable cross shore ssh slope for the northeastward surface currents over the continental shelf mainly by geostrophic balance the alongshore pressure gradient force also increases when the wind relaxes and dominates the weak wind stresses to push the alongshore water northeastwards we also identify the region south of taiwan strait as the origin of the scswc instead of the hainan island or gulf of tonkin vietnam due to the dominant ekman dynamics keywords south china sea warm current wind relaxation ekman transport hycom reanalysis topographic waves origin of south china sea warm current 1 introduction the semi enclosed south china sea scs is the largest marginal sea in southeast asia fig 1a it connects with the east china sea through taiwan strait where the transport is generally northward chuang 1985 1986 even in the winter when northeasterly winds dominant the region the scs has a deep 4000 m central basin surrounded by a steep continental slope and links to the western pacific through luzon strait where the kuroshio flows northward to the east of the strait and sometimes loops and sheds eddies through it between taiwan and luzon the deep central basin is bordered by a continental shelf 150 250 km wide shallower than 200 m along the coast of china fig 1b in general the dynamics of the upper layer circulation in the central scs is fairly clear the seasonally reversing east asia monsoon wind plays a prominent role in forcing the seasonally varying circulation in the scs wyrtki 1961 shaw and chao 1994 northeasterly winds prevail over the region in winter while relatively weaker southwesterly winds dominate in summer the wind driven basin scale upper circulation is thus cyclonic in winter and anti cyclonic in summer however the same is not true regarding the dynamics over the continental shelf in the northern scs where a detailed topography is given in fig 1b the northern scs circulation is complex including the shelf and slope circulation shu et al 2018 summer vietnam offshore currents shu et al 2016 and the strong intra seasonal variability of the cross slope flow wang et al 2020b the subsurface speed maxima along the slope originates from kuroshio intrusion through luzon strait wang et al 2020a historically it was thought that the currents over the continental shelf in the northern scs flow from northeast toward the southwest during the winter under the intense influence of the northeasterly monsoon wyrtki 1961 until the south china sea warm current scswc was observed in winter by guan and chen 1964 from the measured current data obtained by anchored stations and hydrographic characteristic analysis guan and fang 2006 since then the scswc has been confirmed by repeated observations guan 1986 guan and fang 2006 and was demonstrated as a narrow and strong northeastward current persisting all winter long su and wang 1987 hu et al 2000 and originating from hainan island li et al 1992 hu et al 2000 guan and fang 2006 yang et al 2008 in winter it is sandwiched between the southwestward guangdong coastal currents and the southward currents along the shelf break that are related to the wind driven cyclonic gyre in the scs qiu et al 1985 guan 1993 the trademark of the scswc is its counter wind characteristic in winter over a half century after the scswc was discovered scientists have proposed different generation mechanisms trying to explain its counter wind behavior in winter the main proposed generation mechanism is kuroshio intrusion into the scs via luzon strait su and wang 1987 employed a barotropic model with zero wind stress and suggested that kuroshio intrusion plays an important role on the scswc formation the importance of the kuroshio is evident in zhong 1990 who indicated that the formation of the scswc is dynamically related with the south china sea branch current of the kuroshio ye 1994 demonstrated that the temperature increase from shelf to slope due to the warm winter kuroshio intrusion onto the slope could generate northeastward geostrophic flow xue et al 2004 also linked the formation of the scswc to kuroshio intrusion however the numerical experiments conducted by li et al 1993 demonstrated that kuroshio intrusion is not a requirement for the formation of scswc but may only strengthen the scswc their results showed that the scswc still exists but appears to be weaker if luzon strait is closed similar conclusions were made by yang et al 2008 another proposed generation mechanism is related to the alongshore sea surface height ssh slope zeng et al 1989 hypothesized that the alongshore pressure gradient induced by the water piled up to the east of hainan island forces the northeastward flow numerical results from barotropic simulations of the pacific ocean by li et al 1992 indicated that the combined effect of cross shore and alongshore sea surface slope is probably one of the major forces driving the scswc chao et al 1995 were the first one to suggest the wind relaxation as a possible generation mechanism when the alongshore ssh slope exists their numerical simulations clearly demonstrated the formation of the scswc when wind relaxes in winter they conclude that the monsoon driven southwestward coastal current piles up water downwind near hainan island to generate the alongshore ssh slope and the alongshore northeastward pressure gradient force drives the scswc after wind relaxes yang 2006 found that the northeastward currents over the shelf appears only when the northeast monsoon is weak based on mooring observations from 5 november 2001 and 21 march 2002 t1 in fig 1b of yang 2006 chiang et al 2008 examined the idea using a fine resolution 1 16 princeton ocean model pom and confirmed that the wind relaxation is the dominant winter scswc generation mechanism since the northeastward pressure gradient force takes place only when the northeasterly monsoon relaxes however our analysis has raised some questions regarding their results as shown in section 3 while mean ssh clearly shows a northeastward pressure gradient force there are no mean northeastward currents associated with it on the other hand hsueh and zhong 2004 explained the formation of the scswc applying the coastal arresting wave theory csanady 1978 but attributed the along shelf pressure gradient to the collision of the kuroshio intrusion currents with the continental slope besides the above research the following provide a different point of view on the formation of the scswc the importance of taiwan strait was illustrated through numerical simulations by yang et al 2008 who demonstrated that the scswc vanishes when the taiwan strait is closed they suggested that the scswc is a source and sink driven flow induced by the year round northward flow through the taiwan strait the wind stress applied to their numerical simulation is a 4 year average derived from observations by nasa satellite scatterometers wang et al 2010 performed numerical experiments using pom and revealed that it is the joint effect of baroclinicity and relief sarkisyan and ivanov 1971 that drives the scswc against the wind in winter this effect forces the slope currents to flow across the isobaths and veer to the right hand to feed the scswc the onshore pressure gradient force in the outer continental shelf that is favorable for the northeastern scswc comes from kuroshio intrusion via the luzon strait from the previous research it is fair to say that there still is no agreed upon consensus within the scientific community for the dynamics that controls the scswc recent observations and numerical simulations also question the persistency of the scswc in the winter which further complicates the situation fang et al 2015 did not observe the presence of scswc over the continental shelf in the northern scs in 2006 and 2007 and the hypothesis of wind relaxation chao et al 1995 chiang et al 2008 implies that the scswc is not persistent but rather intermittent but all of these previous numerical results agree on one or both of the two physical conditions an onshore and or a northeastward alongshore pressure gradient force exists over the continental shelf the onshore pressure gradient force indicates that the scswc is mainly in geostrophic balance in the cross shore direction while the northeastward alongshore pressure gradient force implies that the scswc is not in pure geostrophic balance but ageostrophic in alongshore direction which allows alongshore wind stress and or bottom friction to be important dynamically as well thus there are two sets of equations geostrophic in cross shore and ageostrophic in alongshore to govern the scswc the generation mechanism has to satisfy both and thus what mechanism generates both cross shore and alongshore pressure gradient that favor the formation of scswc in this study we further examine the generation mechanisms of the counter wind characteristic of the scswc in winter seasons results from a 22 year global hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom data assimilative reanalysis are carefully analyzed and demonstrated that wind relaxation is the dynamical reason driving the counter wind characteristic of the scswc in winter there are two pathways direct and indirect via which the scswc is affected by the wind relaxation the direct pathway is that wind stress represents a weaker force in the alongshore direction while the indirect pathway refers to the offshore ekman transport due to the wind relaxation previous studies on wind relaxation attribute the alongshore pressure gradient to the blockage effect of hainan island chao et al 1995 or the gulf of tonkin chiang et al 2008 but do not explain what sets up the onshore pressure gradient force this research differs and improves on previous studies in that 1 we found that wind relaxation sets up the favorable onshore pressure gradient force over the continental shelf via ekman transport contrary to chiang et al 2008 who stated that ekman transport is not important in maintaining the scswc 2 wind relaxation is the reason why there is a need to have alongshore counter wind currents in winter so that the bottom friction opposite to the current direction follows the northeasterly monsoon wind to balance the northeastward alongshore pressure gradient force 3 unlike previous numerical studies the hycom reanalysis was forced by hourly wind stress and fluxes and thus is able to fully resolve physical processes with a time period less than one day and 4 our findings indicate the scswc originates in the area south of taiwan strait contrary to the commonly accepted origination near hainan island or gulf of tonkin vietnam the same reanalysis was used to study the surface wind work input into the global ocean the high temporal resolution of the wind stress fills the missing wind work spectrum due to the low temporal forcing resolution i e daily and increases the wind work over ageostrophic currents significantly yu et al 2018 to our knowledge this is the first time that a reanalysis with such a high temporal resolution is used to study the scswc dynamics more details of the reanalysis are provided in section 2 this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the numerical model configuration and data assimilation method for the reanalysis section 3 describes the monthly mean characteristics of the ssh wind stresses and the surface currents basic statistics of the scswc are summarized in section 4 an extended empirical orthogonal function eeof analysis of the hourly ssh and wind stress anomalies are presented in section 5 the alongshore forcing comparison is performed in section 6 some of the observed features of the scswc are explained and the origin of the scswc is defined in section 7 which is followed by conclusions in section 8 2 numerical model and simulations a 22 year global hycom reanalysis from 1994 to 2015 is used for this study hycom is the ocean model component for the present operational us navy global ocean forecast system metzger et al 2014 a detailed description of hycom physics is provided by bleck 2002 a brief description of the model setup is presented below with emphasis on the numerical aspects that are most relevant to this study there are no tides or surface waves in this reanalysis 2 1 model grids and output the hycom horizontal resolution for the reanalysis is 0 08 1 12 5 that is 9 km at the equator and 6 5 km at mid latitudes the grid is uniform cylindrical from 78 64 s 66 s mercator between 66 s 47 n and includes a bipolar patch north of 47 n providing 3 5 km grid spacing at the north pole the bathymetry is derived from 30 arc second general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco https www gebeo net three coordinates coexist in hycom vertically z coordinates in unstratified water sigma coordinates in shallow depths and isopycnal coordinates in the stratified ocean hence hycom maintains the significant advantages of an isopycnal model in the stratified ocean but allows coordinate surfaces to locally deviate from isopycnals to provide more vertical resolution near the surface and in shallow coastal regions in order to better represent the upper ocean physics chassignet et al 2003 with this unique feature hycom serves as a good tool for simulating circulations in the scs which has complex topography that covers the continental shelf and deep basin there are 41 hybrid coordinate layers vertically with potential density referenced to 2000 m the top 14 layers are always sigma z so that water shallower than 84 m is always in fixed coordinates for this study we mainly analyze wind stresses and ssh output hourly instantaneous wind stress and ssh fields are interpolated to a uniform 0 08 resolution three dimensional velocity fields are saved 3 hourly 2 2 data assimilation the data assimilation technique employed for the reanalysis is a 3d variational scheme used within the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda cummings 2005 cummings and smedstad 2013 that takes the 24 hour model forecast as a first guess available remotely sensed sea surface temperature sst ssh sea ice concentration and in situ observations of temperature and salinity from profiles ships and moored and drifting buoys are all assimilated into hycom ncoda also generates synthetic temperature and salinity profiles for assimilation that are formed from the two dimensional ssh and sst using a 3d synthetic profile method the improved synthetic ocean profile isop helber et al 2013 isop provides an accurate representation of the ocean s temperature and salinity vertical gradient as defined by historical in situ observations the reanalysis provides realistic ssh fields as verified by cummings and smedstad 2013 who showed the assimilated ssh field in the kuroshio region is in good agreement with independent infrared frontal analyses 2 3 initialization and surface forcing the 22 year reanalysis is not continuous but separated into streams to speed the time to solution when it was integrated most of the streams are 2 5 years long for each stream the initialization state comes from a previous 20 year hycom based reanalysis yu et al 2015 on 1 december of the previous year except the very first stream started on 1 june 1993 the reanalysis uses atmospheric forcing from the 0 3125 hourly ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha and coauthors 2010 the wind stress formulation in the model includes the ocean surface currents yu et al 2017 the ncep cfsr 10 m wind velocities are read by hycom and the wind stress is calculated at every time step taking into account the ocean surface currents as shown below 1 τ ρ a i r c d v 10 v o v 10 v o where ρ a i r is the air density at sea level c d is the drag coefficient and v 10 is the 10 m wind velocity and v o is the velocity of ocean surface currents at 1 m depth this wind stress formulation is more accurate and generates larger wind stresses when the scswc flows counter to the prevailing winds compared to calculating wind stress with 10 m winds only the previous 20 year hycom based reanalysis used to initialize this reanalysis does not include the ocean surface currents in the wind stress formulation when the new wind stress formulation including ocean surface current is applied during the reanalysis the mesoscale eddy field adjusts to the satellite altimeter data within the first month yu et al 2015 but the basin wide kinetic energy takes another 6 months to reach an equilibrium yu et al 2018 thus while the 2 5 year streams start on december 1 of the previous year and end after 31 months of integration i e the end of june only the last two years of output e g july 2001 to june 2003 from each 2 5 year stream are used in the analysis here 2 4 region of interest we focus on the northern scs for this study and the domain chosen is from 110 120 e 19 24 n white box in fig 1a fig 1b its southwestern boundary covers part of the hainan island and the northern boundary is to the south of taiwan strait its eastern boundary is to the west of luzon strait this region is big enough to cover all the scswc over the northern scs continental shelf and small enough to eliminate most of the impact of central basin variations for the eeof analysis 3 monthly mean model results the monthly mean ssh and alongshore wind stresses are removed from the eeof analysis these mean fields are important to interpret the eeof results for instance the eeof shows that ssh decreases over the continental shelf when the wind relaxes section 5 1 and the associated geostrophic flow anomaly is northeastward but this does not mean there are counter wind currents the counter wind scswc exists only when the ssh decrease overturns the mean ssh cross shore slope based on geostrophic balance thus the monthly mean ssh alongshore wind stresses their associated standard deviation std and mean surface currents of december 1994 are shown as examples in this section we choose to show results in december 1994 because it contains one of the longest scswc occurrence during the 22 year reanalysis more detailed analysis during this period is given in section 4 the fundamental pattern over the continental shelf described below applies to all the winter seasons december january february during the 22 year reanalysis period 3 1 sea surface height the mean december 1994 scs ssh fig 2a clearly shows the two important features of the northern scs general circulation the cyclonic circulation in the deep basin and the kuroshio intrusion through luzon strait the kuroshio identified by the high ssh intrudes more water into the scs through luzon strait in december 6 4 sv 22 year average than summer 0 5 sv this agrees well with observations tian et al 2006 the cyclonic circulation in the deep basin represented by the low ssh in fig 2a across the basin from 9 to 21 n agrees with previous research wyrtki 1961 along the continental shelf mean ssh in december 1994 is higher nearshore and decreases offshore gradually and lower near taiwan strait and increases southwestwards over the shelf fig 2b the low ssh in the deep central basin is consistent with the basin wide cyclonic circulation in the winter the higher ssh to the east of 118 e between 20 5 and 22 5 n is associated with kuroshio intrusion through luzon strait the mean ssh pattern indicates an offshore pressure gradient force which agrees well with topex poseidon altimetry data shaw et al 1999 ho et al 2000 chu et al 2003 fang et al 2006 and does not suggest the existence of northeastward currents via geostrophic balance another important feature of the mean ssh over the shelf is that there exists a clear alongshore pressure gradient higher ssh in the vicinity to the northeast of the hainan island and lower at taiwan strait according to previous research zeng et al 1989 chiang et al 2008 the alongshore pressure gradient suggests surface water flows northeastward i e down gradient the std of ssh indicates that most of the ssh variations occur over the continental shelf higher along the coast and decreasing offshore fig 2c the strongest variation of ssh occurs near taiwan strait the ssh variation in the central basin is much smaller than that over the continental shelf the small ssh std of the south china sea branch current of the kuroshio in a band roughly in line with the 200 m isobath indicates that ssh variations associated with the kuroshio do not change much and thus cannot be the primary cause of the scswc via geostrophic balance agreeing with li et al 1993 and yang et al 2008 3 2 wind stresses for wind stresses we choose coordinates so that the y axis alongshore coincides with the coast positive towards northeast and the positive x axis points offshore the coastline is not straight and we estimate that the y axis is 38 to the north of east it is very clear that the mean alongshore wind stresses are southwestward negative in december 1994 fig 3a there exists a strong mean alongshore wind stress band strongest at taiwan strait and extending southwestward the wind stresses are much weaker both to the southeast and northwest of this strong band fig 3a this pattern agrees well with climatology fang et al 2006 the std of wind stresses shows a similar spatial pattern as the mean wind stresses with a strong variational band from taiwan strait and extending southwestward with the maximum std near taiwan strait surface wind stresses to the southeast and northwest of this band do not change much this std pattern suggests that there are larger variations associated with stronger winds than the weak winds fig 3b 3 3 near surface currents it was shown that sometimes the scswc flows beneath the ocean surface while the currents at the surface follow the wind direction guan and fang 2006 thus we show the currents averaged over the top 50 m in the region of interest to represent the surface currents as suggested by chiang et al 2008 the monthly mean near surface currents show no signature of the scswc over the continental shelf in december 1994 fig 4 as suggested by the mean ssh in the same month via geostrophic balance over the continental shelf fig 2b instead the monthly mean near surface currents mainly flow southwestward over the continental shelf following the wind over the 22 year reanalysis time period none of the winter monthly mean near surface currents indicates the existence of scswc agreeing with previous studies that suggested the scswc does not persist throughout the winter seasons chao et al 1995 yang 2006 chiang et al 2008 we will provide an explanation for this in section 7 4 statistics of the scswc in this section we summarize some basic statistics of the scswc from the reanalysis these statistics include the occurrence rate duration length magnitude and the location of the scswc these statistics are calculated from the daily average hycom output based on previous observations zhong 1990 we decide to detect the scswc using the upper 50 m average alongshore velocity in the rectangular area from 115 to 116 e and 21 5 to 22 n this area is between the 50 and 200 m isobaths and on top of 100 m isobath white box fig 2b we focus on the area less than 200 m because it is hard to find continuous counter wind currents between 200 and 300 m isobaths this is in good agreement with the small ssh std roughly along the 200 m isobath fig 2c section 3 1 if the area averaged alongshore velocity in this area is positive the scswc exists on that day an event of the scswc is defined as the currents occurring on consecutive days or one day only a one day event there are 546 days of the scswc occurrence in the 21 winters on average there are 26 days of the scswc occurrence per winter and 9 5 scswc events with an average event duration of 2 7 days we also examine the daily averaged ssh and upper ocean currents when the scswc occurs to determine its location and magnitude somewhat surprisingly the scswc generally does not exist near hainan island but instead exists hundreds of kilometers to the northeast does this suggest that the scswc originates on the shelf away from hainan island the scswc only spans the whole continental shelf from taiwan to hainan island more than 1100 km when an event lasts three days or longer during such events it can reach the gulf of tonkin vietnam at 18 n for one day events the scswc usually exists northward of 21 n towards taiwan strait which is 400 km long the positive alongshore velocity of the scswc can reach to 150 m depth the barotropic alongshore velocity is as large as 0 28 m s along the 100 m isobath and reached 0 10 m s along the 200 m isobath in the december 1994 event shown below 5 eeof analysis of ssh and wind stress anomaly a fundamental response over the continental shelves to the wind forcing expected from dynamics is the generation and propagation of the coastal topographic waves jacobs et al 1998 demonstrated that wind bursts and relaxation excite coastal topographic waves in the east china sea their figure 3 these waves then propagate southwards along the continental shelf and pass through taiwan strait ko et al 2003 chao et al 1995 observed that the emergence of the northeastward scswc begins from the northeastern shelf 115 e 21 n after wind relaxation and expands southwestward they attributed this to the propagation of topographic waves from the daily average ssh animation generated from the reanalysis we often see a wave like feature with lower ssh than that near hainan island propagate southwestwards from the southern end of taiwan strait along the continental shelf as a precursor to the scswc in winter is this wave like feature a topographic wave in this section we perform an eeof analysis on the hourly ssh and wind stress anomalies we choose eeof over eof because it constitutes an extension of the traditional eof to deal not only with the spatial but also the temporal correlations to identify the spatial patterns of the propagating features weare and nasstrom 1982 chen and harr 1993 eeof is an eof analysis with a modified data matrix in eof each row vector represents a data map p locations at one time instance and each column vector represents a time series m time instances at a specific location of the data map the eof data matrix n in this case has dimensions of m by p as shown below 2 n n 1 1 n 1 2 n 1 p n 2 1 n 2 2 n 2 p n m 1 n m 2 n m p an eof analysis uses the variance matrix to define the periodic signals each row vector of an eeof data matrix on the other hand contains not only the data map at a given time but also at some series of times into the past or future in this study we perform a 36 hour time lag eeof analysis to the hourly data sets with 6 hour increment the row vector is extended as 3 n t n t 1 n t p n t 6 1 n t 6 p n t 12 1 n t 12 p n t 36 1 n t 36 p where t varies from 1 to m 36 the data matrix has dimensions of m 36 by 7 p thus an eeof analysis on the matrix applies lagged auto covariance matrix to find both the propagating and or periodic signals an eof analysis of the scs ssh has been performed previously at the seasonal and interannual time scales using altimetry data shaw et al 1999 ho et al 2000 chu et al 2003 fang et al 2006 in our case we focus on the ssh variations on the time scale of days as there is no persistent scswc in winter to do so we remove the monthly mean and conduct a 3 month eeof analysis for every winter season starting from december 1 for the 22 year period 1994 to 2015 the results discussed below are for december 1994 to february 1995 only we choose this specific winter season because there exists one of the longest scswc occurrences during the 22 year analysis from 7 to 13 december 1994 more importantly there exists a 3 day period with quasi constant wind stress and ssh within this event as shown below this provides a wonderful opportunity to reveal the dynamics of the scswc in both the cross shore and alongshore direction however sometimes eeof results are hard to interpret and can be misleading if the time lag is not chosen with care monahan et al 1999 hannachi et al 2007 when there are strong standing waves or a dipole in the primary eof pattern in this study the most significant mode is a standing wave mode we chose a 36 h lag to avoid this which is much less than the first zero autocorrelation function monahan et al 1999 of the leading eof mode time series for both ssh and wind stress 127 h time lags from 36 to 0 h with 6 h increment are used in the eeof analysis time lags shorter and longer still shorter than 127 h than 36 h are also tested and the results are not sensitive to our choice of time lag ssh eeof analyses over the entire 22 year period all show two dominant modes the ekman transport mode leading mode and the coastal topographic wave mode second mode during the 22 year reanalysis period these two modes explain an average of 77 of the total ssh variance the first and second ssh eeof modes account for 61 and 16 of the total variance respectively fig 5 there are 6 winters when the third ssh eeof explains more than 10 of the total variance and all of these are either from an eddy mode due to the existence of one or two eddies in the deep basin or the kuroshio intrusion mode for instance the third ssh eeof mode from december 1994 to february 1995 is a kuroshio intrusion mode due to the intrusion of kuroshio through luzon strait fig 2a and it explains 10 of the total variance since these low energy modes are not consistent have very small ssh anomaly over the continental shelf and thus a very small contribution to the scswc we choose to only analyze the first two dominant modes 5 1 eeof of ssh the first ssh eeof mode indicates a standing wave explaining 61 of the total ssh variance fig 6a it shows a negative ssh anomaly over the continental shelf region that increases offshore the near zero magnitude of ssh anomaly along the shelf break indicates that the standing wave has its node along the shelf break and antinode along the coast line this suggests that this mode causes the ssh to move up and down over the continental shelf while the ssh along the shelf break remains essentially the same the magnitude of the ssh anomaly varies slightly during the 36 hour period but its pattern remains the same please note that the mode expansion coefficient time series fig 6b is normalized by its magnitude so that its range is from 1 to 1 and the mode is amplified accordingly this first mode fig 6a indicates an amplitude of 4 m comparable to the range of mean ssh over the study domain which is 45 m fig 2b the expansion coefficient time series fig 6b black shows a 7 day period from 7 gmt on 6 december to 17 gmt on 13 december 1994 with consecutive positive values there exists a more than 3 day period from 3 gmt on 9 december to 13 gmt on 12 december 1994 fig 6b dashed vertical black lines with an almost constant value of 1 to reconstruct the ssh anomaly associated with a mode at any particular time t the ssh anomaly is obtained by weighted average of the mode at time lag δ multiplied by the expansion coefficient at time t δ over the 36 hour period hannachi et al 2007 in this case δ varies from 18 to 18 with 6 h increment the ssh anomaly at 15 gmt on 11 december 1994 is reconstructed and composited with the monthly mean fig 7a to show that this mode is able to reverse the cross shore pressure gradient and thus the surface geostrophic flow over most of the shelf but not the shallower region 50 m to the west of 115 e where ssh still indicates a weak offshore pressure gradient force the scswc can be clearly seen from the near surface currents at the same time instant red arrows fig 7a from northeast of hainan island to taiwan strait the strongest currents are more than 3 m s but there are still weak southwestward currents to the west of 115 e over the shallowest water along the coast the second eeof mode suggests a typical coastal topographic wave development propagation over a 36 hour period which explains 14 of the total ssh variations fig 6c it demonstrates a negative ssh anomaly that propagates southwards over the shelf from 36 to 24 hour lag a positive ssh anomaly develops at 24 hour lag near taiwan strait and propagates southwards and reaches hainan island at 0 hour lag the phase speed of the topographic wave estimated from the ssh anomaly along the coast of china fig 8a is 12 8 m s which agrees well with the coastal topographic waves estimated by jacobs et al 1998 5 2 eeof of wind stresses the first eeof mode of the wind stresses also shows a standing pattern explaining 64 of total wind stress variabilities fig 9a the spatial pattern indicates a southwestward oriented band of strong positive wind stress anomaly emanating from taiwan strait the strong wind stress anomaly gradually decreases to the southeast and northwest of the band the magnitude of the mode changes with time for example the strong positive wind stress anomaly extends southwestwards from taiwan strait with time from 36 hour lag to 18 hour lag but its pattern remains with time the mode expansion coefficient time series fig 9b black suggests a 1 week period the same as ssh fig 6b black of consecutive positive wind stress anomaly i e wind relaxation from 0 gmt on 6 december to 8 gmt on 13 december 1994 the time period with the consecutive coefficient bigger than 0 85 is marked between the two vertical black dashed lines from 3 gmt on 9 december to 3 gmt on 12 december 1994 the second mode of the wind stresses suggests a reversal process of the wind stress fig 9c anomaly over the shelf the positive wind stress anomaly decreases from 36 hour lag to 24 hour lag and moves southwestwards at the same time the negative wind stress anomaly occurs at 24 hour lag at taiwan strait grows stronger and extends southwestwards from 24 hour lag to 0 hour lag the second eeof wind stress mode accounts for 15 of the total variance 5 3 dynamics of ssh variation the expansion coefficient time series of the first ssh eeof mode fig 6b black is highly correlated with the time series of the first wind stresses eeof mode fig 9b black significant to the 99 confidence level with correlation coefficient of 0 95 the time lag associated with this correlation is 10 hours and with the variation of wind stress leading the ssh variation the positive wind stress anomaly implies alongshore wind relaxation and thus this high correlation suggests that wind relaxation leads to a negative ssh anomaly over the shelf and wind bursts lead to positive ssh anomalies this is the ssh setdown setup due to the ekman transport defined below 4 u e τ v ρ o f where τ v is the alongshore wind stress ρ o is a reference density for seawater and f is the coriolis parameter the negative alongshore wind stress anomaly wind burst pushes water to the right side of its direction to generate a positive ssh anomaly over the continental shelf and during wind relaxation the positive alongshore wind stress anomaly pushes water to the right of the wind stress anomaly direction to generate offshore ekman transport total ekman transport along the 200 m isobath with strongest wind stress anomaly on 11 december 1994 is calculated as 22 sv offshore at this rate it takes only 21 min to move enough water 2 8 1010 m3 the area times the ssh anomaly due to the ekman mode out of the continental shelf to generate the negative ssh anomaly on that day the excess water is compensated by the inshore currents along the sea floor to support the costal upwelling as shown in fig 7a the wind relaxation itself is able to generate the ssh anomaly to reverse the mean ssh gradient over the whole shelf to create northeastward currents via geostrophic balance the expansion coefficient time series of the second ssh eeof mode fig 6b red is also highly correlated with the time series of the second wind stress eeof mode fig 9b red significant to the 99 confidence level the correlation coefficient is 0 92 associated with a time lag of 12 h which suggests that the wind stress anomaly reversal leads the generation propagation of the topographic waves by 12 h the wind stress anomaly reversal fig 9c indicates that the generation propagation of the coastal topographic waves is the result of the strong sudden wind events which agrees with jacobs et al 1998 the wind burst negative wind stress anomaly enhances the propagation of coastal topographic waves with positive ssh anomalies that can reverse transport through taiwan strait ko et al 2003 the wind relaxation the positive stress anomaly is associated with the propagation of topographic waves with negative ssh anomalies 6 alongshore dynamics in this section we assume a slab model and compare the two alongshore forces pressure gradient force and wind stress the idea of treating the scs continental shelf in winter as a slab is not new almost all of the previous research on this topic treat the scswc in winter as a barotropic process since strong wind and surface cooling in winter work together to make the water well mixed over the shelf thus we treat the alongshore dynamics as governed chiang et al 2008 by 5 v t f u g s s h y τ v ρ o h f r i where u and v are depth averaged cross shore and alongshore velocities respectively g is the gravitational parameter h is the water depth and fri is the friction that is always against the alongshore flow the first right hand term is the pressure gradient force and the second represents the depth average of the alongshore kinematic wind stress if there exists a long enough period that we can assume a steady state eq 5 is the same as the alongshore equation of the arrested topographic wave csanady 1978 6 1 wind relaxation the 3 day period from 3 gmt on 9 december to 3 gmt on 12 december 1994 is taken to represent the wind relaxation case both wind stresses and ssh are almost constant with time vertical black dashed lines on figs 6b 9b and thus we treat it as a steady state the first ssh eeof mode clearly demonstrates that wind relaxation can reverse the cross shore pressure gradient force from offshore fig 2b to onshore fig 7a it also indicates that wind relaxation increases the alongshore pressure gradient force from northeast of hainan island to taiwan strait over the shelf fig 7b illustrates that the alongshore pressure gradient force at 15 gmt on 11 december 1994 associated with the first ssh eeof mode is mainly positive along the shelf thus this is the period with weaker wind stresses and stronger alongshore pressure gradient force than the monthly mean values table 1 the area average of the four terms in eq 5 over the continental shelf in the domain shallower than 200 m isobath is summarized in table 1 during this period of wind relaxation the sum of the alongshore pressure gradient force and the depth average kinematic wind stress g s s h y τ v ρ o h are mainly positive over the continental shelf fig 10a the area average of the pressure gradient force is 2 2 10 6 m s2 and the depth average kinematic wind stress over the shelf in the domain shallower than 200 m is 0 73 10 6 m s2 table 1 this indicates that the magnitude of the alongshore pressure gradient force is larger than the wind stress as a result the water flows alongshore northeastward to generate a negative fri 0 50 10 6 m s2 and also offshore to generate a positive coriolis force 0 97 10 6 m s2 to balance the force table 1 the most dominant force during the wind relaxation period is the alongshore pressure gradient force but along the coast to the west of 116 e in waters shallower than 50 m the sum of these two forces is mainly negative fig 10a suggesting that the water flows southwestward to generate a positive fri this agrees well with the sandwich structure of the scswc as illustrated by qiu et al 1985 and guan 1993 and is also consistent with what we see from the ssh pattern and near surface currents fig 7a what it means dynamically is that the depth average wind stress dominates along the coast due to the shallower water depths even though the wind stress is weaker along the coast figs 2c and 8a another region with negative force on the continental shelves is to the west northwestof dongsha island fig 10a the alongshore pressure gradient force from the ekman mode over this region is almost zero fig 7b which indicates that the ssh anomaly contours associated with the ekman mode are almost parallel to the alongshore direction over the region this suggests that the currents in this region should be further north of east as illustrated by fig 7a this is the region where the direction of the near surface currents is 50 60 north of east changing the alongshore direction to 50 produces the positive forces over the region 6 2 strong wind the 3 day period from 17 gmt on 17 december to 17 gmt on 20 december 1994 is taken to represent the strong wind period thin vertical black lines on figs 6b and 9b during this period the wind stresses are strong and consistently southwestward the alongshore pressure gradient force anomaly associated with the first eeof mode has the same pattern as the one with wind relaxation fig 7b but in opposite direction which is negative relative to the mean state this wind burst period has stronger wind stress 5 8 10 6 m s2 and weaker alongshore pressure gradient force 0 30 10 6 m s2 opposite to the wind relaxation case table 1 the sum of the alongshore pressure gradient force and the wind stress are negative over the continental shelf fig 10b this force drives the water southwestward to generate positive friction 3 1 10 6 m s2 and inshore to generate a negative coriolis force 2 4 10 6 m s2 to balance the force the most dominant force during this period is the wind stress while the alongshore pressure gradient force is the least important table 1 for both wind relaxation and strong wind cases one needs to ignore the pattern at depths greater than 200 m where the assumption of a slab model eq 5 is no longer valid in the deep basin the pattern is fully dominated by the pressure gradient force as the depth average kinematic wind stress is practically negligible at these depths in the wind relaxation case we assume a steady state since alongshore wind stresses and ssh are almost constant in the strong wind case ssh and alongshore wind stresses can change as much as 50 figs 6b 9b the time average is taken to represent the steady state most of the wind relaxation periods are shorter than 3 days and thus cannot be treated as steady state in those cases wind relaxation generates positive alongshore velocity tendency v t to slow down the southwestward currents and eventually overturns and generates a counter wind scswc 7 observed features and the origin of the scswc below we apply the dynamics from sections 4 and 5 to explain some of the observed features of the scswc and define the origin of the scswc 7 1 why there is no monthly mean scswc in winter it isclear that the monthly mean ssh in december 1994 fig 2b does not support northeastward geostrophic surface currents as shown in fig 4 however the mean ssh pattern supports a positive alongshore pressure gradient force according to previous studies this would generate scswc persisting in the winter season however our results indicate that it is the sum of the alongshore pressure gradient force and the wind stresses that determines the ageostrophic currents not the pressure gradient force alone in this section we perform a similar alongshore force comparison the same as what we did in section 6 but for the monthly mean wind stresses 3 7 10 6 m s2 and alongshore pressure gradient force table 1 0 80 10 6 m s2 the spatial pattern of the sum of these two forces fig 10c over the continental shelf are very similar to the pattern in strong wind case fig 10b except that the magnitude is smaller this clearly demonstrates the dominance of the monthly mean wind stresses over the alongshore pressure gradient force monthly mean alongshore flow also follows the mean wind towards the southwest thus the scswc cannot be persistent over the winter season 7 2 the origin of the scswc most previous research concludes that the scswc originates from hainan island chiang et al 2008 further suggested that scswc originates from the gulf of tonkin vietnam since the first ssh eeof mode indicates an ekman mode that covers the whole continental shelf does this mode support the opinion that the scswc originates from the southern shelf near hainan island four ssh fields 12 h apart starting from 12 gmt on 6 december 1994 are plotted to demonstrate the onset of the scswc fig 11a they indicate that lower ssh 6 m contour cyan color is moving southwestwards along the continental shelf from the northern shelf the composite fig 11b of the monthly mean ssh and the anomaly associated with the ekman mode fig 11c suggests that the wave like feature we often observe in the daily average ssh animation section 5 is generated by the ekman effect and not by the topographic waves this is really due to the fact that the mean ssh is lower to the northern shelf fig 2b and the ssh anomaly varies relatively uniformly in the cross shore direction fig 6a when winds start relaxing on 6 december the ekman effect generates negative ssh anomaly over the whole shelf the negative ssh anomaly is weak before 0 gmt on december 7 figs 11c1 and 11c2 and only able to reverse the ssh cross shore gradient to the east of 117 e figs 11b1 and 11b2 since the mean ssh gradient is smaller there between 50 and 200 m isobath fig 2b as winds continue relaxing the negative ssh anomaly becomes stronger figs 11c3 and 11c4 and is able to reverse the mean ssh gradient to the east of hainan fig 11b4 between the 50 and 200 m isobaths the counter wind currents first appear only at the very north of the continental shelf red arrows fig 12a move southwards figs 12b and 12c and finally cover the whole shelf from east of hainan to south of taiwan strait at 0 gmt on december 8 1994 fig 12d thus these results show that the scswc in winter originates in the area south of taiwan strait when the winds relax and extends southwards over the shelf as the wind continues to relax but is this always the case a hovmöller diagram of the near surface alongshore currents averaged over the top 50 m along a scswc path over the shelf is shown in fig 8b the path black line fig 1a is defined as the 125 m isobath from 17 n to 21 n and then a straight line from 115 36 e 21 02 n to 119 04 e 23 5 n the tilt in the vertical streaks from the upper left to the lower right indicating the scswc extends from the area south of taiwan strait southwestwards agreeing with the dynamics mentioned above the strongest scswc event in this season can reach to 17 5 n more than 1000 km long but other events like the one on february 9 1995 only exist in the northern shelf to the north of 21 n if the scswc originates from gulf of tonkin or hainan island the tilt in the vertical streaks should be from lower left to the upper right but that is not the case 7 3 increasing scswc downstream our results also clearly illustrate the coexistence of the scswc sandwiched between the southwestward guangdong coastal currents from 110 e to 117 e fig 12 and the cyclonic upper ocean circulation over the central basin during wind relaxation periods in winter season that is consistent with previous findings qiu et al 1985 guan 1993 between the 50 m and 200 m isobaths the positive monthly mean cross shore pressure gradient force is strongest near hainan and becomes smaller northeastward from 111 e to 116 e fig 2b the monthly mean currents averaged over the top 50 m are stronger near hainan and becomes weaker northeastward from 111 e to 116 e fig 4 relative to the mean ssh gradient the negative ssh anomaly associated with the first mode varies uniformly in the cross shore direction fig 11c along the whole shelf the negative cross shore pressure gradient force associated with the ekman mode balances the mean positive pressure gradient force and eventually reverses it when winds relax because the mean cross shore pressure gradient force is strongest near hainan the combined mean ekman mode cross shore pressure gradient force is negative but has a smaller magnitude than that to the northeast of hainan along the shelf to 116 e due to geostrophy the northeastward scswc is weaker near hainan and increases downstream fig 12d shows the strongest scswc occurs at 115 e and agrees well with the previous observations zhong 1990 8 conclusions in this study we investigate the generation mechanism of the counter wind characteristics of the scswc in the winter seasons using output from a 22 year 1994 2015 hycom global reanalysis the reanalysis is forced with atmospheric forcing from the 0 3125 hourly ncep cfsr dataset and a wind stress formulation that takes into account the ocean surface currents because of the latter the wind stress is bigger over the scswc than those calculated only by 10 m wind velocities we performed two analyses 1 an eeof analysis on the hourly ssh and alongshore wind stress in each winter and 2 a comparison of the alongshore pressure gradient force and the alongshore wind stress the eeof analysis reveals that the leading ssh eeof mode which explains more than 60 of the total variance is the direct result of ekman transport during wind bursts the water is pushed inshore and piles up along the coast when winds relax the ekman transport is offshore the closer to the coast the bigger change of the ssh the second ssh eeof mode represents the generation propagation of the coastal topographic waves that are excited by the wind change when winds relax it is associated with the propagation of the waves with negative ssh anomaly monthly mean ssh demonstrates a strong positive cross shore pressure gradient force the ekman effect associated with wind relaxation can produce a large enough pressure gradient to reverse the cross shore pressure gradient force to generate northeastward counter wind flow the propagation of the topographic waves associated with wind relaxation is secondary to enhance the process because the mean cross shore pressure gradient is smaller in the area south of taiwan strait than over the rest of the shelf the ekman effect reverses the cross shore pressure gradient in the northern shelf first thus the scswc originates from the northern shelf in the area south of taiwan strait ssh eeof analysis also indicates that wind relaxation increases the alongshore pressure gradient force while wind bursts decrease the alongshore pressure gradient force during the 3 day wind relaxation period in december 1994 the stronger positive alongshore pressure gradient force overtakes the weaker alongshore wind stresses to push the water northeastward and in the strong wind case the southwestward wind stresses are much stronger than the weaker than normal northeastward alongshore pressure gradient force thus the surface water follows the wind declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

23881,a 22 year 1994 2015 hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom global reanalysis is used to study the generation mechanism of the counter wind characteristic of the south china sea warm current scswc in winter seasons our analysis clearly demonstrates that the counter wind scswc in winter is driven by wind relaxation an extended empirical orthogonal function eeof analysis of the hourly sea surface height ssh and wind stresses reveals that the most dominant ssh mode is an ekman mode when the wind relaxes the ekman transport anomaly is offshore and generates a favorable cross shore ssh slope for the northeastward surface currents over the continental shelf mainly by geostrophic balance the alongshore pressure gradient force also increases when the wind relaxes and dominates the weak wind stresses to push the alongshore water northeastwards we also identify the region south of taiwan strait as the origin of the scswc instead of the hainan island or gulf of tonkin vietnam due to the dominant ekman dynamics keywords south china sea warm current wind relaxation ekman transport hycom reanalysis topographic waves origin of south china sea warm current 1 introduction the semi enclosed south china sea scs is the largest marginal sea in southeast asia fig 1a it connects with the east china sea through taiwan strait where the transport is generally northward chuang 1985 1986 even in the winter when northeasterly winds dominant the region the scs has a deep 4000 m central basin surrounded by a steep continental slope and links to the western pacific through luzon strait where the kuroshio flows northward to the east of the strait and sometimes loops and sheds eddies through it between taiwan and luzon the deep central basin is bordered by a continental shelf 150 250 km wide shallower than 200 m along the coast of china fig 1b in general the dynamics of the upper layer circulation in the central scs is fairly clear the seasonally reversing east asia monsoon wind plays a prominent role in forcing the seasonally varying circulation in the scs wyrtki 1961 shaw and chao 1994 northeasterly winds prevail over the region in winter while relatively weaker southwesterly winds dominate in summer the wind driven basin scale upper circulation is thus cyclonic in winter and anti cyclonic in summer however the same is not true regarding the dynamics over the continental shelf in the northern scs where a detailed topography is given in fig 1b the northern scs circulation is complex including the shelf and slope circulation shu et al 2018 summer vietnam offshore currents shu et al 2016 and the strong intra seasonal variability of the cross slope flow wang et al 2020b the subsurface speed maxima along the slope originates from kuroshio intrusion through luzon strait wang et al 2020a historically it was thought that the currents over the continental shelf in the northern scs flow from northeast toward the southwest during the winter under the intense influence of the northeasterly monsoon wyrtki 1961 until the south china sea warm current scswc was observed in winter by guan and chen 1964 from the measured current data obtained by anchored stations and hydrographic characteristic analysis guan and fang 2006 since then the scswc has been confirmed by repeated observations guan 1986 guan and fang 2006 and was demonstrated as a narrow and strong northeastward current persisting all winter long su and wang 1987 hu et al 2000 and originating from hainan island li et al 1992 hu et al 2000 guan and fang 2006 yang et al 2008 in winter it is sandwiched between the southwestward guangdong coastal currents and the southward currents along the shelf break that are related to the wind driven cyclonic gyre in the scs qiu et al 1985 guan 1993 the trademark of the scswc is its counter wind characteristic in winter over a half century after the scswc was discovered scientists have proposed different generation mechanisms trying to explain its counter wind behavior in winter the main proposed generation mechanism is kuroshio intrusion into the scs via luzon strait su and wang 1987 employed a barotropic model with zero wind stress and suggested that kuroshio intrusion plays an important role on the scswc formation the importance of the kuroshio is evident in zhong 1990 who indicated that the formation of the scswc is dynamically related with the south china sea branch current of the kuroshio ye 1994 demonstrated that the temperature increase from shelf to slope due to the warm winter kuroshio intrusion onto the slope could generate northeastward geostrophic flow xue et al 2004 also linked the formation of the scswc to kuroshio intrusion however the numerical experiments conducted by li et al 1993 demonstrated that kuroshio intrusion is not a requirement for the formation of scswc but may only strengthen the scswc their results showed that the scswc still exists but appears to be weaker if luzon strait is closed similar conclusions were made by yang et al 2008 another proposed generation mechanism is related to the alongshore sea surface height ssh slope zeng et al 1989 hypothesized that the alongshore pressure gradient induced by the water piled up to the east of hainan island forces the northeastward flow numerical results from barotropic simulations of the pacific ocean by li et al 1992 indicated that the combined effect of cross shore and alongshore sea surface slope is probably one of the major forces driving the scswc chao et al 1995 were the first one to suggest the wind relaxation as a possible generation mechanism when the alongshore ssh slope exists their numerical simulations clearly demonstrated the formation of the scswc when wind relaxes in winter they conclude that the monsoon driven southwestward coastal current piles up water downwind near hainan island to generate the alongshore ssh slope and the alongshore northeastward pressure gradient force drives the scswc after wind relaxes yang 2006 found that the northeastward currents over the shelf appears only when the northeast monsoon is weak based on mooring observations from 5 november 2001 and 21 march 2002 t1 in fig 1b of yang 2006 chiang et al 2008 examined the idea using a fine resolution 1 16 princeton ocean model pom and confirmed that the wind relaxation is the dominant winter scswc generation mechanism since the northeastward pressure gradient force takes place only when the northeasterly monsoon relaxes however our analysis has raised some questions regarding their results as shown in section 3 while mean ssh clearly shows a northeastward pressure gradient force there are no mean northeastward currents associated with it on the other hand hsueh and zhong 2004 explained the formation of the scswc applying the coastal arresting wave theory csanady 1978 but attributed the along shelf pressure gradient to the collision of the kuroshio intrusion currents with the continental slope besides the above research the following provide a different point of view on the formation of the scswc the importance of taiwan strait was illustrated through numerical simulations by yang et al 2008 who demonstrated that the scswc vanishes when the taiwan strait is closed they suggested that the scswc is a source and sink driven flow induced by the year round northward flow through the taiwan strait the wind stress applied to their numerical simulation is a 4 year average derived from observations by nasa satellite scatterometers wang et al 2010 performed numerical experiments using pom and revealed that it is the joint effect of baroclinicity and relief sarkisyan and ivanov 1971 that drives the scswc against the wind in winter this effect forces the slope currents to flow across the isobaths and veer to the right hand to feed the scswc the onshore pressure gradient force in the outer continental shelf that is favorable for the northeastern scswc comes from kuroshio intrusion via the luzon strait from the previous research it is fair to say that there still is no agreed upon consensus within the scientific community for the dynamics that controls the scswc recent observations and numerical simulations also question the persistency of the scswc in the winter which further complicates the situation fang et al 2015 did not observe the presence of scswc over the continental shelf in the northern scs in 2006 and 2007 and the hypothesis of wind relaxation chao et al 1995 chiang et al 2008 implies that the scswc is not persistent but rather intermittent but all of these previous numerical results agree on one or both of the two physical conditions an onshore and or a northeastward alongshore pressure gradient force exists over the continental shelf the onshore pressure gradient force indicates that the scswc is mainly in geostrophic balance in the cross shore direction while the northeastward alongshore pressure gradient force implies that the scswc is not in pure geostrophic balance but ageostrophic in alongshore direction which allows alongshore wind stress and or bottom friction to be important dynamically as well thus there are two sets of equations geostrophic in cross shore and ageostrophic in alongshore to govern the scswc the generation mechanism has to satisfy both and thus what mechanism generates both cross shore and alongshore pressure gradient that favor the formation of scswc in this study we further examine the generation mechanisms of the counter wind characteristic of the scswc in winter seasons results from a 22 year global hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom data assimilative reanalysis are carefully analyzed and demonstrated that wind relaxation is the dynamical reason driving the counter wind characteristic of the scswc in winter there are two pathways direct and indirect via which the scswc is affected by the wind relaxation the direct pathway is that wind stress represents a weaker force in the alongshore direction while the indirect pathway refers to the offshore ekman transport due to the wind relaxation previous studies on wind relaxation attribute the alongshore pressure gradient to the blockage effect of hainan island chao et al 1995 or the gulf of tonkin chiang et al 2008 but do not explain what sets up the onshore pressure gradient force this research differs and improves on previous studies in that 1 we found that wind relaxation sets up the favorable onshore pressure gradient force over the continental shelf via ekman transport contrary to chiang et al 2008 who stated that ekman transport is not important in maintaining the scswc 2 wind relaxation is the reason why there is a need to have alongshore counter wind currents in winter so that the bottom friction opposite to the current direction follows the northeasterly monsoon wind to balance the northeastward alongshore pressure gradient force 3 unlike previous numerical studies the hycom reanalysis was forced by hourly wind stress and fluxes and thus is able to fully resolve physical processes with a time period less than one day and 4 our findings indicate the scswc originates in the area south of taiwan strait contrary to the commonly accepted origination near hainan island or gulf of tonkin vietnam the same reanalysis was used to study the surface wind work input into the global ocean the high temporal resolution of the wind stress fills the missing wind work spectrum due to the low temporal forcing resolution i e daily and increases the wind work over ageostrophic currents significantly yu et al 2018 to our knowledge this is the first time that a reanalysis with such a high temporal resolution is used to study the scswc dynamics more details of the reanalysis are provided in section 2 this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the numerical model configuration and data assimilation method for the reanalysis section 3 describes the monthly mean characteristics of the ssh wind stresses and the surface currents basic statistics of the scswc are summarized in section 4 an extended empirical orthogonal function eeof analysis of the hourly ssh and wind stress anomalies are presented in section 5 the alongshore forcing comparison is performed in section 6 some of the observed features of the scswc are explained and the origin of the scswc is defined in section 7 which is followed by conclusions in section 8 2 numerical model and simulations a 22 year global hycom reanalysis from 1994 to 2015 is used for this study hycom is the ocean model component for the present operational us navy global ocean forecast system metzger et al 2014 a detailed description of hycom physics is provided by bleck 2002 a brief description of the model setup is presented below with emphasis on the numerical aspects that are most relevant to this study there are no tides or surface waves in this reanalysis 2 1 model grids and output the hycom horizontal resolution for the reanalysis is 0 08 1 12 5 that is 9 km at the equator and 6 5 km at mid latitudes the grid is uniform cylindrical from 78 64 s 66 s mercator between 66 s 47 n and includes a bipolar patch north of 47 n providing 3 5 km grid spacing at the north pole the bathymetry is derived from 30 arc second general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco https www gebeo net three coordinates coexist in hycom vertically z coordinates in unstratified water sigma coordinates in shallow depths and isopycnal coordinates in the stratified ocean hence hycom maintains the significant advantages of an isopycnal model in the stratified ocean but allows coordinate surfaces to locally deviate from isopycnals to provide more vertical resolution near the surface and in shallow coastal regions in order to better represent the upper ocean physics chassignet et al 2003 with this unique feature hycom serves as a good tool for simulating circulations in the scs which has complex topography that covers the continental shelf and deep basin there are 41 hybrid coordinate layers vertically with potential density referenced to 2000 m the top 14 layers are always sigma z so that water shallower than 84 m is always in fixed coordinates for this study we mainly analyze wind stresses and ssh output hourly instantaneous wind stress and ssh fields are interpolated to a uniform 0 08 resolution three dimensional velocity fields are saved 3 hourly 2 2 data assimilation the data assimilation technique employed for the reanalysis is a 3d variational scheme used within the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda cummings 2005 cummings and smedstad 2013 that takes the 24 hour model forecast as a first guess available remotely sensed sea surface temperature sst ssh sea ice concentration and in situ observations of temperature and salinity from profiles ships and moored and drifting buoys are all assimilated into hycom ncoda also generates synthetic temperature and salinity profiles for assimilation that are formed from the two dimensional ssh and sst using a 3d synthetic profile method the improved synthetic ocean profile isop helber et al 2013 isop provides an accurate representation of the ocean s temperature and salinity vertical gradient as defined by historical in situ observations the reanalysis provides realistic ssh fields as verified by cummings and smedstad 2013 who showed the assimilated ssh field in the kuroshio region is in good agreement with independent infrared frontal analyses 2 3 initialization and surface forcing the 22 year reanalysis is not continuous but separated into streams to speed the time to solution when it was integrated most of the streams are 2 5 years long for each stream the initialization state comes from a previous 20 year hycom based reanalysis yu et al 2015 on 1 december of the previous year except the very first stream started on 1 june 1993 the reanalysis uses atmospheric forcing from the 0 3125 hourly ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha and coauthors 2010 the wind stress formulation in the model includes the ocean surface currents yu et al 2017 the ncep cfsr 10 m wind velocities are read by hycom and the wind stress is calculated at every time step taking into account the ocean surface currents as shown below 1 τ ρ a i r c d v 10 v o v 10 v o where ρ a i r is the air density at sea level c d is the drag coefficient and v 10 is the 10 m wind velocity and v o is the velocity of ocean surface currents at 1 m depth this wind stress formulation is more accurate and generates larger wind stresses when the scswc flows counter to the prevailing winds compared to calculating wind stress with 10 m winds only the previous 20 year hycom based reanalysis used to initialize this reanalysis does not include the ocean surface currents in the wind stress formulation when the new wind stress formulation including ocean surface current is applied during the reanalysis the mesoscale eddy field adjusts to the satellite altimeter data within the first month yu et al 2015 but the basin wide kinetic energy takes another 6 months to reach an equilibrium yu et al 2018 thus while the 2 5 year streams start on december 1 of the previous year and end after 31 months of integration i e the end of june only the last two years of output e g july 2001 to june 2003 from each 2 5 year stream are used in the analysis here 2 4 region of interest we focus on the northern scs for this study and the domain chosen is from 110 120 e 19 24 n white box in fig 1a fig 1b its southwestern boundary covers part of the hainan island and the northern boundary is to the south of taiwan strait its eastern boundary is to the west of luzon strait this region is big enough to cover all the scswc over the northern scs continental shelf and small enough to eliminate most of the impact of central basin variations for the eeof analysis 3 monthly mean model results the monthly mean ssh and alongshore wind stresses are removed from the eeof analysis these mean fields are important to interpret the eeof results for instance the eeof shows that ssh decreases over the continental shelf when the wind relaxes section 5 1 and the associated geostrophic flow anomaly is northeastward but this does not mean there are counter wind currents the counter wind scswc exists only when the ssh decrease overturns the mean ssh cross shore slope based on geostrophic balance thus the monthly mean ssh alongshore wind stresses their associated standard deviation std and mean surface currents of december 1994 are shown as examples in this section we choose to show results in december 1994 because it contains one of the longest scswc occurrence during the 22 year reanalysis more detailed analysis during this period is given in section 4 the fundamental pattern over the continental shelf described below applies to all the winter seasons december january february during the 22 year reanalysis period 3 1 sea surface height the mean december 1994 scs ssh fig 2a clearly shows the two important features of the northern scs general circulation the cyclonic circulation in the deep basin and the kuroshio intrusion through luzon strait the kuroshio identified by the high ssh intrudes more water into the scs through luzon strait in december 6 4 sv 22 year average than summer 0 5 sv this agrees well with observations tian et al 2006 the cyclonic circulation in the deep basin represented by the low ssh in fig 2a across the basin from 9 to 21 n agrees with previous research wyrtki 1961 along the continental shelf mean ssh in december 1994 is higher nearshore and decreases offshore gradually and lower near taiwan strait and increases southwestwards over the shelf fig 2b the low ssh in the deep central basin is consistent with the basin wide cyclonic circulation in the winter the higher ssh to the east of 118 e between 20 5 and 22 5 n is associated with kuroshio intrusion through luzon strait the mean ssh pattern indicates an offshore pressure gradient force which agrees well with topex poseidon altimetry data shaw et al 1999 ho et al 2000 chu et al 2003 fang et al 2006 and does not suggest the existence of northeastward currents via geostrophic balance another important feature of the mean ssh over the shelf is that there exists a clear alongshore pressure gradient higher ssh in the vicinity to the northeast of the hainan island and lower at taiwan strait according to previous research zeng et al 1989 chiang et al 2008 the alongshore pressure gradient suggests surface water flows northeastward i e down gradient the std of ssh indicates that most of the ssh variations occur over the continental shelf higher along the coast and decreasing offshore fig 2c the strongest variation of ssh occurs near taiwan strait the ssh variation in the central basin is much smaller than that over the continental shelf the small ssh std of the south china sea branch current of the kuroshio in a band roughly in line with the 200 m isobath indicates that ssh variations associated with the kuroshio do not change much and thus cannot be the primary cause of the scswc via geostrophic balance agreeing with li et al 1993 and yang et al 2008 3 2 wind stresses for wind stresses we choose coordinates so that the y axis alongshore coincides with the coast positive towards northeast and the positive x axis points offshore the coastline is not straight and we estimate that the y axis is 38 to the north of east it is very clear that the mean alongshore wind stresses are southwestward negative in december 1994 fig 3a there exists a strong mean alongshore wind stress band strongest at taiwan strait and extending southwestward the wind stresses are much weaker both to the southeast and northwest of this strong band fig 3a this pattern agrees well with climatology fang et al 2006 the std of wind stresses shows a similar spatial pattern as the mean wind stresses with a strong variational band from taiwan strait and extending southwestward with the maximum std near taiwan strait surface wind stresses to the southeast and northwest of this band do not change much this std pattern suggests that there are larger variations associated with stronger winds than the weak winds fig 3b 3 3 near surface currents it was shown that sometimes the scswc flows beneath the ocean surface while the currents at the surface follow the wind direction guan and fang 2006 thus we show the currents averaged over the top 50 m in the region of interest to represent the surface currents as suggested by chiang et al 2008 the monthly mean near surface currents show no signature of the scswc over the continental shelf in december 1994 fig 4 as suggested by the mean ssh in the same month via geostrophic balance over the continental shelf fig 2b instead the monthly mean near surface currents mainly flow southwestward over the continental shelf following the wind over the 22 year reanalysis time period none of the winter monthly mean near surface currents indicates the existence of scswc agreeing with previous studies that suggested the scswc does not persist throughout the winter seasons chao et al 1995 yang 2006 chiang et al 2008 we will provide an explanation for this in section 7 4 statistics of the scswc in this section we summarize some basic statistics of the scswc from the reanalysis these statistics include the occurrence rate duration length magnitude and the location of the scswc these statistics are calculated from the daily average hycom output based on previous observations zhong 1990 we decide to detect the scswc using the upper 50 m average alongshore velocity in the rectangular area from 115 to 116 e and 21 5 to 22 n this area is between the 50 and 200 m isobaths and on top of 100 m isobath white box fig 2b we focus on the area less than 200 m because it is hard to find continuous counter wind currents between 200 and 300 m isobaths this is in good agreement with the small ssh std roughly along the 200 m isobath fig 2c section 3 1 if the area averaged alongshore velocity in this area is positive the scswc exists on that day an event of the scswc is defined as the currents occurring on consecutive days or one day only a one day event there are 546 days of the scswc occurrence in the 21 winters on average there are 26 days of the scswc occurrence per winter and 9 5 scswc events with an average event duration of 2 7 days we also examine the daily averaged ssh and upper ocean currents when the scswc occurs to determine its location and magnitude somewhat surprisingly the scswc generally does not exist near hainan island but instead exists hundreds of kilometers to the northeast does this suggest that the scswc originates on the shelf away from hainan island the scswc only spans the whole continental shelf from taiwan to hainan island more than 1100 km when an event lasts three days or longer during such events it can reach the gulf of tonkin vietnam at 18 n for one day events the scswc usually exists northward of 21 n towards taiwan strait which is 400 km long the positive alongshore velocity of the scswc can reach to 150 m depth the barotropic alongshore velocity is as large as 0 28 m s along the 100 m isobath and reached 0 10 m s along the 200 m isobath in the december 1994 event shown below 5 eeof analysis of ssh and wind stress anomaly a fundamental response over the continental shelves to the wind forcing expected from dynamics is the generation and propagation of the coastal topographic waves jacobs et al 1998 demonstrated that wind bursts and relaxation excite coastal topographic waves in the east china sea their figure 3 these waves then propagate southwards along the continental shelf and pass through taiwan strait ko et al 2003 chao et al 1995 observed that the emergence of the northeastward scswc begins from the northeastern shelf 115 e 21 n after wind relaxation and expands southwestward they attributed this to the propagation of topographic waves from the daily average ssh animation generated from the reanalysis we often see a wave like feature with lower ssh than that near hainan island propagate southwestwards from the southern end of taiwan strait along the continental shelf as a precursor to the scswc in winter is this wave like feature a topographic wave in this section we perform an eeof analysis on the hourly ssh and wind stress anomalies we choose eeof over eof because it constitutes an extension of the traditional eof to deal not only with the spatial but also the temporal correlations to identify the spatial patterns of the propagating features weare and nasstrom 1982 chen and harr 1993 eeof is an eof analysis with a modified data matrix in eof each row vector represents a data map p locations at one time instance and each column vector represents a time series m time instances at a specific location of the data map the eof data matrix n in this case has dimensions of m by p as shown below 2 n n 1 1 n 1 2 n 1 p n 2 1 n 2 2 n 2 p n m 1 n m 2 n m p an eof analysis uses the variance matrix to define the periodic signals each row vector of an eeof data matrix on the other hand contains not only the data map at a given time but also at some series of times into the past or future in this study we perform a 36 hour time lag eeof analysis to the hourly data sets with 6 hour increment the row vector is extended as 3 n t n t 1 n t p n t 6 1 n t 6 p n t 12 1 n t 12 p n t 36 1 n t 36 p where t varies from 1 to m 36 the data matrix has dimensions of m 36 by 7 p thus an eeof analysis on the matrix applies lagged auto covariance matrix to find both the propagating and or periodic signals an eof analysis of the scs ssh has been performed previously at the seasonal and interannual time scales using altimetry data shaw et al 1999 ho et al 2000 chu et al 2003 fang et al 2006 in our case we focus on the ssh variations on the time scale of days as there is no persistent scswc in winter to do so we remove the monthly mean and conduct a 3 month eeof analysis for every winter season starting from december 1 for the 22 year period 1994 to 2015 the results discussed below are for december 1994 to february 1995 only we choose this specific winter season because there exists one of the longest scswc occurrences during the 22 year analysis from 7 to 13 december 1994 more importantly there exists a 3 day period with quasi constant wind stress and ssh within this event as shown below this provides a wonderful opportunity to reveal the dynamics of the scswc in both the cross shore and alongshore direction however sometimes eeof results are hard to interpret and can be misleading if the time lag is not chosen with care monahan et al 1999 hannachi et al 2007 when there are strong standing waves or a dipole in the primary eof pattern in this study the most significant mode is a standing wave mode we chose a 36 h lag to avoid this which is much less than the first zero autocorrelation function monahan et al 1999 of the leading eof mode time series for both ssh and wind stress 127 h time lags from 36 to 0 h with 6 h increment are used in the eeof analysis time lags shorter and longer still shorter than 127 h than 36 h are also tested and the results are not sensitive to our choice of time lag ssh eeof analyses over the entire 22 year period all show two dominant modes the ekman transport mode leading mode and the coastal topographic wave mode second mode during the 22 year reanalysis period these two modes explain an average of 77 of the total ssh variance the first and second ssh eeof modes account for 61 and 16 of the total variance respectively fig 5 there are 6 winters when the third ssh eeof explains more than 10 of the total variance and all of these are either from an eddy mode due to the existence of one or two eddies in the deep basin or the kuroshio intrusion mode for instance the third ssh eeof mode from december 1994 to february 1995 is a kuroshio intrusion mode due to the intrusion of kuroshio through luzon strait fig 2a and it explains 10 of the total variance since these low energy modes are not consistent have very small ssh anomaly over the continental shelf and thus a very small contribution to the scswc we choose to only analyze the first two dominant modes 5 1 eeof of ssh the first ssh eeof mode indicates a standing wave explaining 61 of the total ssh variance fig 6a it shows a negative ssh anomaly over the continental shelf region that increases offshore the near zero magnitude of ssh anomaly along the shelf break indicates that the standing wave has its node along the shelf break and antinode along the coast line this suggests that this mode causes the ssh to move up and down over the continental shelf while the ssh along the shelf break remains essentially the same the magnitude of the ssh anomaly varies slightly during the 36 hour period but its pattern remains the same please note that the mode expansion coefficient time series fig 6b is normalized by its magnitude so that its range is from 1 to 1 and the mode is amplified accordingly this first mode fig 6a indicates an amplitude of 4 m comparable to the range of mean ssh over the study domain which is 45 m fig 2b the expansion coefficient time series fig 6b black shows a 7 day period from 7 gmt on 6 december to 17 gmt on 13 december 1994 with consecutive positive values there exists a more than 3 day period from 3 gmt on 9 december to 13 gmt on 12 december 1994 fig 6b dashed vertical black lines with an almost constant value of 1 to reconstruct the ssh anomaly associated with a mode at any particular time t the ssh anomaly is obtained by weighted average of the mode at time lag δ multiplied by the expansion coefficient at time t δ over the 36 hour period hannachi et al 2007 in this case δ varies from 18 to 18 with 6 h increment the ssh anomaly at 15 gmt on 11 december 1994 is reconstructed and composited with the monthly mean fig 7a to show that this mode is able to reverse the cross shore pressure gradient and thus the surface geostrophic flow over most of the shelf but not the shallower region 50 m to the west of 115 e where ssh still indicates a weak offshore pressure gradient force the scswc can be clearly seen from the near surface currents at the same time instant red arrows fig 7a from northeast of hainan island to taiwan strait the strongest currents are more than 3 m s but there are still weak southwestward currents to the west of 115 e over the shallowest water along the coast the second eeof mode suggests a typical coastal topographic wave development propagation over a 36 hour period which explains 14 of the total ssh variations fig 6c it demonstrates a negative ssh anomaly that propagates southwards over the shelf from 36 to 24 hour lag a positive ssh anomaly develops at 24 hour lag near taiwan strait and propagates southwards and reaches hainan island at 0 hour lag the phase speed of the topographic wave estimated from the ssh anomaly along the coast of china fig 8a is 12 8 m s which agrees well with the coastal topographic waves estimated by jacobs et al 1998 5 2 eeof of wind stresses the first eeof mode of the wind stresses also shows a standing pattern explaining 64 of total wind stress variabilities fig 9a the spatial pattern indicates a southwestward oriented band of strong positive wind stress anomaly emanating from taiwan strait the strong wind stress anomaly gradually decreases to the southeast and northwest of the band the magnitude of the mode changes with time for example the strong positive wind stress anomaly extends southwestwards from taiwan strait with time from 36 hour lag to 18 hour lag but its pattern remains with time the mode expansion coefficient time series fig 9b black suggests a 1 week period the same as ssh fig 6b black of consecutive positive wind stress anomaly i e wind relaxation from 0 gmt on 6 december to 8 gmt on 13 december 1994 the time period with the consecutive coefficient bigger than 0 85 is marked between the two vertical black dashed lines from 3 gmt on 9 december to 3 gmt on 12 december 1994 the second mode of the wind stresses suggests a reversal process of the wind stress fig 9c anomaly over the shelf the positive wind stress anomaly decreases from 36 hour lag to 24 hour lag and moves southwestwards at the same time the negative wind stress anomaly occurs at 24 hour lag at taiwan strait grows stronger and extends southwestwards from 24 hour lag to 0 hour lag the second eeof wind stress mode accounts for 15 of the total variance 5 3 dynamics of ssh variation the expansion coefficient time series of the first ssh eeof mode fig 6b black is highly correlated with the time series of the first wind stresses eeof mode fig 9b black significant to the 99 confidence level with correlation coefficient of 0 95 the time lag associated with this correlation is 10 hours and with the variation of wind stress leading the ssh variation the positive wind stress anomaly implies alongshore wind relaxation and thus this high correlation suggests that wind relaxation leads to a negative ssh anomaly over the shelf and wind bursts lead to positive ssh anomalies this is the ssh setdown setup due to the ekman transport defined below 4 u e τ v ρ o f where τ v is the alongshore wind stress ρ o is a reference density for seawater and f is the coriolis parameter the negative alongshore wind stress anomaly wind burst pushes water to the right side of its direction to generate a positive ssh anomaly over the continental shelf and during wind relaxation the positive alongshore wind stress anomaly pushes water to the right of the wind stress anomaly direction to generate offshore ekman transport total ekman transport along the 200 m isobath with strongest wind stress anomaly on 11 december 1994 is calculated as 22 sv offshore at this rate it takes only 21 min to move enough water 2 8 1010 m3 the area times the ssh anomaly due to the ekman mode out of the continental shelf to generate the negative ssh anomaly on that day the excess water is compensated by the inshore currents along the sea floor to support the costal upwelling as shown in fig 7a the wind relaxation itself is able to generate the ssh anomaly to reverse the mean ssh gradient over the whole shelf to create northeastward currents via geostrophic balance the expansion coefficient time series of the second ssh eeof mode fig 6b red is also highly correlated with the time series of the second wind stress eeof mode fig 9b red significant to the 99 confidence level the correlation coefficient is 0 92 associated with a time lag of 12 h which suggests that the wind stress anomaly reversal leads the generation propagation of the topographic waves by 12 h the wind stress anomaly reversal fig 9c indicates that the generation propagation of the coastal topographic waves is the result of the strong sudden wind events which agrees with jacobs et al 1998 the wind burst negative wind stress anomaly enhances the propagation of coastal topographic waves with positive ssh anomalies that can reverse transport through taiwan strait ko et al 2003 the wind relaxation the positive stress anomaly is associated with the propagation of topographic waves with negative ssh anomalies 6 alongshore dynamics in this section we assume a slab model and compare the two alongshore forces pressure gradient force and wind stress the idea of treating the scs continental shelf in winter as a slab is not new almost all of the previous research on this topic treat the scswc in winter as a barotropic process since strong wind and surface cooling in winter work together to make the water well mixed over the shelf thus we treat the alongshore dynamics as governed chiang et al 2008 by 5 v t f u g s s h y τ v ρ o h f r i where u and v are depth averaged cross shore and alongshore velocities respectively g is the gravitational parameter h is the water depth and fri is the friction that is always against the alongshore flow the first right hand term is the pressure gradient force and the second represents the depth average of the alongshore kinematic wind stress if there exists a long enough period that we can assume a steady state eq 5 is the same as the alongshore equation of the arrested topographic wave csanady 1978 6 1 wind relaxation the 3 day period from 3 gmt on 9 december to 3 gmt on 12 december 1994 is taken to represent the wind relaxation case both wind stresses and ssh are almost constant with time vertical black dashed lines on figs 6b 9b and thus we treat it as a steady state the first ssh eeof mode clearly demonstrates that wind relaxation can reverse the cross shore pressure gradient force from offshore fig 2b to onshore fig 7a it also indicates that wind relaxation increases the alongshore pressure gradient force from northeast of hainan island to taiwan strait over the shelf fig 7b illustrates that the alongshore pressure gradient force at 15 gmt on 11 december 1994 associated with the first ssh eeof mode is mainly positive along the shelf thus this is the period with weaker wind stresses and stronger alongshore pressure gradient force than the monthly mean values table 1 the area average of the four terms in eq 5 over the continental shelf in the domain shallower than 200 m isobath is summarized in table 1 during this period of wind relaxation the sum of the alongshore pressure gradient force and the depth average kinematic wind stress g s s h y τ v ρ o h are mainly positive over the continental shelf fig 10a the area average of the pressure gradient force is 2 2 10 6 m s2 and the depth average kinematic wind stress over the shelf in the domain shallower than 200 m is 0 73 10 6 m s2 table 1 this indicates that the magnitude of the alongshore pressure gradient force is larger than the wind stress as a result the water flows alongshore northeastward to generate a negative fri 0 50 10 6 m s2 and also offshore to generate a positive coriolis force 0 97 10 6 m s2 to balance the force table 1 the most dominant force during the wind relaxation period is the alongshore pressure gradient force but along the coast to the west of 116 e in waters shallower than 50 m the sum of these two forces is mainly negative fig 10a suggesting that the water flows southwestward to generate a positive fri this agrees well with the sandwich structure of the scswc as illustrated by qiu et al 1985 and guan 1993 and is also consistent with what we see from the ssh pattern and near surface currents fig 7a what it means dynamically is that the depth average wind stress dominates along the coast due to the shallower water depths even though the wind stress is weaker along the coast figs 2c and 8a another region with negative force on the continental shelves is to the west northwestof dongsha island fig 10a the alongshore pressure gradient force from the ekman mode over this region is almost zero fig 7b which indicates that the ssh anomaly contours associated with the ekman mode are almost parallel to the alongshore direction over the region this suggests that the currents in this region should be further north of east as illustrated by fig 7a this is the region where the direction of the near surface currents is 50 60 north of east changing the alongshore direction to 50 produces the positive forces over the region 6 2 strong wind the 3 day period from 17 gmt on 17 december to 17 gmt on 20 december 1994 is taken to represent the strong wind period thin vertical black lines on figs 6b and 9b during this period the wind stresses are strong and consistently southwestward the alongshore pressure gradient force anomaly associated with the first eeof mode has the same pattern as the one with wind relaxation fig 7b but in opposite direction which is negative relative to the mean state this wind burst period has stronger wind stress 5 8 10 6 m s2 and weaker alongshore pressure gradient force 0 30 10 6 m s2 opposite to the wind relaxation case table 1 the sum of the alongshore pressure gradient force and the wind stress are negative over the continental shelf fig 10b this force drives the water southwestward to generate positive friction 3 1 10 6 m s2 and inshore to generate a negative coriolis force 2 4 10 6 m s2 to balance the force the most dominant force during this period is the wind stress while the alongshore pressure gradient force is the least important table 1 for both wind relaxation and strong wind cases one needs to ignore the pattern at depths greater than 200 m where the assumption of a slab model eq 5 is no longer valid in the deep basin the pattern is fully dominated by the pressure gradient force as the depth average kinematic wind stress is practically negligible at these depths in the wind relaxation case we assume a steady state since alongshore wind stresses and ssh are almost constant in the strong wind case ssh and alongshore wind stresses can change as much as 50 figs 6b 9b the time average is taken to represent the steady state most of the wind relaxation periods are shorter than 3 days and thus cannot be treated as steady state in those cases wind relaxation generates positive alongshore velocity tendency v t to slow down the southwestward currents and eventually overturns and generates a counter wind scswc 7 observed features and the origin of the scswc below we apply the dynamics from sections 4 and 5 to explain some of the observed features of the scswc and define the origin of the scswc 7 1 why there is no monthly mean scswc in winter it isclear that the monthly mean ssh in december 1994 fig 2b does not support northeastward geostrophic surface currents as shown in fig 4 however the mean ssh pattern supports a positive alongshore pressure gradient force according to previous studies this would generate scswc persisting in the winter season however our results indicate that it is the sum of the alongshore pressure gradient force and the wind stresses that determines the ageostrophic currents not the pressure gradient force alone in this section we perform a similar alongshore force comparison the same as what we did in section 6 but for the monthly mean wind stresses 3 7 10 6 m s2 and alongshore pressure gradient force table 1 0 80 10 6 m s2 the spatial pattern of the sum of these two forces fig 10c over the continental shelf are very similar to the pattern in strong wind case fig 10b except that the magnitude is smaller this clearly demonstrates the dominance of the monthly mean wind stresses over the alongshore pressure gradient force monthly mean alongshore flow also follows the mean wind towards the southwest thus the scswc cannot be persistent over the winter season 7 2 the origin of the scswc most previous research concludes that the scswc originates from hainan island chiang et al 2008 further suggested that scswc originates from the gulf of tonkin vietnam since the first ssh eeof mode indicates an ekman mode that covers the whole continental shelf does this mode support the opinion that the scswc originates from the southern shelf near hainan island four ssh fields 12 h apart starting from 12 gmt on 6 december 1994 are plotted to demonstrate the onset of the scswc fig 11a they indicate that lower ssh 6 m contour cyan color is moving southwestwards along the continental shelf from the northern shelf the composite fig 11b of the monthly mean ssh and the anomaly associated with the ekman mode fig 11c suggests that the wave like feature we often observe in the daily average ssh animation section 5 is generated by the ekman effect and not by the topographic waves this is really due to the fact that the mean ssh is lower to the northern shelf fig 2b and the ssh anomaly varies relatively uniformly in the cross shore direction fig 6a when winds start relaxing on 6 december the ekman effect generates negative ssh anomaly over the whole shelf the negative ssh anomaly is weak before 0 gmt on december 7 figs 11c1 and 11c2 and only able to reverse the ssh cross shore gradient to the east of 117 e figs 11b1 and 11b2 since the mean ssh gradient is smaller there between 50 and 200 m isobath fig 2b as winds continue relaxing the negative ssh anomaly becomes stronger figs 11c3 and 11c4 and is able to reverse the mean ssh gradient to the east of hainan fig 11b4 between the 50 and 200 m isobaths the counter wind currents first appear only at the very north of the continental shelf red arrows fig 12a move southwards figs 12b and 12c and finally cover the whole shelf from east of hainan to south of taiwan strait at 0 gmt on december 8 1994 fig 12d thus these results show that the scswc in winter originates in the area south of taiwan strait when the winds relax and extends southwards over the shelf as the wind continues to relax but is this always the case a hovmöller diagram of the near surface alongshore currents averaged over the top 50 m along a scswc path over the shelf is shown in fig 8b the path black line fig 1a is defined as the 125 m isobath from 17 n to 21 n and then a straight line from 115 36 e 21 02 n to 119 04 e 23 5 n the tilt in the vertical streaks from the upper left to the lower right indicating the scswc extends from the area south of taiwan strait southwestwards agreeing with the dynamics mentioned above the strongest scswc event in this season can reach to 17 5 n more than 1000 km long but other events like the one on february 9 1995 only exist in the northern shelf to the north of 21 n if the scswc originates from gulf of tonkin or hainan island the tilt in the vertical streaks should be from lower left to the upper right but that is not the case 7 3 increasing scswc downstream our results also clearly illustrate the coexistence of the scswc sandwiched between the southwestward guangdong coastal currents from 110 e to 117 e fig 12 and the cyclonic upper ocean circulation over the central basin during wind relaxation periods in winter season that is consistent with previous findings qiu et al 1985 guan 1993 between the 50 m and 200 m isobaths the positive monthly mean cross shore pressure gradient force is strongest near hainan and becomes smaller northeastward from 111 e to 116 e fig 2b the monthly mean currents averaged over the top 50 m are stronger near hainan and becomes weaker northeastward from 111 e to 116 e fig 4 relative to the mean ssh gradient the negative ssh anomaly associated with the first mode varies uniformly in the cross shore direction fig 11c along the whole shelf the negative cross shore pressure gradient force associated with the ekman mode balances the mean positive pressure gradient force and eventually reverses it when winds relax because the mean cross shore pressure gradient force is strongest near hainan the combined mean ekman mode cross shore pressure gradient force is negative but has a smaller magnitude than that to the northeast of hainan along the shelf to 116 e due to geostrophy the northeastward scswc is weaker near hainan and increases downstream fig 12d shows the strongest scswc occurs at 115 e and agrees well with the previous observations zhong 1990 8 conclusions in this study we investigate the generation mechanism of the counter wind characteristics of the scswc in the winter seasons using output from a 22 year 1994 2015 hycom global reanalysis the reanalysis is forced with atmospheric forcing from the 0 3125 hourly ncep cfsr dataset and a wind stress formulation that takes into account the ocean surface currents because of the latter the wind stress is bigger over the scswc than those calculated only by 10 m wind velocities we performed two analyses 1 an eeof analysis on the hourly ssh and alongshore wind stress in each winter and 2 a comparison of the alongshore pressure gradient force and the alongshore wind stress the eeof analysis reveals that the leading ssh eeof mode which explains more than 60 of the total variance is the direct result of ekman transport during wind bursts the water is pushed inshore and piles up along the coast when winds relax the ekman transport is offshore the closer to the coast the bigger change of the ssh the second ssh eeof mode represents the generation propagation of the coastal topographic waves that are excited by the wind change when winds relax it is associated with the propagation of the waves with negative ssh anomaly monthly mean ssh demonstrates a strong positive cross shore pressure gradient force the ekman effect associated with wind relaxation can produce a large enough pressure gradient to reverse the cross shore pressure gradient force to generate northeastward counter wind flow the propagation of the topographic waves associated with wind relaxation is secondary to enhance the process because the mean cross shore pressure gradient is smaller in the area south of taiwan strait than over the rest of the shelf the ekman effect reverses the cross shore pressure gradient in the northern shelf first thus the scswc originates from the northern shelf in the area south of taiwan strait ssh eeof analysis also indicates that wind relaxation increases the alongshore pressure gradient force while wind bursts decrease the alongshore pressure gradient force during the 3 day wind relaxation period in december 1994 the stronger positive alongshore pressure gradient force overtakes the weaker alongshore wind stresses to push the water northeastward and in the strong wind case the southwestward wind stresses are much stronger than the weaker than

23882,we investigate the impact of several parameters on the lifecycle of an anticyclonic eddy lying in a topographic depression a bowl similar to the lofoten vortex and the rockall trough eddy cases we observe that the vortex merger with submesoscale coherent vortices generated at depth allows the eddy to grow in size and intensify at depth wintertime convection is also shown to directly intensify the eddy by deepening isopycnals also convection indirectly affects the shape of the eddy it enhances the number of merger 1 at the surface with small vortices generated in the convectively deepened surface mixed layer and 2 at depth because the vertical distance between the main eddy s core and small companion vortices is reduced thus increasing the merging efficiency these processes altogether contribute to the maintaining of the eddy on the other hand the bottom drag is the main process contributing to the decay of the eddy our study thus shows that the sustaining for several years of such eddies trapped in a bowl is mainly due to the balance between merger and bottom drag keywords mesoscale vortex merger convection 1 introduction mesoscale eddies are a prominent feature of the ocean circulation they have a strong influence on biological activity chelton et al 2011 tracer transport zhang et al 2014 and physical and chemical properties of the water column dong et al 2014 in some regions semi permanent eddies can be seen throughout the year at a nearly constant position among other examples two particular cases are the lofoten vortex lv and the rockall trough eddy rt eddy these two semi permanent eddies have the peculiarity to be anticyclonic and located above a topographic depression a bowl the formation of such vortices has recently been examined by solodoch et al 2021 authors showed using idealized simulations that successive merging events form a permanent anticyclone lying in the topographic depression the dynamics of the resulting vortex depends on the ratio of eddy s vorticity to topography s potential vorticity however the mechanisms that sustain semi permanent anticyclones in bowl like topography such as the lv and the rt eddy are not yet fully understood the lv can be found in the lofoten basin in the nordic seas it appears as a large anticyclone at the center of the basin it was first detected by in situ data between 1970 and 1990 ivanov and korablev 1995 the lv is intensified between 700 and 900 m depth and has a radius of about 30 km yu et al 2017 two processes are candidate to explain the long lifetime of the lv first from observational data ivanov and korablev 1995 and bosse et al 2019 argued that wintertime intensification resulting from convection plays a determinant role in sustaining the lv second model studies showed that the lv is sustained by the merger and alignment with smaller vortices generated by unstable boundary currents köhl 2007 trodahl et al 2020 in the current state of knowledge the relative importance of each process is not clear one of the aims of the present study is to give new answers to this question the rt eddy is located in the rockall trough off ireland in the north atlantic it has a clear signature at the sea surface heywood et al 1994 white and heywood 1995 volkov 2005 xu et al 2015 but also at depth with high values of eddy available potential energy roullet et al 2014 this eddy is less sampled than the lv and less known however thanks to recent in situ deployments it has been shown that it is intensified at depth with a maximum azimuthal velocity of 0 3 m s 1 near 500 m depth smilenova et al 2020 it has a radius of approximately 40 km and can reach down to 1500 m its lifecycle as well as the mechanisms that sustain it are yet poorly documented however recent model studies by le corre et al 2019 and smilenova et al 2020 have shown some evidences that 1 the rt eddy formation is the result of successive mergers of deeply generated submesoscale vortices along the porcupine bank 2 the merger of the rt eddy with these small vortices as well as wintertime convection sustain the rt eddy and allow it to remain semi permanent in the rockall trough in this paper we investigate the impact of several parameters on the lifecycle of an anticyclonic eddy lying in a topographic depression in particular we discuss the impact of merger and convection on the lifetime and shape of the anticyclone to explore the parameter space we use an idealized approach based on the rockall trough eddy case this allows to 1 discuss on the general behavior of anticyclonic eddies in a bowl and 2 give insights in the particular case of the rockall trough eddy that is yet poorly documented in section 2 we present the methods the numerical simulation setup and the diagnostics performed on outputs in section 3 we present the results of our study the impact of the different parameters on the vortex dynamics in section 4 we summarize and discuss the results 2 methods 2 1 the numerical simulations in this section we present the idealized simulations performed for this study the aim of these simulations is to simulate schematically the dynamics occurring in the rockall trough area a semi permanent anticyclone the rt eddy lying in a bowl like topography fed by anticyclonic submesoscale coherent vortices scvs generated hundreds of kilometers away from the main eddy hereafter the main eddy designates the eddy that lies approximately in the center of the bowl like topography and merges with smaller scvs we detail each aspect of the simulation in the following subsections 2 1 1 numerical setup and domain the simulations rely on a 3d primitive equation framework they are performed using the coastal and regional ocean community model croco shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 this model solves the hydrostatic primitive equations for the velocity temperature and salinity using a full equation of state for seawater shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2011 the simulations integrate the primitive equations for about 7 and a half years the numerical settings are similar to previous simulations performed in an idealized context see e g ménesguen et al 2018 horizontal advection terms for tracers and momentum are discretized with fifth order upwind advection schemes up5 the explicit horizontal viscosity and diffusivity are set to zero since the up5 scheme damps dispersive errors the vertical advection is discretized with a fourth order centered parabolic spline reconstruction splines scheme further discussion about these parameterizations can be found in klein et al 2008 or ménesguen et al 2018 vertical mixing of tracers and momentum is done using a k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 and the effect of bottom friction is parameterized through a logarithmic law of the wall with the same parameters than in e g gula et al 2015 or le corre et al 2020 some simulations are run without this bottom drag to study its impact on the vortex dynamics simulations have 64 terrain following vertical levels which are stretched such that the resolution increases in the depth range where the main eddy lies giving δ z 20 m from surface to 1000 m depth and 20 δ z 90 m below the horizontal resolution is δ x 5 km the domain is chosen so that it represents schematically the rt area see fig 1 a b the domain is 2000 km and 1000 km wide zonally and meridionally respectively a bowl like topography is placed at the center of the domain to represent the rt topographic depression it is modeled by a gaussian function h h 0 h 1 exp r 2 2 r 2 with r x x 0 2 y y 0 2 x 0 1000 km y 0 600 km r 100 km h 0 2000 m and h 1 500 m such that the simulation is 2000 m deep everywhere except in the bowl where it reaches 2500 m deep the background stratification is the average stratification in the rt area see fig 1 c d it is defined as the average stratification in the rt from le corre et al 2020 s simulation a return to this background stratification is set in the boundaries at these boundaries a 10 km wide sponge layer avoid the generation of spurious boundary dynamics 2 1 2 the scv shotgun in the rt scvs are generated along the porcupine bank smilenova et al 2020 to simulate this scv generation we designed a scv shotgun that continuously generates scvs at a given depth during the simulation it is placed at 300 km from the bowl like topography center this distance is chosen so that it is similar to the one between the porcupine bank and the rt eddy position in reality see fig 1 a b the scv shotgun is based on the principle fully described in deremble et al 2016 at boundary singularities such as corners vorticity is injected into the domain even for free slip boundary conditions we add a land mask forming a corner i e a boundary singularity at the south of the domain with a free slip condition along this mask then we impose a meridional current at depth along the mask see fig 2 a of the form v v 0 exp x x 0 2 2 l 2 exp z z 0 2 2 h 2 with v 0 0 4 m s 1 l 30 km and h 200 m as discussed in deremble et al 2016 the horizontal extension and intensity of generated scvs are mainly controlled by the sub grid parameterization and horizontal discretization such that l and v 0 poorly control the shape of scvs after sensitivity tests we chose the aforementioned values for v 0 l and h such that the model stability is satisfying and that the properties and the frequency of generation of scvs are similar to the one observed in realistic simulations of the rockall trough smilenova et al 2020 i e about 10 scvs are generated each year we also vary z 0 1250 1000 750 500 250 m to discuss the impact of the scv depth on the merging process they are called deep middle deep middle middle surf and surf cases respectively in the following note that the middle case is the one representative of rt scv generation see e g fig 11 in smilenova et al 2020 this current is geostrophically adjusted with the density field at the southern boundary see fig 2 a examples of scv generation in the middle case are shown in fig 2 b c 2 1 3 the rockall trough anticyclone as discussed in the introduction a semi permanent anticyclonic eddy is present in the rt throughout the whole year the rt eddy to simulate this presence we add in some simulations at initialization a composite anticyclone representative of the rt eddy above the center of the bowl like topography at x x 0 and y y 0 the blue cross position in fig 1 b this composite was extracted from a realistic simulation representing the subpolar north atlantic gyre it is fully described in le corre et al 2020 the 2011 vertical properties of the simulated rt eddy being close to ship board conductivity temperature depth ctd data collected in january 2011 see the supplementary material of smilenova et al 2020 this simulation is assumed to represent well the rt eddy dynamics an example of rt eddy occurrence in the simulation is shown in fig 3 a we tracked the rt eddy by following the maximum ssh value in the area after isolating the eddy we took its temporal main structure and azimuthally averaged it to obtain the main composite structure of the rt eddy fig 3 b c d e 2 1 4 add convection the wintertime convection may play an important role in the intensification and the maintenance of anticyclonic eddies gelderloos et al 2011 bosse et al 2016 2019 in particular in high latitude areas such as the rt to discuss the impact of the convection on the intensity of the rt eddy we ran simulations with a surface net heat flux snhf representative of the rt area it is calculated as an average of the snhf from carton et al 2018 in the area of latitude and longitude comprised respectively between 53 n and 57 n and 15 w and 11 w the annual variation of snhf imposed in the simulations with convection is shown in fig 4 2 1 5 sum up a total of 16 simulations have been run and analyzed to study the impact of the different parameters presence and depth of the scv shotgun presence of the rt eddy at initialization convection bottom drag on the rt eddy intensity and dynamics the different simulations are summarized in table 1 mrtdc is the simulation closest to the reality as it includes all features and forcings occurring in the rt area scvs generated at a realistic depth convection bottom drag and a anticyclonic eddy at the center of the bowl like topography 2 2 diagnostics we describe in this section the diagnostics performed on the simulation outputs 2 2 1 detection of the main eddy in each simulation we detect the main eddy using the angular momentum eddy detection and tracking algorithm ameda le vu et al 2018 one of the benefits of ameda is that it does not depend on arbitrary thresholding which would require a fine tuning of geometrical parameters also the algorithm is robust with respect to the grid resolution and can thus be applied to a wide variety of velocity fields experimental numerical derived from altimetry this algorithm has been used and validated in previous observational and numerical studies ioannou et al 2017 le vu et al 2018 garreau et al 2018 de marez et al 2019 de marez et al 2020 see also an example of application of ameda in https www1 lmd polytechnique fr dyned this algorithm works as follows a from the velocity fields it computes the local normalized angular momentum lnam mkhinini et al 2014 and the local okubo weiss parameter low at each point b then it seeks lnam local maxima where low 0 c if these maxima are surrounded by a closed streamline they are flagged as eddy centers a full description of the algorithm is presented in fig 1 of le vu et al 2018 in this study the detection is done using daily velocity fields at 250 500 750 1000 and 1250 m depth for surf middle surf middle middle deep and deep cases respectively choosing the depth of detection as equal to the depth of scv generation ensures an accurate estimation of the radius increase of the main eddy when it merges with scvs the main eddy s edge is defined as its contour of maximal velocity the mean radius of this contour at a given time is r m a x we use this contour to compute volume integrated quantities assuming that the eddy is roughly cylindrical in simulations with a composite anticyclonic eddy at initialization the main eddy is simply the initial eddy that we follow in time for simulations with no eddy at t 0 the main eddy is defined as the first scv that reaches the center of the bowl like topography and then grow in size due to merging with other scvs 2 2 2 kinetic energy budget in the primitive equation framework the kinetic energy ke equation can be obtained by taking the inner product of the horizontal velocities with the momentum equations it follows 1 1 2 t u i 2 u j j 1 2 u i 2 w z 1 2 u i 2 u i ρ 0 i p v i u i d i u i s i u i with summation convention i 1 2 and j 1 2 u i are the horizontal component of velocity i the components of the vector differential operator v i the components of the parameterized vertical mixing d i the components of the horizontal diffusion and s i other sources and sinks due to restoring nudging boundary conditions this equation is then vertically integrated and we define hadv d z u j j 1 2 u i 2 vadv d z w z 1 2 u i 2 prsgrd d z u i ρ 0 i p vmix d z v i u i hmix explicit part of d z d i u i hdiff implicit part of d z d i u i nudg d

of the bottom drag for the ke at a given time t finally we horizontally integrate the results in the main eddy s contour s calculated by ameda this allows to follow in detail which physical mechanism is responsible for the evolution of the main eddy s ke 3 results in this section we describe the results of our study we first explain qualitatively the course of a simulation representative of the rt i e the mrtd simulation then we discuss the impact of the different parameters on the evolution of the main eddy 3 1 qualitative evolution of the simulations in the mrtd simulation the main eddy is present from t 0 at the center of the bowl topography see fig 5 for the time evolution of the mrtd simulation because it is anticyclonic it is stuck in the center of the bowl to conserve its potential vorticity carnevale et al 1991 thus it cannot climb out without external disturbance during the first year of the simulation the main eddy does not move from the center of the bowl its volume slightly increases because of a azimuthal mode 2 and mode 4 destabilization similar to the one observed in de marez et al 2020a a vorticity tripole can be seen at t 5 months in fig 5 simultaneously scvs are generated at the corner of the land mask as shown in deremble et al 2016 such boundary singularities generate dipolar structures in our case about 35 dipoles are generated each year the anticyclonic pole is attracted by the bowl while the cyclonic pole tends to step aside indeed on a slope the topographic β drift makes anticyclones resp cyclones drift downhill resp uphill lacasce 1998 lam and dritschel 2001 this leads to the separation of about all dipoles in two monopoles of opposite vorticities also in some cases the positive pole is rolled up around the anticyclone leading to a shielded anticyclonic scv in both cases this results into anticyclonic scvs attracted by the bowl however they do not all reach the bowl i e the places where the floor is deeper than 2000 m only about ten anticyclonic scvs per year manage to reach it this is mainly due to the fact that just after generation scvs merge between each other and subsequently converge to the center of the bowl at the start of the second year of simulation scvs start to interact with the main eddy these scvs have two effects first the scvs velocity field slightly disturb the main eddy resulting in small displacements of the main eddy in the bowl from this date the main eddy can thus be found at tens of kilometers from the center of the bowl see e g t 15 25 or 55 months in fig 5 second scvs merge with the main eddy in this simulation i e during about 7 years and a half 41 merging events between scvs and the main eddy are observed two kinds of merger occur on the one hand small scvs that have experienced a few merging with other scvs before reaching the bowl are attracted by the main eddy and steered around it they are finally absorbed by the main eddy which eventually grows by aggregating vorticity and azimuthal velocity outside of its core sutyrin and radko 2019 sutyrin 2019 this mechanism is referred to as vortex thinning in the literature a vortex thinning event results in a small increase of the eddy volume examples can be seen at t 15 or 70 months in fig 5 on the other hand the main eddy can merge with scvs that have grown in size due to successive merging with other scvs this results in situations where the main eddy is either of the same size of the vortex it merges with or smaller than it in both cases the merging is roughly symmetric and it results in an abrupt increase of volume of the main eddy an example can be seen between t 30 and 35 months in fig 5 these mergers can also be called alignment because the main eddy s core density is not necessarily the same than its companion s one see e g nof and dewar 1994 and sections 7 1 3 and 7 2 4 of lilly et al 2003 that discuss cases of vortex alignment in the labrador sea it can be mentioned that in a stratified fluid mergers must manifest as alignment because there will always be small differences in the core density of the two eddies the impact of this three dimensional view is discussed in the next sections also we detail in the following the physical mechanism that occur in the simulations and lead to changes of volume for the main eddy 3 2 mechanisms of eddy growth in all simulations as in e g mrtd see fig 5 the main eddy growth is intermittent and occurs at specific moments of the simulation as discussed in the introduction this eddy growth can be attributed to two mechanisms merging with vortex companions and convection we detail in this section these physical mechanisms 3 2 1 merging with scvs to discuss the impact of merger on the main eddy we analyze the time evolution of r max in different simulations see fig 6 both kinds of merging events discussed in the previous section for mrtd simulation vortex thinning and symmetric merger can be seen in fig 6 a they appear as steps in the time evolution of r max at e g t 35 or 75 months in the mrtd simulation see arrows in fig 6 a in all simulations symmetric mergers have a greater impact on r max as it can double the radius of the main eddy in a few days in all simulations with the rt composite at initialization fig 6 a the radius of the main eddy oscillates around about 30 km after periods of radius decrease the merging efficiently increases the radius the horizontal extension of the main eddy is thus similar to its initial one after 7 years of simulation it can be noticed that in the srtd simulation the main eddy appears to have a larger radius than in other simulations even with this difference the purely horizontal view described by the time evolution of r max is qualitatively similar in drtd mdrtd mrtd msrtd and srtd the main difference between the simulations is the final vertical shape of the main eddy e g after 66 months fig 7 in the drtd simulation the main eddy has a 3d shape similar to the initial rt composite this is due to the fact that scvs have difficulty to merge with the main eddy oppositely in the srtd and msrtd simulations scvs easily merge with the main eddy and thus drastically modify its 3d shape the final shape of the main eddy differs from the rt composite because it is intensified at the surface with a larger horizontal extension due to the numerous mergers it experienced in the mrtd and mdrtd simulations the merging events lead to an important intensification of the eddy intensity at depth in the mdrtd simulation the final shape of the main eddy is a double core eddy with two vorticity maxima at 500 m depth and 1300 m depth the merging efficiency is not the same in all simulations because of 1 the background stratification and 2 the vertical structures of the main eddy and the scvs it merges with indeed verron et al 1990 verron and valcke 1994 corréard and carton 1999 altogether showed using 2 layer numerical simulations that the merger or alignment of two like signed vortices depends on their shape before the merging vortices can be separated into two kinds pvi potential vorticity initialization vortices and rvi relative vorticity initialization vortices pvi vortices are represented by a patch of constant potential vorticity in a single layer and in some cases a vertical dipole of potential vorticity associated with nearly barotropic relative vorticity rvi vortices have a constant relative vorticity in a single layer corréard and carton 1999 showed that pvi vortices easily align together while rvi vortices do not verron et al 1990 verron and valcke 1994 showed that the ambient stratification plays a different role in the merging depending on the vortex shape rvi vortex merger strongly depends on the stratification while pvi vortex merger does not if the stratification is weak rvi vortices form a pair of heton like structures that repel each other if the stratification is stronger the ambient flow is more barotropic and merger is easier in a configuration more realistic than the 2 layer quasi geostrophic model like in our study the distinction between rvi or pvi vortices can be tricky because of the gaussian vertical shape that eddies often take mcwilliams 1985 in our simulations the categorization of eddies is difficult because the main eddy and its companion eddies can be categorized as pvi like vortices they appear as roughly constant pv patches confined in a single layer see fig 8 but also rvi like vortices the maximum of relative vorticity is confined in 1000 m deep layers around which the relative vorticity either changes sign or is close to zero merging vortices are thus pvi rvi hybrids the background stratification should thus play a role in the merger efficiency our background stratification is similar to the rt case fig 1 d and it has brunt väisälä frequency maxima at the surface and near 750 m depth thus for rvi vortices the merger is facilitated at these particular depths while it is harder to merge for deeper eddies this could explain in part why scvs have more difficulties to merge with the main eddy in the drtd simulation than in the other simulations one can observe a critical depth for the scv shotgun between 1000 and 750 m depth for which the merging alignment of eddies do not lead to the intensification of the main eddy s core if scvs are close enough in both vertical and horizontal directions they eventually align with the main eddy but this only results in a deepening of the eddy and or a double core eddy with no influence on the original eddy core because of the complicated form of eddies and ambient stratification it is here difficult to be more quantitative about the key parameters that influence the merging a more extensive study in the parameter space would be necessary to discuss in details the alignment of vortices in a 3d primitive equation framework if no initial rt composite is present the time evolution of r max fig 6 b is roughly similar to cases described above however the main eddy vertical structure near the end of the simulation is strongly influenced by the scvs generation depth fig 7 in the dd simulation scvs hardly merge because of the weak stratification below 1000 m depth leading to a weak resulting eddy intensified at depth in the sd simulation scvs are not very intense but they easily merge leading to a weak surface intensified anticyclone that does not resemble the rt eddy either in the md simulation the final shape of the main eddy is roughly similar to the mrtd simulation s one this shows that the merging of scvs between each other produces an eddy similar to the rt eddy only if scvs are generated at a realistic depth where merger is easier because of the strong stratification this supports the view of smilenova et al 2020 that from an ocean at rest the rt eddy results from a succession of merging events between scvs generated at 750 m depth 3 3 on the importance of convection if we add a negative heat flux at the surface as in rtdc mrtdc drtdc or dc simulations convection appears as a result isopycnals deepen during about 6 months each year following the imposed seasonal cycle fig 4 the ertel potential vorticity q defined as 3 q f 0 ζ z b z v x b z u y b with f 0 the coriolis frequency b the buoyancy and ζ the relative vorticity undergoes a seasonal increase in the main eddy s core see fig 9 b the shallower the scv shotgun is the larger this intensification this mechanism of intensification by wintertime convection is rather multifaceted the deepening of the core intensifies radial density gradients and subsequently increases the azimuthal velocity of the eddy during these convective periods the main eddy is thus intensified and its radius increases see fig 9 a on the other hand when density gradients are increased the eddy is no longer in thermal wind balance and therefore an adjustment meditated by a secondary circulation is required we refer the reader to legg et al 1998 legg and mcwilliams 2001 for a full explanation of this process if we compare the rtd and the rtdc simulations one can see that even if no scv shotgun is present the evolution of the main eddy s radius experiences sharp increases in the presence of convection this is due to the fact that during convective periods the surface mixed layer deepens in the whole domain and scvs are spontaneously generated by mixed layer baroclinic instabilities callies et al 2015 this leads to vortex thinning events between convectively generated scvs and the main eddy that subsequently increase the main eddy s radius schubert et al 2020 these events appear throughout the whole simulation involving convection and they are difficult to characterize because they can be generated above the main eddy and merge with it within a few days however it can be noticed that in the simulation with both a scv shotgun at mid depth and convection mrtdc we observe that the main eddy s radius continuously oscillates between a mean value of about 30 km in this simulation the scvs are more numerous than in the mrtd simulation the number of merging events of small scvs with the main eddy is larger when convection is present this leads to a lot of small increases of radius rather than decrease periods followed by a large increase convection and merging events with convectively generated scvs act together to increase the horizontal shape of the main eddy but also its intensity at depth indeed with convection the main eddy is more intensified at depth than in simulation without convection see e g fig 9 c for the drtdc simulation the main eddy is intensified at a depth where no merging with neither the convectively generated scvs in the mixed layer nor the scv shotgun scvs occurs this reflects the importance of the direct convectively driven mode as mentioned in the previous section if the scvs are generated below a critical depth e g in drtd simulation little merging events are observed if we add the convection drtdc simulation the main eddy s core deepens subsequently the vertical distance between the main eddy s core and scvs decreases and merger alignment is eased this leads to a deep intensification of the main eddy see fig 9 c convection thus allows to intensify the main eddy s core by 1 deepening the core during wintertime 2 generating small scvs by mixed layer instabilities that can eventually merge with the main eddy and 3 helping alignment by reducing the distance between the main eddy s core and deeply generated scvs it should be noticed however that from our analysis the relative importance of these three mechanisms cannot be precisely gauged this quantification should be the aim of further investigations as a sensitivity test we also ran a simulation with only convection dc simulation not shown in this simulation anticyclonic convectively generated scvs are attracted by the bowl shaped topography they subsequently merge between each other and eventually form a 50 km radius anticyclone in the bowl i e a main eddy this eddy appears after about 33 months of simulation and is intensified between 1000 and 1500 m depth this test further shows that the convection by itself is sufficient to lead to a single long lived anticyclonic eddy in a bowl topography 3 4 mechanisms of eddy decay as can be seen in the time evolution of r max see e g fig 6 after the main eddy s radius increases due to either merging or convection periods of decay that can last for several years are observed during these periods little merging occur and some physical mechanisms lead to the erosion of the eddy we describe those in the following section 3 4 1 bottom drag the principal mechanism responsible for the eddy decay in our simulations is the bottom drag we observe that no radius decay period are seen in simulations without bottom drag parameterization fig 10 a this leads to a main eddy being too intense and too large in comparison with the rt eddy also without drag the main eddy becomes anomalously barotropic see for instance fig 11 c it thus has a 3d shape very different from the rt eddy the bottom drag seems to be the major limiting factor for the eddy growth due to merging with scvs in the ke equation budget fig 10 b the pressure gradient the advection and the coriolis terms dominate the main eddy s ke gain c in fig 10 b they are the result of merging with other coherent structures scvs and conversion from potential to kinetic energy not shown the horizontal diffusion and mixing as well as volume change and nudging have a neglectable contribution to the ke budget b the bottom drag a 2 included in the vertical mixing a 1 appears to dominate the main eddy s ke loss it compensates the other terms and increases in amplitude each time the eddy gains ke by merging with other vortices the bottom drag contribution is intensified when the main eddy drifts away from the center of the bowl because the water depth is smaller it is thus greater just before symmetric merger events because the main eddy co rotates with its companion and subsequently drifts away from the center of the bowl this can be seen in fig 10 b with drag ke term peaking just before merging related steps see at e g t 35 months 3 4 2 centrifugal instability in cases without drag it can be seen that the main eddy still experiences abrupt radius decrease events see e g between t 1500 and 1700 days in mrt simulation fig 11 a at this time a rapid radius decrease is seen just after a vortex thinning event with a small scv horizontal sections of relative vorticity fig 11 b show that after the main eddy absorbs the scv a spiral like pattern appears in the eddy s core this pattern is seen in the whole water column there the normalized relative vorticity reaches ζ f 0 1 this pattern is typical of centrifugal instability cushman roisin and beckers 2011 this diagnostic is confirmed by the following facts 1 the pv in the eddy s core is negative near its center green contours in fig 11 b which is the necessary condition f q 0 for centrifugal instability 2 the horizontal shear terms are responsible for the extreme decrease of pv in the eddy s core not shown negative pv patches are strongly unstable and the nearly materially conserved nature of pv implies that negative pv does not occur spontaneously inside the fluid thus the generation of negative pv in the fluid must be forced for instance by appropriate frictional interactions with nearby boundaries or interactions with the wind here no such mechanism is present the decrease of pv is due to the abrupt change of horizontal velocity gradients resulting from the vortex thinning of a small scv around the main eddy fig 11 b the change of pv occurs where density fronts are sharp and parameterized diapycnal mixing occurs see appendix c in de marez et al 2020a the centrifugal instability is thus triggered by the interaction of the main eddy with the scv and eventually leads to an abrupt erosion of the eddy about five major centrifugal instability events occur at t 1000 days see the peaks of red dashed curve in fig 11 a that show times when negative pv is seen in the eddy s core note that before t 1000 days negative pv is found in the eddy s core but with values very close to zero the eddy is thus at this moment not intense enough to be subject to the instability such centrifugal instabilities are preferably seen in simulations without drag in those the main eddy is more intense and it reaches very low pv values that are suitable for instabilities nevertheless such instabilities can still be seen in e g mrtd simulation with a smaller signature than in mrt not shown 4 summary and discussion we studied the lifecycle of an anticyclonic eddy trapped in a bowl like topography which is subject to the interaction with like signed scvs and or convection from the analysis of 16 simulations with varying parameters we show that the balance between merger and bottom drag allows the eddy to have a roughly constant 3d shape throughout several years on the one hand the vortex merger with small scvs allows the eddy to grow in size and intensify at depth as merger events occur at the scv generation depth the final main eddy is intensified at this particular depth these mergers are enhanced when scvs are generated at a depth where the stratification is large and when convection is at work indeed the convection 1 deepens the main eddy and increases the merger efficiency at depth and 2 generates other scvs in the mixed layer that eventually merge with the main eddy on the other hand the bottom drag erodes the eddy the bottom drag is the main contribution to the eddy s ke loss when it is not included in simulation the eddy becomes barotropic and centrifugal instabilities triggered by the merger with scvs erode the eddy over the whole water column merging and convection both contribute to the maintaining of anticyclonic eddies trapped in bowl shaped topographies our study thus shows that it is difficult to disentangle the two mechanisms in particular if we replace this in a more realistic context however the final shape of the main eddy can give keys about the mechanisms responsible for the long lifetime of such eddies if the main eddy is intensified at multiple depth it has e g a double core eddy the eddy has certainly experienced one or several merging with other vortices also if the depth of intensification of the main eddy is correlated with the depth of a scv generation site nearby merger between these vortices probably happened one can therefore state that in these cases merging played a major role in the maintaining of the eddy in the real ocean other processes can affect the shape of such an eddy for instance internal waves and fine scale o 1 m processes can lead to the dissipation of long lived mesoscale eddies in the lv case fer et al 2018 showed through high resolution turbulence measurements that the background shear as well as near inertial waves trapped by the negative vorticity of the lv are the dominant sources of kinetic energy loss more generally internal waves are suspected to drain a significant part of the energy of such mesoscale eddies barkan et al 2021 these mechanisms are hardly resolved in the simulations discussed in the present paper and are mainly controlled by the numerical parameterization i e the vertical mixing induced by the kpp scheme furthermore the simulation lacks realistic levels of internal waves simulations with higher resolution and fully realistic atmospheric and tidal forcings should thus be required in order to determine the relative importance of these other processes compared to the bottom drag at larger scales opposite signed mesoscale coherent structures can travel to the eddy s location this could modify the behavior of the eddy by dipolar effect and affect the merging efficiency with scvs rodríguez marroyo et al 2011 furthermore the presence of a mean current due to large scale circulation or local coastal current can erode the eddy because of the presence of an ambient horizontal shear perrot and carton 2010 if the eddy moves toward the coast the interaction with coastal kelvin waves can also affect its trajectory and shape dewar and hogg 2010 gula and zeitlin 2010 hogg et al 2011 de marez et al 2020b despite this in the rockall trough as well as in e g the lofoten basin the semi permanent anticyclonic eddies are rather isolated from the coast and other currents our study can thus support the view of smilenova et al 2020 or trodahl et al 2020 that such semi permanent anticyclonic eddies are mainly maintained by the merger or alignment with smaller scale vortices in this high latitude regions convection is large and indeed deepens isopycnal and subsequently increases the eddy s core potential vorticity as discussed in e g bosse et al 2019 however we show here that convection principally enhances the number of merger with small eddies either at the surface or at depth with scvs the merging alignment with scvs is thus likely to be the more important mechanism to sustain mesoscale anticyclones trapped in a bowl as stated in the lv case by trodahl et al 2020 and by smilenova et al 2020 in

23882,we investigate the impact of several parameters on the lifecycle of an anticyclonic eddy lying in a topographic depression a bowl similar to the lofoten vortex and the rockall trough eddy cases we observe that the vortex merger with submesoscale coherent vortices generated at depth allows the eddy to grow in size and intensify at depth wintertime convection is also shown to directly intensify the eddy by deepening isopycnals also convection indirectly affects the shape of the eddy it enhances the number of merger 1 at the surface with small vortices generated in the convectively deepened surface mixed layer and 2 at depth because the vertical distance between the main eddy s core and small companion vortices is reduced thus increasing the merging efficiency these processes altogether contribute to the maintaining of the eddy on the other hand the bottom drag is the main process contributing to the decay of the eddy our study thus shows that the sustaining for several years of such eddies trapped in a bowl is mainly due to the balance between merger and bottom drag keywords mesoscale vortex merger convection 1 introduction mesoscale eddies are a prominent feature of the ocean circulation they have a strong influence on biological activity chelton et al 2011 tracer transport zhang et al 2014 and physical and chemical properties of the water column dong et al 2014 in some regions semi permanent eddies can be seen throughout the year at a nearly constant position among other examples two particular cases are the lofoten vortex lv and the rockall trough eddy rt eddy these two semi permanent eddies have the peculiarity to be anticyclonic and located above a topographic depression a bowl the formation of such vortices has recently been examined by solodoch et al 2021 authors showed using idealized simulations that successive merging events form a permanent anticyclone lying in the topographic depression the dynamics of the resulting vortex depends on the ratio of eddy s vorticity to topography s potential vorticity however the mechanisms that sustain semi permanent anticyclones in bowl like topography such as the lv and the rt eddy are not yet fully understood the lv can be found in the lofoten basin in the nordic seas it appears as a large anticyclone at the center of the basin it was first detected by in situ data between 1970 and 1990 ivanov and korablev 1995 the lv is intensified between 700 and 900 m depth and has a radius of about 30 km yu et al 2017 two processes are candidate to explain the long lifetime of the lv first from observational data ivanov and korablev 1995 and bosse et al 2019 argued that wintertime intensification resulting from convection plays a determinant role in sustaining the lv second model studies showed that the lv is sustained by the merger and alignment with smaller vortices generated by unstable boundary currents köhl 2007 trodahl et al 2020 in the current state of knowledge the relative importance of each process is not clear one of the aims of the present study is to give new answers to this question the rt eddy is located in the rockall trough off ireland in the north atlantic it has a clear signature at the sea surface heywood et al 1994 white and heywood 1995 volkov 2005 xu et al 2015 but also at depth with high values of eddy available potential energy roullet et al 2014 this eddy is less sampled than the lv and less known however thanks to recent in situ deployments it has been shown that it is intensified at depth with a maximum azimuthal velocity of 0 3 m s 1 near 500 m depth smilenova et al 2020 it has a radius of approximately 40 km and can reach down to 1500 m its lifecycle as well as the mechanisms that sustain it are yet poorly documented however recent model studies by le corre et al 2019 and smilenova et al 2020 have shown some evidences that 1 the rt eddy formation is the result of successive mergers of deeply generated submesoscale vortices along the porcupine bank 2 the merger of the rt eddy with these small vortices as well as wintertime convection sustain the rt eddy and allow it to remain semi permanent in the rockall trough in this paper we investigate the impact of several parameters on the lifecycle of an anticyclonic eddy lying in a topographic depression in particular we discuss the impact of merger and convection on the lifetime and shape of the anticyclone to explore the parameter space we use an idealized approach based on the rockall trough eddy case this allows to 1 discuss on the general behavior of anticyclonic eddies in a bowl and 2 give insights in the particular case of the rockall trough eddy that is yet poorly documented in section 2 we present the methods the numerical simulation setup and the diagnostics performed on outputs in section 3 we present the results of our study the impact of the different parameters on the vortex dynamics in section 4 we summarize and discuss the results 2 methods 2 1 the numerical simulations in this section we present the idealized simulations performed for this study the aim of these simulations is to simulate schematically the dynamics occurring in the rockall trough area a semi permanent anticyclone the rt eddy lying in a bowl like topography fed by anticyclonic submesoscale coherent vortices scvs generated hundreds of kilometers away from the main eddy hereafter the main eddy designates the eddy that lies approximately in the center of the bowl like topography and merges with smaller scvs we detail each aspect of the simulation in the following subsections 2 1 1 numerical setup and domain the simulations rely on a 3d primitive equation framework they are performed using the coastal and regional ocean community model croco shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 this model solves the hydrostatic primitive equations for the velocity temperature and salinity using a full equation of state for seawater shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2011 the simulations integrate the primitive equations for about 7 and a half years the numerical settings are similar to previous simulations performed in an idealized context see e g ménesguen et al 2018 horizontal advection terms for tracers and momentum are discretized with fifth order upwind advection schemes up5 the explicit horizontal viscosity and diffusivity are set to zero since the up5 scheme damps dispersive errors the vertical advection is discretized with a fourth order centered parabolic spline reconstruction splines scheme further discussion about these parameterizations can be found in klein et al 2008 or ménesguen et al 2018 vertical mixing of tracers and momentum is done using a k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 and the effect of bottom friction is parameterized through a logarithmic law of the wall with the same parameters than in e g gula et al 2015 or le corre et al 2020 some simulations are run without this bottom drag to study its impact on the vortex dynamics simulations have 64 terrain following vertical levels which are stretched such that the resolution increases in the depth range where the main eddy lies giving δ z 20 m from surface to 1000 m depth and 20 δ z 90 m below the horizontal resolution is δ x 5 km the domain is chosen so that it represents schematically the rt area see fig 1 a b the domain is 2000 km and 1000 km wide zonally and meridionally respectively a bowl like topography is placed at the center of the domain to represent the rt topographic depression it is modeled by a gaussian function h h 0 h 1 exp r 2 2 r 2 with r x x 0 2 y y 0 2 x 0 1000 km y 0 600 km r 100 km h 0 2000 m and h 1 500 m such that the simulation is 2000 m deep everywhere except in the bowl where it reaches 2500 m deep the background stratification is the average stratification in the rt area see fig 1 c d it is defined as the average stratification in the rt from le corre et al 2020 s simulation a return to this background stratification is set in the boundaries at these boundaries a 10 km wide sponge layer avoid the generation of spurious boundary dynamics 2 1 2 the scv shotgun in the rt scvs are generated along the porcupine bank smilenova et al 2020 to simulate this scv generation we designed a scv shotgun that continuously generates scvs at a given depth during the simulation it is placed at 300 km from the bowl like topography center this distance is chosen so that it is similar to the one between the porcupine bank and the rt eddy position in reality see fig 1 a b the scv shotgun is based on the principle fully described in deremble et al 2016 at boundary singularities such as corners vorticity is injected into the domain even for free slip boundary conditions we add a land mask forming a corner i e a boundary singularity at the south of the domain with a free slip condition along this mask then we impose a meridional current at depth along the mask see fig 2 a of the form v v 0 exp x x 0 2 2 l 2 exp z z 0 2 2 h 2 with v 0 0 4 m s 1 l 30 km and h 200 m as discussed in deremble et al 2016 the horizontal extension and intensity of generated scvs are mainly controlled by the sub grid parameterization and horizontal discretization such that l and v 0 poorly control the shape of scvs after sensitivity tests we chose the aforementioned values for v 0 l and h such that the model stability is satisfying and that the properties and the frequency of generation of scvs are similar to the one observed in realistic simulations of the rockall trough smilenova et al 2020 i e about 10 scvs are generated each year we also vary z 0 1250 1000 750 500 250 m to discuss the impact of the scv depth on the merging process they are called deep middle deep middle middle surf and surf cases respectively in the following note that the middle case is the one representative of rt scv generation see e g fig 11 in smilenova et al 2020 this current is geostrophically adjusted with the density field at the southern boundary see fig 2 a examples of scv generation in the middle case are shown in fig 2 b c 2 1 3 the rockall trough anticyclone as discussed in the introduction a semi permanent anticyclonic eddy is present in the rt throughout the whole year the rt eddy to simulate this presence we add in some simulations at initialization a composite anticyclone representative of the rt eddy above the center of the bowl like topography at x x 0 and y y 0 the blue cross position in fig 1 b this composite was extracted from a realistic simulation representing the subpolar north atlantic gyre it is fully described in le corre et al 2020 the 2011 vertical properties of the simulated rt eddy being close to ship board conductivity temperature depth ctd data collected in january 2011 see the supplementary material of smilenova et al 2020 this simulation is assumed to represent well the rt eddy dynamics an example of rt eddy occurrence in the simulation is shown in fig 3 a we tracked the rt eddy by following the maximum ssh value in the area after isolating the eddy we took its temporal main structure and azimuthally averaged it to obtain the main composite structure of the rt eddy fig 3 b c d e 2 1 4 add convection the wintertime convection may play an important role in the intensification and the maintenance of anticyclonic eddies gelderloos et al 2011 bosse et al 2016 2019 in particular in high latitude areas such as the rt to discuss the impact of the convection on the intensity of the rt eddy we ran simulations with a surface net heat flux snhf representative of the rt area it is calculated as an average of the snhf from carton et al 2018 in the area of latitude and longitude comprised respectively between 53 n and 57 n and 15 w and 11 w the annual variation of snhf imposed in the simulations with convection is shown in fig 4 2 1 5 sum up a total of 16 simulations have been run and analyzed to study the impact of the different parameters presence and depth of the scv shotgun presence of the rt eddy at initialization convection bottom drag on the rt eddy intensity and dynamics the different simulations are summarized in table 1 mrtdc is the simulation closest to the reality as it includes all features and forcings occurring in the rt area scvs generated at a realistic depth convection bottom drag and a anticyclonic eddy at the center of the bowl like topography 2 2 diagnostics we describe in this section the diagnostics performed on the simulation outputs 2 2 1 detection of the main eddy in each simulation we detect the main eddy using the angular momentum eddy detection and tracking algorithm ameda le vu et al 2018 one of the benefits of ameda is that it does not depend on arbitrary thresholding which would require a fine tuning of geometrical parameters also the algorithm is robust with respect to the grid resolution and can thus be applied to a wide variety of velocity fields experimental numerical derived from altimetry this algorithm has been used and validated in previous observational and numerical studies ioannou et al 2017 le vu et al 2018 garreau et al 2018 de marez et al 2019 de marez et al 2020 see also an example of application of ameda in https www1 lmd polytechnique fr dyned this algorithm works as follows a from the velocity fields it computes the local normalized angular momentum lnam mkhinini et al 2014 and the local okubo weiss parameter low at each point b then it seeks lnam local maxima where low 0 c if these maxima are surrounded by a closed streamline they are flagged as eddy centers a full description of the algorithm is presented in fig 1 of le vu et al 2018 in this study the detection is done using daily velocity fields at 250 500 750 1000 and 1250 m depth for surf middle surf middle middle deep and deep cases respectively choosing the depth of detection as equal to the depth of scv generation ensures an accurate estimation of the radius increase of the main eddy when it merges with scvs the main eddy s edge is defined as its contour of maximal velocity the mean radius of this contour at a given time is r m a x we use this contour to compute volume integrated quantities assuming that the eddy is roughly cylindrical in simulations with a composite anticyclonic eddy at initialization the main eddy is simply the initial eddy that we follow in time for simulations with no eddy at t 0 the main eddy is defined as the first scv that reaches the center of the bowl like topography and then grow in size due to merging with other scvs 2 2 2 kinetic energy budget in the primitive equation framework the kinetic energy ke equation can be obtained by taking the inner product of the horizontal velocities with the momentum equations it follows 1 1 2 t u i 2 u j j 1 2 u i 2 w z 1 2 u i 2 u i ρ 0 i p v i u i d i u i s i u i with summation convention i 1 2 and j 1 2 u i are the horizontal component of velocity i the components of the vector differential operator v i the components of the parameterized vertical mixing d i the components of the horizontal diffusion and s i other sources and sinks due to restoring nudging boundary conditions this equation is then vertically integrated and we define hadv d z u j j 1 2 u i 2 vadv d z w z 1 2 u i 2 prsgrd d z u i ρ 0 i p vmix d z v i u i hmix explicit part of d z d i u i hdiff implicit part of d z d i u i nudg d

of the bottom drag for the ke at a given time t finally we horizontally integrate the results in the main eddy s contour s calculated by ameda this allows to follow in detail which physical mechanism is responsible for the evolution of the main eddy s ke 3 results in this section we describe the results of our study we first explain qualitatively the course of a simulation representative of the rt i e the mrtd simulation then we discuss the impact of the different parameters on the evolution of the main eddy 3 1 qualitative evolution of the simulations in the mrtd simulation the main eddy is present from t 0 at the center of the bowl topography see fig 5 for the time evolution of the mrtd simulation because it is anticyclonic it is stuck in the center of the bowl to conserve its potential vorticity carnevale et al 1991 thus it cannot climb out without external disturbance during the first year of the simulation the main eddy does not move from the center of the bowl its volume slightly increases because of a azimuthal mode 2 and mode 4 destabilization similar to the one observed in de marez et al 2020a a vorticity tripole can be seen at t 5 months in fig 5 simultaneously scvs are generated at the corner of the land mask as shown in deremble et al 2016 such boundary singularities generate dipolar structures in our case about 35 dipoles are generated each year the anticyclonic pole is attracted by the bowl while the cyclonic pole tends to step aside indeed on a slope the topographic β drift makes anticyclones resp cyclones drift downhill resp uphill lacasce 1998 lam and dritschel 2001 this leads to the separation of about all dipoles in two monopoles of opposite vorticities also in some cases the positive pole is rolled up around the anticyclone leading to a shielded anticyclonic scv in both cases this results into anticyclonic scvs attracted by the bowl however they do not all reach the bowl i e the places where the floor is deeper than 2000 m only about ten anticyclonic scvs per year manage to reach it this is mainly due to the fact that just after generation scvs merge between each other and subsequently converge to the center of the bowl at the start of the second year of simulation scvs start to interact with the main eddy these scvs have two effects first the scvs velocity field slightly disturb the main eddy resulting in small displacements of the main eddy in the bowl from this date the main eddy can thus be found at tens of kilometers from the center of the bowl see e g t 15 25 or 55 months in fig 5 second scvs merge with the main eddy in this simulation i e during about 7 years and a half 41 merging events between scvs and the main eddy are observed two kinds of merger occur on the one hand small scvs that have experienced a few merging with other scvs before reaching the bowl are attracted by the main eddy and steered around it they are finally absorbed by the main eddy which eventually grows by aggregating vorticity and azimuthal velocity outside of its core sutyrin and radko 2019 sutyrin 2019 this mechanism is referred to as vortex thinning in the literature a vortex thinning event results in a small increase of the eddy volume examples can be seen at t 15 or 70 months in fig 5 on the other hand the main eddy can merge with scvs that have grown in size due to successive merging with other scvs this results in situations where the main eddy is either of the same size of the vortex it merges with or smaller than it in both cases the merging is roughly symmetric and it results in an abrupt increase of volume of the main eddy an example can be seen between t 30 and 35 months in fig 5 these mergers can also be called alignment because the main eddy s core density is not necessarily the same than its companion s one see e g nof and dewar 1994 and sections 7 1 3 and 7 2 4 of lilly et al 2003 that discuss cases of vortex alignment in the labrador sea it can be mentioned that in a stratified fluid mergers must manifest as alignment because there will always be small differences in the core density of the two eddies the impact of this three dimensional view is discussed in the next sections also we detail in the following the physical mechanism that occur in the simulations and lead to changes of volume for the main eddy 3 2 mechanisms of eddy growth in all simulations as in e g mrtd see fig 5 the main eddy growth is intermittent and occurs at specific moments of the simulation as discussed in the introduction this eddy growth can be attributed to two mechanisms merging with vortex companions and convection we detail in this section these physical mechanisms 3 2 1 merging with scvs to discuss the impact of merger on the main eddy we analyze the time evolution of r max in different simulations see fig 6 both kinds of merging events discussed in the previous section for mrtd simulation vortex thinning and symmetric merger can be seen in fig 6 a they appear as steps in the time evolution of r max at e g t 35 or 75 months in the mrtd simulation see arrows in fig 6 a in all simulations symmetric mergers have a greater impact on r max as it can double the radius of the main eddy in a few days in all simulations with the rt composite at initialization fig 6 a the radius of the main eddy oscillates around about 30 km after periods of radius decrease the merging efficiently increases the radius the horizontal extension of the main eddy is thus similar to its initial one after 7 years of simulation it can be noticed that in the srtd simulation the main eddy appears to have a larger radius than in other simulations even with this difference the purely horizontal view described by the time evolution of r max is qualitatively similar in drtd mdrtd mrtd msrtd and srtd the main difference between the simulations is the final vertical shape of the main eddy e g after 66 months fig 7 in the drtd simulation the main eddy has a 3d shape similar to the initial rt composite this is due to the fact that scvs have difficulty to merge with the main eddy oppositely in the srtd and msrtd simulations scvs easily merge with the main eddy and thus drastically modify its 3d shape the final shape of the main eddy differs from the rt composite because it is intensified at the surface with a larger horizontal extension due to the numerous mergers it experienced in the mrtd and mdrtd simulations the merging events lead to an important intensification of the eddy intensity at depth in the mdrtd simulation the final shape of the main eddy is a double core eddy with two vorticity maxima at 500 m depth and 1300 m depth the merging efficiency is not the same in all simulations because of 1 the background stratification and 2 the vertical structures of the main eddy and the scvs it merges with indeed verron et al 1990 verron and valcke 1994 corréard and carton 1999 altogether showed using 2 layer numerical simulations that the merger or alignment of two like signed vortices depends on their shape before the merging vortices can be separated into two kinds pvi potential vorticity initialization vortices and rvi relative vorticity initialization vortices pvi vortices are represented by a patch of constant potential vorticity in a single layer and in some cases a vertical dipole of potential vorticity associated with nearly barotropic relative vorticity rvi vortices have a constant relative vorticity in a single layer corréard and carton 1999 showed that pvi vortices easily align together while rvi vortices do not verron et al 1990 verron and valcke 1994 showed that the ambient stratification plays a different role in the merging depending on the vortex shape rvi vortex merger strongly depends on the stratification while pvi vortex merger does not if the stratification is weak rvi vortices form a pair of heton like structures that repel each other if the stratification is stronger the ambient flow is more barotropic and merger is easier in a configuration more realistic than the 2 layer quasi geostrophic model like in our study the distinction between rvi or pvi vortices can be tricky because of the gaussian vertical shape that eddies often take mcwilliams 1985 in our simulations the categorization of eddies is difficult because the main eddy and its companion eddies can be categorized as pvi like vortices they appear as roughly constant pv patches confined in a single layer see fig 8 but also rvi like vortices the maximum of relative vorticity is confined in 1000 m deep layers around which the relative vorticity either changes sign or is close to zero merging vortices are thus pvi rvi hybrids the background stratification should thus play a role in the merger efficiency our background stratification is similar to the rt case fig 1 d and it has brunt väisälä frequency maxima at the surface and near 750 m depth thus for rvi vortices the merger is facilitated at these particular depths while it is harder to merge for deeper eddies this could explain in part why scvs have more difficulties to merge with the main eddy in the drtd simulation than in the other simulations one can observe a critical depth for the scv shotgun between 1000 and 750 m depth for which the merging alignment of eddies do not lead to the intensification of the main eddy s core if scvs are close enough in both vertical and horizontal directions they eventually align with the main eddy but this only results in a deepening of the eddy and or a double core eddy with no influence on the original eddy core because of the complicated form of eddies and ambient stratification it is here difficult to be more quantitative about the key parameters that influence the merging a more extensive study in the parameter space would be necessary to discuss in details the alignment of vortices in a 3d primitive equation framework if no initial rt composite is present the time evolution of r max fig 6 b is roughly similar to cases described above however the main eddy vertical structure near the end of the simulation is strongly influenced by the scvs generation depth fig 7 in the dd simulation scvs hardly merge because of the weak stratification below 1000 m depth leading to a weak resulting eddy intensified at depth in the sd simulation scvs are not very intense but they easily merge leading to a weak surface intensified anticyclone that does not resemble the rt eddy either in the md simulation the final shape of the main eddy is roughly similar to the mrtd simulation s one this shows that the merging of scvs between each other produces an eddy similar to the rt eddy only if scvs are generated at a realistic depth where merger is easier because of the strong stratification this supports the view of smilenova et al 2020 that from an ocean at rest the rt eddy results from a succession of merging events between scvs generated at 750 m depth 3 3 on the importance of convection if we add a negative heat flux at the surface as in rtdc mrtdc drtdc or dc simulations convection appears as a result isopycnals deepen during about 6 months each year following the imposed seasonal cycle fig 4 the ertel potential vorticity q defined as 3 q f 0 ζ z b z v x b z u y b with f 0 the coriolis frequency b the buoyancy and ζ the relative vorticity undergoes a seasonal increase in the main eddy s core see fig 9 b the shallower the scv shotgun is the larger this intensification this mechanism of intensification by wintertime convection is rather multifaceted the deepening of the core intensifies radial density gradients and subsequently increases the azimuthal velocity of the eddy during these convective periods the main eddy is thus intensified and its radius increases see fig 9 a on the other hand when density gradients are increased the eddy is no longer in thermal wind balance and therefore an adjustment meditated by a secondary circulation is required we refer the reader to legg et al 1998 legg and mcwilliams 2001 for a full explanation of this process if we compare the rtd and the rtdc simulations one can see that even if no scv shotgun is present the evolution of the main eddy s radius experiences sharp increases in the presence of convection this is due to the fact that during convective periods the surface mixed layer deepens in the whole domain and scvs are spontaneously generated by mixed layer baroclinic instabilities callies et al 2015 this leads to vortex thinning events between convectively generated scvs and the main eddy that subsequently increase the main eddy s radius schubert et al 2020 these events appear throughout the whole simulation involving convection and they are difficult to characterize because they can be generated above the main eddy and merge with it within a few days however it can be noticed that in the simulation with both a scv shotgun at mid depth and convection mrtdc we observe that the main eddy s radius continuously oscillates between a mean value of about 30 km in this simulation the scvs are more numerous than in the mrtd simulation the number of merging events of small scvs with the main eddy is larger when convection is present this leads to a lot of small increases of radius rather than decrease periods followed by a large increase convection and merging events with convectively generated scvs act together to increase the horizontal shape of the main eddy but also its intensity at depth indeed with convection the main eddy is more intensified at depth than in simulation without convection see e g fig 9 c for the drtdc simulation the main eddy is intensified at a depth where no merging with neither the convectively generated scvs in the mixed layer nor the scv shotgun scvs occurs this reflects the importance of the direct convectively driven mode as mentioned in the previous section if the scvs are generated below a critical depth e g in drtd simulation little merging events are observed if we add the convection drtdc simulation the main eddy s core deepens subsequently the vertical distance between the main eddy s core and scvs decreases and merger alignment is eased this leads to a deep intensification of the main eddy see fig 9 c convection thus allows to intensify the main eddy s core by 1 deepening the core during wintertime 2 generating small scvs by mixed layer instabilities that can eventually merge with the main eddy and 3 helping alignment by reducing the distance between the main eddy s core and deeply generated scvs it should be noticed however that from our analysis the relative importance of these three mechanisms cannot be precisely gauged this quantification should be the aim of further investigations as a sensitivity test we also ran a simulation with only convection dc simulation not shown in this simulation anticyclonic convectively generated scvs are attracted by the bowl shaped topography they subsequently merge between each other and eventually form a 50 km radius anticyclone in the bowl i e a main eddy this eddy appears after about 33 months of simulation and is intensified between 1000 and 1500 m depth this test further shows that the convection by itself is sufficient to lead to a single long lived anticyclonic eddy in a bowl topography 3 4 mechanisms of eddy decay as can be seen in the time evolution of r max see e g fig 6 after the main eddy s radius increases due to either merging or convection periods of decay that can last for several years are observed during these periods little merging occur and some physical mechanisms lead to the erosion of the eddy we describe those in the following section 3 4 1 bottom drag the principal mechanism responsible for the eddy decay in our simulations is the bottom drag we observe that no radius decay period are seen in simulations without bottom drag parameterization fig 10 a this leads to a main eddy being too intense and too large in comparison with the rt eddy also without drag the main eddy becomes anomalously barotropic see for instance fig 11 c it thus has a 3d shape very different from the rt eddy the bottom drag seems to be the major limiting factor for the eddy growth due to merging with scvs in the ke equation budget fig 10 b the pressure gradient the advection and the coriolis terms dominate the main eddy s ke gain c in fig 10 b they are the result of merging with other coherent structures scvs and conversion from potential to kinetic energy not shown the horizontal diffusion and mixing as well as volume change and nudging have a neglectable contribution to the ke budget b the bottom drag a 2 included in the vertical mixing a 1 appears to dominate the main eddy s ke loss it compensates the other terms and increases in amplitude each time the eddy gains ke by merging with other vortices the bottom drag contribution is intensified when the main eddy drifts away from the center of the bowl because the water depth is smaller it is thus greater just before symmetric merger events because the main eddy co rotates with its companion and subsequently drifts away from the center of the bowl this can be seen in fig 10 b with drag ke term peaking just before merging related steps see at e g t 35 months 3 4 2 centrifugal instability in cases without drag it can be seen that the main eddy still experiences abrupt radius decrease events see e g between t 1500 and 1700 days in mrt simulation fig 11 a at this time a rapid radius decrease is seen just after a vortex thinning event with a small scv horizontal sections of relative vorticity fig 11 b show that after the main eddy absorbs the scv a spiral like pattern appears in the eddy s core this pattern is seen in the whole water column there the normalized relative vorticity reaches ζ f 0 1 this pattern is typical of centrifugal instability cushman roisin and beckers 2011 this diagnostic is confirmed by the following facts 1 the pv in the eddy s core is negative near its center green contours in fig 11 b which is the necessary condition f q 0 for centrifugal instability 2 the horizontal shear terms are responsible for the extreme decrease of pv in the eddy s core not shown negative pv patches are strongly unstable and the nearly materially conserved nature of pv implies that negative pv does not occur spontaneously inside the fluid thus the generation of negative pv in the fluid must be forced for instance by appropriate frictional interactions with nearby boundaries or interactions with the wind here no such mechanism is present the decrease of pv is due to the abrupt change of horizontal velocity gradients resulting from the vortex thinning of a small scv around the main eddy fig 11 b the change of pv occurs where density fronts are sharp and parameterized diapycnal mixing occurs see appendix c in de marez et al 2020a the centrifugal instability is thus triggered by the interaction of the main eddy with the scv and eventually leads to an abrupt erosion of the eddy about five major centrifugal instability events occur at t 1000 days see the peaks of red dashed curve in fig 11 a that show times when negative pv is seen in the eddy s core note that before t 1000 days negative pv is found in the eddy s core but with values very close to zero the eddy is thus at this moment not intense enough to be subject to the instability such centrifugal instabilities are preferably seen in simulations without drag in those the main eddy is more intense and it reaches very low pv values that are suitable for instabilities nevertheless such instabilities can still be seen in e g mrtd simulation with a smaller signature than in mrt not shown 4 summary and discussion we studied the lifecycle of an anticyclonic eddy trapped in a bowl like topography which is subject to the interaction with like signed scvs and or convection from the analysis of 16 simulations with varying parameters we show that the balance between merger and bottom drag allows the eddy to have a roughly constant 3d shape throughout several years on the one hand the vortex merger with small scvs allows the eddy to grow in size and intensify at depth as merger events occur at the scv generation depth the final main eddy is intensified at this particular depth these mergers are enhanced when scvs are generated at a depth where the stratification is large and when convection is at work indeed the convection 1 deepens the main eddy and increases the merger efficiency at depth and 2 generates other scvs in the mixed layer that eventually merge with the main eddy on the other hand the bottom drag erodes the eddy the bottom drag is the main contribution to the eddy s ke loss when it is not included in simulation the eddy becomes barotropic and centrifugal instabilities triggered by the merger with scvs erode the eddy over the whole water column merging and convection both contribute to the maintaining of anticyclonic eddies trapped in bowl shaped topographies our study thus shows that it is difficult to disentangle the two mechanisms in particular if we replace this in a more realistic context however the final shape of the main eddy can give keys about the mechanisms responsible for the long lifetime of such eddies if the main eddy is intensified at multiple depth it has e g a double core eddy the eddy has certainly experienced one or several merging with other vortices also if the depth of intensification of the main eddy is correlated with the depth of a scv generation site nearby merger between these vortices probably happened one can therefore state that in these cases merging played a major role in the maintaining of the eddy in the real ocean other processes can affect the shape of such an eddy for instance internal waves and fine scale o 1 m processes can lead to the dissipation of long lived mesoscale eddies in the lv case fer et al 2018 showed through high resolution turbulence measurements that the background shear as well as near inertial waves trapped by the negative vorticity of the lv are the dominant sources of kinetic energy loss more generally internal waves are suspected to drain a significant part of the energy of such mesoscale eddies barkan et al 2021 these mechanisms are hardly resolved in the simulations discussed in the present paper and are mainly controlled by the numerical parameterization i e the vertical mixing induced by the kpp scheme furthermore the simulation lacks realistic levels of internal waves simulations with higher resolution and fully realistic atmospheric and tidal forcings should thus be required in order to determine the relative importance of these other processes compared to the bottom drag at larger scales opposite signed mesoscale coherent structures can travel to the eddy s location this could modify the behavior of the eddy by dipolar effect and affect the merging efficiency with scvs rodríguez marroyo et al 2011 furthermore the presence of a mean current due to large scale circulation or local coastal current can erode the eddy because of the presence of an ambient horizontal shear perrot and carton 2010 if the eddy moves toward the coast the interaction with coastal kelvin waves can also affect its trajectory and shape dewar and hogg 2010 gula and zeitlin 2010 hogg et al 2011 de marez et al 2020b despite this in the rockall trough as well as in e g the lofoten basin the semi permanent anticyclonic eddies are rather isolated from the coast and other currents our study can thus support the view of smilenova et al 2020 or trodahl et al 2020 that such semi permanent anticyclonic eddies are mainly maintained by the merger or alignment with smaller scale vortices in this high latitude regions convection is large and indeed deepens isopycnal and subsequently increases the eddy s core potential vorticity as discussed in e g bosse et al 2019 however we show here that convection principally enhances the number of merger with small eddies either at the surface or at depth with scvs the merging alignment with scvs is thus likely to be the more important mechanism to sustain mesoscale anticyclones trapped in a bowl as stated in the lv case by trodahl et al 2020 and by smilenova et al 2020 in

23883,we report on the development and implementation of a novel physics based algorithm that includes the effects of subsurface current on buoyant particles in a lagrangian particle tracking model specifically the larval transport lagrangian ltrans model in the upper ocean the direction and the magnitude of horizontal current change with water depth due to local effects such as the ekman balance and large scale influences such as the thermal wind balance the subsurface current alters both the advection and the dispersion of weakly buoyant particles that could be suspended in the ocean surface boundary layer by turbulence the transport and fate of riverborne plastics from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers were examined using a hindcast model solution for the louisiana and texas continental shelf latex shelf the model results show that after leaving the river outlets plastic particles travel on average in a southwestward direction over the latex shelf for up to four months transiting from a few hundred kilometers to more than a thousand kilometers the pathways and the fate of particles change as a function of the particle size with smaller particles traveling slower also less buoyant particles transit longer distances over more offshore regions and remain longer on the latex shelf particle pathways also display a strong seasonal cycle associate with the seasonal cycle of circulation on the latex shelf the model results further reveal that more than 50 of the plastic particles delivered by the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers reach the land boundary of the latex shelf and more than 18 of those reach the land boundary west of louisiana including texas and portions of mexico this modeling framework can be used to study the transport of other positively buoyant particulate materials in the ocean such as spilled oil and plankton keywords lagrangian particle tracking turbulence plastics 1 introduction plastic debris has emerged as one of the major pollutants in the oceans and a growing concern and threat to the ocean environment and marine organisms e g andrady 2011 law 2017 its concentration in the ocean appears to be increasing in some if not all ocean basins e g ostle et al 2019 wilcox et al 2020 plastic debris in the ocean is generated by various human activities and enters the ocean along hotspots such as ship tracks beaches and ocean platforms e g kershaw et al 2011 in addition plastic debris introduced into inland aquatic environments reaches the ocean through river outflows the majority of plastic debris floats and remains close to the ocean surface due to a lower density than that of seawater for example morét ferguson et al 2010 found that the density of plastic debris in the western north atlantic ocean ranges from 808 to 1240 kg m 3 and has an average value of 965 kg m 3 after entering the ocean plastic debris moves under the combined influence of ocean currents and its own buoyant rising sinking it accumulates in the convergence zones of horizontal currents which are known as ocean garbage patches e g van sebille et al 2012 2015 in the ocean plastic degrades via physical chemical and biological processes wayman and niemann 2021 and the degradation may take hundreds to thousands of years andrady 2011 because of its long life in the ocean plastic debris can be carried long distances from its source and is now found in all ocean basins and marginal seas the transport and fate of plastic debris are commonly studied by analyzing surface drifters e g maximenko et al 2012 van sebille et al 2012 and computer model solutions of particle dispersal e g lebreton et al 2012 wichmann et al 2019 in those studies lagrangian particles representing plastic debris are advected by pre saved drifter derived or simulated current fields past studies have largely relied on surface currents since the largest concentration of plastic debris is at the ocean surface those studies have been able to reproduce the observed locations of ocean garbage patches e g lebreton et al 2012 maximenko et al 2012 van sebille et al 2012 however observations have also shown that plastic debris particularly microplastics 5 mm does not remain at the ocean surface and substantial amounts of those particles can be mixed into the boundary layer e g kukulka et al 2012 reisser and co authors 2015 due to the earth s rotation both the magnitude and the direction of the wind and wave driven horizontal currents change with water depth within the ocean surface boundary layer where buoyant plastic debris is located furthermore horizontal currents also change with depth due to larger scale circulations such as the thermal wind current in the presence of a horizontal density gradient buoyant particles such as plastic debris under the influence of subsurface current move at different rates and directions from those purely driven by surface currents e g yang et al 2015 in addition to the advective effect of subsurface current a vertically varying horizontal current also disperses particles that constantly transit across the shear using a series of simulations with three simplified representations of vertical mixing and idealized representations of subsurface current effects wichmann et al 2019 demonstrated that subsurface currents alter the large scale meridional transport of plastic debris and allows more plastic debris to be transported from low to high latitude regions such as the arctic region a more mechanistic representation of subsurface currents has not been tested with a combined annual discharge of 730 86 billion m3 y 1 the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers fig 1 drain a catchment with a population of over 100 million people while major river systems are widely acknowledged as being primary conduits for plastics from land to the sea schmidt et al 2017 van emmerik and schwarz 2019 few estimates of the numerical or mass flux of plastics in the mississippi are available scircle et al 2020 estimated that 87 to 129 trillion plastic particles 0 30 μ m were transported daily by the mississippi river at new orleans toner 2020 estimated a daily flux of 897 million particles 500 to 5000 μ m the orders of magnitude difference between these estimates is likely due to the vastly different size ranges considered and the sample volumes used 1 l versus 10 s of cubic meters respectively despite the paucity and range of data on plastic flux in the mississippi river it is undoubtedly an important source of plastic debris for the northern gulf of mexico ngom di mauro et al 2017 the transport and fate of riverborne plastics in the ngom has not been previously studied while models have explored transport of other positively buoyant particulate materials in this region such as macroalgae sargassum e g zhong et al 2012 spilled oil e g liu et al 2011 weisberg et al 2017 and coral larvae e g davies et al 2017 limer et al 2020 and generic floating particles e g bracco et al 2019 neither riverine input of particulate material nor the effect of subsurface current were addressed in those studies the ngom is characterized by a broad continental shelf 200 m deep i e the louisiana texas latex continental shelf usually defined as inshore of the 100 m isobath which is tens of kilometers wide fig 1 over the shelf wind forcing and ocean circulation exhibit distinct seasonal cycles figs 2a to 2d in non summer months the primary circulation over the latex shelf called the louisiana coastal current lcc is westward downcoast fig 2c while the lcc reverses its direction and is eastward upcoast in summer months fig 2d e g wiseman et al 1997 hetland and dimarco 2012 the seasonal cycle of the lcc is primarily driven by the wind figs 2a and 2b whose

plastics section 5 is a summary and the acknowledgment section contains the access information to the computer code described in the study 2 a physics based algorithm for including the effect of subsurface currents in lagrangian particle models 2 1 formulation and implementation ocean plastics are commonly tracked using lagrangian particle models as lagrangian particle models avoid the spurious diffusive and dispersive errors inherent to the solutions of eulerian material concentration models that are a combination of hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential equations e g morton and mayers 2005 in most existing lagrangian tracking studies of marine plastics surface currents are used to calculate the location of plastic particles e g lebreton et al 2012 i e 1a x t δ t x t f u s f c δ t 1b y t δ t y t f u s f c δ t where t is time δ t is the time step x y are horizontal locations u s f c v s f c are the horizontal velocities at the ocean surface and f u s f c δ t is the time integration scheme observations however show that plastic particles particularly small ones with small buoyant rising speeds move up and down rapidly in the ocean surface boundary layer the upper few to tens of meters under the combined influence of turbulent current and their own buoyancy kukulka et al 2012 therefore plastic particle transport is influenced by not only the surface current but also subsurface currents forecasting hindcasting ocean models are based on the hydrostatic assumption vertical currents in those models are due to meso to large scale circulations 10 5 m s to 10 6 m s and are orders of magnitudes weaker than the vertical currents associated with boundary layer turbulence 10 2 cm s in fact the vertical current in forecasting hindcasting models is so weak that even weakly buoyant particles cannot be suspended even for particles of buoyant rising speed comparable to the vertical current in forecasting hindcasting models they are not able to move up and down quickly in the ocean surface boundary layer where both the magnitude and direction change drastically with water depth under the combined influence of the earth s rotation surface and lateral forcings therefore the inability to resolve the rapid vertical turnover of particles in the turbulent ocean surface boundary layer in lagrangian tracking models leads to inaccurate estimate of horizontal speed and transport of weakly buoyant particles such as microplastics to include the effect of subsurface currents for weakly buoyant particles the calculation of particle location in the ltrans model i e eq 1 is modified as 2a x t δ t x t f u δ t x s g s x y t 2b y t δ t y t f v δ t y s g s x y t where u v are the weighted averaged horizontal velocities in x y and x s g s and y s g s are the subgrid scale sgs displacements the weighted averaged velocities i e u v are calculated as 3a u x y t u x y t f x y z t f x y z t 3b v x y t v x y t f x y z t f x y z t here the angle bracket denotes the depth average e g u 1 h h 0 u d z with h the boundary layer depth and f x y z t is the mean particle distribution it is calculated by assuming the distribution is stationary so that the balance between advection by buoyant rising and turbulent diffusion i e w b f z a k s f z z with zero flux at the surface and the base of the ocean surface boundary layer is achieved 4 f x y z t c e x

the above equation d ξ is a gaussian white noise with its variance δ t and k x x and k y y are the effective diffusivity calculated as 6a k x x u u m 6b k y y v v n where the perturbation particle

x y z t h z v x y s t v f x y s t d s eq 6 is based on fluid dynamical principles and is derived by applying the multiscale expansions and the method of moments on the fokker planck equation for the probability density function of particle concentrations it mechanistically takes into the account of the vertical shear of horizontal currents detailed derivation can be found in liang et al 2018 the rationale behind the revised algorithm is that each lagrangian particle represents numerous actual buoyant particles that follow a vertical distribution f x y z t determined locally by the balanced between turbulent mixing and buoyant rising at its location the lagrangian particles move only in horizontal dimensions as the actual particles are confined in the ocean surface boundary layer due to their buoyancy instead of being moved around by the surface current as in most existing plastic tracking studies the lagrangian particles are advected by weighted averaged current u v and disperse following the effective diffusivity k x x k y y in this study eqs 2 to 6 are implemented in the larval transport lagrangian model ltrans north et al 2011 the time advancement follows that in the ltrans model i e the runge kutta 3rd scheme the ltrans model is an off line particle tracking model that is driven by stored current fields from hindcasting forecasting ocean models the model has been used for the tracking of a variety of ocean particles such as marine organisms e g north et al 2008 and spilled oil e g north et al 2011 the ltrans model is similar to other lagrangian particle tracking models e g paris et al 2013 lange and van sebille 2017 delandmeter and van sebille 2019 peytavin et al 2021 the ltrans model was selected for this study because it is compatible with outputs using the regional ocean modeling system roms e g shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 haidvogel et al 2008 namely c grid predictions with sigma coordinates 3 model application to riverborne plastics over the ngom to study the transport and fate of plastics from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers the texas louisiana tx la hindcast solutions zhang et al 2012b kobashi and hetland 2020 were used to drive the ltrans model the tx la hindcast solutions were obtained by configuring the roms model at a curvilinear grid that covers the continental shelf off the coast of texas and louisiana fig 1 the horizontal resolution of the model ranges from about 0 5 km close to the coast to approximately 3 km close to the open boundaries submesoscale currents are permitted but are not fully resolved with the finest resolutions while mesoscale and regional scale currents are fully resolved in the model solution surface boundary conditions were interpolated using the ecmwf s era interim data set dee et al 2011 and the lateral boundary conditions were interpolated from the global hybrid coordinate ocean model glo hycom cummings and smedstad 2013 http www hycom org and global mercator https marine copernicus eu other details of the model configuration and extensive validation with observational datasets are given in kobashi and hetland 2020 three dimensional ocean velocities temperature salinity and eddy viscosity saved at three hour intervals are inputs to the ltrans model and are interpolated to the location of the particles in the hindcast solution eddy viscosity is diagnosed using the generic length scale gls model umlauf and burchard 2001 surface boundary layer depth is not an output of roms solutions using the gls model for vertical mixing but is needed in the algorithm presented in section 2 1 it is therefore determined using model outputs of density and diffusivity profiles when surface forcing is strong the ocean surface boundary layer is limited by pycnocline and is effectively the mixed layer when surface forcing is weak the surface boundary layer could be shallower than the mixed layer to include both scenarios the bottom of the boundary layer is defined as the smallest depth where one of the following two criteria is met a the density at the depth is 0 01 kg m 3 larger than the surface density or b the vertical diffusivity a k s at the depth is smaller than 1 10 4 m2 s 1 and the absolute difference of vertical diffusivity from the model element right above is smaller than 1 10 4 m2 s 1 surface momentum and buoyancy fluxes together with the profiles of density diffusivity and horizontal currents were examined for a large number of locations and occurrences and the criteria to identify boundary layer depth is deemed robust the same criteria could be applied to determine boundary layer depth when other vertical mixing schemes are used the difference between the horizontal current averaged over the ocean surface boundary layer osbl and the surface current i e the subsurface current effects for neutrally buoyant particles is shown in figs 2 e and 2 f and the magnitude and direction of the subgrid scale effective diffusivity k m a j o r and k m i n o r for neutrally buoyant particles is shown in figs 2 g and 2 h the osbl averaged current is weaker than the corresponding surface current in regions where the surface current is strong the difference from the surface current is more than 30 during non summer months over most of the domain in the summer months the difference in magnitude is smaller and but is still larger than 5 over most of the domain the magnitude of the sgs diffusivity is at the order of 10 s of m2 s the sgs diffusivity is highly anisotropic and its direction generally aligns with the along shore direction three groups of simulations are conducted in the first group of simulations particles are assumed to float at the surface and represent particles that have a large rising speed indicated as w b hereafter this group of simulations is also used to represent traditional plastic trajectory simulations where the effects of subsurface currents are neglected in the next two groups of simulations particles are assigned a constant rising speed of 0 5 mm s and 10 mm s respectively observations in the north atlantic gyre fig 5 of reisser and co authors 2015 show that the majority of plastic particles have a rising speed between the two values chosen in this study and those being mixed into the ocean surface boundary layer have a rising speed smaller than 10 mm s depending on the shape and density of plastics the two rising speeds correspond to plastic particles with a size range of sub millimeter to tens of millimeters reisser and co authors 2015 in each simulation a total of 1200 particles are released at three different locations i e the outlets of the mississippi river 28 9 n 89 45 w the atchafalaya river 29 44 n 91 28 w and the wax lake pass 29 47 n 91 45 w the particle releases are repeated on the 1st and 16th day of each month from january 2008 to december 2015 and a total of 576 simulations were conducted a climatology of the trajectory and the fate of plastic particles is established using the 8 year solutions with hourly outputs the tracking for each particle is conducted until a particle reaches either the open boundaries or the land boundaries of the computational domain in this study we consider that a particle beaches when it hits the land boundary it has been observed that buoyant materials that are within hundreds of meters from the land boundary are largely retained in the region and the nearshore water is called sticky water e g wolanski and spangol 2000 or coastal boundary layer e g nickols et al 2012 it was also shown that waves greatly enhance the beaching of oil brought to the nearshore ocean by circulations weisberg et al 2017 while the model grid next to the land boundary has a resolution of a few hundred meters and does not resolve surf zone processes particles that hit the land boundary are considered beached in this study 4 results fig 3 shows the mean paths lines and the percentage reaching a location of the domain heat maps for particles released from the mississippi and the atchafalaya rivers between 2008 and 2015 particles from the atchafalaya river outlet and the wax lake outlet is grouped together as from the atchafalaya particles as both outlets drain the atchafalaya river the total transit distance transit time and average speed are summarized in fig 3 here the total transit distance is the sum of transit distance using neighboring outputs the total transit distance is substantially longer than that shown by the mean trajectories in fig 2 as particle motions associated with eddies and inertial oscillation are smoothed out in the mean trajectories the fate locations of the plastic particles in the domain are summarized in fig 4 note that all results in figs 2 and 4 assume that particles are released evenly in time in reality plastic fluxes from the rivers are not uniform in time as will be discussed in section 5 4 1 simulated transport and fate we will first focus on the climatological trajectory and fate of floating particles w b as those particles are the ones tracked in existing plastics transport models on average floating particles move southwestward after leaving the river outlets figs 3 a and 3 b and their trajectories cover the whole latex shelf particles from the mississippi river travel approximately 722 km over 37 days and those from the atchafalaya river travel about 455 km over 34 days fig 4 mississippi river particles transit through regions further offshore and at a 30 higher speed compared to those from the atchafalaya river wax lake outlet consistent with a previous study showing that the mississippi river plume is faster than the atchafalaya river plume zhang et al 2012a around 65 of the mississippi river particles and about 90 of the atchafalaya river particles stop or beach at the land boundary particles that stop at the open boundary may move eastward to other parts of the gulf with the mexican current and some may even leave the gulf advected with the loop current as is evidenced by the studies of the fate of the river plume water e g hu et al 2005 walker et al 1994 it is also possible that some of the particles that stop at the open boundary of the domain re enter the domain with westward propagating loop current eddies e g alvera azcárate et al 2009 liu et al 2016 and eventually reach the land boundary particularly the coastline west of louisiana including that of texas and portions of mexico the fate of particles that stop at the open boundary can only be evaluated using circulation fields that encompass the whole gulf of mexico the particle beaching statistics presented in this study therefore are likely conservative estimates only slightly more than 20 of the floating particles from both rivers stop at the coast west of louisiana since the mean surface current in the latex is westward except during summer when the winds can become weakly upwelling favorable only about 20 of the floating particles stop east of their origins 4 2 effect of subsurface current subsurface current alters both the trajectory and the fate of weakly buoyant particles and the effect of subsurface current increases with decreasing buoyant rising speed figs 3 4 and 5 with decreasing rising speed particles transit through more offshore regions for example for the slowest rising mississippi river particles w b 0 5 mm s the mean trajectory ends offshore of the 50 m isobath while that of faster rising mississippi river particles stop inshore of the 50 m isobath fig 3 they also travel a substantially longer distance and for a significantly longer period before stopping at the boundaries than the faster rising particles from the same origin the slowest rising mississippi river particles on average travel 1185 km over 65 days before reaching the boundaries fig 4 the transit speed is slightly lower for weakly buoyant particles this is expected as the surface current is stronger when wind and the background current is in the same direction as is mostly the case over the region slower rising particles w b 0 5 mm s have a lower chance of stopping at the land boundary than floating and faster rising particles do figs 5 a and 5 e they have a lower chance of stopping at the land boundary of louisiana figs 5 b and 5 f but have a higher chance of stopping at the land boundary west of louisiana figs 5 c and 5 g the zonal fate of the particles is not influenced by the subsurface current figs 5 d and 5 h the effect of subsurface current on the fate of particles could be understood by examining a transect of horizontal currents fig 6 that is representative of that in the latex shelf the seasonal cycle of mixed layer depth the louisiana coastal current and the upwelling downwelling circulation is evident inshore of the 100 m isobath the alongshore current is the strongest near the surface and decreases with depth the alongshore current is substantially stronger than the cross shore current as shown in zhang et al 2014 the mean along shore current is primarily in thermal wind balance driven by the strong cross shore density gradient particularly in non summer months the shore ward current largely associated with downwelling circulation is also surface intensified therefore slower rising buoyant particles have a slower shoreward motion and might stay for a longer period in the ocean before beaching at higher frequencies the inertial and weather band flows often reverse with depth creating a two or more layer flow this is in part due to the coastal constraint that confines the depth average cross shore flow to be small particles rising through this strongly sheared flow may enhance particle dispersion in the alongshore direction the mean vertical shear in the alongshore direction also dominates over that in the cross shore direction therefore the effective diffusivity is largely in the alongshore direction figs 2e and 2f 4 3 seasonal cycle since both the wind and the circulation show a strong seasonal cycle the trajectory and the fate of riverine particles also exhibit strong seasonal cycles figs 4 and 5 for particles of different rising speeds the seasonal cycle is qualitatively similar but quantitatively different for mississippi river particles both the transit distance and transit time are lower in the first half of the year than the second half of the year figs 4a and 4b particles released between january and april have a relatively high chance of beaching at the coast of louisiana fig 5b during those months there is a strong surface intensified shoreward current driven by downwelling favorable wind and the louisiana coastal current in the largely alongshore direction is westward particles released between may and july have a relatively low probability of beaching and a relatively high probability of stopping east of the river outlet due to the reversal of the louisiana coastal current therefore particles released during the two seasons travel for a relatively short distance before beaching note that the seasonal cycle for beaching at the coast of louisiana fig 5b is less evident for weakly buoyant particles w b 0 5 mm s than for strongly buoyant w b 10 mm s and floating particles w b as discussed earlier weakly buoyant particles are subject to less influence of the shoreward surface intensified downwelling current because they spend substantial time below the ocean surface the seasonal cycle for atchafalaya particles qualitatively similar though less evident than that for mississippi particles 5 transport and fate of riverborne plastics over the latex shelf the riverine plastics discharge changes over an annual cycle and so the trajectory and fate of plastics are therefore different from the averages shown in figs 4 and 5 a climatological plastics discharge from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers has yet to be established here we use an 11 month observation of plastics flux at the baton rouge and new orleans stations of the mississippi river toner 2020 to represent the seasonal plastics flux from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers fig 7 this is the first observational attempt to quantify plastics flux from the two rivers the observations were collected with a manta net at five stations spanning baton rouge and new orleans louisiana between day 309 nov 5th of 2016 and day 273 sept 30th of 2017 the count is for plastics between 0 5 and 5 mm microplastics although the size and shape distributions of the measured plastics are not established therefore plastic particles of different sizes are assumed to have the same seasonal cycle plastics discharge reaches its peak at around may and is the lowest in late fall and winter the peak of the plastics discharge lags about a month behind the peak in the riverine freshwater discharge e g martinez lopez and zavala hidalgo 2009 the plastics discharge flux is used to calculate the annual mean statistics for riverine plastics table 1 in the calculation plastics discharge for october that is missing from the observations is linearly interpolated from the rest of the time series since plastic flux has its peak in late spring and early summer the statistics for plastics is influenced more strongly by those months when buoyant particles travel shorter distances over shorter time periods at higher speeds with fewer particles stopping at the land boundaries in particular the coast west of louisiana on average mississippi river plastics travels 600 km over 30 days both travel distance and travel time is more than 50 larger for weakly buoyant plastics than for floating plastics atchafalaya river plastics travels over a shorter distance than mississippi river plastics the difference in travel time is small for floating plastics w b but is more evident for weakly buoyant plastics w b 0 5 mm s at least 50 mississippi plastics and 80 atchafalaya plastics stop at the land boundaries of the latex shelf the percentage is likely higher because plastic particles that stop at the open boundary of the domain may be swept into the domain again and eventually reach the land boundary subsurface currents move plastics more offshore as explained in section 4 2 and the percentage of plastic reaching the land boundary decreases with decreasing rising speed 6 summary and future directions the major conclusions of the paper are 1 an algorithm that mechanistically includes the effects of subsurface currents on the horizontal movement of buoyant particles is implemented in the larval transport lagrangian ltrans model in a dynamically consistent way the updated ltrans model is readily run in conjunction with standard output from the regional ocean modeling system roms sections 2 and 3 2 buoyant particles from the mississippi and the atchafalaya rivers on average move southwestward and cover the louisiana and texas latex shelf section 4 3 both the trajectory and fate of weakly buoyant particles are affected by subsurface currents the slowest rising particles on average travel a longer distance for a longer period at a lower speed they also are less affected by the surface intensified downwelling upwelling currents showing a weaker seasonal cycle for beaching at the coastline of louisiana section 4 4 more than 50 of the mississippi river plastics and 80 of the atchafalaya river plastics stop at the land boundaries of the latex shelf the probability of beaching decreases with decreasing buoyant rising speed section 5 the modeling framework presented here is not only useful for the tracking of marine plastics it can also be applied for the tracking of other weakly buoyant particulate materials in the ocean such as oil droplets and plankton while oil slicks float at the ocean surface they are broken into droplets of 10 s to 100 s of microns after the application of dispersant many planktonic organisms are also weakly buoyant and have rising speed of a few mm s or smaller there are still uncertainties associated with the estimate of the trajectory and the fate of simulated riverine plastic particles over the latex shelf those uncertainties could be reduced by more accurate plastics flux estimates from the mississippi and the atchafalaya rivers by more realistic representation of plastics dynamics and by the resolving more physics in the ocean circulation fields comprehensive long term observations of plastics in the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers including particle properties are needed to better constrain the model extreme plastics pulse events such as the nurdle spill event near new orleans in august 2020 https www nola com news environment article b4fba760 e18d 11ea 9b0b b3a2123cf48b html are likely to have a substantial impact on plastics concentration over the latex shelf while the rising speed of a lagrangian particle is constant in the simulation the rising speed of plastic particles is variable in the realistic ocean it could vary due to the change in seawater density that is significant from river outflows to the open ocean it could also change due to the aggregation of plastic particles with negatively buoyant particulate materials of either organic or mineral origins e g van sebille et al 2020 since rising speed determines the importance of particle speed and direction change in rising speed during their transport influences the pathway and destine of plastics regarding the physics of the circulation field the biggest uncertainty may be associated with the effects of ocean surface gravity waves that are not included in the hindcast solution for the latex shelf the inclusion of ocean surface gravity waves could alter the trajectories of buoyant particles in the following two ways first waves alter the vertical mixing in the upper ocean waves can enhance vertical mixing by the generation of langmuir circulation e g d asaro 2014 or by the wave orbital velocities e g dai et al 2010 dibenedetto 2020 waves can also suppress vertical mixing when it is in the opposite direction of near surface current e g van roekel et al 2012 mcwilliams et al 2014 the effect of waves on vertical mixing is important in many regions of the global ocean li et al 2019 including over the gulf of mexico e g ali et al 2019 vertical mixing controls the distribution of buoyant particles including plastics in the ocean surface boundary layer e g chor et al 2018 kukulka and brunner 2015 liang et al 2012 and therefore the effect of subsurface currents on plastics in addition to the effect of waves recent studies also demonstrate that the northward component of the earth s rotation e g liu et al 2018 and submesoscale currents e g hamlington et al 2014 yuan and liang 2021 could further alter vertical mixing and thereby the effect of subsurface currents on plastics secondly the wave induced stokes drift is important in the transport of floating materials such as plastics ocean surface gravity waves and stokes drift can be in very different directions from the wind and the current over the world s ocean e g hanley et al 2010 including over the gulf of mexico and the latex shelf abolfazli et al 2020 in the open ocean stokes drift has been shown to influence the large scale transport of plastics e g fraser et al 2018 dobler et al 2019 when only surface current is considered in the coastal ocean waves refract due to bottom topography and propagate perpendicular towards the shoreline when approaching the coastline it was shown that stokes drift is responsible for oil beaching in the northern gulf beaches weisberg et al 2017 the effect of stokes drift on plastic propagation over the latex shelf remains to be investigated another important dynamical process not fully resolved in the circulation field is submesoscale currents with a spatial resolution of 500 m and an archive interval of 3 h the model output in this study marginally resolves submesoscale currents sensitivity studies using 6 hourly roms solutions were also conducted the particle solutions using 3 hourly and 6 hourly roms outputs are qualitatively the same though as expected slightly quantitatively different in a recent study that examines the sensitivity of lagrangian particle solutions to the resolution of archived hydrodynamic solutions dauhajre et al 2019 showed that the model grid needs to be finer than about 100 m and the output interval has to be smaller than 30 min to fully resolve the effect of submesoscale currents on tracer transport in the nearshore region 1 km from the shoreline and further reducing model resolution beyond that yield no difference in particle trajectories and fates submesoscale currents also interact with surface gravity waves e g romero et al 2020 further altering the effects of both waves and submesoscale currents on plastic transport on the other hand it is still formidable to run a model and archive multi year model outputs at that spatial and temporal scale for a regional ocean as noted by dauhajre et al 2019 also the regional ocean scale transport is still governed by mesoscale and large scale circulations the effects of submesoscale currents on the particle distributions in a regional ocean are another open research question all the missing dynamical processes could be straightforwardly added to the modeling framework described in section 2 for example to include the effect of the stokes drift u v will be replaced by u c i r u s t v c i r v s t with subscripts cir and st implying circulation and stokes drift field from a coupled ocean wave model to include the effect of wave induced mixing diffusivity with wave induced mixing will be used as input for a k s to include the effect of submesoscale currents circulation fields with a spatial resolution of 100 m archived every 30 min will be used as input in an off line particle tracking model or an online lagrangian particle tracking model i e a model that concurrently simulates particle trajectories and circulation fields can be used e g stanev and ricker 2020 ricker and stanev 2020 the study also points to the need in plastic trajectory studies that the ocean instrumentation and observing community could contribute to as noted by the authors and pointed out by the anonymous reviewers there are no observations that accurately follow the motion of the weakly buoyant microplastics that could be compared with the modeling results most ocean drifters and floats move at the ocean surface or along constant density surface in the ocean interior e g lumpkin et al 2017 the only instrument that could follow the turbulent motions of neutrally weakly particles in the ocean surface boundary layer to the authors best knowledge is the lagrangian floats developed by eric d asaro e g d asaro et al 1996 those floats are relatively expensive and have only been deployed at small spatial and temporal scales therefore have never been used to study the trajectories of microplastics the development and deployment of low cost weakly buoyant drifters that mimic the motion of microplastics would greatly improve our understanding of the trajectory and fate of microplastics and other weakly buoyant particulate materials in the ocean credit authorship contribution statement jun hong liang conceptualization methodology formal analysis

23883,we report on the development and implementation of a novel physics based algorithm that includes the effects of subsurface current on buoyant particles in a lagrangian particle tracking model specifically the larval transport lagrangian ltrans model in the upper ocean the direction and the magnitude of horizontal current change with water depth due to local effects such as the ekman balance and large scale influences such as the thermal wind balance the subsurface current alters both the advection and the dispersion of weakly buoyant particles that could be suspended in the ocean surface boundary layer by turbulence the transport and fate of riverborne plastics from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers were examined using a hindcast model solution for the louisiana and texas continental shelf latex shelf the model results show that after leaving the river outlets plastic particles travel on average in a southwestward direction over the latex shelf for up to four months transiting from a few hundred kilometers to more than a thousand kilometers the pathways and the fate of particles change as a function of the particle size with smaller particles traveling slower also less buoyant particles transit longer distances over more offshore regions and remain longer on the latex shelf particle pathways also display a strong seasonal cycle associate with the seasonal cycle of circulation on the latex shelf the model results further reveal that more than 50 of the plastic particles delivered by the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers reach the land boundary of the latex shelf and more than 18 of those reach the land boundary west of louisiana including texas and portions of mexico this modeling framework can be used to study the transport of other positively buoyant particulate materials in the ocean such as spilled oil and plankton keywords lagrangian particle tracking turbulence plastics 1 introduction plastic debris has emerged as one of the major pollutants in the oceans and a growing concern and threat to the ocean environment and marine organisms e g andrady 2011 law 2017 its concentration in the ocean appears to be increasing in some if not all ocean basins e g ostle et al 2019 wilcox et al 2020 plastic debris in the ocean is generated by various human activities and enters the ocean along hotspots such as ship tracks beaches and ocean platforms e g kershaw et al 2011 in addition plastic debris introduced into inland aquatic environments reaches the ocean through river outflows the majority of plastic debris floats and remains close to the ocean surface due to a lower density than that of seawater for example morét ferguson et al 2010 found that the density of plastic debris in the western north atlantic ocean ranges from 808 to 1240 kg m 3 and has an average value of 965 kg m 3 after entering the ocean plastic debris moves under the combined influence of ocean currents and its own buoyant rising sinking it accumulates in the convergence zones of horizontal currents which are known as ocean garbage patches e g van sebille et al 2012 2015 in the ocean plastic degrades via physical chemical and biological processes wayman and niemann 2021 and the degradation may take hundreds to thousands of years andrady 2011 because of its long life in the ocean plastic debris can be carried long distances from its source and is now found in all ocean basins and marginal seas the transport and fate of plastic debris are commonly studied by analyzing surface drifters e g maximenko et al 2012 van sebille et al 2012 and computer model solutions of particle dispersal e g lebreton et al 2012 wichmann et al 2019 in those studies lagrangian particles representing plastic debris are advected by pre saved drifter derived or simulated current fields past studies have largely relied on surface currents since the largest concentration of plastic debris is at the ocean surface those studies have been able to reproduce the observed locations of ocean garbage patches e g lebreton et al 2012 maximenko et al 2012 van sebille et al 2012 however observations have also shown that plastic debris particularly microplastics 5 mm does not remain at the ocean surface and substantial amounts of those particles can be mixed into the boundary layer e g kukulka et al 2012 reisser and co authors 2015 due to the earth s rotation both the magnitude and the direction of the wind and wave driven horizontal currents change with water depth within the ocean surface boundary layer where buoyant plastic debris is located furthermore horizontal currents also change with depth due to larger scale circulations such as the thermal wind current in the presence of a horizontal density gradient buoyant particles such as plastic debris under the influence of subsurface current move at different rates and directions from those purely driven by surface currents e g yang et al 2015 in addition to the advective effect of subsurface current a vertically varying horizontal current also disperses particles that constantly transit across the shear using a series of simulations with three simplified representations of vertical mixing and idealized representations of subsurface current effects wichmann et al 2019 demonstrated that subsurface currents alter the large scale meridional transport of plastic debris and allows more plastic debris to be transported from low to high latitude regions such as the arctic region a more mechanistic representation of subsurface currents has not been tested with a combined annual discharge of 730 86 billion m3 y 1 the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers fig 1 drain a catchment with a population of over 100 million people while major river systems are widely acknowledged as being primary conduits for plastics from land to the sea schmidt et al 2017 van emmerik and schwarz 2019 few estimates of the numerical or mass flux of plastics in the mississippi are available scircle et al 2020 estimated that 87 to 129 trillion plastic particles 0 30 μ m were transported daily by the mississippi river at new orleans toner 2020 estimated a daily flux of 897 million particles 500 to 5000 μ m the orders of magnitude difference between these estimates is likely due to the vastly different size ranges considered and the sample volumes used 1 l versus 10 s of cubic meters respectively despite the paucity and range of data on plastic flux in the mississippi river it is undoubtedly an important source of plastic debris for the northern gulf of mexico ngom di mauro et al 2017 the transport and fate of riverborne plastics in the ngom has not been previously studied while models have explored transport of other positively buoyant particulate materials in this region such as macroalgae sargassum e g zhong et al 2012 spilled oil e g liu et al 2011 weisberg et al 2017 and coral larvae e g davies et al 2017 limer et al 2020 and generic floating particles e g bracco et al 2019 neither riverine input of particulate material nor the effect of subsurface current were addressed in those studies the ngom is characterized by a broad continental shelf 200 m deep i e the louisiana texas latex continental shelf usually defined as inshore of the 100 m isobath which is tens of kilometers wide fig 1 over the shelf wind forcing and ocean circulation exhibit distinct seasonal cycles figs 2a to 2d in non summer months the primary circulation over the latex shelf called the louisiana coastal current lcc is westward downcoast fig 2c while the lcc reverses its direction and is eastward upcoast in summer months fig 2d e g wiseman et al 1997 hetland and dimarco 2012 the seasonal cycle of the lcc is primarily driven by the wind figs 2a and 2b whose alongshore component has the same seasonal cycle as the coastal currents e g nowlin et al 2005 south of the lcc the western boundary current of the gom with a magnitude of around 0 5 m s 1 i e the

includes the effect of subsurface current on buoyant particles in a lagrangian particle tracking model 2 to study the transport and fate of plastics delivered by the mississippi and atchafalaya on the louisiana texas continental shelf and 3 to assess the importance of subsurface current on plastic transport in this region the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the algorithm and its implementation section 3 introduces the application of the model to the latex shelf section 4 discusses simulation results and their relevance to transport and fate of riverborne plastics section 5 is a summary and the acknowledgment section contains the access information to the computer code described in the study 2 a physics based algorithm for including the effect of subsurface currents in lagrangian particle models 2 1 formulation and implementation ocean plastics are commonly tracked using lagrangian particle models as lagrangian particle models avoid the spurious diffusive and dispersive errors inherent to the solutions of eulerian material concentration models that are a combination of hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential equations e g morton and mayers 2005 in most existing lagrangian tracking studies of marine plastics surface currents are used to calculate the location of plastic particles e g lebreton et al 2012 i e 1a x t δ t x t f u s f c δ t 1b y t δ t y t f u s f c δ t where t is time δ t is the time step x y are horizontal locations u s f c v s f c are the horizontal velocities at the ocean surface and f u s f c δ t is the time integration scheme observations however show that plastic particles particularly small ones with small buoyant rising speeds move up and down rapidly in the ocean surface boundary layer the upper few to tens of meters under the combined influence of turbulent current and their own buoyancy kukulka et al 2012 therefore plastic particle transport is influenced by not only the surface current but also subsurface currents forecasting hindcasting ocean models are based on the hydrostatic assumption vertical currents in those models are due to meso to large scale circulations 10 5 m s to 10 6 m s and are orders of magnitudes weaker than the vertical currents associated with boundary layer turbulence 10 2 cm s in fact the vertical current in forecasting hindcasting models is so weak that even weakly buoyant particles cannot be suspended even for particles of buoyant rising speed comparable to the vertical current in forecasting hindcasting models they are not able to move up and down quickly in the ocean surface boundary layer where both the magnitude and direction change drastically with water depth under the combined influence of the earth s rotation surface and lateral forcings therefore the inability to resolve the rapid vertical turnover of particles in the turbulent ocean surface boundary layer in lagrangian tracking models leads to inaccurate estimate of horizontal speed and transport of weakly buoyant particles such as microplastics to include the effect of subsurface currents for weakly buoyant particles the calculation of particle location in the ltrans model i e eq 1 is modified as 2a x t δ t x t f u δ t x s g s x y t 2b y t δ t y t f v δ t y s g s x y t where u v are the weighted averaged horizontal velocities in x y and x s g s and y s g s are the subgrid scale sgs displacements the weighted averaged velocities i e u v are calculated as 3a u x y t u x y t f x y z t f x y z t 3b v x y t v x y t f x y z t f x y z t here the angle bracket denotes the depth average e g u 1 h h 0 u d z with h the boundary layer depth and f x y z t is the mean particle distribution it is calculated by assuming the distribution is stationary so that the balance between advection by buoyant rising and turbulent diffusion i e w b f z a k s f z z with zero flux at the surface and the base of the ocean surface boundary layer is achieved 4 f x y z t c e x

the above equation d ξ is a gaussian white noise with its variance δ t and k x x and k y y are the effective diffusivity calculated as 6a k x x u u m 6b k y y v v n where the perturbation particle

x y z t h z v x y s t v f x y s t d s eq 6 is based on fluid dynamical principles and is derived by applying the multiscale expansions and the method of moments on the fokker planck equation for the probability density function of particle concentrations it mechanistically takes into the account of the vertical shear of horizontal currents detailed derivation can be found in liang et al 2018 the rationale behind the revised algorithm is that each lagrangian particle represents numerous actual buoyant particles that follow a vertical distribution f x y z t determined locally by the balanced between turbulent mixing and buoyant rising at its location the lagrangian particles move only in horizontal dimensions as the actual particles are confined in the ocean surface boundary layer due to their buoyancy instead of being moved around by the surface current as in most existing plastic tracking studies the lagrangian particles are advected by weighted averaged current u v and disperse following the effective diffusivity k x x k y y in this study eqs 2 to 6 are implemented in the larval transport lagrangian model ltrans north et al 2011 the time advancement follows that in the ltrans model i e the runge kutta 3rd scheme the ltrans model is an off line particle tracking model that is driven by stored current fields from hindcasting forecasting ocean models the model has been used for the tracking of a variety of ocean particles such as marine organisms e g north et al 2008 and spilled oil e g north et al 2011 the ltrans model is similar to other lagrangian particle tracking models e g paris et al 2013 lange and van sebille 2017 delandmeter and van sebille 2019 peytavin et al 2021 the ltrans model was selected for this study because it is compatible with outputs using the regional ocean modeling system roms e g shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 haidvogel et al 2008 namely c grid predictions with sigma coordinates 3 model application to riverborne plastics over the ngom to study the transport and fate of plastics from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers the texas louisiana tx la hindcast solutions zhang et al 2012b kobashi and hetland 2020 were used to drive the ltrans model the tx la hindcast solutions were obtained by configuring the roms model at a curvilinear grid that covers the continental shelf off the coast of texas and louisiana fig 1 the horizontal resolution of the model ranges from about 0 5 km close to the coast to approximately 3 km close to the open boundaries submesoscale currents are permitted but are not fully resolved with the finest resolutions while mesoscale and regional scale currents are fully resolved in the model solution surface boundary conditions were interpolated using the ecmwf s era interim data set dee et al 2011 and the lateral boundary conditions were interpolated from the global hybrid coordinate ocean model glo hycom cummings and smedstad 2013 http www hycom org and global mercator https marine copernicus eu other details of the model configuration and extensive validation with observational datasets are given in kobashi and hetland 2020 three dimensional ocean velocities temperature salinity and eddy viscosity saved at three hour intervals are inputs to the ltrans model and are interpolated to the location of the particles in the hindcast solution eddy viscosity is diagnosed using the generic length scale gls model umlauf and burchard 2001 surface boundary layer depth is not an output of roms solutions using the gls model for vertical mixing but is needed in the algorithm presented in section 2 1 it is therefore determined using model outputs of density and diffusivity profiles when surface forcing is strong the ocean surface boundary layer is limited by pycnocline and is effectively the mixed layer when surface forcing is weak the surface boundary layer could be shallower than the mixed layer to include both scenarios the bottom of the boundary layer is defined as the smallest depth where one of the following two criteria is met a the density at the depth is 0 01 kg m 3 larger than the surface density or b the vertical diffusivity a k s at the depth is smaller than 1 10 4 m2 s 1 and the absolute difference of vertical diffusivity from the model element right above is smaller than 1 10 4 m2 s 1 surface momentum and buoyancy fluxes together with the profiles of density diffusivity and horizontal currents were examined for a large number of locations and occurrences and the criteria to identify boundary layer depth is deemed robust the same criteria could be applied to determine boundary layer depth when other vertical mixing schemes are used the difference between the horizontal current averaged over the ocean surface boundary layer osbl and the surface current i e the subsurface current effects for neutrally buoyant particles is shown in figs 2 e and 2 f and the magnitude and direction of the subgrid scale effective diffusivity k m a j o r and k m i n o r for neutrally buoyant particles is shown in figs 2 g and 2 h the osbl averaged current is weaker than the corresponding surface current in regions where the surface current is strong the difference from the surface current is more than 30 during non summer months over most of the domain in the summer months the difference in magnitude is smaller and but is still larger than 5 over most of the domain the magnitude of the sgs diffusivity is at the order of 10 s of m2 s the sgs diffusivity is highly anisotropic and its direction generally aligns with the along shore direction three groups of simulations are conducted in the first group of simulations particles are assumed to float at the surface and represent particles that have a large rising speed indicated as w b hereafter this group of simulations is also used to represent traditional plastic trajectory simulations where the effects of subsurface currents are neglected in the next two groups of simulations particles are assigned a constant rising speed of 0 5 mm s and 10 mm s respectively observations in the north atlantic gyre fig 5 of reisser and co authors 2015 show that the majority of plastic particles have a rising speed between the two values chosen in this study and those being mixed into the ocean surface boundary layer have a rising speed smaller than 10 mm s depending on the shape and density of plastics the two rising speeds correspond to plastic particles with a size range of sub millimeter to tens of millimeters reisser and co authors 2015 in each simulation a total of 1200 particles are released at three different locations i e the outlets of the mississippi river 28 9 n 89 45 w the atchafalaya river 29 44 n 91 28 w and the wax lake pass 29 47 n 91 45 w the particle releases are repeated on the 1st and 16th day of each month from january 2008 to december 2015 and a total of 576 simulations were conducted a climatology of the trajectory and the fate of plastic particles is established using the 8 year solutions with hourly outputs the tracking for each particle is conducted until a particle reaches either the open boundaries or the land boundaries of the computational domain in this study we consider that a particle beaches when it hits the land boundary it has been observed that buoyant materials that are within hundreds of meters from the land boundary are largely retained in the region and the nearshore water is called sticky water e g wolanski and spangol 2000 or coastal boundary layer e g nickols et al 2012 it was also shown that waves greatly enhance the beaching of oil brought to the nearshore ocean by circulations weisberg et al 2017 while the model grid next to the land boundary has a resolution of a few hundred meters and does not resolve surf zone processes particles that hit the land boundary are considered beached in this study 4 results fig 3 shows the mean paths lines and the percentage reaching a location of the domain heat maps for particles released from the mississippi and the atchafalaya rivers between 2008 and 2015 particles from the atchafalaya river outlet and the wax lake outlet is grouped together as from the atchafalaya particles as both outlets drain the atchafalaya river the total transit distance transit time and average speed are summarized in fig 3 here the total transit distance is the sum of transit distance using neighboring outputs the total transit distance is substantially longer than that shown by the mean trajectories in fig 2 as particle motions associated with eddies and inertial oscillation are smoothed out in the mean trajectories the fate locations of the plastic particles in the domain are summarized in fig 4 note that all results in figs 2 and 4 assume that particles are released evenly in time in reality plastic fluxes from the rivers are not uniform in time as will be discussed in section 5 4 1 simulated transport and fate we will first focus on the climatological trajectory and fate of floating particles w b as those particles are the ones tracked in existing plastics transport models on average floating particles move southwestward after leaving the river outlets figs 3 a and 3 b and their trajectories cover the whole latex shelf particles from the mississippi river travel approximately 722 km over 37 days and those from the atchafalaya river travel about 455 km over 34 days fig 4 mississippi river particles transit through regions further offshore and at a 30 higher speed compared to those from the atchafalaya river wax lake outlet consistent with a previous study showing that the mississippi river plume is faster than the atchafalaya river plume zhang et al 2012a around 65 of the mississippi river particles and about 90 of the atchafalaya river particles stop or beach at the land boundary particles that stop at the open boundary may move eastward to other parts of the gulf with the mexican current and some may even leave the gulf advected with the loop current as is evidenced by the studies of the fate of the river plume water e g hu et al 2005 walker et al 1994 it is also possible that some of the particles that stop at the open boundary of the domain re enter the domain with westward propagating loop current eddies e g alvera azcárate et al 2009 liu et al 2016 and eventually reach the land boundary particularly the coastline west of louisiana including that of texas and portions of mexico the fate of particles that stop at the open boundary can only be evaluated using circulation fields that encompass the whole gulf of mexico the particle beaching statistics presented in this study therefore are likely conservative estimates only slightly more than 20 of the floating particles from both rivers stop at the coast west of louisiana since the mean surface current in the latex is westward except during summer when the winds can become weakly upwelling favorable only about 20 of the floating particles stop east of their origins 4 2 effect of subsurface current subsurface current alters both the trajectory and the fate of weakly buoyant particles and the effect of subsurface current increases with decreasing buoyant rising speed figs 3 4 and 5 with decreasing rising speed particles transit through more offshore regions for example for the slowest rising mississippi river particles w b 0 5 mm s the mean trajectory ends offshore of the 50 m isobath while that of faster rising mississippi river particles stop inshore of the 50 m isobath fig 3 they also travel a substantially longer distance and for a significantly longer period before stopping at the boundaries than the faster rising particles from the same origin the slowest rising mississippi river particles on average travel 1185 km over 65 days before reaching the boundaries fig 4 the transit speed is slightly lower for weakly buoyant particles this is expected as the surface current is stronger when wind and the background current is in the same direction as is mostly the case over the region slower rising particles w b 0 5 mm s have a lower chance of stopping at the land boundary than floating and faster rising particles do figs 5 a and 5 e they have a lower chance of stopping at the land boundary of louisiana figs 5 b and 5 f but have a higher chance of stopping at the land boundary west of louisiana figs 5 c and 5 g the zonal fate of the particles is not influenced by the subsurface current figs 5 d and 5 h the effect of subsurface current on the fate of particles could be understood by examining a transect of horizontal currents fig 6 that is representative of that in the latex shelf the seasonal cycle of mixed layer depth the louisiana coastal current and the upwelling downwelling circulation is evident inshore of the 100 m isobath the alongshore current is the strongest near the surface and decreases with depth the alongshore current is substantially stronger than the cross shore current as shown in zhang et al 2014 the mean along shore current is primarily in thermal wind balance driven by the strong cross shore density gradient particularly in non summer months the shore ward current largely associated with downwelling circulation is also surface intensified therefore slower rising buoyant particles have a slower shoreward motion and might stay for a longer period in the ocean before beaching at higher frequencies the inertial and weather band flows often reverse with depth creating a two or more layer flow this is in part due to the coastal constraint that confines the depth average cross shore flow to be small particles rising through this strongly sheared flow may enhance particle dispersion in the alongshore direction the mean vertical shear in the alongshore direction also dominates over that in the cross shore direction therefore the effective diffusivity is largely in the alongshore direction figs 2e and 2f 4 3 seasonal cycle since both the wind and the circulation show a strong seasonal cycle the trajectory and the fate of riverine particles also exhibit strong seasonal cycles figs 4 and 5 for particles of different rising speeds the seasonal cycle is qualitatively similar but quantitatively different for mississippi river particles both the transit distance and transit time are lower in the first half of the year than the second half of the year figs 4a and 4b particles released between january and april have a relatively high chance of beaching at the coast of louisiana fig 5b during those months there is a strong surface intensified shoreward current driven by downwelling favorable wind and the louisiana coastal current in the largely alongshore direction is westward particles released between may and july have a relatively low probability of beaching and a relatively high probability of stopping east of the river outlet due to the reversal of the louisiana coastal current therefore particles released during the two seasons travel for a relatively short distance before beaching note that the seasonal cycle for beaching at the coast of louisiana fig 5b is less evident for weakly buoyant particles w b 0 5 mm s than for strongly buoyant w b 10 mm s and floating particles w b as discussed earlier weakly buoyant particles are subject to less influence of the shoreward surface intensified downwelling current because they spend substantial time below the ocean surface the seasonal cycle for atchafalaya particles qualitatively similar though less evident than that for mississippi particles 5 transport and fate of riverborne plastics over the latex shelf the riverine plastics discharge changes over an annual cycle and so the trajectory and fate of plastics are therefore different from the averages shown in figs 4 and 5 a climatological plastics discharge from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers has yet to be established here we use an 11 month observation of plastics flux at the baton rouge and new orleans stations of the mississippi river toner 2020 to represent the seasonal plastics flux from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers fig 7 this is the first observational attempt to quantify plastics flux from the two rivers the observations were collected with a manta net at five stations spanning baton rouge and new orleans louisiana between day 309 nov 5th of 2016 and day 273 sept 30th of 2017 the count is for plastics between 0 5 and 5 mm microplastics although the size and shape distributions of the measured plastics are not established therefore plastic particles of different sizes are assumed to have the same seasonal cycle plastics discharge reaches its peak at around may and is the lowest in late fall and winter the peak of the plastics discharge lags about a month behind the peak in the riverine freshwater discharge e g martinez lopez and zavala hidalgo 2009 the plastics discharge flux is used to calculate the annual mean statistics for riverine plastics table 1 in the calculation plastics discharge for october that is missing from the observations is linearly interpolated from the rest of the time series since plastic flux has its peak in late spring and early summer the statistics for plastics is influenced more strongly by those months when buoyant particles travel shorter distances over shorter time periods at higher speeds with fewer particles stopping at the land boundaries in particular the coast west of louisiana on average mississippi river plastics travels 600 km over 30 days both travel distance and travel time is more than 50 larger for weakly buoyant plastics than for floating plastics atchafalaya river plastics travels over a shorter distance than mississippi river plastics the difference in travel time is small for floating plastics w b but is more evident for weakly buoyant plastics w b 0 5 mm s at least 50 mississippi plastics and 80 atchafalaya plastics stop at the land boundaries of the latex shelf the percentage is likely higher because plastic particles that stop at the open boundary of the domain may be swept into the domain again and eventually reach the land boundary subsurface currents move plastics more offshore as explained in section 4 2 and the percentage of plastic reaching the land boundary decreases with decreasing rising speed 6 summary and future directions the major conclusions of the paper are 1 an algorithm that mechanistically includes the effects of subsurface currents on the horizontal movement of buoyant particles is implemented in the larval transport lagrangian ltrans model in a dynamically consistent way the updated ltrans model is readily run in conjunction with standard output from the regional ocean modeling system roms sections 2 and 3 2 buoyant particles from the mississippi and the atchafalaya rivers on average move southwestward and cover the louisiana and texas latex shelf section 4 3 both the trajectory and fate of weakly buoyant particles are affected by subsurface currents the slowest rising particles on average travel a longer distance for a longer period at a lower speed they also are less affected by the surface intensified downwelling upwelling currents showing a weaker seasonal cycle for beaching at the coastline of louisiana section 4 4 more than 50 of the mississippi river plastics and 80 of the atchafalaya river plastics stop at the land boundaries of the latex shelf the probability of beaching decreases with decreasing buoyant rising speed section 5 the modeling framework presented here is not only useful for the tracking of marine plastics it can also be applied for the tracking of other weakly buoyant particulate materials in the ocean such as oil droplets and plankton while oil slicks float at the ocean surface they are broken into droplets of 10 s to 100 s of microns after the application of dispersant many planktonic organisms are also weakly buoyant and have rising speed of a few mm s or smaller there are still uncertainties associated with the estimate of the trajectory and the fate of simulated riverine plastic particles over the latex shelf those uncertainties could be reduced by more accurate plastics flux estimates from the mississippi and the atchafalaya rivers by more realistic representation of plastics dynamics and by the resolving more physics in the ocean circulation fields comprehensive long term observations of plastics in the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers including particle properties are needed to better constrain the model extreme plastics pulse events such as the nurdle spill event near new orleans in august 2020 https www nola com news environment article b4fba760 e18d 11ea 9b0b b3a2123cf48b html are likely to have a substantial impact on plastics concentration over the latex shelf while the rising speed of a lagrangian particle is constant in the simulation the rising speed of plastic particles is variable in the realistic ocean it could vary due to the change in seawater density that is significant from river outflows to the open ocean it could also change due to the aggregation of plastic particles with negatively buoyant particulate materials of either organic or mineral origins e g van sebille et al 2020 since rising speed determines the importance of particle speed and direction change in rising speed during their transport influences the pathway and destine of plastics regarding the physics of the circulation field the biggest uncertainty may be associated with the effects of ocean surface gravity waves that are not included in the hindcast solution for the latex shelf the inclusion of ocean surface gravity waves could alter the trajectories of buoyant particles in the following two ways first waves alter the vertical mixing in the upper ocean waves can enhance vertical mixing by the generation of langmuir circulation e g d asaro 2014 or by the wave orbital velocities e g dai et al 2010 dibenedetto 2020 waves can also suppress vertical mixing when it is in the opposite direction of near surface current e g van roekel et al 2012 mcwilliams et al 2014 the effect of waves on vertical mixing is important in many regions of the global ocean li et al 2019 including over the gulf of mexico e g ali et al 2019 vertical mixing controls the distribution of buoyant particles including plastics in the ocean surface boundary layer e g chor et al 2018 kukulka and brunner 2015 liang et al 2012 and therefore the effect of subsurface currents on plastics in addition to the effect of waves recent studies also demonstrate that the northward component of the earth s rotation e g liu et al 2018 and submesoscale currents e g hamlington et al 2014 yuan and liang 2021 could further alter vertical mixing and thereby the effect of subsurface currents on plastics secondly the wave induced stokes drift is important in the transport of floating materials such as plastics ocean surface gravity waves and stokes drift can be in very different directions from the wind and the current over the world s ocean e g hanley et al 2010 including over the gulf of mexico and the latex shelf abolfazli et al 2020 in the open ocean stokes drift has been shown to influence the large scale transport of plastics e g fraser et al 2018 dobler et al 2019 when only surface current is considered in the coastal ocean waves refract due to bottom topography and propagate perpendicular towards the shoreline when approaching the coastline it was shown that stokes drift is responsible for oil beaching in the northern gulf beaches weisberg et al 2017 the effect of stokes drift on plastic propagation over the latex shelf remains to be investigated another important dynamical process not fully resolved in the circulation field is submesoscale currents with a spatial resolution of 500 m and an archive interval of 3 h the model output in this study marginally resolves submesoscale currents sensitivity studies using 6 hourly roms solutions were also conducted the particle solutions using 3 hourly and 6 hourly roms outputs are qualitatively the same though as expected slightly quantitatively different in a recent study that examines the sensitivity of lagrangian particle solutions to the resolution of archived hydrodynamic solutions dauhajre et al 2019 showed that the model grid needs to be finer than about 100 m and the output interval has to be smaller than 30 min to fully resolve the effect of submesoscale currents on tracer transport in the nearshore region 1 km from the shoreline and further reducing model resolution beyond that yield no difference in particle trajectories and fates submesoscale currents also interact with surface gravity waves e g romero et al 2020 further altering the effects of both waves and submesoscale currents on plastic transport on the other hand it is still formidable to run a model and archive multi year model outputs at that spatial and temporal scale for a regional ocean as noted by dauhajre et al 2019 also the regional ocean scale transport is still governed by mesoscale and large scale circulations the effects of submesoscale currents on the particle distributions in a regional ocean are another open research question all the missing dynamical processes could be straightforwardly added to the modeling framework described in section 2 for example to include the effect of the stokes drift u v will be replaced by u c i r u s t v c i r v s t with subscripts cir and st implying circulation and stokes drift field from a coupled ocean wave model to include the effect of wave induced mixing diffusivity with wave induced mixing will be used as input for a k s to include the effect of submesoscale currents circulation fields with a spatial resolution of 100 m archived every 30 min will be used as input in an off line particle tracking model or an online lagrangian particle tracking model i e a model that concurrently simulates particle trajectories and circulation fields can be used e g stanev and ricker 2020 ricker and stanev 2020 the study also points to the need in plastic trajectory studies that the ocean instrumentation and observing community could contribute to as noted by the authors and pointed out by the anonymous reviewers there are no observations that accurately follow the motion of the weakly buoyant microplastics that could be compared with the modeling results most ocean drifters and floats move at the ocean surface or along constant density surface in the ocean interior e g lumpkin et al 2017 the only instrument that could follow the turbulent motions of neutrally weakly particles in the ocean surface boundary layer to the authors best knowledge is the lagrangian floats developed by eric d asaro e g d asaro et al 1996 those floats are relatively expensive and have only been deployed at small spatial and temporal scales therefore have never been used to study the trajectories of microplastics the development and deployment of low cost weakly buoyant drifters that mimic the motion of microplastics would greatly improve our understanding of the trajectory and fate of microplastics and other weakly buoyant particulate materials in the ocean credit authorship contribution statement jun hong liang conceptualization methodology formal analysis

23884,the congo river estuary is characterised by a deep canyon that connects the river to the deep ocean by cutting through the continental shelf its estuary is influenced by high river discharge and micro tidal conditions with a large depth and limited vertical mixing this restricts the supply of oxygen from the surface waters to the more saline bottom waters leading to hypoxic and anoxic zones we study the dynamics of the congo river estuary by applying the multi scale baroclinic coastal ocean model slim 3d www slim ocean be to this topographically challenging environment by allowing a high degree of flexibility in the representation of both the complex geometry and the strong stratification slim 3d is able to simulate riverine tidal and gravitational processes that drive the estuarine circulation model results compare favourably with in situ data in the estuary suggesting that the exchange flow is correctly simulated the latter is characterised by a two layer dynamics the combination of the large river discharge the strong stratification and the large depth results in a moderate freshwater froude number and a very small mixing number it makes the congo river an outlier in state of the art estuarine classifications closer to fjords than salt wedge estuaries furthermore using the age as a diagnosis sheds light on the spatial variability of the estuarine waters ventilation local maximum of renewing water age located just below the pycnocline is exceeded by old dense oceanic waters which stagnate at the bottom of the canyon for more than two months due to the small vertical mixing it helps explain the hypoxic and anoxic conditions observed at the bottom of the submarine canyon keywords congo river to ocean continuum unstructured mesh coastal ocean model renewing water age estuarine classification 1 introduction the congo river is the main african freshwater input into the atlantic ocean with a watershed of 3 7 1 0 6 km 2 and a mean river discharge of about 4 1 0 4 m 3 s second only to the amazon river the congo strongly affects the sea surface salinity in the eastern atlantic ocean vangriesheim et al 2009 pak et al 1984 reported that its plume forms a surface lens that extends 800 km offshore reaching latitude 8 east this large outflow transports a large amount of suspended matter into the atlantic ocean eisma et al 1978 in kinshasa located 300 km upstream of the estuary the total suspended sediment flux reaches 30 7 1 0 6 tons year and approximately 6 of it is particulate organic carbon poc coynel et al 2005 only half of the poc gravitationally settles into the subhalocline water body of the canyon the other half being advected offshore with the surface plume eisma and kalf 1984 hence the congo river plays an important role for the local regional and global carbon fluxes at the land ocean interface despite the importance of the congo river there are very few publications about the hydrodynamics of the congo s estuary and region of freshwater influence rofi hopkins et al 2013 and chao et al 2015 tracked the plume by means of satellite data products the first numerical model of the plume dynamics was set up by denamiel et al 2013 using roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 they studied the impact of topographic features in particular the submarine canyon and variable forcings on the plume movement the model was further used to investigate the influence of the outflow on the sea surface temperature in the near shore region white and toumi 2014 and the relevance of data assimilation in the regional scale modelling of this area phillipson and toumi 2017 2019 as these studies focused on the freshwater plume the computational domains did not include the congo river itself to the best of our knowledge the only numerical study of the whole tidally influenced congo river has been conducted by le bars et al 2016 by means of a depth averaged barotropic model which by construction could not deal with the baroclinic aspects of the flow the deep submarine canyon one of the largest in the world that directly connects the ocean with the lower estuary impacts the plume and shelf dynamics as well as the estuarine circulation the large variations of the water column depth and the steep bathymetry gradients with slopes up to 50 imply that the numerical grid of any numerical model of this region must be designed with care it is desirable that the hydrostatic consistency criterion 1 1 as was argued by deleersnijder 2015 this criterion has little to do with the consistency of the numerical scheme per se and instead is closely related to the accuracy of the discretisation of the horizontal pressure force term haney 1991 be met so as to avoid significant errors in the evaluation of the discrete pressure force requiring the implementation of a flexible horizontal resolution and a suitable vertical coordinate system haney 1991 deleersnijder and beckers 1992 burchard and beckers 2004 hofmeister et al 2010 berntsen 2011 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2016 furthermore the strong stratification inside the estuary requires low numerical dissipation schemes clearly modelling the barotropic and baroclinic circulation along the congo river to sea continuum represents a challenging test case for any numerical model since hansen and rattray 1966 estuarine classification into different regimes has been an active field of study see for example geyer and maccready 2014 and references therein as the discharge and the tides change over time an estuary may switch from one regime to another one as exemplified by the columbia river estuary kärnä and baptista 2016a in many estuaries vertical mixing is mostly driven by the tides the congo river estuary is micro tidal with a tidal range varying between 1 9 m during spring tides and 0 3 m during neap tides at the river mouth near banana see fig 1 for the exact location eisma and van bennekom 1978 in combination with the large depth of the canyon the regime of the congo river estuary is thus expected to be classified as a strongly stratified estuary mostly driven by salinity differences such estuarine feature is often associated with low discharge estuaries or fjords however unlike such small velocity systems the congo estuary is driven by a huge and stable water discharge that produces a large and steady mean river velocity as such it appears as a very peculiar estuary which is likely to be an outlier in estuarine classifications another salient feature of the congo estuary is the presence of vast hypoxic and anoxic zones because of the mineralisation of poc in sinking sediments the dissolved oxygen concentration steadily decreases below the freshwater surface layer this is enhanced by stratification that reduces the vertical mixing below the pycnocline low oxygen zones have been reported in the deep estuary with an oxygen concentration that almost vanishes near the bottom eisma and van bennekom 1978 this has qualitatively been understood but not yet quantified in detail for the congo river van bennekom et al 1978 similar hypoxic conditions are reported for the neuse river paerl et al 1998 or puget sound feely et al 2010 although they exhibit large seasonal variations the goal of this paper is to advance our understanding of the congo river estuarine dynamics by applying the multi scale hydrodynamic model slim 3d 2 2 slim second generation louvain la neuve ice ocean model www slim ocean be to the congo river to sea continuum slim 3d is an unstructured mesh discontinuous galerkin model that is well suited to simulate flows in topographically challenging areas after being compared with field observations the model is used to study the 3d flow structure within this estuary that allows us to assess the importance of tidal mixing and stratification and hence position the congo river in geyer and maccready 2014 s estuarine classification by further coupling the hydrodynamic model with a renewing water age diagnostic tool we can show how the combination of a large depth weak tide and high discharge leads to very slow water renewal at the bottom of the estuary which in turn leads to hypoxic conditions the paper is organised as follows section 2 details the methods and data i e the available in situ observations the numerical model and the diagnostic tools the results are presented in section 3 the model reference run is compared against field data in section 3 1 insights into the estuarine classification resp circulation are provided in section 3 2 resp 3 3 renewing water age theory is applied to the estuary in section 3 4 a schematic oxygen budget is outlined in section 3 5 finally results are discussed in section 4 conclusions are drawn in the same section 2 methods and data 2 1 in situ measurements about thirty years ago eisma 1990 collected data along the congo river canyon fig 1 while navigating measurements of salinity temperature and oxygen were made at different locations represented with white dots in fig 1 and at different depths these data were collected from november 21th 1989 for the upstream river until december 12th 1989 for the oceanic measurements in the estuary measurements were performed from 27 november to 30 november since they were taken along the way the atmospheric and oceanic conditions were not constant during the measurement period the measured estuarine profiles of salinity temperature and oxygen are shown in fig 2 the observed salinity and temperature profiles show the high vertical stratification of the congo river estuary the pycnocline is located at a depth of about 10 m the freshwater layer thickness is almost constant in the whole transect except at the plume lift off near the mouth where the layer is thinner the vertical stratification is strong with salinity differences of 35 1 0 3 within 5 m these observations are consistent with those of spencer et al 2013 who mentioned the presence of very saline water 35 1 0 3 just downstream of malela under a 10 m freshwater surface layer and a plume thickness of about 2 3 m at the mouth with surface salinity near zero the stratification is mostly controlled by salinity differences and seems to be rather insensitive to tidal motions oxygen concentrations show a strong vertical variability with relatively high oxygen concentrations located near the surface and large areas of hypoxia 187 5 mmol o 2 m 3 dashed line in fig 2 and even anoxia 62 5 mmol o 2 m 3 solid line in fig 2 in the bottom layer of the estuary there is a clear similarity between the salinity temperature and oxygen profiles for context fig 3 shows seasonal variations of river discharge at matadi and tidal elevation at banana near the river mouth the analysis period dark grey is in the wet austral summer the river discharge is large throughout the year and varies between 2 and 7 1 0 4 m 3 s december generally features the highest river discharge with a mean value around 5 5 1 0 4 m 3 s fresh water discharge of december 1989 was slightly smaller than the seasonal mean but remains above yearly average values 2 2 model setup the three dimensional hydrodynamics is simulated by means of the baroclinic ocean model slim 3d kärnä et al 2013 delandmeter et al 2015 2018 vallaeys et al 2018 it solves the 3d hydrostatic equations under the boussinesq approximation on an unstructured mesh by means of the discontinuous galerkin dg finite element method blaise et al 2010 slim 3d has recently been used to simulate the thermocline oscillations in lake tanganyika with a vertically adaptive grid delandmeter et al 2018 the coupled estuarine plume dynamics of the columbia river vallaeys et al 2018 and the algal bloom occurrence in lake titicaca duquesne et al 2021 the model is run from 15 august 1989 until 1 january 1990 the model spin up lasts until the analysis starts on 1 november we then compare the simulated results with the observations of eisma 1990 2 2 1 3d baroclinic model the model equations are described in delandmeter et al 2018 they are based on a formulation that preserves tracer consistency white et al 2008 at a discrete level delandmeter et al 2018 such a formulation ensures an accurate coupling between the hydrodynamical and tracer transport modules dg methods scale well on parallel computer platforms thanks to their spatial sparsity they also offer functional flexibility as the model solutions can be discontinuous between mesh elements this is particularly useful for modelling flows in topographically challenging environments in the case of the congo river the sides of the submarine canyon that cut through the continental shelf are so steep that it is almost impossible to achieve a mesh fine enough to represent them accurately as a result the model has to be flexible enough to deal with under resolved topographic features without resorting to unphysical dissipation the dg formulation allows slim 3d to handle strong gradients of bathymetry density and velocity with little numerical dissipation as shown in vallaeys et al 2018 2 2 2 computational domain the domain of interest covers the atlantic ocean near the congo river mouth from 2 s to 10 s and from 8 e to the african west coast at the border between angola and democratic republic of congo drc at approximately 6 s the domain includes the whole tidally influenced congo river from banana at the mouth to matadi about 150 km upstream of it fig 1 the latter area is separated from the capital of drc kinshasa by rapids flowing over about 290 km the water depth ranges from more than 4500 m in the deep ocean to a few metres in the estuary fig 1 the computational bathymetry has been obtained by merging the global data from gebco 2008 monahan 2008 with digitalised nautical charts of the river le bars et al 2016 the bathymetry features of the congo river estuary are shown in fig 1 a deep canyon depth 250 m splits the congo river estuary into two distinct parts the submarine canyon originates from the post rift evolution of the continental margin of west equatorial africa savoye et al 2009 shallow zones depth 20 m are found along both sides of the estuarine canyon with half of the non canyon area shallower than 10 m the estuary is characterised by a number of channels between boma and malela downstream of this region mangroves occupy large shallow areas on each bank as only very little topographical information is available for those areas they are left out of the domain a minimal depth of 3 m is prescribed as wetting and drying processes are not explicitly taken into account as in vallaeys et al 2018 2 2 3 mesh generation owing to the specific nature of the domain of interest rugged bathymetry wide range of characteristic length scales mesh generation is crucial lambrechts et al 2008 clearly the horizontal mesh size must be sufficiently small in the estuary and in the vicinity of the coast and can be significantly larger in the deep ocean then in the region where the bottom slope is the steepest in particular along the sides of the canyon the horizontal mesh resolution must be further enhanced special attention must also be devoted to the determination of the vertical grid size with a finer mesh where vertical gradients of density and velocity are highest near the top surface of the water column inside the estuary for example as in other previous applications of slim 3d we resort to a two stage mesh generation procedure see for example delandmeter et al 2015 first a triangular unstructured surface mesh is generated by means of gmsh http gmsh info geuzaine and remacle 2009 then this mesh is extruded along the vertical direction yielding prismatic elements here we use a hybrid σ z vertical grid with σ levels near the surface and z levels below the transition depth h σ as in vallaeys et al 2018 this type of mesh facilitates the representation of the hydrostatic equilibrium especially with low order discretisations the surface mesh consists of about 1 6 1 0 4 triangles the reference element mesh size of the horizontal triangles is set to the minimum of two linear functions of the distance to the continental and estuarine coastlines the reference mesh size reaches 500 m along the banks of the estuary and 3 km near the other coastlines it further decreases to reach a mesh size of 15 km at 50 km from the coast in the deepest parts of the domain fig 4 next seeking inspiration in haney 1991 deleersnijder and beckers 1992 and legrand et al 2007 a horizontal length characterising the bottom topography is evaluated namely l h h h h where h and h denote the unperturbed height of the water column and the horizontal gradient operator respectively the objective is to further refine the surface mesh in such a way that this length is resolved however this would lead to a significant increase in the number of elements therefore using the method of legrand et al 2007 we generate anisotropic elements whose size is smaller in the direction of the bathymetry gradient than in the orthogonal direction with a maximum mesh size of 300 m the anisotropic mesh has about half the number of elements than an isotropic mesh would have in other words length scale l h is still resolved albeit in a directional manner the surface mesh is finally vertically extruded to form prisms the anisotropic mesh is extruded with h σ 12 m and is made up of 5 σ layers on top of at most 27 z layers the value of h σ has been obtained following a calibration procedure with respect to a high resolution reference solution the 5 uppermost σ levels have a maximal depth of 1 3 5 8 and 12 metres below sea level to increase the near surface resolution as soon as depth exceeds 14 m a number of z levels is added below the σ levels at depths 16 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 60 70 80 90 100 120 150 175 200 250 350 500 700 1000 1300 1700 2300 3000 and 4000 metres below the sea surface vertical movement of the mesh is handled with an ale formulation as is described in delandmeter et al 2018 2 2 4 initial conditions and forcings the system is initially at rest with zero elevation and velocity the salinity is set to s 35 1 0 3 in the ocean and s 0 in the river the initial temperature is a piecewise linear function of depth with a surface temperature of 25 c decreasing to a minimum value of 8 c in the deeper parts of the domain h 500 m for the latter since global products such as mercator or hycom are not available before 1993 we construct a stratified field similar to that of denamiel et al 2013 the river discharge is imposed at matadi the upstream boundary of the domain based on volumetric flow rate measurements made at the inga dam located about 30 km upstream of matadi as can be seen in fig 3 the period sampled by eisma 1990 is marked by a relatively low river outflow about 4 5 1 0 4 m 3 s in comparison to climatological values for december about 5 6 1 0 4 m 3 s only freshwater enters the domain at matadi and the temperature is set to a constant value of 27 c while there are several rivers along the african coast inside the computational domain like the nyanga and kwanza rivers the congo river is the only freshwater input taken into account in the model as its volumetric flow rate is about two orders of magnitude greater than the other rivers at the open ocean boundaries tidal elevation and current from osu topex poseidon global inverse solution tpxo7 2 dataset egbert and erofeeva 2002 are prescribed no global ocean circulation is prescribed at the open boundaries the wind stress is generally small in the region of interest denamiel et al 2013 we impose the air sea flux of momentum with the reanalysis product of ecmwf for the wind speed at 10 m above sea level the air sea heat flux is not taken into account as will be seen later the renewing time of surface waters is quite small hence limiting the impact of heat fluxes on the estuarine hydrodynamics the influence of waves in the estuary is also quite limited because of the large river outflow and the topography of the mouth with the beach barriers almost disconnecting the estuary from the open ocean the estimated net atmospheric water flux over the area of the estuary is insignificant as compared to the river inflow 2 3 renewing water age inspecting fields of primitive variables velocity pressure density etc is not necessarily the best approach to the understanding of transport processes taking place over timescales longer than those related to tides i e subtidal timescales as pointed out above evaluating time and position dependent diagnostic timescales may be conducive to useful interpretations this is mainly because such timescales lead to an integrative holistic view of transport phenomena which is much less affected by small time and space scales of variation than primitive variables see e g the review article by lucas and deleersnijder 2020 in this context inspiration is sought in the generic approach to water renewal developed by gourgue et al 2007 accordingly the water is split into several water types namely the water particles present in the control domain at the initial time the original water and those progressively replacing them which belong to the renewing water and originate from open boundaries the renewing water may be further divided into two components according to whether they come from the upstream boundary river water or equivalently freshwater or the downstream one coastal ocean water at a given time and location the age of the renewing water or one of its components is the time elapsed since leaving the relevant open boundary rayson et al 2016 liu et al 2017 du et al 2018 rutherford and fennel 2018 such ages allow gaining insight into water renewal rates de brye et al 2012 kärnä and baptista 2016b yang et al 2019 in the present study these diagnoses will help clarify the effects of the estuarine circulation on the long term transport and the emergence of hypoxia and anoxia in the estuary the aforementioned ages are evaluated in accordance with the constituent oriented age and residence time theory cart www climate be cart delhez et al 1999 deleersnijder et al 2001 let t and x denote the time and the position vector respectively then subscripts o r i r i v and o c e are introduced so as to identify original river and oceanic waters since it has long been acknowledged that a water type may be regarded as a passive tracer cox 1989 hirst 1999 goosse et al 2001 deleersnijder et al 2002 haine and hall 2002 meier 2005 de brye et al 2012 the concentration of a water type c χ t x obeys advection diffusion equation 1 c χ t h c χ v k h c χ χ o r i r i v o c e where v t x is the water velocity which is divergence free boussinesq approximation and k t x is the diffusivity tensor the latter is symmetric and positive definite its components are

first term on the right hand side of eq 2 is related to ageing the age of every water type particle increases at the same pace as time key ingredients for the evaluation of the ages are the definition of the control domain as well as the initial and boundary conditions under which eqs 1 and 2 are to be solved deleersnijder et al 2020 they must be in line with the declared objectives of the diagnostic strategy which consists in diagnosing water renewal in the river and the adjacent coastal zone therefore the control domain is to be smaller than and included in the computational one the control domain s open upstream boundary γ r i v coincides with the riverine boundary of the computational domain which is located at matadi strictly speaking the estuary begins just upstream of malela spencer et al 2013 the impact of setting the upstream boundary at matadi will be discussed in section 3 4 the open oceanic boundary γ o c e is relatively close to the coastline it is located at the mouth of the river and links pointe de bulambemba drc in the north and punta do padrao angola in the south red line in the lower right panel of fig 1 the remainder of the boundary including the water air interface is impermeable and is denoted γ i m p the initial and boundary conditions are laid out in table 1 and are illustrated in fig 5 a zero flux boundary condition is imposed at the impermeable boundaries γ i m p and dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at other boundaries while the open boundary conditions for the age concentration are simply α χ 0 the open boundary conditions for the water mass concentration depend on whether the inflow brings the water mass of interest c χ 1 or not c χ 0 deleersnijder 2019 demonstrated that as expected the water concentrations

the least we can expect from such diagnostic timescales the age of the original water is equal to the elapsed time a o r i t x t obviously this result provides no insight into water renewal processes but is a validation element of the present diagnostic strategy finally in accordance with the age averaging hypothesis formulated by deleersnijder et al 2001 we can also aggregate the riverine and oceanic waters yielding the renewing water hereinafter identified by subscript r e n its concentration age concentration and age are c r e n c r i v c o c e α r e n α r i v α o c e and a r e n α r e n c r e n respectively 3 results model results are first compared with the observations collected by eisma 1990 in december 1989 we then discuss the position of the congo river estuary within the estuarine classification of geyer and maccready 2014 and highlight the two layer flow structure we also compute the renewing water age and use it to gain insight into the water renewal timescales of the estuary we finally sketch an oxygen budget for the estuary 3 1 comparison with field data the model results are compared with the observed salinity and temperature vertical profiles model outputs are sampled at the same time stamps as the observations we then merge simulated vertical profiles in a transect view figs 6 and 7 the simulated halocline is similar to the observed one with a freshwater layer thickness ranging from about 15 m at the upstream station to about 5 m at the river mouth fig 6 the strong stratification observed in situ is well captured by the model with a thickness of the brackish water layer of a few metres the sharp transition between water masses shown in the temperature field is also well captured by the model fig 7 in deeper areas the temperature is somewhat overestimated the vertical profiles are nonetheless very similar and vertical gradients of temperature agree between observed and simulated values the temperature bias is likely due to the ocean initial and boundary conditions which might be slightly too warm skill metrics are computed to assess the quality of the simulated temperature and salinity fields see tables a 3 and a 4 correlations between observations and predicted values are high at all stations for the salinity 0 87 and the temperature 0 92 small biases are found in the salinity field because salinity differences in the ocean are small as compared to the temperature differences the predicted salinity values show less variability than in the observations with very small normalised root mean square errors rmse and nmse there is very little information to validate the velocity field in the estuary let us just point out that eisma 1990 reported a velocity of about 2 m s just upstream of malela at the head of the canyon the model simulates a velocity of about 1 5 m s at that location it is noteworthy that the velocity in this region strongly depends on the bathymetry which is not well documented outside of the canyon at the bottom of the canyon shepard and emery 1973 reported current velocities up to 0 16 m s in the up canyon direction and less intense up to 0 11 m s in the down canyon direction to compensate for the outflow of saltwater near the surface the time average was reported to be up canyon which is also simulated with the model fig 9 down canyon strong turbidity currents may abruptly reverse this net upward flow but those cannot be simulated by the present model 3 2 estuarine classification in order to better understand the hydrodynamic regime of the congo river estuary we attempt to position it in the geyer and maccready 2014 diagram which is based on the freshwater froude f r f and mixing m i dimensionless numbers fig 8 the freshwater froude number compares the river flow velocity to the speed of internal waves 3 f r f u r β g s o h where u r q a is the sectionally and tidally averaged river flow velocity β 7 7 1 0 1 is the haline contraction coefficient s o 35 1 0 3 is the maximal ocean salinity at the river mouth h a w is the characteristic depth of the estuary for a section of the congo estuary of area a 2 1 0 5 m 2 and width w 4 1 0 3 m similar to that of the red dot in the inset of fig 1 we obtain u r 0 2 m s and h 50 m the resulting freshwater froude number value f r f 5 5 1 0 2 is comparable to that of other high discharge rivers such as the columbia river kärnä and baptista 2016a the mixing number evaluates the effectiveness of tidal mixing for a stratified estuary 4 m i u 2 ω n 0 h 2 where u 2 c d u t 2 is the bottom stress ω 1 4 1 0 4 s 1 is the dominant m 2 tidal frequency in the congo river estuary and n 0 β g s o h 7 3 1 0 2 s 1 is the buoyancy frequency with an amplitude of the depth averaged tidal velocity u t 0 2 m s and c d 3 1 0 3 the squared friction velocity is u 2 1 0 4 m 2 s 2 which is comparable to values computed by means of the hydrodynamic model the resulting mixing parameter value m i 7 1 0 2 is very small and comparable to that of fjords this is due to the combined effect of a small tidal amplitude signal in this region and the canyon s depth comparable to that of a fjord unlike classical fjords the freshwater froude number is rather large despite the depth of the canyon this is a consequence of the very large river discharge the congo river estuary thus appears as an outlier in the geyer and maccready 2014 estuarine parameter space fig 8 3 3 two layer flow structure the congo river estuary exhibits a very stable stratification as the tides are not strong enough to erode the pycnocline in order to quantify the comparative effects of the tidal and gravitational circulations we compute the different components of the residual salinity transport u s using the vertical profiles of the along channel velocity u u z t and salinity s s z t at a station inside the estuary red dot in fig 1 the total salt transport u s can be expressed as 5 u s u s u s where f represents the deviation from the tidal average f this splitting allows us to evaluate the transport due to the exchange flow as compared to the dispersive tidal salt transport hamilton 1990 the first term on the right hand side of eq 5 represents the advection of the mean salinity profile by the residual velocity field the second term represents the transport due to tides the typical two layer structure of the exchange flow is clearly visible in the transport profiles fig 9 the temporal average is computed over four tidal periods in both spring dashed curves and neap solid curves tidal phases see fig 3 for the time periods the mean value red curves shows that there is a large net seaward transport in the top layer as explained by spencer et al 2013 below it the net salt flux is landward which is typical of strongly stratified estuaries and fjords the transition between the two distinct layers is very sharp but unlike shallow rivers where maximum inflow is near the bottom the landward component is mainly restricted to the top 40 m it is not significant at larger depths appearing more like the circulation in a fjord with a third layer in which the current is slower the tidal effects blue curve have an almost negligible influence on the total transport as in fjords and strongly stratified estuaries the tidal transport is restricted to the pycnocline area overall the flow is mostly baroclinic and gravitational effects dominate the tidal effects the variability of the velocity over a tidal period is shown in fig 10 where the two layer structure of the flow clearly appears in the bottom layer the flood tide increases the landward current but ebbing tides barely change the velocity direction there the top layer seaward velocity also exhibits small tidal variability with small changes of the seaward velocity geyer and ralston 2011 examined the dynamics of strongly stratified estuaries using the two layer theory they split those into two categories salt wedge and fjord the former is characterised by a discharge sufficiently large to recover strong stratification despite tides and comparable thickness between top and bottom layers the stratification in the latter arises from the decorrelation between surface and bottom layer dynamics the depth of fjords is quite large and the top layer is often very thin as compared to the bottom layer tides also have a limited impact on the surface layer dynamics the congo therefore shares many similarities with fjords despite its huge river discharge the turbulent kinetic energy which increases with shear and decreases with stratification controls the vertical mixing the dynamic stability of the water column can thus be investigated with the gradient richardson number r i n 2 m 2 the latter is the ratio of the following parameters the squared brunt vaïsälä buoyancy frequency n 2 g ρ 0 ρ z and the squared shear frequency m 2 u z 2 fig 11 shows profiles of those parameters along the canyon transect as expected both frequencies are higher along the pycnocline where the stratification is strongest as the shear frequency is smaller than the buoyancy frequency in deep areas the gradient richardson number is large in many places except near the pycnocline and the sea surface the resulting vertical turbulent diffusivity is therefore very small throughout the deep water column it mainly becomes significant in shallower regions at the head of the canyon 3 4 renewing water age we study the renewing of the estuarine water and differentiate water masses originating from the ocean and the river renewing water age is simulated for the same time period as the hydrodynamics the surface renewing water age is shown in fig 12 the riverine waters rapidly flows out of the river when leaving matadi reaching boma in about 12 hours and malela in about 1 day they eventually enter the ocean after about 1 5 days upstream of the canyon there is little variability of the surface freshwater age across the channel however over the canyon bottom friction is reduced and combined with the gravitational current surface waters tend to accelerate as a result lateral variability grows with a smaller age over the canyon and larger values in the vicinity of the river banks leading to a parabolic like age profile as the water column is well mixed in the upstream part of the river age estimates are in good agreement with the barotropic estimates of le bars et al 2016 the depth averaged renewing water age near boma was estimated to be less than one day with the 2d model whereas surface water age computed with the 3d model is about 12 hours density driven currents tend to accelerate surface waters leading to smaller ages in the estuary estimates vary more significantly the barotropic model showed a strong deceleration near the mouth with a transition of river water age from 2 days at malela to more than 10 days at banana in the 3d model the water age shows that water accelerates at the surface reaching the river mouth in less than 1 5 days of course the oceanic water age sharply increases in the bottom layer and hence partly compensates these differences however in the estuary the 3d baroclinic model clearly provides a better picture of the water age as there is a strong vertical variability over the water column over the water column the riverine waters are mainly present in the top layers with a riverine water concentration c r i v 0 99 in the top 5 m of the water column of the estuary and c r i v 0 01 below 15 m not shown the oceanic waters slowly fill the bottom layer in between brackish waters result from the mixing of those two water masses the renewing water age in the top 15 metres is shown in fig 13 top panel near the pycnocline the structure is similar to that observed in other stratified estuaries kärnä and baptista 2016b the renewing water age is small a 2 days in this top layer where freshwater is mostly present c r i v c o c e the age is also small near the open ocean boundary just below the pycnocline 8 m where oceanic waters are mostly present c o c e c r i v between those two layers brackish waters are trapped by the strong mixing and the renewing water age increases a 3 days it is noteworthy that the riverine water age is computed since leaving matadi while the congo river estuary is defined as starting just upstream of malela the time spent by the riverine water inside the estuary itself is thus smaller by approximatively 1 day yet this aforementioned local age maximum is not the global maximal value over the water column as the maximum salinity inflow is located far from the bottom in the case of the congo due the significant depth of the estuary there is an inflow of older water in deeper areas where shear stress and hence mixing is reduced near the bottom of the canyon there is therefore no trace of riverine water the renewing water age coincides with the oceanic water age and grows with depth fig 13 bottom panel it exceeds two months at some places the dense oceanic water masses with a low dissolved oxygen concentration enter with the gravitational circulation and stagnate in the deep estuary like in a fjord these water masses do not mix with the lighter riverine water masses the long renewal time during which waters originating from the eastern equatorial oxygen minimum zone enter the deeper parts of the canyon combined with the degradation of riverine organic material presumably cause the formation of areas with very low oxygen concentrations the locations of the renewing water age maxima seem to correspond with the observed oxygen minima the head of the canyon is characterised by an abrupt halt of the oceanic water intrusion not shown at malela there is an abrupt transition between the outer deep and the inner shallow parts of the estuary dupra et al 2001 with the steep transition to shallow areas and the large river discharge the oceanic waters are blocked only riverine freshwater fills the inner estuary the salinity intrusion length is therefore very stable over time 3 5 schematic oxygen budget oxygen in the estuarine canyon below the freshwater layer is increasingly depleted with depth reaching almost zero near the bottom fig 2 this is due to i aerobic respiration of particulate organic carbon poc that is flushed from the upstream congo river and gravitationally settles into the deeper layers once it arrives at the estuary ii strong density stratification restricting vertical mixing of atmospheric oxygen into deeper layers and iii advection of oxygen depleted oceanic waters into the estuarine canyon here we estimate the role of poc remineralisation for the estuarine canyon s oxygen and carbon balance with a 3 box model in a simplified geometry fig 14 where a shallow oxygenated upper layer of constant depth 10 m lies on top of a deoxygenated lower layer whose depth increases with the distance to the upstream boundary from the vertical structure of oxygen measurements fig 2 and simulated ocean water renewal times fig 13 the deoxygenated area can be subdivided into an upper and a lower zone the upper deoxygenated zone is characterised by a relatively fast exchange of water with the upper ocean and a strong input of poc the lower anoxic zone exchanges more slowly with the corresponding deep ocean water poc which is not remineralised within the upper canyon reaches this zone and its labile fraction can be partly remineralised there with provision of less oxygen both deoxygenated zones are separated at 50 m depth the volume of the estuarine canyon is 1 0 10 m 3 from approximate length scales width w 2 km length l 25 km and mean depth h 200 m the upper and lower deoxygenated zones water renewal times are r 1 5 4 days and r 2 47 7 days respectively they are calculated as volume weighted averages of the simulated high resolution water age distribution the oxygen concentrations of the upper o 2 1 0 189 mol m 3 and lower o 2 2 0 085 mol m 3 oceanic renewal waters are calculated as vertical averages from an oxygen profile at a station 121 km downstream of the upper end of the estuary eisma 1990 the lower oceanic waters originate in the eastern equatorial oxygen minimum zone karstensen et al 2008 the oxygen budget in the upper deoxygenated layer is given by the net influx of o 2 f ox1 from the inflowing oceanic waters during the renewal time r 1 and by the concurrent loss of oxygen due to remineralisation of labile poc settling from surface oxygenated layer the poc remineralisation rate f remi1 is equivalent to the oxygen consumption as the stoichiometric ratio of oxygen o 2 consumption to organic carbon labile poc consumption is 1 paulmier et al 2009 pelagic remineralisation is computed as the difference between oxygen advected with ocean water and oxygen observed in situ exchange of oxygen with the surface layer is not taken into account because it is largely prevented by the halocline for the lower deoxygenated layer we assume the corresponding fluxes the carbon budget in the upper deoxygenated layer is given by the amount of labile poc settling from the oxygenated layer f in1 and its loss due to remineralisation while settling f remi1 according to eisma and kalf 1984 half of the congo river s poc flux settles into the deeper part of the estuary the other half being advected offshore with the surface current this value of 50 is consistent with the results from a recent study on trace elements originating from the congo river vieira et al 2020 we therefore take f in1 as the labile fraction of f riv 2 the carbon budget in the lower deoxygenated layer is given by the amount of labile poc settling from the upper deoxygenated layer f in2 and its loss due to remineralisation while settling f remi2 the riverine poc flux f riv calculated as the product of discharge and poc concentration deviates from the annual average by less than 2 during the seasonal low and high water periods according to monthly measurements at a station near brazzaville kinshasa about 300 km upstream of the estuary coynel et al 2005 river suspension apparently becomes diluted with discharge we assume no change in water discharge from kinshasa to the river mouth and therefore use the annual average given by coynel et al 2005 for the poc concentration they report an annual average of 1 7 mg c l 1 which is significantly higher than the 1 1 mg c l 1 reported as average by cadée 1984 for the estuarine freshwater this indicates a loss of poc due to sedimentation within the river between kinshasa and the river mouth we therefore use the poc concentration of 1 1 mg c l 1 0 092 mol c m 3 from cadée 1984 only a fraction of poc is labile i e susceptible to remineralisation this fraction has been estimated as 22 46 for rivers with total suspended solids tss 150 mg l 1 e g 20 25 for the ganges brahmaputra indus and orinoco rivers by ittekott 1988 for the congo river we expect values towards the lower end of that range due to the river s comparatively low tss annual average 26 mg l 1 coynel et al 2005 which is predominantly 80 in the fine fraction 63 microns with its poc originating from relatively degraded soil organic matter spencer et al 2012 the carbon and oxygen budget for the subhalocline layer of the canyon critically depends on the ocean water s oxygen concentration and renewal time the amount of organic matter entering the anaerobic zone and this material s labile fraction the mean renewal time 27 3 days compares reasonably well with the 20 days estimate derived from earlier bottom water current measurements of shepard and emery 1973 by van bennekom et al 1978 varying the values of renewal times by 10 results in remineralisation ratios of 60 8 73 5 this interval includes the standard ratio with the model based renewal times of 67 in narrow limits organic matter fluxes are well documented the labile fraction can be estimated within reasonable limits assuming a labile fraction of 30 the remineralisation consumes 67 of the labile component of the total settling poc or 33 5 of the labile component of the total river poc flux to draw oxygen down to the observed levels in both deoxygenated zones if the labile fraction were 25 instead the same oxygen drawdown would result from remineralisation of 80 of the labile component of the total settling poc or 40 of the labile component of total river poc flux in other words a reduction of the congo s poc flux by more than 33 of its present value e g due to reservoir construction for the grand inga hydroelectric project could initiate re oxygenation of the subhalocline water body towards aerobic conditions 4 discussion and conclusion setting up a 3d baroclinic model of the congo river estuary is very challenging because of the steep bathymetry profile with slopes up to 50 along the submarine canyon by combining a discontinuous galerkin formulation an anisotropic horizontal mesh and σ z vertical discretisation we managed to represent both the geometry and the model variables despite these strong gradients the vertical and horizontal discretisations have to be carefully selected in order to correctly reproduce the circulation within the canyon preliminary attempts confirmed that σ layers are not well suited to approximate steep bathymetry profiles we therefore only used σ layers in the top 12 metres and z layers underneath the recent implementation of a vertically adaptive mesh in slim 3d delandmeter et al 2018 should also be considered as such a discretisation has proved to be very efficient in previous studies of stratified flows burchard and beckers 2004 hofmeister et al 2010 2011 gräwe et al 2015 the vertical discretisation seems to be more important than the horizontal mesh refinement strategy although the use of horizontally anisotropic meshes helps reducing the numerical dissipation by increasing the resolution over the steep slopes of the canyon with a limited computational overhead le bars et al 2016 accurately reproduced the tidal propagation in the estuary with a depth averaged model here we have studied the 3d baroclinic dynamics of this system some of the results obviously differ between the two studies unsurprisingly gravitational currents play a significant role in the net outflow the 2d barotropic model estimated that the net outflow varies by about 1 5 1 0 4 m 3 s due to tides baroclinic model results suggest a larger variability 2 5 1 0 4 m 3 s not shown it suggests that the outflow may reverse and net inflows towards the river can be expected during dry seasons and flood tides the gyres that appeared in the 2d model simulations did not appear with the 3d model since the sensitivity analysis of le bars et al 2016 showed a strong dependence to the bottom friction parametrisation a misrepresentation of the bottom velocity and hence the bottom drag could have led to unrealistic barotropic features as depth averaged velocities are far larger in the 2d model than those predicted near the bottom in the 3d model by modelling the renewing water age we gained insight into the transport timescales of the estuary this slow renewal can be directly related to the hypoxic and anoxic conditions observed the exchange flow traps particles such as particulate organic matter or sediments that mix in the pycnocline these particles flocculate and sink to the bottom waters bacteria feed on particulate organic matter and consume oxygen through respiration due to the abundant source of particulate organic matter the number of bacteria grows since the water column is highly stratified there is little vertical mixing and water renewal is hence very limited pak et al 1984 oxygen is therefore entirely consumed by the respiration of the settling poc the peculiar characteristics of the congo river estuary make it difficult to categorise as illustrated by fig 8 the strongly stratified congo hydrodynamical regime lies between a very pronounced salt wedge and an unconventionally dynamic fjord in their theoretical study of highly stratified estuaries geyer and ralston 2011 doubt the existence of any estuary where the salt wedge would not be significantly affected by tides the congo is almost contradicting this hypothesis the micro tidal environment and the depth of the canyon allow the stratification to remain strong at all times this separation between water masses reduces the mixing with oceanic waters in the bottom layer in the canyon the dynamics of the congo river estuary shares more similarities with fjords such as the decorrelation between the thick bottom layer and the thin surface layer and the high retention of water near the bottom even with a very large discharge the renewing water age exceeds two months at some deep places the congo river estuary therefore appears as a hybrid between a strongly stratified estuary and a hydrodynamic fjord in africa credit authorship contribution

23884,the congo river estuary is characterised by a deep canyon that connects the river to the deep ocean by cutting through the continental shelf its estuary is influenced by high river discharge and micro tidal conditions with a large depth and limited vertical mixing this restricts the supply of oxygen from the surface waters to the more saline bottom waters leading to hypoxic and anoxic zones we study the dynamics of the congo river estuary by applying the multi scale baroclinic coastal ocean model slim 3d www slim ocean be to this topographically challenging environment by allowing a high degree of flexibility in the representation of both the complex geometry and the strong stratification slim 3d is able to simulate riverine tidal and gravitational processes that drive the estuarine circulation model results compare favourably with in situ data in the estuary suggesting that the exchange flow is correctly simulated the latter is characterised by a two layer dynamics the combination of the large river discharge the strong stratification and the large depth results in a moderate freshwater froude number and a very small mixing number it makes the congo river an outlier in state of the art estuarine classifications closer to fjords than salt wedge estuaries furthermore using the age as a diagnosis sheds light on the spatial variability of the estuarine waters ventilation local maximum of renewing water age located just below the pycnocline is exceeded by old dense oceanic waters which stagnate at the bottom of the canyon for more than two months due to the small vertical mixing it helps explain the hypoxic and anoxic conditions observed at the bottom of the submarine canyon keywords congo river to ocean continuum unstructured mesh coastal ocean model renewing water age estuarine classification 1 introduction the congo river is the main african freshwater input into the atlantic ocean with a watershed of 3 7 1 0 6 km 2 and a mean river discharge of about 4 1 0 4 m 3 s second only to the amazon river the congo strongly affects the sea surface salinity in the eastern atlantic ocean vangriesheim et al 2009 pak et al 1984 reported that its plume forms a surface lens that extends 800 km offshore reaching latitude 8 east this large outflow transports a large amount of suspended matter into the atlantic ocean eisma et al 1978 in kinshasa located 300 km upstream of the estuary the total suspended sediment flux reaches 30 7 1 0 6 tons year and approximately 6 of it is particulate organic carbon poc coynel et al 2005 only half of the poc gravitationally settles into the subhalocline water body of the canyon the other half being advected offshore with the surface plume eisma and kalf 1984 hence the congo river plays an important role for the local regional and global carbon fluxes at the land ocean interface despite the importance of the congo river there are very few publications about the hydrodynamics of the congo s estuary and region of freshwater influence rofi hopkins et al 2013 and chao et al 2015 tracked the plume by means of satellite data products the first numerical model of the plume dynamics was set up by denamiel et al 2013 using roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 they studied the impact of topographic features in particular the submarine canyon and variable forcings on the plume movement the model was further used to investigate the influence of the outflow on the sea surface temperature in the near shore region white and toumi 2014 and the relevance of data assimilation in the regional scale modelling of this area phillipson and toumi 2017 2019 as these studies focused on the freshwater plume the computational domains did not include the congo river itself to the best of our knowledge the only numerical study of the whole tidally influenced congo river has been conducted by le bars et al 2016 by means of a depth averaged barotropic model which by construction could not deal with the baroclinic aspects of the flow the deep submarine canyon one of the largest in the world that directly connects the ocean with the lower estuary impacts the plume and shelf dynamics as well as the estuarine circulation the large variations of the water column depth and the steep bathymetry gradients with slopes up to 50 imply that the numerical grid of any numerical model of this region must be designed with care it is desirable that the hydrostatic consistency criterion 1 1 as was argued by deleersnijder 2015 this criterion has little to do with the consistency of the numerical scheme per se and instead is closely related to the accuracy of the discretisation of the horizontal pressure force term haney 1991 be met so as to avoid significant errors in the evaluation of the discrete pressure force requiring the implementation of a flexible horizontal resolution and a suitable vertical coordinate system haney 1991 deleersnijder and beckers 1992 burchard and beckers 2004 hofmeister et al 2010 berntsen 2011 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2016 furthermore the strong stratification inside the estuary requires low numerical dissipation schemes clearly modelling the barotropic and baroclinic circulation along the congo river to sea continuum represents a challenging test case for any numerical model since hansen and rattray 1966 estuarine classification into different regimes has been an active field of study see for example geyer and maccready 2014 and references therein as the discharge and the tides change over time an estuary may switch from one regime to another one as exemplified by the columbia river estuary kärnä and baptista 2016a in many estuaries vertical mixing is mostly driven by the tides the congo river estuary is micro tidal with a tidal range varying between 1 9 m during spring tides and 0 3 m during neap tides at the river mouth near banana see fig 1 for the exact location eisma and van bennekom 1978 in combination with the large depth of the canyon the regime of the congo river estuary is thus expected to be classified as a strongly stratified estuary mostly driven by salinity differences such estuarine feature is often associated with low discharge estuaries or fjords however unlike such small velocity systems the congo estuary is driven by a huge and stable water discharge that produces a large and steady mean river velocity as such it appears as a very peculiar estuary which is likely to be an outlier in estuarine classifications another salient feature of the congo estuary is the presence of vast hypoxic and anoxic zones because of the mineralisation of poc in sinking sediments the dissolved oxygen concentration steadily decreases below the freshwater surface layer this is enhanced by stratification that reduces the vertical mixing below the pycnocline low oxygen zones have been reported in the deep estuary with an oxygen concentration that almost vanishes near the bottom eisma and van bennekom 1978 this has qualitatively been understood but not yet quantified in detail for the congo river van bennekom et al 1978 similar hypoxic conditions are reported for the neuse river paerl et al 1998 or puget sound feely et al 2010 although they exhibit large seasonal variations the goal of this paper is to advance our understanding of the congo river estuarine dynamics by applying the multi scale hydrodynamic model slim 3d 2 2 slim second generation louvain la neuve ice ocean model www slim ocean be to the congo river to sea continuum slim 3d is an unstructured mesh discontinuous galerkin model that is well suited to simulate flows in topographically challenging areas after being compared with field observations the model is used to study the 3d flow structure within this estuary that allows us to assess the importance of tidal mixing and stratification and hence position the congo river in geyer and maccready 2014 s estuarine classification by further coupling the hydrodynamic model with a renewing water age diagnostic tool we can show how the combination of a large depth weak tide and high discharge leads to very slow water renewal at the bottom of the estuary which in turn leads to hypoxic conditions the paper is organised as follows section 2 details the methods and data i e the available in situ observations the numerical model and the diagnostic tools the results are presented in section 3 the model reference run is compared against field data in section 3 1 insights into the estuarine classification resp circulation are provided in section 3 2 resp 3 3 renewing water age theory is applied to the estuary in section 3 4 a schematic oxygen budget is outlined in section 3 5 finally results are discussed in section 4 conclusions are drawn in the same section 2 methods and data 2 1 in situ measurements about thirty years ago eisma 1990 collected data along the congo river canyon fig 1 while navigating measurements of salinity temperature and oxygen were made at different locations represented with white dots in fig 1 and at different depths these data were collected from november 21th 1989 for the upstream river until december 12th 1989 for the oceanic measurements in the estuary measurements were performed from 27 november to 30 november since they were taken along the way the atmospheric and oceanic conditions were not constant during the measurement period the measured estuarine profiles of salinity temperature and oxygen are shown in fig 2 the observed salinity and temperature profiles show the high vertical stratification of the congo river estuary the pycnocline is located at a depth of about 10 m the freshwater layer thickness is almost constant in the whole transect except at the plume lift off near the mouth where the layer is thinner the vertical stratification is strong with salinity differences of 35 1 0 3 within 5 m these observations are consistent with those of spencer et al 2013 who mentioned the presence of very saline water 35 1 0 3 just downstream of malela under a 10 m freshwater surface layer and a plume thickness of about 2 3 m at the mouth with surface salinity near zero the stratification is mostly controlled by salinity differences and seems to be rather insensitive to tidal motions oxygen concentrations show a strong vertical variability with relatively high oxygen concentrations located near the surface and large areas of hypoxia 187 5 mmol o 2 m 3 dashed line in fig 2 and even anoxia 62 5 mmol o 2 m 3 solid line in fig 2 in the bottom layer of the estuary there is a clear similarity between the salinity temperature and oxygen profiles for context fig 3 shows seasonal variations of river discharge at matadi and tidal elevation at banana near the river mouth the analysis period dark grey is in the wet austral summer the river discharge is large throughout the year and varies between 2 and 7 1 0 4 m 3 s december generally features the highest river discharge with a mean value around 5 5 1 0 4 m 3 s fresh water discharge of december 1989 was slightly smaller than the seasonal mean but remains above yearly average values 2 2 model setup the three dimensional hydrodynamics is simulated by means of the baroclinic ocean model slim 3d kärnä et al 2013 delandmeter et al 2015 2018 vallaeys et al 2018 it solves the 3d hydrostatic equations under the boussinesq approximation on an unstructured mesh by means of the discontinuous galerkin dg finite element method blaise et al 2010 slim 3d has recently been used to simulate the thermocline oscillations in lake tanganyika with a vertically adaptive grid delandmeter et al 2018 the coupled estuarine plume dynamics of the columbia river vallaeys et al 2018 and the algal bloom occurrence in lake titicaca duquesne et al 2021 the model is run from 15 august 1989 until 1 january 1990 the model spin up lasts until the analysis starts on 1 november we then compare the simulated results with the observations of eisma 1990 2 2 1 3d baroclinic model the model equations are described in delandmeter et al 2018 they are based on a formulation that preserves tracer consistency white et al 2008 at a discrete level delandmeter et al 2018 such a formulation ensures an accurate coupling between the hydrodynamical and tracer transport modules dg methods scale well on parallel computer platforms thanks to their spatial sparsity they also offer functional flexibility as the model solutions can be discontinuous between mesh elements this is particularly useful for modelling flows in topographically challenging environments in the case of the congo river the sides of the submarine canyon that cut through the continental shelf are so steep that it is almost impossible to achieve a mesh fine enough to represent them accurately as a result the model has to be flexible enough to deal with under resolved topographic features without resorting to unphysical dissipation the dg formulation allows slim 3d to handle strong gradients of bathymetry density and velocity with little numerical dissipation as shown in vallaeys et al 2018 2 2 2 computational domain the domain of interest covers the atlantic ocean near the congo river mouth from 2 s to 10 s and from 8 e to the african west coast at the border between angola and democratic republic of congo drc at approximately 6 s the domain includes the whole tidally influenced congo river from banana at the mouth to matadi about 150 km upstream of it fig 1 the latter area is separated from the capital of drc kinshasa by rapids flowing over about 290 km the water depth ranges from more than 4500 m in the deep ocean to a few metres in the estuary fig 1 the computational bathymetry has been obtained by merging the global data from gebco 2008 monahan 2008 with digitalised nautical charts of the river le bars et al 2016 the bathymetry features of the congo river estuary are shown in fig 1 a deep canyon depth 250 m splits the congo river estuary into two distinct parts the submarine canyon originates from the post rift evolution of the continental margin of west equatorial africa savoye et al 2009 shallow zones depth 20 m are found along both sides of the estuarine canyon with half of the non canyon area shallower than 10 m the estuary is characterised by a number of channels between boma and malela downstream of this region mangroves occupy large shallow areas on each bank as only very little topographical information is available for those areas they are left out of the domain a minimal depth of 3 m is prescribed as wetting and drying processes are not explicitly taken into account as in vallaeys et al 2018 2 2 3 mesh generation owing to the specific nature of the domain of interest rugged bathymetry wide range of characteristic length scales mesh generation is crucial lambrechts et al 2008 clearly the horizontal mesh size must be sufficiently small in the estuary and in the vicinity of the coast and can be significantly larger in the deep ocean then in the region where the bottom slope is the steepest in particular along the sides of the canyon the horizontal mesh resolution must be further enhanced special attention must also be devoted to the determination of the vertical grid size with a finer mesh where vertical gradients of density and velocity are highest near the top surface of the water column inside the estuary for example as in other previous applications of slim 3d we resort to a two stage mesh generation procedure see for example delandmeter et al 2015 first a triangular unstructured surface mesh is generated by means of gmsh http gmsh info geuzaine and remacle 2009 then this mesh is extruded along the vertical direction yielding prismatic elements here we use a hybrid σ z vertical grid with σ levels near the surface and z levels below the transition depth h σ as in vallaeys et al 2018 this type of mesh facilitates the representation of the hydrostatic equilibrium especially with low order discretisations the surface mesh consists of about 1 6 1 0 4 triangles the reference element mesh size of the horizontal triangles is set to the minimum of two linear functions of the distance to the continental and estuarine coastlines the reference mesh size reaches 500 m along the banks of the estuary and 3 km near the other coastlines it further decreases to reach a mesh size of 15 km at 50 km from the coast in the deepest parts of the domain fig 4 next seeking inspiration in haney 1991 deleersnijder and beckers 1992 and legrand et al 2007 a horizontal length characterising the bottom topography is evaluated namely l h h h h where h and h denote the unperturbed height of the water column and the horizontal gradient operator respectively the objective is to further refine the surface mesh in such a way that this length is resolved however this would lead to a significant increase in the number of elements therefore using the method of legrand et al 2007 we generate anisotropic elements whose size is smaller in the direction of the bathymetry gradient than in the orthogonal direction with a maximum mesh size of 300 m the anisotropic mesh has about half the number of elements than an isotropic mesh would have in other words length scale l h is still resolved albeit in a directional manner the surface mesh is finally vertically extruded to form prisms the anisotropic mesh is extruded with h σ 12 m and is made up of 5 σ layers on top of at most 27 z layers the value of h σ has been obtained following a calibration procedure with respect to a high resolution reference solution the 5 uppermost σ levels have a maximal depth of 1 3 5 8 and 12 metres below sea level to increase the near surface resolution as soon as depth exceeds 14 m a number of z levels is added below the σ levels at depths 16 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 60 70 80 90 100 120 150 175 200 250 350 500 700 1000 1300 1700 2300 3000 and 4000 metres below the sea surface vertical movement of the mesh is handled with an ale formulation as is described in delandmeter et al 2018 2 2 4 initial conditions and forcings the system is initially at rest with zero elevation and velocity the salinity is set to s 35 1 0 3 in the ocean and s 0 in the river the initial temperature is a piecewise linear function of depth with a surface temperature of 25 c decreasing to a minimum value of 8 c in the deeper parts of the domain h 500 m for the latter since global products such as mercator or hycom are not available before 1993 we construct a stratified field similar to that of denamiel et al 2013 the river discharge is imposed at matadi the upstream boundary of the domain based on volumetric flow rate measurements made at the inga dam located about 30 km upstream of matadi as can be seen in fig 3 the period sampled by eisma 1990 is marked by a relatively low river outflow about 4 5 1 0 4 m 3 s in comparison to climatological values for december about 5 6 1 0 4 m 3 s only freshwater enters the domain at matadi and the temperature is set to a constant value of 27 c while there are several rivers along the african coast inside the computational domain like the nyanga and kwanza rivers the congo river is the only freshwater input taken into account in the model as its volumetric flow rate is about two orders of magnitude greater than the other rivers at the open ocean boundaries tidal elevation and current from osu topex poseidon global inverse solution tpxo7 2 dataset egbert and erofeeva 2002 are prescribed no global ocean circulation is prescribed at the open boundaries the wind stress is generally small in the region of interest denamiel et al 2013 we impose the air sea flux of momentum with the reanalysis product of ecmwf for the wind speed at 10 m above sea level the air sea heat flux is not taken into account as will be seen later the renewing time of surface waters is quite small hence limiting the impact of heat fluxes on the estuarine hydrodynamics the influence of waves in the estuary is also quite limited because of the large river outflow and the topography of the mouth with the beach barriers almost disconnecting the estuary from the open ocean the estimated net atmospheric water flux over the area of the estuary is insignificant as compared to the river inflow 2 3 renewing water age inspecting fields of primitive variables velocity pressure density etc is not necessarily the best approach to the understanding of transport processes taking place over timescales longer than those related to tides i e subtidal timescales as pointed out above evaluating time and position dependent diagnostic timescales may be conducive to useful interpretations this is mainly because such timescales lead to an integrative holistic view of transport phenomena which is much less affected by small time and space scales of variation than primitive variables see e g the review article by lucas and deleersnijder 2020 in this context inspiration is sought in the generic approach to water renewal developed by gourgue et al 2007 accordingly the water is split into several water types namely the water particles present in the control domain at the initial time the original water and those progressively replacing them which belong to the renewing water and originate from open boundaries the renewing water may be further divided into two components according to whether they come from the upstream boundary river water or equivalently freshwater or the downstream one coastal ocean water at a given time and location the age of the renewing water or one of its components is the time elapsed since leaving the relevant open boundary rayson et al 2016 liu et al 2017 du et al 2018 rutherford and fennel 2018 such ages allow gaining insight into water renewal rates de brye et al 2012 kärnä and baptista 2016b yang et al 2019 in the present study these diagnoses will help clarify the effects of the estuarine circulation on the long term transport and the emergence of hypoxia and anoxia in the estuary the aforementioned ages are evaluated in accordance with the constituent oriented age and residence time theory cart www climate be cart delhez et al 1999 deleersnijder et al 2001 let t and x denote the time and the position vector respectively then subscripts o r i r i v and o c e are introduced so as to identify original river and oceanic waters since it has long been acknowledged that a water type may be regarded as a passive tracer cox 1989 hirst 1999 goosse et al 2001 deleersnijder et al 2002 haine and hall 2002 meier 2005 de brye et al 2012 the concentration of a water type c χ t x obeys advection diffusion equation 1 c χ t h c χ v k h c χ χ o r i r i v o c e where v t x is the water velocity which is divergence free boussinesq approximation and k t x is the diffusivity tensor the latter is symmetric and positive definite its components are the same as in the temperature and salinity equations the age of every water type is a χ α χ c χ where age concentration α χ is the solution of 2 α χ t c χ h α χ v k h α χ χ o r i r i v o c e the first term on the right hand side of eq 2 is related to ageing the age of every water type particle increases at the same pace as time key ingredients for the evaluation of the ages are the definition of the control domain as well as the initial and boundary conditions under which eqs 1 and 2 are to be solved deleersnijder et al 2020 they must be in line with the declared objectives of the diagnostic strategy which consists in diagnosing water renewal in the river and the adjacent coastal zone therefore the control domain is to be smaller than and included in the computational one the control domain s open upstream boundary γ r i v coincides with the riverine boundary of the computational domain which is located at matadi strictly speaking the estuary begins just upstream of malela spencer et al 2013 the impact of setting the upstream boundary at matadi will be discussed in section 3 4 the open oceanic boundary γ o c e is relatively close to the coastline it is located at the mouth of the river and links pointe de bulambemba drc in the north and punta do padrao angola in the south red line in the lower right panel of fig 1 the remainder of the boundary including the water air interface is impermeable and is denoted γ i m p the initial and boundary conditions are laid out in table 1 and are illustrated in fig 5 a zero flux boundary condition is imposed at the impermeable boundaries γ i m p and dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at other boundaries while the open boundary conditions for the age concentration are simply α χ 0 the open boundary conditions for the water mass concentration depend on whether the inflow brings the water mass of interest c χ 1 or not c χ 0 deleersnijder 2019 demonstrated that as expected the water concentrations satisfy inequalities 0 c χ t x 1 in addition the sum of the concentrations under consideration i e the water concentration is equal to unity at any time and location c o r i c r i v c o c e 1 it can also be seen that the l 2 norm of the original water concentration monotonically decreases as time progresses so that c o r i x 0 in other words in the long run the original water is replaced by riverine and oceanic waters which eventually fill the whole domain i e c r i v x c o c e x 1 the riverine and oceanic water ages can be seen to be positive and smaller than the elapsed time which is the least we can expect from such diagnostic timescales the age of the original water is equal to the elapsed time a o r i t x t obviously this result provides no insight into water renewal processes but is a validation element of the present diagnostic strategy finally in accordance with the age averaging hypothesis formulated by deleersnijder et al 2001 we can also aggregate the riverine and oceanic waters yielding the renewing water hereinafter identified by subscript r e n its concentration age concentration and age are c r e n c r i v c o c e α r e n α r i v α o c e and a r e n α r e n c r e n respectively 3 results model results are first compared with the observations collected by eisma 1990 in december 1989 we then discuss the position of the congo river estuary within the estuarine classification of geyer and maccready 2014 and highlight the two layer flow structure we also compute the renewing water age and use it to gain insight into the water renewal timescales of the estuary we finally sketch an oxygen budget for the estuary 3 1 comparison with field data the model results are compared with the observed salinity and temperature vertical profiles model outputs are sampled at the same time stamps as the observations we then merge simulated vertical profiles in a transect view figs 6 and 7 the simulated halocline is similar to the observed one with a freshwater layer thickness ranging from about 15 m at the upstream station to about 5 m at the river mouth fig 6 the strong stratification observed in situ is well captured by the model with a thickness of the brackish water layer of a few metres the sharp transition between water masses shown in the temperature field is also well captured by the model fig 7 in deeper areas the temperature is somewhat overestimated the vertical profiles are nonetheless very similar and vertical gradients of temperature agree between observed and simulated values the temperature bias is likely due to the ocean initial and boundary conditions which might be slightly too warm skill metrics are computed to assess the quality of the simulated temperature and salinity fields see tables a 3 and a 4 correlations between observations and predicted values are high at all stations for the salinity 0 87 and the temperature 0 92 small biases are found in the salinity field because salinity differences in the ocean are small as compared to the temperature differences the predicted salinity values show less variability than in the observations with very small normalised root mean square errors rmse and nmse there is very little information to validate the velocity field in the estuary let us just point out that eisma 1990 reported a velocity of about 2 m s just upstream of malela at the head of the canyon the model simulates a velocity of about 1 5 m s at that location it is noteworthy that the velocity in this region strongly depends on the bathymetry which is not well documented outside of the canyon at the bottom of the canyon shepard and emery 1973 reported current velocities up to 0 16 m s in the up canyon direction and less intense up to 0 11 m s in the down canyon direction to compensate for the outflow of saltwater near the surface the time average was reported to be up canyon which is also simulated with the model fig 9 down canyon strong turbidity currents may abruptly reverse this net upward flow but those cannot be simulated by the present model 3 2 estuarine classification in order to better understand the hydrodynamic regime of the congo river estuary we attempt to position it in the geyer and maccready 2014 diagram which is based on the freshwater froude f r f and mixing m i dimensionless numbers fig 8 the freshwater froude number compares the river flow velocity to the speed of internal waves 3 f r f u r β g s o h where u r q a is the sectionally and tidally averaged river flow velocity β 7 7 1 0 1 is the haline contraction coefficient s o 35 1 0 3 is the maximal ocean salinity at the river mouth h a w is the characteristic depth of the estuary for a section of the congo estuary of area a 2 1 0 5 m 2 and width w 4 1 0 3 m similar to that of the red dot in the inset of fig 1 we obtain u r 0 2 m s and h 50 m the resulting freshwater froude number value f r f 5 5 1 0 2 is comparable to that of other high discharge rivers such as the columbia river kärnä and baptista 2016a the mixing number evaluates the effectiveness of tidal mixing for a stratified estuary 4 m i u 2 ω n 0 h 2 where u 2 c d u t 2 is the bottom stress ω 1 4 1 0 4 s 1 is the dominant m 2 tidal frequency in the congo river estuary and n 0 β g s o h 7 3 1 0 2 s 1 is the buoyancy frequency with an amplitude of the depth averaged tidal velocity u t 0 2 m s and c d 3 1 0 3 the squared friction velocity is u 2 1 0 4 m 2 s 2 which is comparable to values computed by means of the hydrodynamic model the resulting mixing parameter value m i 7 1 0 2 is very small and comparable to that of fjords this is due to the combined effect of a small tidal amplitude signal in this region and the canyon s depth comparable to that of a fjord unlike classical fjords the freshwater froude number is rather large despite the depth of the canyon this is a consequence of the very large river discharge the congo river estuary thus appears as an outlier in the geyer and maccready 2014 estuarine parameter space fig 8 3 3 two layer flow structure the congo river estuary exhibits a very stable stratification as the tides are not strong enough to erode the pycnocline in order to quantify the comparative effects of the tidal and gravitational circulations we compute the different components of the residual salinity transport u s using the vertical profiles of the along channel velocity u u z t and salinity s s z t at a station inside the estuary red dot in fig 1 the total salt transport u s can be expressed as 5 u s u s u s where f represents the deviation from the tidal average f this splitting allows us to evaluate the transport due to the exchange flow as compared to the dispersive tidal salt transport hamilton 1990 the first term on the right hand side of eq 5 represents the advection of the mean salinity profile by the residual velocity field the second term represents the transport due to tides the typical two layer structure of the exchange flow is clearly visible in the transport profiles fig 9 the temporal average is computed over four tidal periods in both spring dashed curves and neap solid curves tidal phases see fig 3 for the time periods the mean value red curves shows that there is a large net seaward transport in the top layer as explained by spencer et al 2013 below it the net salt flux is landward which is typical of strongly stratified estuaries and fjords the transition between the two distinct layers is very sharp but unlike shallow rivers where maximum inflow is near the bottom the landward component is mainly restricted to the top 40 m it is not significant at larger depths appearing more like the circulation in a fjord with a third layer in which the current is slower the tidal effects blue curve have an almost negligible influence on the total transport as in fjords and strongly stratified estuaries the tidal transport is restricted to the pycnocline area overall the flow is mostly baroclinic and gravitational effects dominate the tidal effects the variability of the velocity over a tidal period is shown in fig 10 where the two layer structure of the flow clearly appears in the bottom layer the flood tide increases the landward current but ebbing tides barely change the velocity direction there the top layer seaward velocity also exhibits small tidal variability with small changes of the seaward velocity geyer and ralston 2011 examined the dynamics of strongly stratified estuaries using the two layer theory they split those into two categories salt wedge and fjord the former is characterised by a discharge sufficiently large to recover strong stratification despite tides and comparable thickness between top and bottom layers the stratification in the latter arises from the decorrelation between surface and bottom layer dynamics the depth of fjords is quite large and the top layer is often very thin as compared to the bottom layer tides also have a limited impact on the surface layer dynamics the congo therefore shares many similarities with fjords despite its huge river discharge the turbulent kinetic energy which increases with shear and decreases with stratification controls the vertical mixing the dynamic stability of the water column can thus be investigated with the gradient richardson number r i n 2 m 2 the latter is the ratio of the following parameters the squared brunt vaïsälä buoyancy frequency n 2 g ρ 0 ρ z and the squared shear frequency m 2 u z 2 fig 11 shows profiles of those parameters along the canyon transect as expected both frequencies are higher along the pycnocline where the stratification is strongest as the shear frequency is smaller than the buoyancy frequency in deep areas the gradient richardson number is large in many places except near the pycnocline and the sea surface the resulting vertical turbulent diffusivity is therefore very small throughout the deep water column it mainly becomes significant in shallower regions at the head of the canyon 3 4 renewing water age we study the renewing of the estuarine water and differentiate water masses originating from the ocean and the river renewing water age is simulated for the same time period as the hydrodynamics the surface renewing water age is shown in fig 12 the riverine waters rapidly flows out of the river when leaving matadi reaching boma in about 12 hours and malela in about 1 day they eventually enter the ocean after about 1 5 days upstream of the canyon there is little variability of the surface freshwater age across the channel however over the canyon bottom friction is reduced and combined with the gravitational current surface waters tend to accelerate as a result lateral variability grows with a smaller age over the canyon and larger values in the vicinity of the river banks leading to a parabolic like age profile as the water column is well mixed in the upstream part of the river age estimates are in good agreement with the barotropic estimates of le bars et al 2016 the depth averaged renewing water age near boma was estimated to be less than one day with the 2d model whereas surface water age computed with the 3d model is about 12 hours density driven currents tend to accelerate surface waters leading to smaller ages in the estuary estimates vary more significantly the barotropic model showed a strong deceleration near the mouth with a transition of river water age from 2 days at malela to more than 10 days at banana in the 3d model the water age shows that water accelerates at the surface reaching the river mouth in less than 1 5 days of course the oceanic water age sharply increases in the bottom layer and hence partly compensates these differences however in the estuary the 3d baroclinic model clearly provides a better picture of the water age as there is a strong vertical variability over the water column over the water column the riverine waters are mainly present in the top layers with a riverine water concentration c r i v 0 99 in the top 5 m of the water column of the estuary and c r i v 0 01 below 15 m not shown the oceanic waters slowly fill the bottom layer in between brackish waters result from the mixing of those two water masses the renewing water age in the top 15 metres is shown in fig 13 top panel near the pycnocline the structure is similar to that observed in other stratified estuaries kärnä and baptista 2016b the renewing water age is small a 2 days in this top layer where freshwater is mostly present c r i v c o c e the age is also small near the open ocean boundary just below the pycnocline 8 m where oceanic waters are mostly present c o c e c r i v between those two layers brackish waters are trapped by the strong mixing and the renewing water age increases a 3 days it is noteworthy that the riverine water age is computed since leaving matadi while the congo river estuary is defined as starting just upstream of malela the time spent by the riverine water inside the estuary itself is thus smaller by approximatively 1 day yet this aforementioned local age maximum is not the global maximal value over the water column as the maximum salinity inflow is located far from the bottom in the case of the congo due the significant depth of the estuary there is an inflow of older water in deeper areas where shear stress and hence mixing is reduced near the bottom of the canyon there is therefore no trace of riverine water the renewing water age coincides with the oceanic water age and grows with depth fig 13 bottom panel it exceeds two months at some places the dense oceanic water masses with a low dissolved oxygen concentration enter with the gravitational circulation and stagnate in the deep estuary like in a fjord these water masses do not mix with the lighter riverine water masses the long renewal time during which waters originating from the eastern equatorial oxygen minimum zone enter the deeper parts of the canyon combined with the degradation of riverine organic material presumably cause the formation of areas with very low oxygen concentrations the locations of the renewing water age maxima seem to correspond with the observed oxygen minima the head of the canyon is characterised by an abrupt halt of the oceanic water intrusion not shown at malela there is an abrupt transition between the outer deep and the inner shallow parts of the estuary dupra et al 2001 with the steep transition to shallow areas and the large river discharge the oceanic waters are blocked only riverine freshwater fills the inner estuary the salinity intrusion length is therefore very stable over time 3 5 schematic oxygen budget oxygen in the estuarine canyon below the freshwater layer is increasingly depleted with depth reaching almost zero near the bottom fig 2 this is due to i aerobic respiration of particulate organic carbon poc that is flushed from the upstream congo river and gravitationally settles into the deeper layers once it arrives at the estuary ii strong density stratification restricting vertical mixing of atmospheric oxygen into deeper layers and iii advection of oxygen depleted oceanic waters into the estuarine canyon here we estimate the role of poc remineralisation for the estuarine canyon s oxygen and carbon balance with a 3 box model in a simplified geometry fig 14 where a shallow oxygenated upper layer of constant depth 10 m lies on top of a deoxygenated lower layer whose depth increases with the distance to the upstream boundary from the vertical structure of oxygen measurements fig 2 and simulated ocean water renewal times fig 13 the deoxygenated area can be subdivided into an upper and a lower zone the upper deoxygenated zone is characterised by a relatively fast exchange of water with the upper ocean and a strong input of poc the lower anoxic zone exchanges more slowly with the corresponding deep ocean water poc which is not remineralised within the upper canyon reaches this zone and its labile fraction can be partly remineralised there with provision of less oxygen both deoxygenated zones are separated at 50 m depth the volume of the estuarine canyon is 1 0 10 m 3 from approximate length scales width w 2 km length l 25 km and mean depth h 200 m the upper and lower deoxygenated zones water renewal times are r 1 5 4 days and r 2 47 7 days respectively they are calculated as volume weighted averages of the simulated high resolution water age distribution the oxygen concentrations of the upper o 2 1 0 189 mol m 3 and lower o 2 2 0 085 mol m 3 oceanic renewal waters are calculated as vertical averages from an oxygen profile at a station 121 km downstream of the upper end of the estuary eisma 1990 the lower oceanic waters originate in the eastern equatorial oxygen minimum zone karstensen et al 2008 the oxygen budget in the upper deoxygenated layer is given by the net influx of o 2 f ox1 from the inflowing oceanic waters during the renewal time r 1 and by the concurrent loss of oxygen due to remineralisation of labile poc settling from surface oxygenated layer the poc remineralisation rate f remi1 is equivalent to the oxygen consumption as the stoichiometric ratio of oxygen o 2 consumption to organic carbon labile poc consumption is 1 paulmier et al 2009 pelagic remineralisation is computed as the difference between oxygen advected with ocean water and oxygen observed in situ exchange of oxygen with the surface layer is not taken into account because it is largely prevented by the halocline for the lower deoxygenated layer we assume the corresponding fluxes the carbon budget in the upper deoxygenated layer is given by the amount of labile poc settling from the oxygenated layer f in1 and its loss due to remineralisation while settling f remi1 according to eisma and kalf 1984 half of the congo river s poc flux settles into the deeper part of the estuary the other half being advected offshore with the surface current this value of 50 is consistent with the results from a recent study on trace elements originating from the congo river vieira et al 2020 we therefore take f in1 as the labile fraction of f riv 2 the carbon budget in the lower deoxygenated layer is given by the amount of labile poc settling from the upper deoxygenated layer f in2 and its loss due to remineralisation while settling f remi2 the riverine poc flux f riv calculated as the product of discharge and poc concentration deviates from the annual average by less than 2 during the seasonal low and high water periods according to monthly measurements at a station near brazzaville kinshasa about 300 km upstream of the estuary coynel et al 2005 river suspension apparently becomes diluted with discharge we assume no change in water discharge from kinshasa to the river mouth and therefore use the annual average given by coynel et al 2005 for the poc concentration they report an annual average of 1 7 mg c l 1 which is significantly higher than the 1 1 mg c l 1 reported as average by cadée 1984 for the estuarine freshwater this indicates a loss of poc due to sedimentation within the river between kinshasa and the river mouth we therefore use the poc concentration of 1 1 mg c l 1 0 092 mol c m 3 from cadée 1984 only a fraction of poc is labile i e susceptible to remineralisation this fraction has been estimated as 22 46 for rivers with total suspended solids tss 150 mg l 1 e g 20 25 for the ganges brahmaputra indus and orinoco rivers by ittekott 1988 for the congo river we expect values towards the lower end of that range due to the river s comparatively low tss annual average 26 mg l 1 coynel et al 2005 which is predominantly 80 in the fine fraction 63 microns with its poc originating from relatively degraded soil organic matter spencer et al 2012 the carbon and oxygen budget for the subhalocline layer of the canyon critically depends on the ocean water s oxygen concentration and renewal time the amount of organic matter entering the anaerobic zone and this material s labile fraction the mean renewal time 27 3 days compares reasonably well with the 20 days estimate derived from earlier bottom water current measurements of shepard and emery 1973 by van bennekom et al 1978 varying the values of renewal times by 10 results in remineralisation ratios of 60 8 73 5 this interval includes the standard ratio with the model based renewal times of 67 in narrow limits organic matter fluxes are well documented the labile fraction can be estimated within reasonable limits assuming a labile fraction of 30 the remineralisation consumes 67 of the labile component of the total settling poc or 33 5 of the labile component of the total river poc flux to draw oxygen down to the observed levels in both deoxygenated zones if the labile fraction were 25 instead the same oxygen drawdown would result from remineralisation of 80 of the labile component of the total settling poc or 40 of the labile component of total river poc flux in other words a reduction of the congo s poc flux by more than 33 of its present value e g due to reservoir construction for the grand inga hydroelectric project could initiate re oxygenation of the subhalocline water body towards aerobic conditions 4 discussion and conclusion setting up a 3d baroclinic model of the congo river estuary is very challenging because of the steep bathymetry profile with slopes up to 50 along the submarine canyon by combining a discontinuous galerkin formulation an anisotropic horizontal mesh and σ z vertical discretisation we managed to represent both the geometry and the model variables despite these strong gradients the vertical and horizontal discretisations have to be carefully selected in order to correctly reproduce the circulation within the canyon preliminary attempts confirmed that σ layers are not well suited to approximate steep bathymetry profiles we therefore only used σ layers in the top 12 metres and z layers underneath the recent implementation of a vertically adaptive mesh in slim 3d delandmeter et al 2018 should also be considered as such a discretisation has proved to be very efficient in previous studies of stratified flows burchard and beckers 2004 hofmeister et al 2010 2011 gräwe et al 2015 the vertical discretisation seems to be more important than the horizontal mesh refinement strategy although the use of horizontally anisotropic meshes helps reducing the numerical dissipation by increasing the resolution over the steep slopes of the canyon with a limited computational overhead le bars et al 2016 accurately reproduced the tidal propagation in the estuary with a depth averaged model here we have studied the 3d baroclinic dynamics of this system some of the results obviously differ between the two studies unsurprisingly gravitational currents play a significant role in the net outflow the 2d barotropic model estimated that the net outflow varies by about 1 5 1 0 4 m 3 s due to tides baroclinic model results suggest a larger variability 2 5 1 0 4 m 3 s not shown it suggests that the outflow may reverse and net inflows towards the river can be expected during dry seasons and flood tides the gyres that appeared in the 2d model simulations did not appear with the 3d model since the sensitivity analysis of le bars et al 2016 showed a strong dependence to the bottom friction parametrisation a misrepresentation of the bottom velocity and hence the bottom drag could have led to unrealistic barotropic features as depth averaged velocities are far larger in the 2d model than those predicted near the bottom in the 3d model by modelling the renewing water age we gained insight into the transport timescales of the estuary this slow renewal can be directly related to the hypoxic and anoxic conditions observed the exchange flow traps particles such as particulate organic matter or sediments that mix in the pycnocline these particles flocculate and sink to the bottom waters bacteria feed on particulate organic matter and consume oxygen through respiration due to the abundant source of particulate organic matter the number of bacteria grows since the water column is highly stratified there is little vertical mixing and water renewal is hence very limited pak et al 1984 oxygen is therefore entirely consumed by the respiration of the settling poc the peculiar characteristics of the congo river estuary make it difficult to categorise as illustrated by fig 8 the strongly stratified congo hydrodynamical regime lies between a very pronounced salt wedge and an unconventionally dynamic fjord in their theoretical study of highly stratified estuaries geyer and ralston 2011 doubt the existence of any estuary where the salt wedge would not be significantly affected by tides the congo is almost contradicting this hypothesis the micro tidal environment and the depth of the canyon allow the stratification to remain strong at all times this separation between water masses reduces the mixing with oceanic waters in the bottom layer in the canyon the dynamics of the congo river estuary shares more similarities with fjords such as the decorrelation between the thick bottom layer and the thin surface layer and the high retention of water near the bottom even with a very large discharge the renewing water age exceeds two months at some deep places the congo river estuary therefore appears as a hybrid between a strongly stratified estuary and a hydrodynamic fjord in africa credit authorship contribution
