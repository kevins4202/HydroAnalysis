4300,soluble reactive phosphorus srp in urban runoff can contribute to eutrophication of downstream water bodies bioretention systems a popular low impact development lid practice have the potential to reduce srp loads in urban runoff in this study six field scale bioretention systems located in southern ontario canada with different soil media compositions were monitored to evaluate their performance with respect to srp retention and to identify the geochemical processes influencing srp behaviour within the systems the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil media were analysed to compare the systems as well as to assess whether the installed soil media compositions met the lid bioretention design guidelines to examine how srp evolves as stormwater infiltrates through the different media porewater was collected from multiple depths within the bioretention systems the geochemical processes controlling srp retention release were identified by chemical analysis of the porewater and selective solid phase extractions the geochemical processes governing srp behaviour differed between the bioretention systems with processes validated via one dimensional reactive transport simulations conducted in phreeqc results indicate 1 soil media characteristics are highly variable between systems despite the systems having the same overall engineering design specifications 2 porewater srp does not evolve uniformly with depth indicating the importance of overall system design including redox conditions infiltration rate and vertical layering of different materials e g surface cover layer and bioretention media 3 srp retention release processes often occur at shallow depth 0 1 m and more attention is needed to assess the impact of different surface cover layers used in field installations 4 hydraulic conductivity controls the residence time of water in the systems which in turn influences srp retention release 5 srp adsorption onto al and or fe oxides is the main retention mechanism in systems with high hydraulic conductivity while ca phosphate mineral precipitation may be important in systems with low hydraulic conductivity the study findings provide insights needed to improve the field performance of bioretention systems in retaining srp including the testing and application of soil media amendments for enhancing srp retention keywords nutrients low impact development stormwater management water quality reactive processes 1 introduction eutrophication of freshwaters driven by excessive nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus p inputs has detrimental economic and environmental consequences paerl et al 2016 watson et al 2016 p is generally the limiting nutrient in freshwaters as soluble reactive phosphorus srp is the bioavailable form of p that is taken up by plants and microorganisms thus leading to eutrophication srp is of one of the key concerns for water quality impairment urban runoff can contribute high srp loads to downstream water bodies li and davis 2016 shrestha et al 2018 with srp sources in urban runoff including naturally occurring labile soil p and atmospheric deposition as well as sources associated with human activities such as fertilizer application waste disposal and detergent use hsieh et al 2007 kandel et al 2017 effective urban stormwater management is critical for protection of downstream environments particularly with urban runoff volume and associated anthropogenic pollutant loads including srp loads increasing as urbanization intensifies and expands bratieres et al 2008 line and white 2007 to reduce stress on downstream environments low impact development lid stormwater management practices such as vegetated filter strips permeable pavement perforated pipe systems green roofs and bioretention systems have become popular ahiablame et al 2012 dietz 2007 among these practices bioretention systems fig 1 are increasingly installed due to their economic feasibility combined with potential for stormwater attenuation and pollutant control roy poirier et al 2010 pollutants are removed in bioretention systems via multiple physical chemical and biological processes such as sedimentation filtration ion exchange precipitation adsorption plant microorganism uptake and biodegradation feng et al 2012 liu et al 2014 shrestha et al 2018 tirpak et al 2021 for srp the main biogeochemical processes governing its behaviour within bioretention systems include 1 adsorption desorption onto fe and al oxides or clay and calcium minerals 2 organic p mineralization 3 precipitation dissolution of ca phosphate minerals e g hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh and tricalcium phosphate ca3 po4 2 and 4 precipitation dissolution of secondary minerals e g strengite fepo4 2h2o and vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o fig 1 liu and davis 2014 roy poirier et al 2010 the complex interactions between the infiltrating water and soil media governs srp retention within a bioretention system bioretention systems have been shown to be efficient in attenuating a wide range of pollutants including total suspended solids tss heavy metals total kjeldahl nitrogen and organic matter bratieres et al 2008 davis et al 2001 diblasi et al 2009 khan et al 2012 muthanna et al 2007 however highly variable performance of bioretention system with respect to p including srp retention has been observed in prior laboratory ding et al 2019 lucas and greenway 2011 palmer et al 2013 paus et al 2014 poor et al 2018 poor and kube 2019 and field studies brown and hunt iii 2011 goor et al 2021 hunt et al 2006 kandel et al 2017 komlos and traver 2012 mangangka et al 2015 passeport et al 2009 for instance while the field study of komlos and traver 2012 showed high sustained over 9 years srp removal 90 poor srp retention has been observed a number of field studies with some studies reporting net release of total phosphorus and or srp from the soil media brown and hunt iii 2011 goor et al 2021 mullane et al 2015 the variable performance of bioretention systems with respect to srp retention is partially due to the different characteristics of the soil media used between studies resulting in different biogeochemical processes controlling srp retention hunt et al 2012 for instance studies have shown that compost which is added to some systems to support plant growth and increase the water holding capacity of the soil media can act as a sustained source of p due to processes including organic matter mineralization mullane et al 2015 paus et al 2014 in contrast soil media with high content of al fe and ca low p index and high cation exchange capacity is generally found to have high srp retention marvin et al 2020 this is why soil media with added fe and al oxides and ca rich amendments have been found to be effective in retaining srp in bioretention systems lucas and greenway 2011 o neill and davis 2012 poor et al 2019 shrestha et al 2018 in addition to the soil media composition other factors such as ph redox condition residence time and media particle size distribution also affect srp retention in bioretention systems for example srp retention in fe and al rich media has been found to be less sensitive to the water residence time in the bioretention system compared with ca rich media as adsorption desorption processes are fast compared to ca phosphate mineral precipitation klimeski et al 2014 lyngsie et al 2015 penn et al 2017 srp adsorption onto fe and al oxides tends to be greatest at near neutral conditions with srp desorbing as the ph becomes more alkaline marvin et al 2020 in contrast ca rich media may release srp at low ph conditions due to the increased solubility of ca phosphate minerals stevenson and cole 1999 further the redox conditions are important for srp retention in fe rich media as a switch from oxidizing to reducing conditions can trigger reductive dissolution of fe oxides and the release of srp leader et al 2008 shrestha et al 2018 as mentioned above the findings from laboratory and field studies are highly variable with respect to p including srp retention in bioretention media davis 2007 hunt et al 2008 kandel et al 2017 sharkey and hunt 2005 shilton et al 2006 as prior field studies have generally only conducted influent effluent sampling with the bioretention systems treated as a black box goor et al 2021 marvin et al 2020 spraakman et al 2020 these studies often provide limited understanding of the underlying geochemical processes governing p retention release within the system this makes it challenging to broadly apply and compare the findings with other bioretention systems with different overall designs and soil media compositions while some laboratory column studies provide strong insight into the geochemical processes governing srp retention release ádám et al 2007 chahal et al 2016 ding et al 2019 paus et al 2014 conditions are considerably more complex in the field for instance runoff composition srp concentration redox potential and ph soil media properties hydraulic conductivity particle size distribution media age and chemical composition and environmental factors temperature precipitation depth and freeze thaw cycles change over different time scales for field scale bioretention systems all these factors can considerably affect the factors and processes governing srp behaviour and subsequently srp retention in a field scale bioretention system marvin et al 2020 shrestha et al 2018 with an increasing number of studies focused on evaluating as well as enhancing the performance of bioretention systems to retain srp there is a need to systematically investigate the processes governing srp retention within field scale bioretention systems these insights are needed to provide fundamental understanding that can be applied to guide selection of appropriate soil media compositions and improve overall system design for enhancing srp retention in this study investigations were conducted on six existing field scale bioretention systems in ontario canada to evaluate the processes governing srp behaviour within the systems the specific study objectives were to 1 characterize and compare the physical and chemical composition of the soil media including the surface cover layer used in the bioretention systems 2 evaluate the spatial variability of srp within the bioretention systems and 3 identify the major geochemical processes governing srp behaviour within the systems and what factors influence these processes to identify the processes governing srp retention within the bioretention systems data for the six field scale bioretention systems were analysed with the data for three systems simulated using a one dimensional reactive transport model developed in phreeqc v3 parkhurst and appelo 2015 2 material and methods 2 1 site description six bioretention systems in southern ontario canada were selected as study sites these systems are herein referred to as oakridge waterloo dorchester black creek kennedy and dundas fig 2 the bioretention systems were designed according to a lid stormwater management planning and design guide credit valley conservation authority and toronto and region conservation authority 2010 that was widely used by practitioners across ontario the characteristics of the bioretention systems including areal size installation year surface cover layer type e g mulch stone soil media depth and specific chemical and physical characteristics of soil media are provided in table 1 note that all bioretention systems have an underdrain except black creek the soil media of all bioretention systems were designed and specified to have a composition of 85 sand 8 12 soil fines and 3 5 organic matter by dry weight following the lid design guidelines credit valley conservation authority and toronto and region conservation authority 2010 no fe al or ca rich amendments were added to the soil media further most bioretention systems have a surface cover layer approximate depth of 7 5 10 cm that overlies the soil media clear stone cs was used as the surface cover layer for waterloo and kennedy and shredded hardwood bark shwb was used for oakridge black creek and dundas there is no surface cover layer named na hereafter for dorchester table 1 the bioretention systems were designed for water quantity control post development runoff controlled to pre development runoff for 2 to 100 year storm events and to meet the normal water quality control standards for stormwater management facilities in ontario 80 total suspended solids tss removal 2 2 field measurements and sample collection field investigations including water sampling and sediment core collection were completed from may to october 2019 for the six bioretention systems road runoff ponded water water ponded on the surface of the bioretention system during and immediately following a precipitation event and pore water were sampled during ten precipitation events over this period sampling was also conducted three times during dry conditions to sample the stagnant porewater in the bioretention systems effluent samples were not collected as there was no safe way to access to the underdrain or site owner permission was not provided to sample from the underdrain in each bioretention system two vertical profiles of macrorhizon samplers were permanently installed at four different depths to collect porewater samples the sampling profile near the road curb cut inlet to the bioretention system is herein referred to as upstream while the sampling profile farther from the inlet is referred to as downstream to collect porewater an acid washed syringe was connected to each macrorhizon sampler and a retainer was used to maintain suction over a period of 12 24 h as the porewater was collected in this way the porewater was extracted and temporarily stored in the syringes volume of 10 60 ml the road runoff ponded water and porewater samples were filtered 0 45 µm cellulose acetate in the field stored in acid washed bottles and taken immediately to the laboratory for chemical analysis two sediment cores were collected from each bioretention system to characterize the physical and chemical sediment properties at different depths sediment cores were collected from just below the stone cover layer at waterloo and kennedy sediment cores were collected using a stainless steel corer 2 inch diameter that was pushed vertically down into the sediments to a target depth and then pulled up manually the sediment cores were immediately sealed with a plastic membrane to prevent water evaporation and placed horizontally to reduce water movement through the core the sediment core was sliced into pieces with 2 5 cm intervals and stored in a refrigerator 4 c until physical and chemical analyses were performed finally guelph permeameter tests were conducted following standard procedures bagarello and giordano 1999 at multiple spatial locations across each bioretention system to measure the vertical hydraulic conductivity 2 3 water sample analysis the ph oxidation reduction potential orp and electrical conductivity ec of road runoff ponded water and porewater samples were measured after sample collection using an accumet ab 200 ph orp probe and ec probe respectively the ph orp and ec probes were calibrated before each sampling event the filtered water samples were analysed for srp using a lachat quikchem 8500 flow injection analyser fia method 10 115 01 1 m cations including fe al and ca were analysed via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy vista pro ccd simultaneous icp oes for quality control standards and duplicates were run every ten samples for the srp fe al and ca analyses based on the duplicate analysis the overall accuracy of the srp and cation concentrations were determined to be higher than 95 and 98 respectively 2 4 sediment analysis approximately 250 g of oven dried 105 c for 24 h sediment collected from the top of the sediment core 7 5 cm depth and deeper 7 5 cm depth in the core of each bioretention system was sieved to obtain a particle size distribution ontario ministry of transportation test method ls 602 note that for waterloo kennedy and dorchester the top sediment sample represented the top of the soil media layer as the clear stone was not sampled for waterloo and kennedy whereas for the other bioretention systems this sample was from the surface cover layer shwb organic content was also measured using the loss on ignition standard method heiri et al 2001 for this method approximately 25 g sediment was dried at 105 c for 24 h to remove all residual water the dried sediment was then weighed before heating at 550 c for 4 h the sediment samples were weighed after cooling to calculate the mass of organic content sequential p extraction of sediment samples was conducted to determine the fractions of inorganic p ip in the sediment hedley et al 1982 tiessen and moir 1993 a modified three step extraction adapted from hedley et al 1982 was performed using the following extractants 1 deionized water 2 0 1 m naoh solution and 3 1 m hcl solution the fractions extracted from each of these steps are operationally defined based on the extractant used the first extraction step is thought to extract loosely bound inorganic p fractions h2o ip the second step is thought to extract al and fe bound inorganic p including inorganic p bounded to fe and al oxides named naoh ip the third extraction step extracts residual inorganic p named hcl ip which includes inorganic p associated with ca bound minerals but may also include fe and al bound inorganic p not released in the naoh extraction step it is important to note that recent studies suggest caution is required in interpreting the results from the hedley method and its modified versions hedley et al 1982 tiessen and moir 1993 this is because discrete p forms e g fe bound ca bound are not precisely quantified by individual steps but rather p can be co released from multiple mineral phases within a given step barrow et al 2021 gu and margenot 2020 klotzbücher et al 2019 this limitation is considered in our interpretation of the data to extract h2o ip 2 g of dry sediment and 60 ml deionized water were placed in a centrifuge bottle and shaken for 16 h this mixture was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered 0 45 µm and stored for chemical analysis for the subsequent two steps the residual sediment was mixed with 60 ml 0 1 m naoh solution to extract naoh ip and then with 60 ml 1 0 m hcl solution to extract residual inorganic p hcl ip and the mixture was shaken centrifuged and filtered using the same procedure used for the first step all extracted solutions were diluted and run on the fia within 48 h for inorganic p srp analysis 2 5 one dimensional reactive transport model a one dimensional transport model which considers the main reactions controlling srp was developed in phreeqc v3 parkhurst and appelo 2015 to simulate the srp concentrations in the oakridge kennedy and dundas systems the model was used to simulate these three bioretention systems as the data indicate that srp in these systems may be governed by distinctively different processes the model considers thermodynamic aqueous speciation reactions precipitation dissolution reactions surface complexation reactions adsorption of srp to mineral surfaces and one dimensional transport the specific reactions considered in each of the models used to simulate the bioretention systems varied based on our field data analysis see table 2 for reactions considered one dimensional transport considering steady advection diffusion and dispersion was simulated with the model domain for each simulation based on the depth of the soil media the sediments were assumed to be saturated with continuous inflow to the top model boundary and free drainage from the bottom model boundary the advective velocity was calculated by multiplying the measured sediment hydraulic conductivity by a measured hydraulic gradient for each bioretention system table 2 the chemistry of ponded water e g ph eh concentrations of al ca fe k mg mn na and srp for each bioretention system was used to specify the chemical composition of the water entering the top model boundary the initial conditions in the model domain were specified using the porewater chemistry measured for the deepest sampling location in each bioretention system for each time step the aqueous solution in each model cell was speciated using thermodynamic constants in the phreeqc database minteq v4 parkhurst and appelo 2015 mineral phases that influence srp mobility including ferrihydrite fe oh 3 and gibbsite al oh 3 were also allowed to dissolve or precipitate by assigning a saturation index for each mineral phase the diffuse double layer ddl model dzombak and morel 1990 was used to simulate surface complexation adsorption desorption of srp to ferrihydrite or gibbsite see table 2 for parameter values used whether ferrihydrite or gibbsite was selected as the mineral surface for surface complexation adsorption desorption for a given model was based on the measured al or fe porewater concentrations if al porewater concentrations varied more than fe concentrations with depth as occurred for oakridge it was assumed that srp complexation to gibbsite had more control on the srp variations with depth compared to complexation to ferrihydrite vice versa applied if fe porewater concentrations varied more than al concentrations finally irreversible chemical reactions including organic matter degradation via fe reduction were simulated by specifying a given amount of moles to react per time step each model was run for a simulation time of 100 days at which time steady state conditions with respect to the porewater chemistry was reached the model does not consider porewater trapped in the dead pore spaces and preferential flow in the media further details on the model set up including the initial conditions transport parameters and reactions used to simulate each bioretention system are provided in table 2 2 6 statistical analyses statistical analyses were conducted to compare the ph ec orp porewater srp and sediment extraction data between systems a t test was performed if the data were normal or log normal otherwise the wilcoxon signed rank test was applied a criterion of 95 α 0 05 confidence was used to test for significance all statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics version 21 brosius 2013 each sampling event was considered as a replicate for the statistical analyses 3 results 3 1 properties of bioretention media the particle size distributions of the soil media are considerably different between the bioretention systems despite all systems having the same design guidelines 85 sand 8 12 soil fines and 3 5 organic matter by dry weight the measured particle size distribution of the soil media for each bioretention system are shown in fig 3 with a summary provided in table 1 the soil media has a well distributed particle size for oakridge black creek and dundas whereas waterloo has a high percentage of medium sand and dorchester and kennedy have a high percentage of fine sand fig 3 for waterloo dorchester and kennedy the top sediment 7 5 cm depth and lower sediment 7 5 cm depth have similar particle size distributions as both the top and lower sediments are the soil media itself in contrast the top sediment and lower sediment have different particle size distributions for oakridge black creek and dundas because for these systems the top sediment sample represents the surface shwb cover layer fig 3 the top sediment for oakridge and black creek has a high medium sand content and for dundas has a well distributed particle size due to the differences in particle size distribution and presence absence of a surface cover layer between the systems the hydraulic conductivity of the top 15 cm sediments varies greatly between systems fig 4 a the measured hydraulic conductivity of oakridge waterloo and black creek was around 2 6 m d which is within the range of the lid design guide 0 6 7 2 m d whereas dorchester 0 34 m d kennedy 0 1 m d and dundas 0 1 m d have a much lower hydraulic conductivity than that recommended by the lid design guide in addition to the different physical characteristics the organic content of the sediment also differs between the systems fig 4b fig s1 the organic content of the soil media for different systems ranges from 2 5 to 9 5 for oakridge black creek and dundas the organic content of the surface cover layer top sediment is considerable higher 45 36 and 15 respectively compared to the underlying soil media 4 5 2 8 and 9 5 respectively fig 4b due to the high organic matter in the shwb surface cover 3 2 porewater physicochemical conditions the physicochemical parameters ph orp and ec of the ponded water and porewater in the bioretention systems are shown in fig 5 the ponded water chemistry rather than road runoff chemistry are compared with the porewater as the ponded water is the integrated endmember for water infiltrating into the bioretention systems over a precipitation event generally the ph of the ponded water is below 7 for all bioretention systems and the ponded water ph is significantly lower than the porewater within each bioretention systems considering all sampling events p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test kennedy has the highest ph difference 1 ph unit between the ponded water and porewater resulting primarily from a sharp increase in ph at shallow depth top 7 5 cm with the ph decreasing slightly with depth after this initial increase fig s2 the ph also increases at shallow depth in the other bioretention systems with the porewater ph then generally decreasing with depth in oakridge and waterloo increasing with depth for black creek and being variable with depth for dorchester and dundas fig s2 the orp of the ponded water is above 200 mv for all bioretention systems indicating that oxidized water infiltrates into the bioretention systems fig 5 considering all sampling events the ponded water orp is significantly higher than the porewater orp p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test for each system with conditions become less oxidizing with depth black creek is the only system where this does not occur and the mean porewater orp is higher than the mean ponded water orp 324 mv and 206 mv respectively this may have been caused by high labile organic debris on the surface of the black creek system the orp porewater depth profiles indicate oxidizing conditions at all depths for all bioretention systems it is important to note that the mean porewater orp is lower in kennedy 145 mv compared to all other systems 180 mv fig 5 fig s3 this may be associated with the low hydraulic conductivity of the media in the kennedy system with the specific mechanisms responsible for this lower orp explored in section 4 1 2 below the ponded water ec is 100 µs cm for oakridge waterloo black creek and dorchester but is 350 µs cm for kennedy and dundas the higher ec in the ponded water for kennedy and dundas may be due to longer surface water ponding time caused by the lower hydraulic conductivity and thus infiltration rate of these systems compared to the other systems fig 3 the mean porewater ec is significantly higher than the ponded water ec for each system considering all sampling events p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test this is attributed to the leaching of solutes as the infiltrating water interacts with the sediment as well as residual high salt content in the media due to winter de icing road salt nacl application in all bioretention systems the porewater ec increases with depth indicating continual net leaching along the infiltration flow path fig s4 the mean porewater ec is significantly lower for oakridge waterloo black creek and dorchester 476 153 332 117 292 36 and 636 248 µs cm respectively compared with kennedy and dundas 3326 1095 and 2018 884 µs cm respectively p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test again this may be due to the lower hydraulic conductivity for the kennedy and dundas systems which provides longer residence times for aqueous solid phase interactions and thus for mineral dissolution alternatively the elevated porewater ec may be due to the lower hydraulic conductivity of these systems causing slow flushing of high winter de icing road salt from the systems over the spring and summer including over the sampling period 3 3 porewater srp the mean srp concentrations in the ponded water and porewater for the six bioretention systems are shown in fig 6 the mean ponded water srp is 99 56 85 104 162 119 41 35 46 6 and 43 35 µg l for oakridge waterloo black creek dorchester kennedy and dundas respectively there is no significant difference in the ponded water srp concentrations between the bioretention systems p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test the mean ponded water srp concentrations are 1 2 4 3 folds higher than the mean porewater srp concentrations for all sites except kennedy where the porewater srp concentration is about two orders of magnitude higher than the ponded water srp 3775 2397 and 46 6 µg l for porewater and ponded water respectively the mean porewater srp for other sites are below 100 µg l with the mean porewater srp ranging from 32 19 µg l for dorchester to 73 64 µg l for waterloo the srp vertical profiles are similar between precipitation events and also between precipitation events and dry non event conditions fig s5 therefore to illustrate the general trends in srp concentrations with depth for each bioretention system the mean srp concentration at each sampling point considering all sampling events is presented in fig 7 importantly the porewater srp concentrations do not consistently decrease with increasing depth for most of the bioretention systems for example for oakridge downstream the mean srp concentration decreases near the surface 0 7 5 cm from 100 to 40 µg l but increases at mid depth 50 cm to 80 µg l this may be caused by a change of geochemical conditions at this depth or alternatively due to local sediment heterogeneity such as organic matter not been well mixed in the media fig 7a for some systems such as dorchester upstream and waterloo downstream the srp decreases near the surface and then increases with depth in the media layer fig 7b d even within the same system the srp concentration trends with depth varies between upstream and downstream profile locations e g waterloo and dorchester highlighting the heterogeneous nature of the processes governing srp retention within these systems the complex and heterogeneous srp profiles observed are in contrast to the common notion that srp decreases with increasing depth in bioretention systems therefore increasing media depth leads to increased srp retention komlos and traver 2012 the field data instead highlight the complexity of the geochemical processes governing srp retention and the importance of not only the soil media composition but also the overall system design and geochemical conditions throughout the system in ensuring srp retention along the entire bioretention system depth the field data also indicate the different behaviour of srp in the shallow sediment relative to deeper in the systems with the largest change in srp concentration either increase or decrease generally occurring in the top 7 5 cm for example srp concentrations decrease at shallow depth 7 5 cm for oakridge waterloo and dorchester downstream while they increase at shallow depth for the upstream locations at dundas and dorchester the largest increase in srp concentrations at shallow depth is observed for kennedy where the srp increases from 50 µg l in ponded water to 4418 531 and 7719 958 µg l in the shallow porewater at the upstream and downstream locations respectively this highlights the importance of the geochemical processes in the shallow sediment of the bioretention systems including within the surface cover layer e g shwb cover layer for black creek oakridge and dundas while bioretention design guidelines credit valley conservation authority and toronto and region conservation authority 2010 often provide recommended specifications for the soil media e g for p index ph and cation exchange capacity the specifications do not extend to the surface cover material and as such this material is often not tested to confirm its suitability with respect to srp retention 3 4 sediment phase of inorganic p the mean inorganic p extracted from sediment samples all depths collected from each bioretention system are illustrated in fig 8 the mean h2o ip sediment concentrations for the bioretention systems range from 1 7 1 for oakridge to 5 6 mg kg for dorchester the naoh ip is 2 8 folds higher than h2o ip in the sediments for all systems suggesting the potential importance of srp associated with al and fe bound mineral phases naoh ip is variable between bioretention systems and is significantly higher at dundas 34 9 mg kg compared to the other systems such as kennedy and dorchester 6 8 2 and 7 9 3 mg kg p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test the hcl ip is 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than h2o ip for all systems among all bioretention systems waterloo has the lowest hcl ip 242 28 mg kg and kennedy has the highest hcl ip 667 30 mg kg dundas 596 79 mg kg and kennedy 667 30 mg kg have significantly higher hcl ip compared with oakridge and dorchester 332 123 and 276 21 mg kg p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test the vertical profiles of sediment h2o ip naoh ip and hcl ip concentrations fig 9 highlight the different vertical distributions of sediment inorganic p between the systems for oakridge black creek and dundas all of which have a shwb cover layer the h2o ip is significantly higher in top sediment compared with the underlying sediment p 0 05 t test for example in oakridge h2o ip in the top sediment 17 7 mg kg is 4 16 times higher than h2o ip in the deeper sediment 1 4 1 mg kg however for other systems such as dorchester and kennedy the h2o ip concentrations between the top sediment and underlying sediment are relatively similar with the h2o ip being relatively low overall 5 mg kg the vertical trends in the naoh ip vary between the bioretention systems for instance naoh ip generally decreases with increasing depth in systems such as waterloo black creek and oakridge the naoh ip in dorchester decreases in the first 30 cm and then gradually increases below 30 cm dundas shows a slight decrease in naoh ip over the first 10 cm and with the naoh ip then increasing from 10 cm to mid depth 40 cm hcl ip in waterloo black creek and dorchester are relatively constant with depth whereas hcl ip in kennedy and dundas increases slightly with depth over the first 40 cm and 60 cm respectively the hcl ip in oakridge sharply increases two fold at a depth of 50 cm 4 discussion 4 1 identification of controlling geochemical processes 4 1 1 srp adsorption desorption to fine particles srp has been found to adsorb to fine sediment particles including fine sand 0 075 mm size 0 425 mm silt and clay size 0 075 mm as these particles have larger specific surface area cucarella and renman 2009 nair et al 1984 penn et al 2017 data from all bioretention systems indicate that srp adsorption to fine sediment particles is not a major controlling factor in srp retention in the bioretention systems which may be due to the negative change of the sediment surfaces and negative charge of srp for instance dorchester 47 fine sand 7 6 silt and clay and kennedy 59 fine sand 23 silt and clay have a high percentage of fine particles fine sand silt and clay in the media but have less decrease in srp between the ponded water and porewater compared with other bioretention systems with larger sediment size such as oakridge 20 fine sand 14 silt and clay waterloo 26 fine sand 1 5 silt and clay and black creek 14 fine sand 13 silt and clay figs 3 6 in addition srp retention is higher in the top sediment of oakridge and black creek compared to the lower sediment even though the underlying soil media has a higher percentage of fine particles compared with the top sediment figs 4 7 it is important to note that while this data suggests that the fine sediment content may not directly influence the srp retention the particle size distribution does influence the hydraulic conductivity and thus the porewater residence time in the system tirpak et al 2021 this in turn may affect the redox conditions and rate controlled reactions including ca phosphate mineral precipitation and organic matter degradation marvin et al 2020 penn et al 2012 stoner et al 2012 4 1 2 adsorption desorption to al and fe oxides and precipitation of phosphate minerals this section examines the relative importance of srp adsorption desorption to al and fe oxides and phosphate mineral precipitation in retaining srp the analysis focuses on the oakridge kennedy and dundas systems for which the data indicate distinctively different soil media compositions and behaviour of srp between the systems srp adsorption desorption to al and fe oxides is commonly considered the dominant mechanism governing srp retention in bioretention systems li and davis 2016 liu and davis 2014 roy poirier et al 2010 vertical profiles of fe al and srp from a precipitation event indicate that al and fe in porewater vary similarly with the srp concentrations for oakridge and kennedy fig 10 for oakridge fig 10a the decrease in al fe and srp at shallow depth may be due to the precipitation of al and fe oxides and subsequent adsorption of srp fulazzaky et al 2014 saturation indices calculated using the batch thermodynamic calculations in phreeqc support this with simulations indicating that the porewater is oversaturated at shallow depth 7 5 cm depth with respect to al and fe oxides such as gibbsite al oh 3 goethite feooh ferrihydrite fe oh 3 suggesting that these mineral phases may be precipitating this is also consistent with the higher naoh ip observed in the shallow sediments for oakridge fig 9b in contrast to the sharp srp al and fe decrease observed at shallow depth for oakridge fig 10a there is a sharp increase in the porewater srp al and fe at shallow depth for kennedy fig 10b the porewater al and fe concentrations in the kennedy system are significantly higher compared with the other bioretention systems p 0 05 t test fig 10 suggesting the dissolution of al and fe bearing solid phases such as al and fe oxides at shallow depth the high fe concentrations observed in kennedy compared with the other systems suggest that the redox conditions may be favourable for organic matter mineralization via fe reduction lefevre et al 2015 roy poirier et al 2010 importantly the mean porewater ph is high for kennedy ph 8 compared with other systems and srp release from al and fe oxides is favourable under these higher ph conditions as the change on the mineral surfaces becomes negative barrow 1984 zhou et al 2005 phreeqc batch calculations were performed to explore the processes that may be contributing to the higher ph in kennedy and associated srp release in the shallow sediments calculations indicate that organic matter mineralization via fe reduction may considerably increase porewater ph thereby promoting desorption of srp from al and fe oxides overall the data and batch model simulations suggest porewater srp in kennedy is released by three processes a organic matter mineralization transformation from organic p to srp b dissolution of fe oxides srp released because of loss of adsorption sites and c srp desorption from available al and fe oxides surfaces due to change in mineral surface change as ph increases however stoichiometric calculation of the organic matter remineralization via fe reduction in phreeqc indicate that the amount of srp released from organic matter remineralization may be small compared to the other two processes calculations also suggest that dissolution of secondary minerals such vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o is not the dominant mechanism responsible for the increase in both fe and srp at shallow depth as these dissolution reactions do not increases ph as is observed at shallow depth fig s2 as the water continues to infiltrate through the media the srp concentrations decreases this may be due to adsorption of srp to al and fe oxides with phreeqc calculations show positive saturation indices of ferrihydrite 7 7 10 0 and gibbsite 0 6 1 7 below 7 5 cm depth suggesting al and fe oxides may be precipitating phreeqc calculations also indicate that hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh is oversaturated in the sediments with depth 7 5 cm saturation indices range from 7 7 to 9 as such hydroxyapatite precipitation may also be partially contributing to the decrease in srp concentrations with depth in the lower sediment the high hcl ip observed in the sediments for kennedy fig 8 support the high abundance of ca phosphate minerals such as hydroxyapatite within the system although it is possible that the high hcl ip may also be partially due fe bound ip klotzbücher et al 2019 note that the porewater ca and srp concentration trends with depth in the kennedy system are different fig 10b this is not unexpected given the different magnitudes of the porewater ca and srp concentrations for dundas al and fe concentrations decrease sharply at shallow depth 7 5 cm whereas the srp concentration decreases only slightly fig 10c it is possible that srp retention via adsorption to al and fe oxides is contributing to srp retention in the top sediment this is supported by the decrease in al and fe concentrations combined with the higher naoh ip at shallow depth 0 10 cm of dundas fig 9b compared to the underlying sediments 20 30 cm the gradual decrease in srp with increasing depth in the lower sediment fig 10c combined with gradual increase in hcl ip in the sediments fig 9c suggest that hydroxyapatite precipitation may contribute to srp retention in the dundas system it is possible though that the increase in hcl ip may also be due to an increase in fe bearing mineral phases with depth klotzbücher et al 2019 the low hydraulic conductivity and long porewater residence times in the dundas system would be favourable for hydroxyapatite precipitation roy poirier et al 2010 4 1 3 validation of geochemical processes via one dimensional reactive transport simulations the one dimensional reactive transport models implemented in phreeqc v3 for each of the systems are shown in fig 11 with all model parameters including reactions simulated explained in section 2 5 and provided in table 2 for oakridge srp adsorption desorption to gibbsite al oh 3 was simulated with the number of adsorption sites controlled by specifying the saturation indices of gibbsite at different depths thereby controlling the amount of gibbsite available gibbsite rather than ferrihydrite fe oh 3 was considered in the oakridge model as a higher variation in porewater al concentrations with depth was observed compared to porewater fe concentrations from this is was assumed that variations in the gibbsite mineral surface area had a greater influence on the srp variations with depth compared to ferrihydrite fig 10a the porewater fe concentrations were simulated by specifying the saturation indices of ferrihydrite at different depths the simulation results for oakridge agree well with the observed porewater ph al fe and srp depth profiles fig 11a not surprisingly the simulated and observed porewater ca do not match well because processes including precipitation dissolution of ca bearing minerals e g calcite were not included in this model two stages of reaction were considered for kennedy as water infiltrates through the soil media due to the distinct behaviour of the dissolved constituents at shallow depth 0 7 5 cm compared to deeper in the system at shallow depth mineralization of organic matter via fe reduction was simulated together with surface complexation reactions including srp complexation to ferrihydrite mineral surfaces see table 2 for details on reactions only srp complexation to ferrihydrite and not to gibbsite was considered for the kennedy system as the variation of porewater fe concentrations with depth was much greater than for al concentrations fig 10b therefore it was assumed the variation in srp concentrations with depth is more likely due to variability in the available ferrihydrite surface area the mineralization of organic matter via fe reduction was included as it is able to explain the sharp increase in ph at shallow depth this reaction may occur in the kennedy system as the low hydraulic conductivity provides sufficiently long residence time for organic matter mineralization reddy and delaune 2008 further the high porewater fe concentrations at shallow depth suggests the conditions are fe reducing and fe oxides ferrihydrite may serve as the electron accepter for organic matter mineralization fleischer 1978 in addition calcite dissolution was considered over the entire depth for the kennedy system as both ec fig s4 and ca fig 10b are observed to increase with depth the long residence time in the kennedy system due to the low hydraulic conductivity would provide sufficient time for calcite dissolution to occur the simulation results compare well with the observed srp concentrations with depth for the kennedy site despite not considering the possible precipitation of hydroxyapatite fig 11b as suggested by the good comparison between the simulated and observed data hydroxyapatite precipitation may only be partially contributing to srp retention in this system and srp adsorption to fe oxides ferrihydrite may be the more dominant process controlling srp in the lower sediment 7 5 cm depth for dundas it was assumed that ferrihydrite precipitation occurred in the top sediment layer due to the low hydraulic conductivity and thus long porewater residence time in these sediments similar to the kennedy system calcite dissolution was considered in the model across the entire depth of the system the model was not able to adequately simulate the observed srp depth profile and other parameter distributions with depth such as ca and ph when only surface complexation adsorption desorption to fe oxides ferrihydrite was considered therefore the precipitation of hydroxyapatite was included in the model of the dundas system fig 11c secondary minerals such as vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o were not included as the data suggest they are not a major controlling process due to the observed inconsistent trends between dissolved fe with srp fig 10c a reasonable match between the simulated and observed results with respect to srp ca and ph was obtained after the including hydroxyapatite precipitation suggesting that hydroxyapatite precipitation may play a role in srp retention in the dundas system as explained above this is consistent with the lower hydraulic conductivity and thus longer residence times in this system which provide sufficient time for this precipitation reaction 4 2 factors influencing srp retention hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity directly affects the porewater residence time in bioretention systems rate controlled reactions including organic matter mineralization and hydroxyapatite precipitation and subsequently the redox conditions in the soil media in systems with high hydraulic conductivity and thus shorter residence times srp can be retained by adsorption onto al and fe oxides due to the short time scale of adsorption reactions lucas and greenway 2011 lyngsie et al 2015 high hydraulic conductivity is often associated with more oxidizing conditions which is favourable for fe oxide precipitation and subsequent srp adsorption however soil media with low hydraulic conductivity can result in less oxidizing conditions or even anoxic conditions tirpak et al 2021 this may impact the srp retention performance in systems where the adsorption onto fe oxides is the major retention process glaister et al 2014 kratky et al 2018 for example the release of srp at shallow depth in the kennedy system is attributed to reductive dissolution of fe oxides via organic matter degradation and subsequent srp desorption this reaction also increases the ph which further promotes srp desorption from fe oxide surfaces organic matter degradation via fe oxide reduction was able to occur in the shallow layer of this system due to the low hydraulic conductivity and thus long residence time for systems where srp is thought to be mainly retained by precipitation of ca phosphate minerals e g hydroxyapatite such as dundas the low hydraulic conductivity provides sufficient residence time for ca phosphate mineral precipitation to occur lyngsie et al 2014 stoner et al 2012 however it is important to note that the hydraulic conductivity of bioretention media is recommended to be higher than that observed at both dundas and kennedy to limit ponding and ensure rapid infiltration through the media credit valley conservation authority and toronto and region conservation authority 2010 as such bioretention systems with fe rich media should be designed with high hydraulic conductivity to ensure conditions remain favourable for fe oxidation in the system organic content previous studies have demonstrated that adding organic matter to the soil media can enhance removal of metals and nitrogen in bioretention systems hsieh and davis 2005 however the breakdown of organic matter releases srp bratieres et al 2008 hsieh and davis 2005 organic matter degradation via fe reduction is thought to be occurring in the top sediment of the kennedy system leading to high porewater ph and srp release from al and fe oxides the srp release directly from the transformation from organic p is comparatively not thought to be major source of porewater srp in addition the organic matter competes for adsorption sites with the srp guan et al 2006 which may further influence the retention of srp in a bioretention system based on data for the kennedy system it is recommended that anaerobic degradation of organic matter be avoided within bioretention systems to prevent high ph conditions and srp release aerobic degradation of organic matter may also impact srp retention in bioretention systems theoretically the degradation of organic matter via aerobic respiration produces co2 which generates acidity and lowers ph arndt et al 2013 however the decrease of ph caused by aerobic organic matter degradation can be buffered by calcareous minerals in the soil media e g calcite if conditions remain oxic the srp produced from aerobic organic matter degradation may adsorb to al and fe oxides that are present this may explain why we do not observe high porewater srp concentrations in oakridge waterloo and black creek where the organic content and orp values are high in the top sediments therefore the data indicate that provided conditions in the system remain oxic the organic content in the media is not a critical factor for evaluating the suitability of a soil media composition for srp retention for instance oakridge black creek and dundas have a much higher organic contents than kennedy but porewater srp concentrations are considerably lower for these former bioretention systems ph and orp ph strongly influences the srp retention in soils including within the bioretention systems cucarella and renman 2009 marvin et al 2020 penn et al 2017 singh and gilkes 1991 different srp retention processes have different optimal ph conditions for example ca phosphate precipitation is more favourable at alkaline ph as these minerals are more soluble under acidic conditions serpone 1996 srp retention via al and fe oxides adsorption is more favourable at near neutral ph stoner et al 2012 in this study the ph and srp within most systems showed similar trends with depth figs s2e 7e suggesting that srp retention in bioretention systems is highly ph sensitive particularly when srp adsorption to al and fe oxides is the major retention mechanism the surface charge on al and fe oxides minerals becomes negative at higher ph which reduces srp adsorption onto these phases zhou et al 2005 the conditions in all the bioretention systems were oxidizing with kennedy having the lowest porewater orp 145 9 mv among all the bioretention systems fig 5 the lower orp in the kennedy system may have facilitated the degradation of organic matter via fe reduction with in turn may have reduced the abundance of fe oxides and thus available adsorption sites the influence of orp on srp retention is also evident from the inverse behaviour of orp and srp with depth in systems such as kennedy and black creek figs 7 s3 drying wetting process previous studies indicate that drying wetting cycles can influence the redox conditions which subsequently affect metal distributions in sediments saeki et al 1993 this has also been shown in bioretention systems blecken et al 2009 as a redox sensitive metal fe may be influenced by drying wetting cycles which in turn affects srp retention via reductive fe oxide dissolution and srp desorption during dry periods sufficiently long residence times can allow for slow and less reversible adsorption reactions to occur that facilitate srp retention this can lead to comparatively lower srp concentration in porewater during dry periods compared to wet periods lucas and greenway 2008 marvin et al 2020 this phenomenon was observed in systems such as in oakridge black creek and waterloo for which the sediment hydraulic conductivity sediment is high figs s5 4b in contrast the srp concentrations were similar between dry and wet periods for the dorchester kennedy and dundas systems fig s5 these systems all have lower hydraulic conductivity fig 4b it is possible the lower hydraulic conductivity for these systems results in the geochemical conditions including redox within the system remaining relatively stable over the drying wetting cycles amount of infiltrating water as shown in fig 7 the srp depth profiles are considerably different between the upstream and downstream locations for most of the bioretention systems the upstream location generally receives more infiltrating water this is expected to result in lower residence times more infiltration of oxic water and more dilution leading to lower srp porewater concentrations compared to the downstream location as observed for oakridge waterloo kennedy and dundas the differences in the infiltrating water volumes also results in different sediment water ratios theoretically higher sediment water ratio for the downstream locations will lead to higher concentration of srp in porewater ádám et al 2007 cucarella and renman 2009 søvik and kløve 2005 it is important to note that the black creek system receives runoff from all directions with no curb cut inlets and therefore there is no clear difference in the srp concentrations between the upstream and downstream locations fig 7c further in dorchester there are curb cut inlets near the upstream and downstream sampling profile locations however the downstream location usually has more ponded water than the upstream location based on field observations this is consistent with porewater srp found to be lower at the downstream compared with the upstream location for dorchester fig 7 this comparison between the upstream and downstream locations highlight the importance of the overall bioretention system design and function in governing srp retention in addition to the soil media composition 5 conclusions overall the findings of this study indicate that while the specific composition of the soil media used in the bioretention systems is important for srp retention more attention should be given to overall design of field scale bioretention system with respect to hydraulic conductivity overall redox conditions and physical and chemical composition of the surface cover layer srp behaviour was found to be highly heterogeneous in the six bioretention systems studied and considerably more complex than the behaviour typically observed in laboratory column experiments ádám et al 2007 rosenquist et al 2010 in bioretention systems with high hydraulic conductivity adsorption desorption to al and fe oxides is thought to be the major srp retention mechanism due to the short porewater residence times and more oxidizing conditions in the system oxidizing conditions are thought to lead to rapid adsorption of srp to al fe oxides with srp concentrations sharply decreasing at shallow depth while srp retention via adsorption to al and fe oxides is not directly affected by the porewater residence time it may be indirectly affected by reactions that can occur when the porewater residence time is greater e g organic matter degradation moreover srp adsorption to al and fe oxides is sensitive to ph especially in more alkaline conditions ph 8 therefore reactions that increases ph such as organic matter degradation via fe reduction as observed in the kennedy bioretention system must be avoided by increasing the soil media hydraulic conductivity and maintaining oxic condition within the system in bioretention systems with low hydraulic conductivity it is possible for srp retention to occur by both srp adsorption onto al and fe oxides and the precipitation of ca phosphate minerals e g hydroxyapatite because of the longer porewater residence times however it is important to note that the low hydraulic conductivity media used in two of the systems studied dundas kennedy should be avoided as their reduced infiltration capacity led to excessive surface water ponding during precipitation events credit authorship contribution statement yi liu conceptualization methodology

4300,soluble reactive phosphorus srp in urban runoff can contribute to eutrophication of downstream water bodies bioretention systems a popular low impact development lid practice have the potential to reduce srp loads in urban runoff in this study six field scale bioretention systems located in southern ontario canada with different soil media compositions were monitored to evaluate their performance with respect to srp retention and to identify the geochemical processes influencing srp behaviour within the systems the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil media were analysed to compare the systems as well as to assess whether the installed soil media compositions met the lid bioretention design guidelines to examine how srp evolves as stormwater infiltrates through the different media porewater was collected from multiple depths within the bioretention systems the geochemical processes controlling srp retention release were identified by chemical analysis of the porewater and selective solid phase extractions the geochemical processes governing srp behaviour differed between the bioretention systems with processes validated via one dimensional reactive transport simulations conducted in phreeqc results indicate 1 soil media characteristics are highly variable between systems despite the systems having the same overall engineering design specifications 2 porewater srp does not evolve uniformly with depth indicating the importance of overall system design including redox conditions infiltration rate and vertical layering of different materials e g surface cover layer and bioretention media 3 srp retention release processes often occur at shallow depth 0 1 m and more attention is needed to assess the impact of different surface cover layers used in field installations 4 hydraulic conductivity controls the residence time of water in the systems which in turn influences srp retention release 5 srp adsorption onto al and or fe oxides is the main retention mechanism in systems with high hydraulic conductivity while ca phosphate mineral precipitation may be important in systems with low hydraulic conductivity the study findings provide insights needed to improve the field performance of bioretention systems in retaining srp including the testing and application of soil media amendments for enhancing srp retention keywords nutrients low impact development stormwater management water quality reactive processes 1 introduction eutrophication of freshwaters driven by excessive nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus p inputs has detrimental economic and environmental consequences paerl et al 2016 watson et al 2016 p is generally the limiting nutrient in freshwaters as soluble reactive phosphorus srp is the bioavailable form of p that is taken up by plants and microorganisms thus leading to eutrophication srp is of one of the key concerns for water quality impairment urban runoff can contribute high srp loads to downstream water bodies li and davis 2016 shrestha et al 2018 with srp sources in urban runoff including naturally occurring labile soil p and atmospheric deposition as well as sources associated with human activities such as fertilizer application waste disposal and detergent use hsieh et al 2007 kandel et al 2017 effective urban stormwater management is critical for protection of downstream environments particularly with urban runoff volume and associated anthropogenic pollutant loads including srp loads increasing as urbanization intensifies and expands bratieres et al 2008 line and white 2007 to reduce stress on downstream environments low impact development lid stormwater management practices such as vegetated filter strips permeable pavement perforated pipe systems green roofs and bioretention systems have become popular ahiablame et al 2012 dietz 2007 among these practices bioretention systems fig 1 are increasingly installed due to their economic feasibility combined with potential for stormwater attenuation and pollutant control roy poirier et al 2010 pollutants are removed in bioretention systems via multiple physical chemical and biological processes such as sedimentation filtration ion exchange precipitation adsorption plant microorganism uptake and biodegradation feng et al 2012 liu et al 2014 shrestha et al 2018 tirpak et al 2021 for srp the

bioretention systems have been shown to be efficient in attenuating a wide range of pollutants including total suspended solids tss heavy metals total kjeldahl nitrogen and organic matter bratieres et al 2008 davis et al 2001 diblasi et al 2009 khan et al 2012 muthanna et al 2007 however highly variable performance of bioretention system with respect to p including srp retention has been observed in prior laboratory ding et al 2019 lucas and greenway 2011 palmer et al 2013 paus et al 2014 poor et al 2018 poor and kube 2019 and field studies brown and hunt iii 2011 goor et al 2021 hunt et al 2006 kandel et al 2017 komlos and traver 2012 mangangka et al 2015 passeport et al 2009 for instance while the field study of komlos and traver 2012 showed high sustained over 9 years srp removal 90 poor srp retention has been observed a number of field studies with some studies reporting net release of total phosphorus and or srp from the soil media brown and hunt iii 2011 goor et al 2021 mullane et al 2015 the variable performance of bioretention systems with respect to srp retention is partially due to the different characteristics of the soil media used between studies resulting in different biogeochemical processes controlling srp retention hunt et al 2012 for instance studies have shown that compost which is added to some systems to support plant growth and increase the water holding capacity of the soil media can act as a sustained source of p due to processes including organic matter mineralization mullane et al 2015 paus et al 2014 in contrast soil media with high content of al fe and ca low p index and high cation exchange capacity is generally found to have high srp retention marvin et al 2020 this is why soil media with added fe and al oxides and ca rich amendments have been found to be effective in retaining srp in bioretention systems lucas and greenway 2011 o neill and davis 2012 poor et al 2019 shrestha et al 2018 in addition to the soil media composition other factors such as ph redox condition residence time and media particle size distribution also affect srp retention in bioretention systems for example srp retention in fe and al rich media has been found to be less sensitive to the water residence time in the bioretention system compared with ca rich media as adsorption desorption processes are fast compared to ca phosphate mineral precipitation klimeski et al 2014 lyngsie et al 2015 penn et al 2017 srp adsorption onto fe and al oxides tends to be greatest at near neutral conditions with srp desorbing as the ph becomes more alkaline marvin et al 2020 in contrast ca rich media may release srp at low ph conditions due to the increased solubility of ca phosphate minerals stevenson and cole 1999 further the redox conditions are important for srp retention in fe rich media as a switch from oxidizing to reducing conditions can trigger reductive dissolution of fe oxides and the release of srp leader et al 2008 shrestha et al 2018 as mentioned above the findings from laboratory and field studies are highly variable with respect to p including srp retention in bioretention media davis 2007 hunt et al 2008 kandel et al 2017 sharkey and hunt 2005 shilton et al 2006 as prior field studies have generally only conducted influent effluent sampling with the bioretention systems treated as a black box goor et al 2021 marvin et al 2020 spraakman et al 2020 these studies often provide limited understanding of the underlying geochemical processes governing p retention release within the system this makes it challenging to broadly apply and compare the findings with other bioretention systems with different overall designs and soil media compositions while some laboratory column studies provide strong insight into the geochemical processes governing srp retention release ádám et al 2007 chahal et al 2016 ding et al 2019 paus et al 2014 conditions are considerably more complex in the field for instance runoff composition srp concentration redox potential and ph soil media properties hydraulic conductivity particle size distribution media age and chemical composition and environmental factors temperature precipitation depth and freeze thaw cycles change over different time scales for field scale bioretention systems all these factors can considerably affect the factors and processes governing srp behaviour and subsequently srp retention in a field scale bioretention system marvin et al 2020 shrestha et al 2018 with an increasing number of studies focused on evaluating as well as enhancing the performance of bioretention systems to retain srp there is a need to systematically investigate the processes governing srp retention within field scale bioretention systems these insights are needed to provide fundamental understanding that can be applied to guide selection of appropriate soil media compositions and improve overall system design for enhancing srp retention in this study investigations were conducted on six existing field scale bioretention systems in ontario canada to evaluate the processes governing srp behaviour within the systems the specific study objectives were to 1 characterize and compare the physical and chemical composition of the soil media including the surface cover layer used in the bioretention systems 2 evaluate the spatial variability of srp within the bioretention systems and 3 identify the major geochemical processes governing srp behaviour within the systems and what factors influence these processes to identify the processes governing srp retention within the bioretention systems data for the six field scale bioretention systems were analysed with the data for three systems simulated using a one dimensional reactive transport model developed in phreeqc v3 parkhurst and appelo 2015 2 material and methods 2 1 site description six bioretention systems in southern ontario canada were selected as study sites these systems are herein referred to as oakridge waterloo dorchester black creek kennedy and dundas fig 2 the bioretention systems were designed according to a lid stormwater management planning and design guide credit valley conservation authority and toronto and region conservation authority 2010 that was widely used by practitioners across ontario the characteristics of the bioretention systems including areal size installation year surface cover layer type e g mulch stone soil media depth and specific chemical and physical characteristics of soil media are provided in table 1 note that all bioretention systems have an underdrain except black creek the soil media of all bioretention systems were designed and specified to have a composition of 85 sand 8 12 soil fines and 3 5 organic matter by dry weight following the lid design guidelines credit valley conservation authority and toronto and region conservation authority 2010 no fe al or ca rich amendments were added to the soil media further most bioretention systems have a surface cover layer approximate depth of 7 5 10 cm that overlies the soil media clear stone cs was used as the surface cover layer for waterloo and kennedy and shredded hardwood bark shwb was used for oakridge black creek and dundas there is no surface cover layer named na hereafter for dorchester table 1 the bioretention systems were designed for water quantity control post development runoff controlled to pre development runoff for 2 to 100 year storm events and to meet the normal water quality control standards for stormwater management facilities in ontario 80 total suspended solids tss removal 2 2 field measurements and sample collection field investigations including water sampling and sediment core collection were completed from may to october 2019 for the six bioretention systems road runoff ponded water water ponded on the surface of the bioretention system during and immediately following a precipitation event and pore water were sampled during ten precipitation events over this period sampling was also conducted three times during dry conditions to sample the stagnant porewater in the bioretention systems effluent samples were not collected as there was no safe way to access to the underdrain or site owner permission was not provided to sample from the underdrain in each bioretention system two vertical profiles of macrorhizon samplers were permanently installed at four different depths to collect porewater samples the sampling profile near the road curb cut inlet to the bioretention system is herein referred to as upstream while the sampling profile farther from the inlet is referred to as downstream to collect porewater an acid washed syringe was connected to each macrorhizon sampler and a retainer was used to maintain suction over a period of 12 24 h as the porewater was collected in this way the porewater was extracted and temporarily stored in the syringes volume of 10 60 ml the road runoff ponded water and porewater samples were filtered 0 45 µm cellulose acetate in the field stored in acid washed bottles and taken immediately to the laboratory for chemical analysis two sediment cores were collected from each bioretention system to characterize the physical and chemical sediment properties at different depths sediment cores were collected from just below the stone cover layer at waterloo and kennedy sediment cores were collected using a stainless steel corer 2 inch diameter that was pushed vertically down into the sediments to a target depth and then pulled up manually the sediment cores were immediately sealed with a plastic membrane to prevent water evaporation and placed horizontally to reduce water movement through the core the sediment core was sliced into pieces with 2 5 cm intervals and stored in a refrigerator 4 c until physical and chemical analyses were performed finally guelph permeameter tests were conducted following standard procedures bagarello and giordano 1999 at multiple spatial locations across each bioretention system to measure the vertical hydraulic conductivity 2 3 water sample analysis the ph oxidation reduction potential orp and electrical conductivity ec of road runoff ponded water and porewater samples were measured after sample collection using an accumet ab 200 ph orp probe and ec probe respectively the ph orp and ec probes were calibrated before each sampling event the filtered water samples were analysed for srp using a lachat quikchem 8500 flow injection analyser fia method 10 115 01 1 m cations including fe al and ca were analysed via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy vista pro ccd simultaneous icp oes for quality control standards and duplicates were run every ten samples for the srp fe al and ca analyses based on the duplicate analysis the overall accuracy of the srp and cation concentrations were determined to be higher than 95 and 98 respectively 2 4 sediment analysis approximately 250 g of oven dried 105 c for 24 h sediment collected from the top of the sediment core 7 5 cm depth and deeper 7 5 cm depth in the core of each bioretention system was sieved to obtain a particle size distribution ontario ministry of transportation test method ls 602 note that for waterloo kennedy and dorchester the top sediment sample represented the top of the soil media layer as the clear stone was not sampled for waterloo and kennedy whereas for the other bioretention systems this sample was from the surface cover layer shwb organic content was also measured using the loss on ignition standard method heiri et al 2001 for this method approximately 25 g sediment was dried at 105 c for 24 h to remove all residual water the dried sediment was then weighed before heating at 550 c for 4 h the sediment samples were weighed after cooling to calculate the mass of organic content sequential p extraction of sediment samples was conducted to determine the fractions of inorganic p ip in the sediment hedley et al 1982 tiessen and moir 1993 a modified three step extraction adapted from hedley et al 1982 was performed using the following extractants 1 deionized water 2 0 1 m naoh solution and 3 1 m hcl solution the fractions extracted from each of these steps are operationally defined based on the extractant used the first extraction step is thought to extract loosely bound inorganic p fractions h2o ip the second step is thought to extract al and fe bound inorganic p including inorganic p bounded to fe and al oxides named naoh ip the third extraction step extracts residual inorganic p named hcl ip which includes inorganic p associated with ca bound minerals but may also include fe and al bound inorganic p not released in the naoh extraction step it is important to note that recent studies suggest caution is required in interpreting the results from the hedley method and its modified versions hedley et al 1982 tiessen and moir 1993 this is because discrete p forms e g fe bound ca bound are not precisely quantified by individual steps but rather p can be co released from multiple mineral phases within a given step barrow et al 2021 gu and margenot 2020 klotzbücher et al 2019 this limitation is considered in our interpretation of the data to extract h2o ip 2 g of dry sediment and 60 ml deionized water were placed in a centrifuge bottle and shaken for 16 h this mixture was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered 0 45 µm and stored for chemical analysis for the subsequent two steps the residual sediment was mixed with 60 ml 0 1 m naoh solution to extract naoh ip and then with 60 ml 1 0 m hcl solution to extract residual inorganic p hcl ip and the mixture was shaken centrifuged and filtered using the same procedure used for the first step all extracted solutions were diluted and run on the fia within 48 h for inorganic p srp analysis 2 5 one dimensional reactive transport model a one dimensional transport model which considers the main reactions controlling srp was developed in phreeqc v3 parkhurst and appelo 2015 to simulate the srp concentrations in the oakridge kennedy and dundas systems the model was used to simulate these three bioretention systems as the data indicate that srp in these systems may be governed by distinctively different processes the model considers thermodynamic aqueous speciation reactions precipitation dissolution reactions surface complexation reactions adsorption of srp to mineral surfaces and one dimensional transport the specific reactions considered in each of the models used to simulate the bioretention systems varied based on our field data analysis see table 2 for reactions considered one dimensional transport considering steady advection diffusion and dispersion was simulated with the model domain for each simulation based on the depth of the soil media the sediments were assumed to be saturated with continuous inflow to the top model boundary and free drainage from the bottom model boundary the advective velocity was calculated by multiplying the measured sediment hydraulic conductivity by a measured hydraulic gradient for each bioretention system table 2 the chemistry of ponded water e g ph eh concentrations of al ca fe k mg mn na and srp for each bioretention system was used to specify the chemical composition of the water entering the top model boundary the initial conditions in the model domain were specified using the porewater chemistry measured for the deepest sampling location in each bioretention system for each time step the aqueous solution in each model cell was speciated using thermodynamic constants in the phreeqc database minteq v4 parkhurst and appelo 2015 mineral phases that influence srp mobility including ferrihydrite fe oh 3 and gibbsite al oh 3 were also allowed to dissolve or precipitate by assigning a saturation index for each mineral phase the diffuse double layer ddl model dzombak and morel 1990 was used to simulate surface complexation adsorption desorption of srp to ferrihydrite or gibbsite see table 2 for parameter values used whether ferrihydrite or gibbsite was selected as the mineral surface for surface complexation adsorption desorption for a given model was based on the measured al or fe porewater concentrations if al porewater concentrations varied more than fe concentrations with depth as occurred for oakridge it was assumed that srp complexation to gibbsite had more control on the srp variations with depth compared to complexation to ferrihydrite vice versa applied if fe porewater concentrations varied more than al concentrations finally irreversible chemical reactions including organic matter degradation via fe reduction were simulated by specifying a given amount of moles to react per time step each model was run for a simulation time of 100 days at which time steady state conditions with respect to the porewater chemistry was reached the model does not consider porewater trapped in the dead pore spaces and preferential flow in the media further details on the model set up including the initial conditions transport parameters and reactions used to simulate each bioretention system are provided in table 2 2 6 statistical analyses statistical analyses were conducted to compare the ph ec orp porewater srp and sediment extraction data between systems a t test was performed if the data were normal or log normal otherwise the wilcoxon signed rank test was applied a criterion of 95 α 0 05 confidence was used to test for significance all statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics version 21 brosius 2013 each sampling event was considered as a replicate for the statistical analyses 3 results 3 1 properties of bioretention media the particle size distributions of the soil media are considerably different between the bioretention systems despite all systems having the same design guidelines 85 sand 8 12 soil fines and 3 5 organic matter by dry weight the measured particle size distribution of the soil media for each bioretention system are shown in fig 3 with a summary provided in table 1 the soil media has a well distributed particle size for oakridge black creek and dundas whereas waterloo has a high percentage of medium sand and dorchester and kennedy have a high percentage of fine sand fig 3 for waterloo dorchester and kennedy the top sediment 7 5 cm depth and lower sediment 7 5 cm depth have similar particle size distributions as both the top and lower sediments are the soil media itself in contrast the top sediment and lower sediment have different particle size distributions for oakridge black creek and dundas because for these systems the top sediment sample represents the surface shwb cover layer fig 3 the top sediment for oakridge and black creek has a high medium sand content and for dundas has a well distributed particle size due to the differences in particle size distribution and presence absence of a surface cover layer between the systems the hydraulic conductivity of the top 15 cm sediments varies greatly between systems fig 4 a the measured hydraulic conductivity of oakridge waterloo and black creek was around 2 6 m d which is within the range of the lid design guide 0 6 7 2 m d whereas dorchester 0 34 m d kennedy 0 1 m d and dundas 0 1 m d have a much lower hydraulic conductivity than that recommended by the lid design guide in addition to the different physical characteristics the organic content of the sediment also differs between the systems fig 4b fig s1 the organic content of the soil media for different systems ranges from 2 5 to 9 5 for oakridge black creek and dundas the organic content of the surface cover layer top sediment is considerable higher 45 36 and 15 respectively compared to the underlying soil media 4 5 2 8 and 9 5 respectively fig 4b due to the high organic matter in the shwb surface cover 3 2 porewater physicochemical conditions the physicochemical parameters ph orp and ec of the ponded water and porewater in the bioretention systems are shown in fig 5 the ponded water chemistry rather than road runoff chemistry are compared with the porewater as the ponded water is the integrated endmember for water infiltrating into the bioretention systems over a precipitation event generally the ph of the ponded water is below 7 for all bioretention systems and the ponded water ph is significantly lower than the porewater within each bioretention systems considering all sampling events p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test kennedy has the highest ph difference 1 ph unit between the ponded water and porewater resulting primarily from a sharp increase in ph at shallow depth top 7 5 cm with the ph decreasing slightly with depth after this initial increase fig s2 the ph also increases at shallow depth in the other bioretention systems with the porewater ph then generally decreasing with depth in oakridge and waterloo increasing with depth for black creek and being variable with depth for dorchester and dundas fig s2 the orp of the ponded water is above 200 mv for all bioretention systems indicating that oxidized water infiltrates into the bioretention systems fig 5 considering all sampling events the ponded water orp is significantly higher than the porewater orp p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test for each system with conditions become less oxidizing with depth black creek is the only system where this does not occur and the mean porewater orp is higher than the mean ponded water orp 324 mv and 206 mv respectively this may have been caused by high labile organic debris on the surface of the black creek system the orp porewater depth profiles indicate oxidizing conditions at all depths for all bioretention systems it is important to note that the mean porewater orp is lower in kennedy 145 mv compared to all other systems 180 mv fig 5 fig s3 this may be associated with the low hydraulic conductivity of the media in the kennedy system with the specific mechanisms responsible for this lower orp explored in section 4 1 2 below the ponded water ec is 100 µs cm for oakridge waterloo black creek and dorchester but is 350 µs cm for kennedy and dundas the higher ec in the ponded water for kennedy and dundas may be due to longer surface water ponding time caused by the lower hydraulic conductivity and thus infiltration rate of these systems compared to the other systems fig 3 the mean porewater ec is significantly higher than the ponded water ec for each system considering all sampling events p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test this is attributed to the leaching of solutes as the infiltrating water interacts with the sediment as well as residual high salt content in the media due to winter de icing road salt nacl application in all bioretention systems the porewater ec increases with depth indicating continual net leaching along the infiltration flow path fig s4 the mean porewater ec is significantly lower for oakridge waterloo black creek and dorchester 476 153 332 117 292 36 and 636 248 µs cm respectively compared with kennedy and dundas 3326 1095 and 2018 884 µs cm respectively p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test again this may be due to the lower hydraulic conductivity for the kennedy and dundas systems which provides longer residence times for aqueous solid phase interactions and thus for mineral dissolution alternatively the elevated porewater ec may be due to the lower hydraulic conductivity of these systems causing slow flushing of high winter de icing road salt from the systems over the spring and summer including over the sampling period 3 3 porewater srp the mean srp concentrations in the ponded water and porewater for the six bioretention systems are shown in fig 6 the mean ponded water srp is 99 56 85 104 162 119 41 35 46 6 and 43 35 µg l for oakridge waterloo black creek dorchester kennedy and dundas respectively there is no significant difference in the ponded water srp concentrations between the bioretention systems p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test the mean ponded water srp concentrations are 1 2 4 3 folds higher than the mean porewater srp concentrations for all sites except kennedy where the porewater srp concentration is about two orders of magnitude higher than the ponded water srp 3775 2397 and 46 6 µg l for porewater and ponded water respectively the mean porewater srp for other sites are below 100 µg l with the mean porewater srp ranging from 32 19 µg l for dorchester to 73 64 µg l for waterloo the srp vertical profiles are similar between precipitation events and also between precipitation events and dry non event conditions fig s5 therefore to illustrate the general trends in srp concentrations with depth for each bioretention system the mean srp concentration at each sampling point considering all sampling events is presented in fig 7 importantly the porewater srp concentrations do not consistently decrease with increasing depth for most of the bioretention systems for example for oakridge downstream the mean srp concentration decreases near the surface 0 7 5 cm from 100 to 40 µg l but increases at mid depth 50 cm to 80 µg l this may be caused by a change of geochemical conditions at this depth or alternatively due to local sediment heterogeneity such as organic matter not been well mixed in the media fig 7a for some systems such as dorchester upstream and waterloo downstream the srp decreases near the surface and then increases with depth in the media layer fig 7b d even within the same system the srp concentration trends with depth varies between upstream and downstream profile locations e g waterloo and dorchester highlighting the heterogeneous nature of the processes governing srp retention within these systems the complex and heterogeneous srp profiles observed are in contrast to the common notion that srp decreases with increasing depth in bioretention systems therefore increasing media depth leads to increased srp retention komlos and traver 2012 the field data instead highlight the complexity of the geochemical processes governing srp retention and the importance of not only the soil media composition but also the overall system design and geochemical conditions throughout the system in ensuring srp retention along the entire bioretention system depth the field data also indicate the different behaviour of srp in the shallow sediment relative to deeper in the systems with the largest change in srp concentration either increase or decrease generally occurring in the top 7 5 cm for example srp concentrations decrease at shallow depth 7 5 cm for oakridge waterloo and dorchester downstream while they increase at shallow depth for the upstream locations at dundas and dorchester the largest increase in srp concentrations at shallow depth is observed for kennedy where the srp increases from 50 µg l in ponded water to 4418 531 and 7719 958 µg l in the shallow porewater at the upstream and downstream locations respectively this highlights the importance of the geochemical processes in the shallow sediment of the bioretention systems including within the surface cover layer e g shwb cover layer for black creek oakridge and dundas while bioretention design guidelines credit valley conservation authority and toronto and region conservation authority 2010 often provide recommended specifications for the soil media e g for p index ph and cation exchange capacity the specifications do not extend to the surface cover material and as such this material is often not tested to confirm its suitability with respect to srp retention 3 4 sediment phase of inorganic p the mean inorganic p extracted from sediment samples all depths collected from each bioretention system are illustrated in fig 8 the mean h2o ip sediment concentrations for the bioretention systems range from 1 7 1 for oakridge to 5 6 mg kg for dorchester the naoh ip is 2 8 folds higher than h2o ip in the sediments for all systems suggesting the potential importance of srp associated with al and fe bound mineral phases naoh ip is variable between bioretention systems and is significantly higher at dundas 34 9 mg kg compared to the other systems such as kennedy and dorchester 6 8 2 and 7 9 3 mg kg p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test the hcl ip is 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than h2o ip for all systems among all bioretention systems waterloo has the lowest hcl ip 242 28 mg kg and kennedy has the highest hcl ip 667 30 mg kg dundas 596 79 mg kg and kennedy 667 30 mg kg have significantly higher hcl ip compared with oakridge and dorchester 332 123 and 276 21 mg kg p 0 05 wilcoxon signed rank test the vertical profiles of sediment h2o ip naoh ip and hcl ip concentrations fig 9 highlight the different vertical distributions of sediment inorganic p between the systems for oakridge black creek and dundas all of which have a shwb cover layer the h2o ip is significantly higher in top sediment compared with the underlying sediment p 0 05 t test for example in oakridge h2o ip in the top sediment 17 7 mg kg is 4 16 times higher than h2o ip in the deeper sediment 1 4 1 mg kg however for other systems such as dorchester and kennedy the h2o ip concentrations between the top sediment and underlying sediment are relatively similar with the h2o ip being relatively low overall 5 mg kg the vertical trends in the naoh ip vary between the bioretention systems for instance naoh ip generally decreases with increasing depth in systems such as waterloo black creek and oakridge the naoh ip in dorchester decreases in the first 30 cm and then gradually increases below 30 cm dundas shows a slight decrease in naoh ip over the first 10 cm and with the naoh ip then increasing from 10 cm to mid depth 40 cm hcl ip in waterloo black creek and dorchester are relatively constant with depth whereas hcl ip in kennedy and dundas increases slightly with depth over the first 40 cm and 60 cm respectively the hcl ip in oakridge sharply increases two fold at a depth of 50 cm 4 discussion 4 1 identification of controlling geochemical processes 4 1 1 srp adsorption desorption to fine particles srp has been found to adsorb to fine sediment particles including fine sand 0 075 mm size 0 425 mm silt and clay size 0 075 mm as these particles have larger specific surface area cucarella and renman 2009 nair et al 1984 penn et al 2017 data from all bioretention systems indicate that srp adsorption to fine sediment particles is not a major controlling factor in srp retention in the bioretention systems which may be due to the negative change of the sediment surfaces and negative charge of srp for instance dorchester 47 fine sand 7 6 silt and clay and kennedy 59 fine sand 23 silt and clay have a high percentage of fine particles fine sand silt and clay in the media but have less decrease in srp between the ponded water and porewater compared with other bioretention systems with larger sediment size such as oakridge 20 fine sand 14 silt and clay waterloo 26 fine sand 1 5 silt and clay and black creek 14 fine sand 13 silt and clay figs 3 6 in addition srp retention is higher in the top sediment of oakridge and black creek compared to the lower sediment even though the underlying soil media has a higher percentage of fine particles compared with the top sediment figs 4 7 it is important to note that while this data suggests that the fine sediment content may not directly influence the srp retention the particle size distribution does influence the hydraulic conductivity and thus the porewater residence time in the system tirpak et al 2021 this in turn may affect the redox conditions and rate controlled reactions including ca phosphate mineral precipitation and organic matter degradation marvin et al 2020 penn et al 2012 stoner et al 2012 4 1 2 adsorption desorption to al and fe oxides and precipitation of phosphate minerals this section examines the relative importance of srp adsorption desorption to al and fe oxides and phosphate mineral precipitation in retaining srp the analysis focuses on the oakridge kennedy and dundas systems for which the data indicate distinctively different soil media compositions and behaviour of srp between the systems srp adsorption desorption to al and fe oxides is commonly considered the dominant mechanism governing srp retention in bioretention systems li and davis 2016 liu and davis 2014 roy poirier et al 2010 vertical profiles of fe al and srp from a precipitation event indicate that al and fe in porewater vary similarly with the srp concentrations for oakridge and kennedy fig 10 for oakridge fig 10a the decrease in al fe and srp at shallow depth may be due to the precipitation of al and fe oxides and subsequent adsorption of srp fulazzaky et al 2014 saturation indices calculated using the batch thermodynamic calculations in phreeqc support this with simulations indicating that the porewater is oversaturated at shallow depth 7 5 cm depth with respect to al and fe oxides such as gibbsite al oh 3 goethite feooh ferrihydrite fe oh 3 suggesting that these mineral phases may be precipitating this is also consistent with the higher naoh ip observed in the shallow sediments for oakridge fig 9b in contrast to the sharp srp al and fe decrease observed at shallow depth for oakridge fig 10a there is a sharp increase in the porewater srp al and fe at shallow depth for kennedy fig 10b the porewater al and fe concentrations in the kennedy system are significantly higher compared with the other bioretention systems p 0 05 t test fig 10 suggesting the dissolution of al and fe bearing solid phases such as al and fe oxides at shallow depth the high fe concentrations observed in kennedy compared with the other systems suggest that the redox conditions may be favourable for organic matter mineralization via fe reduction lefevre et al 2015 roy poirier et al 2010 importantly the mean porewater ph is high for kennedy ph 8 compared with other systems and srp release from al and fe oxides is favourable under these higher ph conditions as the change on the mineral surfaces becomes negative barrow 1984 zhou et al 2005 phreeqc batch calculations were performed to explore the processes that may be contributing to the higher ph in kennedy and associated srp release in the shallow sediments calculations indicate that organic matter mineralization via fe reduction may considerably increase porewater ph thereby promoting desorption of srp from al and fe oxides overall the data and batch model simulations suggest porewater srp in kennedy is released by three processes a organic matter mineralization transformation from organic p to srp b dissolution of fe oxides srp released because of loss of adsorption sites and c srp desorption from available al and fe oxides surfaces due to change in mineral surface change as ph increases however stoichiometric calculation of the organic matter remineralization via fe reduction in phreeqc indicate that the amount of srp released from organic matter remineralization may be small compared to the other two processes calculations also suggest that dissolution of secondary minerals such vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o is not the dominant mechanism responsible for the increase in both fe and srp at shallow depth as these dissolution reactions do not increases ph as is observed at shallow depth fig s2 as the water continues to infiltrate through the media the srp concentrations decreases this may be due to adsorption of srp to al and fe oxides with phreeqc calculations show positive saturation indices of ferrihydrite 7 7 10 0 and gibbsite 0 6 1 7 below 7 5 cm depth suggesting al and fe oxides may be precipitating phreeqc calculations also indicate that hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh is oversaturated in the sediments with depth 7 5 cm saturation indices range from 7 7 to 9 as such hydroxyapatite precipitation may also be partially contributing to the decrease in srp concentrations with depth in the lower sediment the high hcl ip observed in the sediments for kennedy fig 8 support the high abundance of ca phosphate minerals such as hydroxyapatite within the system although it is possible that the high hcl ip may also be partially due fe bound ip klotzbücher et al 2019 note that the porewater ca and srp concentration trends with depth in the kennedy system are different fig 10b this is not unexpected given the different magnitudes of the porewater ca and srp concentrations for dundas al and fe concentrations decrease sharply at shallow depth 7 5 cm whereas the srp concentration decreases only slightly fig 10c it is possible that srp retention via adsorption to al and fe oxides is contributing to srp retention in the top sediment this is supported by the decrease in al and fe concentrations combined with the higher naoh ip at shallow depth 0 10 cm of dundas fig 9b compared to the underlying sediments 20 30 cm the gradual decrease in srp with increasing depth in the lower sediment fig 10c combined with gradual increase in hcl ip in the sediments fig 9c suggest that hydroxyapatite precipitation may contribute to srp retention in the dundas system it is possible though that the increase in hcl ip may also be due to an increase in fe bearing mineral phases with depth klotzbücher et al 2019 the low hydraulic conductivity and long porewater residence times in the dundas system would be favourable for hydroxyapatite precipitation roy poirier et al 2010 4 1 3 validation of geochemical processes via one dimensional reactive transport simulations the one dimensional reactive transport models implemented in phreeqc v3 for each of the systems are shown in fig 11 with all model parameters including reactions simulated explained in section 2 5 and provided in table 2 for oakridge srp adsorption desorption to gibbsite al oh 3 was simulated with the number of adsorption sites controlled by specifying the saturation indices of gibbsite at different depths thereby controlling the amount of gibbsite available gibbsite rather than ferrihydrite fe oh 3 was considered in the oakridge model as a higher variation in porewater al concentrations with depth was observed compared to porewater fe concentrations from this is was assumed that variations in the gibbsite mineral surface area had a greater influence on the srp variations with depth compared to ferrihydrite fig 10a the porewater fe concentrations were simulated by specifying the saturation indices of ferrihydrite at different depths the simulation results for oakridge agree well with the observed porewater ph al fe and srp depth profiles fig 11a not surprisingly the simulated and observed porewater ca do not match well because processes including precipitation dissolution of ca bearing minerals e g calcite were not included in this model two stages of reaction were considered for kennedy as water infiltrates through the soil media due to the distinct behaviour of the dissolved constituents at shallow depth 0 7 5 cm compared to deeper in the system at shallow depth mineralization of organic matter via fe reduction was simulated together with surface complexation reactions including srp complexation to ferrihydrite mineral surfaces see table 2 for details on reactions only srp complexation to ferrihydrite and not to gibbsite was considered for the kennedy system as the variation of porewater fe concentrations with depth was much greater than for al concentrations fig 10b therefore it was assumed the variation in srp concentrations with depth is more likely due to variability in the available ferrihydrite surface area the mineralization of organic matter via fe reduction was included as it is able to explain the sharp increase in ph at shallow depth this reaction may occur in the kennedy system as the low hydraulic conductivity provides sufficiently long residence time for organic matter mineralization reddy and delaune 2008 further the high porewater fe concentrations at shallow depth suggests the conditions are fe reducing and fe oxides ferrihydrite may serve as the electron accepter for organic matter mineralization fleischer 1978 in addition calcite dissolution was considered over the entire depth for the kennedy system as both ec fig s4 and ca fig 10b are observed to increase with depth the long residence time in the kennedy system due to the low hydraulic conductivity would provide sufficient time for calcite dissolution to occur the simulation results compare well with the observed srp concentrations with depth for the kennedy site despite not considering the possible precipitation of hydroxyapatite fig 11b as suggested by the good comparison between the simulated and observed data hydroxyapatite precipitation may only be partially contributing to srp retention in this system and srp adsorption to fe oxides ferrihydrite may be the more dominant process controlling srp in the lower sediment 7 5 cm depth for dundas it was assumed that ferrihydrite precipitation occurred in the top sediment layer due to the low hydraulic conductivity and thus long porewater residence time in these sediments similar to the kennedy system calcite dissolution was considered in the model across the entire depth of the system the model was not able to adequately simulate the observed srp depth profile and other parameter distributions with depth such as ca and ph when only surface complexation adsorption desorption to fe oxides ferrihydrite was considered therefore the precipitation of hydroxyapatite was included in the model of the dundas system fig 11c secondary minerals such as vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o were not included as the data suggest they are not a major controlling process due to the observed inconsistent trends between dissolved fe with srp fig 10c a reasonable match between the simulated and observed results with respect to srp ca and ph was obtained after the including hydroxyapatite precipitation suggesting that hydroxyapatite precipitation may play a role in srp retention in the dundas system as explained above this is consistent with the lower hydraulic conductivity and thus longer residence times in this system which provide sufficient time for this precipitation reaction 4 2 factors influencing srp retention hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity directly affects the porewater residence time in bioretention systems rate controlled reactions including organic matter mineralization and hydroxyapatite precipitation and subsequently the redox conditions in the soil media in systems with high hydraulic conductivity and thus shorter residence times srp can be retained by adsorption onto al and fe oxides due to the short time scale of adsorption reactions lucas and greenway 2011 lyngsie et al 2015 high hydraulic conductivity is often associated with more oxidizing conditions which is favourable for fe oxide precipitation and subsequent srp adsorption however soil media with low hydraulic conductivity can result in less oxidizing conditions or even anoxic conditions tirpak et al 2021 this may impact the srp retention performance in systems where the adsorption onto fe oxides is the major retention process glaister et al 2014 kratky et al 2018 for example the release of srp at shallow depth in the kennedy system is attributed to reductive dissolution of fe oxides via organic matter degradation and subsequent srp desorption this reaction also increases the ph which further promotes srp desorption from fe oxide surfaces organic matter degradation via fe oxide reduction was able to occur in the shallow layer of this system due to the low hydraulic conductivity and thus long residence time for systems where srp is thought to be mainly retained by precipitation of ca phosphate minerals e g hydroxyapatite such as dundas the low hydraulic conductivity provides sufficient residence time for ca phosphate mineral precipitation to occur lyngsie et al 2014 stoner et al 2012 however it is important to note that the hydraulic conductivity of bioretention media is recommended to be higher than that observed at both dundas and kennedy to limit ponding and ensure rapid infiltration through the media credit valley conservation authority and toronto and region conservation authority 2010 as such bioretention systems with fe rich media should be designed with high hydraulic conductivity to ensure conditions remain favourable for fe oxidation in the system organic content previous studies have demonstrated that adding organic matter to the soil media can enhance removal of metals and nitrogen in bioretention systems hsieh and davis 2005 however the breakdown of organic matter releases srp bratieres et al 2008 hsieh and davis 2005 organic matter degradation via fe reduction is thought to be occurring in the top sediment of the kennedy system leading to high porewater ph and srp release from al and fe oxides the srp release directly from the transformation from organic p is comparatively not thought to be major source of porewater srp in addition the organic matter competes for adsorption sites with the srp guan et al 2006 which may further influence the retention of srp in a bioretention system based on data for the kennedy system it is recommended that anaerobic degradation of organic matter be avoided within bioretention systems to prevent high ph conditions and srp release aerobic degradation of organic matter may also impact srp retention in bioretention systems theoretically the degradation of organic matter via aerobic respiration produces co2 which generates acidity and lowers ph arndt et al 2013 however the decrease of ph caused by aerobic organic matter degradation can be buffered by calcareous minerals in the soil media e g calcite if conditions remain oxic the srp produced from aerobic organic matter degradation may adsorb to al and fe oxides that are present this may explain why we do not observe high porewater srp concentrations in oakridge waterloo and black creek where the organic content and orp values are high in the top sediments therefore the data indicate that provided conditions in the system remain oxic the organic content in the media is not a critical factor for evaluating the suitability of a soil media composition for srp retention for instance oakridge black creek and dundas have a much higher organic contents than kennedy but porewater srp concentrations are considerably lower for these former bioretention systems ph and orp ph strongly influences the srp retention in soils including within the bioretention systems cucarella and renman 2009 marvin et al 2020 penn et al 2017 singh and gilkes 1991 different srp retention processes have different optimal ph conditions for example ca phosphate precipitation is more favourable at alkaline ph as these minerals are more soluble under acidic conditions serpone 1996 srp retention via al and fe oxides adsorption is more favourable at near neutral ph stoner et al 2012 in this study the ph and srp within most systems showed similar trends with depth figs s2e 7e suggesting that srp retention in bioretention systems is highly ph sensitive particularly when srp adsorption to al and fe oxides is the major retention mechanism the surface charge on al and fe oxides minerals becomes negative at higher ph which reduces srp adsorption onto these phases zhou et al 2005 the conditions in all the bioretention systems were oxidizing with kennedy having the lowest porewater orp 145 9 mv among all the bioretention systems fig 5 the lower orp in the kennedy system may have facilitated the degradation of organic matter via fe reduction with in turn may have reduced the abundance of fe oxides and thus available adsorption sites the influence of orp on srp retention is also evident from the inverse behaviour of orp and srp with depth in systems such as kennedy and black creek figs 7 s3 drying wetting process previous studies indicate that drying wetting cycles can influence the redox conditions which subsequently affect metal distributions in sediments saeki et al 1993 this has also been shown in bioretention systems blecken et al 2009 as a redox sensitive metal fe may be influenced by drying wetting cycles which in turn affects srp retention via reductive fe oxide dissolution and srp desorption during dry periods sufficiently long residence times can allow for slow and less reversible adsorption reactions to occur that facilitate srp retention this can lead to comparatively lower srp concentration in porewater during dry periods compared to wet periods lucas and greenway 2008 marvin et al 2020 this phenomenon was observed in systems such as in oakridge black creek and waterloo for which the sediment hydraulic conductivity sediment is high figs s5 4b in contrast the srp concentrations were similar between dry and wet periods for the dorchester kennedy and dundas systems fig s5 these systems all have lower hydraulic conductivity fig 4b it is possible the lower hydraulic conductivity for these systems results in the geochemical conditions including redox within the system remaining relatively stable over the drying wetting cycles amount of infiltrating water as shown in fig 7 the srp depth profiles are considerably different between the upstream and downstream locations for most of the bioretention systems the upstream location generally receives more infiltrating water this is expected to result in lower residence times more infiltration of oxic water and more dilution leading to lower srp porewater concentrations compared to the downstream location as observed for oakridge waterloo kennedy and dundas the differences in the infiltrating water volumes also results in different sediment water ratios theoretically higher sediment water ratio for the downstream locations will lead to higher concentration of srp in porewater ádám et al 2007 cucarella and renman 2009 søvik and kløve 2005 it is important to note that the black creek system receives runoff from all directions with no curb cut inlets and therefore there is no clear difference in the srp concentrations between the upstream and downstream locations fig 7c further in dorchester there are curb cut inlets near the upstream and downstream sampling profile locations however the downstream location usually has more ponded water than the upstream location based on field observations this is consistent with porewater srp found to be lower at the downstream compared with the upstream location for dorchester fig 7 this comparison between the upstream and downstream locations highlight the importance of the overall bioretention system design and function in governing srp retention in addition to the soil media composition 5 conclusions overall the findings of this study indicate that while the specific composition of the soil media used in the bioretention systems is important for srp retention more attention should be given to overall design of field scale bioretention system with respect to hydraulic conductivity overall redox conditions and physical and chemical composition of the surface cover layer srp behaviour was found to be highly heterogeneous in the six bioretention systems studied and considerably more complex than the behaviour typically observed in laboratory column experiments ádám et al 2007 rosenquist et al 2010 in bioretention systems with high hydraulic conductivity adsorption desorption to al and fe oxides is thought to be the major srp retention mechanism due to the short porewater residence times and more oxidizing conditions in the system oxidizing conditions are thought to lead to rapid adsorption of srp to al fe oxides with srp concentrations sharply decreasing at shallow depth while srp retention via adsorption to al and fe oxides is not directly affected by the porewater residence time it may be indirectly affected by reactions that can occur when the porewater residence time is greater e g organic matter degradation moreover srp adsorption to al and fe oxides is sensitive to ph especially in more alkaline conditions ph 8 therefore reactions that increases ph such as organic matter degradation via fe reduction as observed in the kennedy bioretention system must be avoided by increasing the soil media hydraulic conductivity and maintaining oxic condition within the system in bioretention systems with low hydraulic conductivity it is possible for srp retention to occur by both srp adsorption onto al and fe oxides and the precipitation of ca phosphate minerals e g hydroxyapatite because of the longer porewater residence times however it is important to note that the low hydraulic conductivity media used in two of the systems studied dundas kennedy should be avoided as their reduced infiltration capacity led to excessive surface water ponding during precipitation events credit authorship contribution statement yi liu conceptualization methodology

4301,the lancang river upper mekong originated from qinghai tibet plateau is the main water source for southeast asia countries in recent years people have paid more and more attention to the impact of climate change and human activities on the lancang river water resources system due to external disturbances the vulnerability of water resources in the lancang river basin lrb is also changing leading to an increase in the probability of possible risks this study proposes an assessment framework to evaluate water resources system vulnerability and analyze its dynamic change in the lrb during 1998 2014 quantitative approaches for calculation of sensitivity exposure hazard and adaptability are respectively formulated which highlight the impacts of natural and anthropogenic interference on water resources specific management strategies are put forward based on the spatial recognition of water resources system vulnerable areas in the lrb the results indicate that the sensitivity and exposure of the lrb show an upward trend while the adaptive capacity shows a downward trend during 1998 2014 the vulnerability of the lrb is at low level currently however fluctuations in its vulnerability have increased over time as a whole the vulnerability displays a high to low gradient from southeast to northwest of the lrb during the study period the dali region is the most vulnerable region in the lrb the areas with high vulnerability are distributed in the southeast of the study area mainly in the mainstream areas with characterization of frequent human interferences tend to increase persistently based on the results some suggestions targeted at different vulnerable areas were proposed this study maps the spatiotemporal characteristics of the water resource vulnerability in the lrb which reveals hotspot areas from climate related threats and can provide useful information to improve the adaptation and resilience of the water resources system keywords climate change vulnerability spatial analyses lancang river 1 introduction the term water resource system vulnerability is considered to be the resistance of the water resources system to external interference and the ability to respond to natural disasters tang et al 2000 koutroulis et al 2019 dong et al 2020 the vulnerability of the water resources system is not only restricted by the temporal and spatial evolution of the water cycle and water resources under the influence of climate change and human activities but is also closely related to the regional characteristics of water resource demand and its impact on the social economy and ecological environment abera et al 2019 koech et al 2019 sharma et al 2019 climate change and anthropogenic activities have increasingly greater impacts on water resources systems gain and wada 2014 lee and yeh 2019 and increasing water security risks hinkel 2011 rodrigues et al 2014 zhong et al 2018 approximately 80 of the world s population faces high levels of water security risk vörösmarty et al 2010 furthermore the asymmetry between supply and demand also weakened the capacity of water resources xia jun et al 2012a acessment of water resource vulnerability which has been at the forefront of global hydrology and water research alonso et al 2019 can help reduce the vulnerability of the water resources system mitigate the consequences of climate change enhance our knowledge of the water resource status of a region and contribute to the formulation of local plans for sustainable development over the past decade extensive efforts have been made by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc to assess the risks and vulnerabilities of studies that have contributed to the development of theory and practice füssel and klein 2006 field and barros 2014 increasingly complex and diverse methodologies are being used to assess vulnerability including the index system method cai et al 2017 boruff et al 2018 alonso et al 2019 the simple index method falkenmark 1989 sullivan and meigh 2005 and the model analysis method malone and engle 2011 yao et al 2020 the index system method is currently the most widely used method in research of water resources system vulnerability anandhi and kannan 2018 paula et al 2019 nguyen et al 2020 some previous studies have attempted to establish the assessment indicator system of the vulnerability of the water resources system from many attributes such as adaptability robinson et al 2020 disaster hazard zhu et al 2019 and ecological environment kharrazi et al 2016 there were also studies that reflect vulnerability from a comprehensive perspective watson et al 2013 mortazavi naeini et al 2019 xue et al 2019 for example the driver pressure state impact response dpsir framework sun et al 2016 and ipcc s framework field and barros 2014 however there are several challenges associated with these methods first due to the mutual influence of different factors the vulnerability brought about by the change of one factor may be re changed by the impact of other factors which leads to the cumulative effect of vulnerability secondly the characteristics of strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity of water resources diverse causes of vulnerability and significant multi dimensional attributes have greatly increased the difficulty of quantifying vulnerability meanwhile a large number of indicators also require a large amount of data support there are difficulties in the availability and applicability of data therefore in the context of climate change and human activities it is necessary to comprehensively consider the impact of climate change and land cover land use based on the risk probability to select simple indicators and carry out multi indicator and multi dimensional vulnerability analysis so as to provide a scientific basis for the integrated watershed management the lancang river upper mekong originated from qinghai tibet plateau is the main water source for southeast asia countries and attracts more and more attention most studies in the lrb focus on runoff changes han et al 2019 land use changes pavisorn et al 2020 hydropower changes zhong et al 2019 under climate change there are few studies on the comprehensive vulnerability of water systems in the lrb there are two reasons the first is that the upper reaches of the lbr is still an ungauged basin with insufficient research data the second is that the lrb is located in southwest china with relatively abundant water resources where the study of water resources hazards is easier to be ignored as compared with arid regions where water resources is poor koech et al 2019 the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall in the lrb is uneven with more droughts in spring and more floods in summer which is characterized by large spatial difference high frequency and short interval of disaster ma et al 2018 in addition economic development has stimulated large scale land and water exploitation along with increasingly intensified human activities characterized by grazing intensive land use and urbanization leading to significant changes in land use and land cover in the lrb as well as ecological and environmental problems such as forest land degradation and destruction of alpine vegetation liu et al 2018 gao et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to develop systematic analysis methods that can systematically quantify water resource vulnerability in the lrb and work out adaptive countermeasures for water resources protection of lrb based on water resource vulnerability consequently in view of the lack of data in the lrb and the incomplete research on water resources vulnerability this study proposes a framework that involves physical mechanisms coupled with multiple elements for assessing the water resources system vulnerability in the lrb we not only coupled the budyko formula budyko 1974 with fu s evapotranspiration ratio fu 1981 and schaake s climate elasticity coefficient schaake 1990 to assess the sensitivity of water resources to climate but also rewrote xia and chen s formula chen et al 2016 xia et al 2017 to calculate the exposure in addition we initially considered the risk of water resource system vulnerability caused by drought flood transition events more importantly we formulated our own approach to calculate the adaptive capacity this study indicates the source of ideas and methods for each part of the calculation this framework quantitatively assesses the spatial variability and temporal dynamics of water system vulnerability through components of the sensitivity exposure hazard and adaptability furthermore our selection of indicators is simple and has a clear physical concept the data used to measure the various components of the vulnerability of water resources system is easily available and applicable this paper describes the conceptual framework and detailed methods for assessing water resources system vulnerability reports the results of its temporal changes 1998 2014 in the entire study area the results give appropriate adaptability recommendations for different vulnerability zones the current study aims to highlight the nature and human disturbances affecting the vulnerability of the water resources system in a causal context and understand the potential risks of water resources systems to facilitate the development of adaptive countermeasures 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the lancang mekong river is the largest international river in asia the chinese part of the river which is called the mekong river in other countries is known as the lancang river it originates from the northern portion of the tanggula mountains in the qinghai tibetan plateau in southwestern china fig 1 the river flows from north to south through china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam before finally discharging into the south china sea in southern vietnam zhai et al 2016 the area of the lrb is 174 000 km2 and the length is approximately 2161 km he et al 2005 it is rich in hydropower reserves and is a water tower for areas downstream zhong et al 2019 it can regulates the dry season river runoff for the downstream southeast asian countries the water resources utilization and management of the lrb are of much concern by relevant organizations and governments in both china and abroad yun et al 2020 the lrb is one of the most sensitive areas to global climate change it has diverse topographical conditions and a variety of climatic zones because of the presence of many high mountains and deep valleys in southwestern china bo et al 2009 in the rainy season april october large amounts of rainfall are stimulated by the influence of wet southwest monsoons from the bay of bengal water is abundant but unevenly distributed and approximately 90 of annual rainfall occurs during the rainy season zhong et al 2018 in contrast the dry season november march is prone to serious drought 2 2 data description this study is based on the analysis of daily meteorological data including precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine duration atmospheric pressure and wind speed observed at 42 meteorological stations situated within the lrb distribution is shown in fig 1 these data used to calculate the sensitivity were obtained from the china meteorological administration the monthly runoff data of jiuzhou and yunjinghong station were provided by the hydrological bureau of yunnan province of china the monthly runoff data of qamdo station were provided by the hydrological bureau of the tibet autonomous region of china the data used to calculate the adaptability index including total water content and water consumption were taken from the water resources bulletin of yunnan published by the ministry of water resources of china and bulletin of yangtze river basin and southwest river resources published by the changjiang water resources committee the data used to calculate the exposure index including gridded population density gdp per unit area and the type of land use with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km were provided by the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences huang et al 2014 the data used to draw topographic maps dem 90 m were obtained from the international scientific data platform of the chinese academy of sciences the information of the above data is shown in table 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 framework for quantifying the vulnerability of the water resources system under climate change the ipcc ar5 report notes the inherent relationship between climate change events vulnerabilities risks exposures and further categorizes disasters as a result of the coupling of vulnerability exposure and climate events field and barros 2014 water resource vulnerability refers to the degree of external disturbance tang et al 2000 that is the comprehensive consideration of the vulnerability of the water resources system to climate change extreme events human activities and other factors xia jun et al 2012b therefore in this study water resource vulnerability refers to the sensitivity of water resources systems to climate change the pressures on the water resources systems the exposure and damage caused by the population and socioeconomic scale the definition of water system vulnerability is to measure the degree of damage from exposure to stresses as well as the sensitivity and resilience of the system to human activities and natural causes water vulnerability in a changing environment is a function of the water resources system s sensitivity s to climate change the adaptability a of the water resources system and the exposed environment e in which the socio economic and natural resources are exposed and the possible hazard h to the system smit and wandel 2006 1 vulnerability v sensitivity s α 1 e x p o s u r e e α 2 h a z a r d h α 3 adaptability a α 4 where v is the vulnerability of the water resources system s is the sensitivity of the water resources system which indicates the impact of climate change on water resources field and barros 2014 e is the exposure which refers to the socio economic and natural resources that are threatened by a lack of water resources karmaoui and balica 2019 h is the hazard which indicates the possibility of a disaster the intensity scale and the degree of damage caused a is the adaptive capacity of the water resources system which is the capacity of any kind of system society or environment to adapt under the potential exposure to hazards pelling 2012 α i represents the weight of each component and the weight range is 0 α i 1 according to the results of previous research chen et al 2016 as well as the evaluation standards of many international organizations on the scarcity of water resources combined with the delphi method the values are respectively α 1 0 5 α 2 0 4 α 3 0 1 α 4 0 5 in this study vulnerability was grouped into five categories little vulnerability v 0 2 low vulnerability 0 2 v 0 4 moderate vulnerability 0 4 v 0 6 high vulnerability 0 6 v 0 8 and severe vulnerability 0 8 v 1 0 2 3 2 calculation of the sensitivity of the water resources system sensitivity is the degree to which a particular system or environment is affected by climate pressure climate pressure can be expressed as an indicator such as the amount of change in resources relative to climate change field and barros 2014 water resources sensitivity can be defined as the percentage change in the mean annual streamflow occurring in response to a change in the mean annual precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e 0 donohue et al 2011 the original budyko hypothesis states that actual evapotranspiration e is mainly controlled by available water and energy evapotranspiration ratio e p can be expressed as a function of aridity index φ e 0 p precipitation p reflects available water potential evapotranspiration e 0 reflects available energy budyko 1974 the budyko hydrothermal coupling equilibrium equation can better describe the quantitative relationship between precipitation potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration yang et al 2008 zhan et al 2014 guo et al 2015 wu et al 2017 this study use the f φ expression calculation proposed by fu 1981 2 e p f e 0 p ω f φ ω 1 φ 1 φ ω 1 ω where ω represents the hydrothermal coupling control parameters assuming that p e 0 and ω of above formula are independent of each other combined with the long term average water balance equation of the basin that is r p e the total differential of r can be used to assess 3 δ r r p δ p r e 0 δ e 0 r ω δ ω where r δ r are actual runoff and changes in runoff respectively δ p and δ e 0 are changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively combined with the climate elasticity coefficient proposed by schaake 1990 eg the climate elasticity coefficient of precipitation is denoted as ε p dr r dp p the eq 3 can be written 4 δ r r ε p δ p p ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 ε ω δ ω ω where ε p ε e 0 and ε ω represent the sensitivity coefficients of r with respect to p e 0 and ω respectively in this framework the impact of climate change on runoff is express as ε p δ p p ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 the last term ε ω δ ω ω in eq 4 is considered to represent the effect of changes in the catchment mainly as a result of human activities accroding the dinfition of sensitivity of the water resources system in this study we mainly considered the impact of climate change on runoff i e the first two parts of the eq 4 based on previous researchs arora 2002 the elasticity coefficient of potential evapotranspiration can be expressed by the elasticity coefficient of precipitation ε e 0 1 ε p the runoff is more correlated with precipitation therefore we selected ε p as the elasticity rate of runoff to changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration combining eq 2 3 and 4 we can deduce the expression of ε p 5 ε p 1 φ ω 1 ω 1 φ ω 1 φ ω 1 ω φ where ω can be derived from the measured rate of change of natural runoff in this study the rate of change of natural runoff was estimated by using the rate of change of the measured natural runoff in the study area from 1960 to 1990 and 1991 2006 the climate elasticity coefficient ε p increases as the aridity index increases furthermore larger values of ε p indicate larger changes in runoff if precipitation or potential evaporation changes for the convenience of subsequent calculations according to the positive relationship between s and ε p the sensitivity coefficient value is converted to the sensitivity coefficient of the 0 1 interval by the following equation 6 s 1 e ε p 1 e ε p ε p 0 ε p 0 in this study the potential evapotranspiration of each site was calculated separately by penman monteith method and kriging interpolation was used to spatialize evapotranspiration and perform subsequent sensitivity calculations 2 3 3 calculation of the exposure of the water resources system exposure is a vulnerable location for population livelihoods ecological services and resources facilities as well as social economic and cultural assets field and barros 2014 in this study exposure refers to the extent of the population gdp and land at risk in other words increased exposure corresponds to people or property occurring in dangerous areas that are more exposed to disasters the magnitude of exposure represents the amount and degree of people and property facing the risks associated with disasters exposure increases with the size of the population the value of assets or property and the extent of land use damage chen et al 2016 this study ues the formula from previous research chen et al 2016 xia et al 2017 we also consider different types of land use as risk indicators different land use can suffer from different levels of risk for example in the face of disasters farmlands cause more losses than grasslands and its ability to resist risks is weaker we believe that the three influencing factors of population economy and land are parallel and have a common impact therefore according to the positive relationship between the exposure of water resources e and the sub exposure e i we rewrite the following formula to estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of exposure based on geographic information systems gis 7 e 1 3 e pop e gdp e land where e i is the sub exposure including the population exposure e pop economic exposure e gdp and land exposure e land in the above formula the population and economic indicators use the average density which is the ratio of the population and gross domestic product gdp to the area respectively the sub exposure of population and gdp was normalized to the range of 0 1 using a normalization method eq 8 the normalized equation is presented as the difference between the calculated value and the minimum value of the entire sample divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the entire sample 8 e normalized x x min x max x min the sub exposure of land use was evaluated by the degree to which different land use types are affected by disasters table 2 2 3 4 calculation of the hazard of the water resources system the hazard of water resources refers to the possibility of a disaster the intensity scale and the degree of damage caused in a certain area cheng et al 2013 the risk of the water resources system therefore can be defined as the intensity scale and the possibility of damage caused by water disaster the hazard of water resources disaster events is mainly the occurrence of droughts and floods therefore their hazards vary with the possibility of disaster events the intensity of the event and the severity of the consequences caused by the duration of the event therefore it is necessary to analyze the risk of water resources disaster events based on the meteorological and hydrological data of the study area itself in this study the probabilistic analysis method was selected for risk analysis and evaluation the phenomenon of the drought flood transition is prominent on the ground of the frequent extreme hydrological events in the region in addition the losses caused by drought flood transition are several times that of individual disasters therefore this study mainly studies the risk of drought flood transition specifically the copula function is used to calculate the joint distribution probability of disaster duration and disaster intensity as the hazard of the water resources system sklar 1959 on the basis of the standard weighted average precipitation swap index the swap is based on the water income and decay model it characterizes the current drought and flood conditions according to the current and previous precipitation and can analyze the dry and wet conditions of the area on a daily scale lu 2009 lu et al 2014 the swap is introduced to calculate hazard in the study which considers the previous water content to replaces the traditional spi method here the definition of the drought flood transition is a flood event s w a p 0 5 occurs within 5 days after the end of a drought event s w a p 0 5 within a certain period of time in addition the start time of the drought flood transition event is the start time of the drought event and the end time is the end time of the flood event based on this use run length theory to identify duration and intensity of disaster define the following formula to describe the intensity of drought flood transition 9 s ci swa p e swa p l d i l i where s ci is the intensity of the i th drought flood transition event swap e represents the cumulative intensity of drought events before the transition point intensity of drought and swap l is the cumulative intensity of flood events after the sudden transition point intensity of flood d i is the duration of the transition event that is the number of days from the start to the end of the event l i is the interval of days that is the number of days between the end of the drought event and the start of the flood event in the i th drought flood transition event furthermore in order to determine the annual hazard it is necessary to determine the sequences of the duration and intensity of the drought flood transition events in the current year the hazard of the water resources system is caputured by the joint distribution probability of the two variable due to any high value of duration or intensity will bring a full threat and cause serious consequences therefore the joint distribution probability under the or return period is used here that is it is a dangerous event if any disaster element exceeds a given threshold the formula for calculating the hazard of water resources is as follows 10 h c f d d f s s where c is the joint distribution probability of duration and intensity f d d f s s are the probability distribution functions of disaster duration and intensity respectively the specific calculation process is explained in detail in the wang s article wang et al 2021 2 3 5 calculation of the adaptive capacity of the water resources system the adaptability of the water resources system refers to the ability of the system to reduce potential damage maintain its structural balance or respond to the consequences of impacts under the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities field and barros 2014 that is the adaptability of the water resources system is the resilience or recoverability against the pressures of climate change and human social and economic activities ning et al 2016 therefore the adaptability of water resources can be composed of indicators reflecting the pressure of water resources water stress is driven by high density population and future demand growth wan et al 2014 river basin water system stress can be decomposed into two dimensions water demand pressure and water resources carrying population pressure falkenmark and molden 2008 the pressure of water demand can be described by the exploitation ratio of water resources and the water resources carrying population pressure can be described by water crowding or available water resources per capita this study uses the water resource scarcity indicator proposed by the malin falknmark s sustaining water as an evaluation criterion as shown in table 3 when the available water resources per capita were less than 3000 m3 water shortage problems begin to occur when the per capita available water resources are less than 1700 m3 the water shortage problem that affects normal life and social order begins to occur falkenmark 1992 the integrated indicators above were used to assess the adaptability of water resources the adaptability increases as the available water resources per capita w p increases and decreases as the water resources development rate r increases thus the adaptability is directly proportional to w p but inversely proportional to r the adaptive capacity a is calculated by 11 a f r w p 1 e w p 1700 k r 1 where k is the scale factor of the pressure coefficient changing with the exploitation ratio of water resources previous research suggests that when the per capita water resources in the region are less than 500 m3 and the exploitation ratio of water resources reaches 70 serious social and ecological problems can result if efficient water use measures and ecological environmental protection measures are not adopted chen et al 2016 xia et al 2017 in addition the upper limit for the reasonable development of a river is generally thought to occur at a water resource utilization rate of 40 according to the development utilization rate of 40 and the pressure critical value of 0 4 k is 4 89 by fitting w p is the available water resources per capita here refer to the calculation method that proposaled by xia et al 2017 12 w p w a p op w t w eco μ p op where w a is the available water resources p op is the amount of the population μ is the water quality compliance rate in this study we assume that μ is equal to 1 this is because on the one hand the river of study area is generally located in the mountains and valleys and on the other hand the level of human development activities in the lrb is relatively low compared with other rivers in china during the study period the pollution level caused by human activities is relatively low w t is the total water resources w eco is the ecological water demand which consists of the ecological water demand in the river and the ecological water demand outside the river the ecological water demand in the river was calculated using the internationally popular tennant method tennant 1976 in this study the short term requirement is to minimally ensure healthy ecological growth outside of the river the retention of sufficient ecological water is necessary for ensuring the healthy development of the natural ecosystems that human beings depend on so that they continue to serve humanity therefore when calculating the utilization rate of water resources development the development and utilization of water resources in the river basin will be underestimated to a certain extent if the ecological water demand is also taken as the total amount of water resources this study uses the ratio of water withdrawn to available water resources to express the water resources development rate 13 r w u w a w u w t w eco where w u is water use which denotes the total water use for agriculture industries and domestics 3 results 3 1 the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of meteorological elements the spatial distribution of meteorological elements and sen slope in the study area were calculated according to the meteorological data the annual precipitation in the study area was not only restricted by the weather system but was also affected by geographical environment factors such as topography which exists significant spatial differences annual precipitation in the study area was generally lower upstream and greater downstream gradually decreasing from downstream to upstream the upstream source area belongs to an alpine climate zone with high terrain and dry air resulting in scarce precipitation the precipitatiom is mostly concentrated in the summer most of which comes in the form of showers the river of study area is deep and the variation change in precipitation is prominent vertically sen s slope in the study area ranged between 5 56 mm a 1 55 mm a fig 2 left the annual precipitation of stations in the upper reaches showed an increasing trend which decreased more significant in downstream additionally from 1960 to 2014 there was a slight decrease in the annual precipitation in the study area z 1 07 1 96 and the sen s slope was 6 8 mm 10a with an abrupt change around 1978 shown in fig 2 right the spatial distribution of the annual average temperature in the study area and the trend in the change of the annual average temperature are shown in fig 3 the average temperature in the study area ranged between 5 2 c and 22 0 c the average temperature decreased as latitude and altitude increased the results of the sen s slope analysis revealed that the annual average temperature of all stations showed an upward trend among which the southeast stations increased significantly the trend in temporal change and change points of annual temperature in the study area are shown in fig 3 the annual average temperature in the study area from 1960 to 2014 showed a significantly increasing trend z 6 07 greater than 1 96 and the sen s slope was 0 30 c 10a what s more the spatial distribution and the variation of annual average potential evapotranspiration in the study area are shown in fig 4 because of differences in solar radiation water vapor content and temperature the study area experiences both high total solar radiation and high evaporation and areas with higher altitudes are characterized by low potential evaporation the magnitude of potential evapotranspiration is related to wind speed radiation status and air humidity the overall spatial variation trend of the average potential evapotranspiration in the study area was low in the north and high in the south the annual average potential evapotranspiration in most areas was between 800 mm and 1100 mm in the upper reaches in the downstream area generally exceeds 1100 mm with obvious regional differences the sen s slope in the study area was approximately 2 0 mm a 5 0 mm a and most of stations showed an increasing trend as shown in fig 4 there was a significant increase in the annual potential evapotranspiration overall z 3 30 greater than 1 96 where the change could be divided into three stage first increased 1960 1984 decreased 1984 2000 and then increased 2000 2014 the sen s slope was 8 4 mm 10a with an abrupt change around around 1975 and 2006 3 2 the sensitivity of the water resources system the runoff in the lancang river region is highly sensitive to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration fig 5 the sensitivity coefficient ranged from 0 65 to 0 90 the distribution of sensitivity in the study area of southwest china was spatially variable from the upstream to the downstream the sensitivity coefficient increased indicating that the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration gradually increased the upstream portions of the lrb are located in the northeastern part of the tibetan plateau with an alpine and temperate plateau climate vegetation is sparse in the upper lrb which is mainly covered by glaciers alpine forest area and sporadic valley agricultural areas global warming has led to a reduction in glaciers and frozen soil and increased uncertainty in precipitation patterns which has led to natural disasters such as floods shrinking wetlands and debris flows compared with the upper reaches of the middle and upper reaches of the sensitivity coefficient between 0 65 and 0 75 the lower reaches are significantly higher than the middle and upper reaches and the sensitivity coefficients are almost between 0 75 and 0 90 this also means that the yunnan province which is located in the subtropical monsoon climate zone of the western yunnan guizhou plateau is more sensitive to climate in terms of water resources these consequences of global warming not only lead to the deterioration of the upstream ecological environment but also pose a threat to societies downstream comparison of the sensitivity of the water resources system of the 1960 s 1970 s 1980 s 1990 s 2000 s and 2010 s revealed that the sensitivity coefficient in the northwestern portion of the study area remained basically unchanged the northwestern region of the upper reaches has a slight fluctuation within 50 years and the change range is within 0 1 the sensitivity of water resources to climate change on the interdecadal scale in the middle reaches is basically unchanged and the change range is less than 0 05 in contrast the sensitivity difference in the southeastern part of the lancang river basin is obvious the area of the area with a sensitivity coefficient greater than 0 8 spreads from right to left over time by 2010 the sensitivity coefficient of the basic downstream area exceeded 0 8 over the past 50 years the pattern of change in precipitation has not been conspicuous but the temperature is increasing evaporation increases as the temperature increases leading to a decrease in runoff and a reduction in the sensitivity coefficient in the downstream of the lrb the landcover consists of evergreen broadleaf forest shrubs and grassland forest ecosystems often contain deep rooted plants which show better performance in terms of soil and water conservation since 1980 the middle and downstream regions of the lrb began to show rapid economic development a large number of forests have been converted into farmland and grassland which decreases the soil s water retention increasing the runoff and in turn the sensitivity coefficient 3 3 the exposure of the water resources system fig 6 shows the different types of exposure of the water resources system in the study area the distributions of population exposure and economic exposure were similar the distribution of land showed low spatial variability high values of exposure commonly appeared in the southeastern portion of the study area and high values are also scattered in the upstream of the lrb excluding a few general values the rest of the upstream regions had low exposure values compared with the rest of the regions of the study area the southeastern portion of the study area located in yunnan province china has higher population density and higher gdp the high value point in the upstream region was located in qamdo and its surroundings qamdo is a well developed city in tibet and is known as the pearl of eastern tibet regions with relatively high exposure values coincided with high population density and high unit area gdp additionally farmland is highly susceptible to disasters and is also scattered in the study area fig 6 regions with relatively low exposure values coincided with low population density low unit area gdp and predominant land use classified as woodland grassland and unused land rapid population growth and expansion of irrigated farmlands during the last two decades have imposed increasing pressure on water resources as can be seen from fig 6 the land use changes in the lrb from 1960 to 2015 were not very obvious some of the grassland has become farmland and dry land for economic development and human life table 4 residential land increased year by year residential land increased the most in 2010 2020 reaching 111 26 which also indicated the economic development and population development of the lrb changes in population economy and land use will inevitably increase the asymmetry between water supply and demand these factors will undoubtedly increase the vulnerability of the water resources system of the lrb 3 4 hazard of the water resources system due to the large number of meteorological stations and the correlation between them rotated empirical orthogonal function reof is used to divide the lancang river basin based on the swap index and the lancang river basin was divided into five regions dali lincang xishuangbanna qamdo and yushu spatio temporal analysis of the hazard of water resources system in five regions fig 7 the overall water resource system hazard of the lrb is very unstable and there is great uncertainty in the 1960 s the hazards of the lrb decreased with the decrease of latitude and altitude the upstream area had a higher risk while the downstream area had a lower risk from the 1970 s to the 1990 s the hazard in the central area of the lrb showed a significant increase which means that the probability and frequency of mild and severe drought flood transition events in qamdo dali and lincang areas were increasing in the 21st century the overall hazard of the lrb was relatively high all above 0 4 in the context of climate change the hazard of water resources systems has shown an increasing trend in the study area this means that the probability of long duration and high intensity drought flood transition is increasing and its impact is more far reaching and the losses caused are more serious 3 5 the adaptive capacity of the water resources system across the entire study area water resources were characterized by high adaptability fig 8 the adaptability coefficient of the qinghai tibet region in the upper reaches of the region was nearly 1 the exploitation ratio of water resources was only approximately 1 and per capita water resources were more than 15 000 m3 which is much larger than the threshold of 3000 m3 in the dali and lincang regions the adaptability coefficient was slightly lower compared with the upstream region this region has a larger population lower per capita water resources and a correspondingly greater exploitation ratio of water resources over the past 15 years the average water consumption in the lbr was 2 8 billion cubic meters accounting for only approximately 4 1 of the average total water resources the development and utilization of water resources in the upper and lower reaches of the region were quite different specifically the development and utilization of water resources were relatively high in the downstream areas but low in the upstream areas the exploitation ratio of water resources across the entire study area was approximately 10 and the per capita water consumption was higher than 3000 m3 water stress is considered low when the exploitation ratio of water resources does not exceed 10 perveen and james 2011 in addition to the zonal distribution the distribution of water resources was basically consistent with the distribution of precipitation fig 9 a the upstream yushu and qamdo regions have the smallest runoff depth the lincang and xishaungbanna regions in the lower reaches have the largest runoff depth in general the amount of surface water resources in the lrb has shown a decreasing trend since 2000 fig 9b the amount of surface water resources in most years was smaller than the multi year average the total water consumption of the study area generally showed a gradual increasing trend from 2000 to 2015 the total water consumption in the basin increased from 2 61 to 2 81 billion cubic meters the total water consumption in the upper and middle reaches of the river basin has increased rapidly the average annual growth rates of total water consumption in qinghai and tibet in the upper and middle reaches were 3 34 and 4 59 respectively yunnan province which is located downstream has an average annual growth rate of 0 67 with the development of the social economy the ever decreasing total amount of water resources and rising water consumption will gradually increase the pressure on water resources in the lrb in the future and the adaptability of water resources will gradually decrease 3 6 the vulnerability of the water resources system the sensitivity of the water resources system to climate change exposure hazard and the adaptability of the water resources system evaluated by eq 6 eq 7 eq 10 and eq 11 respectively were combined to calculate the vulnerability of the water resources using eq 1 after the calculations the vulnerability of the study area from 1998 to 2014 was obtained fig 10 during the study period the vulnerability exhibited an exponential function of fluctuating growth in 2009 the vulnerability of the lrb water resources system reached a high value which indicates that the water resources system is threatened the reason is that the decrease in rainfall in 2009 led to a decrease in the total amount of water resources and the extreme drought from the winter of 2009 to the spring of 2010 caused greater damage to the water resources system moreover the temperature peaked during the study period during this year which increased the evapotranspiration the vulnerability declined in 2010 but later peaked again based on the vulnerability trend the increasing trend became larger and fluctuated starting in 2003 this pattern may stem from the gradual decline in forest land and grassland with water and soil conservation functions and the gradual increase in residential land at the same time the total amount of water resources was nearly below the multi year average although the average water resource system vulnerability of the lrb is relatively low the spatial distribution varies greatly this study selected 2010 as an example to explore the spatial distribution of water resource system vulnerability fig 11 the runoff in the study area was highly sensitive to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration a 10 change in precipitation can cause a change of 13 0 19 5 in water resources and a 10 change in potential evapotranspiration can result in a 3 0 9 5 change in water resources availability regarding the exposure of water resources the upper reaches of the watershed are mainly covered by grassland and the lower reaches are mainly covered by forest land however the population and economic exposure of the middle reaches is higher than that of the upper reaches therefore the lower reaches of the lrb in the southeastern portion of the study area are more exposed the adaptability of the water resources had low spatial variability the lancang river is rich in water resources and has a small water resource utilization rate and a high per capita water use capacity which makes the water resources adaptable divided by the first line of deqin and gongshan the vulnerability of the water resources system in the northern area is between 0 and 0 1 although the upstream land exposure and risk are high the adaptability of water resources is relatively high and the population density and economic development are not high making the vulnerability low the vulnerability of the water resources system in the southern region is mainly between 0 1 and 0 2 of which the vulnerability level of 0 2 0 4 is distributed in the downstream in a patch and the vulnerability level of 0 4 0 6 is mostly distributed in sporadic blocks there is high vulnerability place in dali region which is the most vulnerable region in the whole basin the water resources system in dali is sensitive to climate and has low adaptability in addition this region with relatively large population and rapid economic development has a high exposure when a disaster occurs its water resources system is vulnerable most of all basins in the study area showed little vulnerability in the water resources system where the water was sufficient and can meet the water needs of agriculture industry and ecosystems in addition the vulnerability was high where the water resources were highly susceptible to climate the exposure and hazard was high and or the adaptability was low the southeastern portion of the study area has low vulnerability compared with elsewhere this region has a higher population density and gdp 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis of the factors affecting vulnerability the sensitivity coefficient of runoff to the change in precipitation ε p and potential evapotranspiration ε e 0 can be determined using eq 4 and 5 to determine the pattern of change in the sensitivity coefficient the relationship between the climate sensitivity coefficient and the aridity index was plotted fig 12 a under the same underlying conditions the absolute value of the climate sensitivity coefficient showed a significant increasing trend when the aridity index ranged from 0 to 1 0 when the aridity index ranged from 1 0 to 1 5 the absolute value of the climate sensitivity coefficient still showed an increasing trend but the trend was less pronounced when the aridity index was greater than 1 5 the climate sensitivity gradually stabilized compared with arid regions humid regions respond more strongly to changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in arid regions changes in precipitation are more dominant than changes in potential evapotranspiration to runoff changes the results of the sensitivity analysis above are consistent with the findings of xia et al 2017 and chen et al 2016 in eq 3 ω is closely related to vegetation type soil hydraulic characteristics and terrain yang et al 2009 this parameter can be calculated through an empirical formula but the formula is relatively complicated and includes the average slope of the watershed terrain the relative infiltration capacity of the soil and the effective water storage capacity of the vegetation yang et al 2007 analogously the relationship curve between the sensitivity coefficient of ω and the aridity index can be plotted fig 12b the absolute value of the sensitivity coefficient of ω increased as the aridity index increased when the aridity index was less than 1 0 smaller ω corresponded to greater absolute values of the sensitivity coefficient of ω when the aridity index was greater than 1 0 greater ω corresponded to greater absolute values of the sensitivity coefficient of ω in other words under humid conditions less vegetation corresponded to increased sensitivity to changes in runoff to underlying surface changes li et al 2011 that is changes in precipitation can cause greater changes in runoff in grasslands than in forests dou et al 2019 4 2 proposals for the sustainable development of water resources the lrb possesses a variety of biological and forest resources from tropical to alpine regions it is rich in mineral resources and contains a large amount of water resources but it is located in a fragile ecological environment in southwest china räsänen et al 2017 zhao et al 2012 as the ability of human activities to transform natural processes strengthens the impact of changes in human activities on surface cover and on runoff cannot be ignored zhao et al 2010 however changes in hydrothermal conditions caused by climate change will also have a profound impact on river basin runoff zhong et al 2018 based on the results of this research the vulnerability of the water resources system in the lrb is low but this result does not mean that human beings can exploit water resources recklessly and change the surface coverage without restraint or planning as there are still many potential risks fig 13 shows the pattern of change in spi in the upstream region of the study area the increasing trend in spi in the upstream region indicates that there is an increased likelihood of flooding in contrast the middle and downstream regions of study area show a decreasing trend fig 13b 13c suggesting the continued increase in drought potential in addition forests in the middle and lower reaches of the study area are converted into farmland or grassland and the area of residential land is gradually incrasing this has led to an increase in runoff and all changes caused by the changing environment will inevitably have a negative impact on the long term development of the ecological environment below some suggestions for different partitions in the study area are proposed to promote the sustainable development of water resources the upper reaches of lrb in the tibetan plateau is the main area affected by global warming and is mainly covered by alpine grassland first the protection of natural forests needs to be strengthened so that the ecological health of forests is improved natural forests have made outstanding contributions to water conservation flood control and debris flow prevention second the protection of natural grassland needs to be strengthened and desertification needs to be inhibited natural grassland is the main body of vegetation in the upper reaches of the lrb the health of the plateau ecosystem depends to a large extent on the state of grassland vegetation third disaster monitoring and early warning emergency mechanisms need to be established and improved in the future consistent increases in extreme high flow may indicate greater flood or debris flow risk in the region and downstream areas the lower reaches of the lrb located in the yunnan guizhou plateau are characterized by a primarily sub tropical monsoon climate first deforestation needs to be reduced and the ecological environment needs to be protected there are many alternative ways to improve the local economy and thus protect natural forests second the rate of water resource development and the water supply need to be increased water conservation practices and reservoirs to regulate runoff need to be used and the frequency of drought needs to be reduced in the non flood seasons third soil erosion control needs to be strengthened and landslides mudslides and other disasters need to be prevented 4 3 reviewing the proposed method there are very few studies on the vulnerability of the water resources system in the lrb in previous literatures we find some dealing with the vulnerability in the region of the lancang river compare the vulnerability of water resources by administrative region of china from which the conclusions were similar to this article the rivers in the study area flow through the three provinces of qinghai tibet and yunnan in china from upstream to downstream cai et al 2017 and yao et al 2020 found that qinghai tibet and yunnan all have low vulnerability this is consistent with our conclusion that the entire study area is in a low vulnerability level furthermore qin et al 2020 s paper found that the vulnerability of yunnan is on the rising stage but the overall level is low due to rich rainfall and abundant runoff in this area this is consistent with our conclusion that the vulnerability of the downstream area in our study has increased in terms of sensitivity han et al 2019 s research can support the conclusion that the water resources system in our study area is highly sensitive to climate there is no reservoir construction in the upper reaches of the lancang river and climate change is the main driver for the change of water resources dynamic changes in exposure are similar to those observed in zhao et al 2010 and fan et al 2012 thus this study can provide a basis for formulating plans to promote economic and water resource development for the basin however because some indicators were unavailable and data were limited a few problems require consideration first the number of meteorological stations in this paper was not sufficient and the zoning of the climate in the study area cannot be achieved by classifying the data of the meteorological stations the current research can thus only be based on the spatial distribution of the vulnerability of the river basin along the river subsequent work will assess the vulnerability of the regional water resources system based on climatic zoning to achieve clear and detailed vulnerability spatialization second the time scales in this study were all in years which may weaken the potential hazards in the hydrological process during the flood season and the non flood season however because of the difficulty of obtaining quarterly or monthly data on human activity data such as water use data the time scale should be refined to highlight flood disasters during the flood season and drought disasters during the non flood season in future research 5 conclusions in this study a framework of water resource system vulnerability assessment based on coupling sensitivity exposure risk and adaptability is proposed by comprehensively considering various factors such as water resource endowment economic and social water use structure water resource system response to climate change disaster impact and risk level from a system perspective this framework quantifies the generation mechanism and attributes of vulnerability of water resources system the constructed non linear relationship can more intuitively reflect the existence of interdependent and mutually restrictive relationships between factors which has a physical mechanism in the study basin regions with relatively tight water resources but dense population distribution and high socio economic production have higher exposure after coupling sensitivity and hazard the degree of vulnerability of water resources system is more clearly divided the results show that in the context of climate change and more frequent human activities the vulnerability of water resources system in the lrb has increased exponentially over time although it is currently at little vulnerability the growth trend is very fast in addition the lrb has large spatial difference it shows an increasing trend from upstream to downstream the upper reaches are almost at little vulnerability most of the downstream are low vulnerability and moderate vulnerability areas are scattered sporadically four key elements exposure and sensitivity and hazard and adaptability are considered respectively in accordance with the matched features of vulnerability in different regions the qinghai tibet region with large water resource reserve and weak human activities has a low water system vulnerability however in the face of high probability disasters the vulnerability of regions with large populations and high levels of socio economic development is reflected in population and economic exposure such as the qamdo region therefore the local government must not only protect natural vegetation and enhance soil conservation capabilities but also strengthen the detection and early warning of disasters such as floods and mudslides compared with the upstream basin the water resource system in the downstream is more sensitive to climate and the degree of urbanization is higher which has a higher vulnerability furthermore the vulnerability of the region in the downstream with weaker human activities is reflected by water resource adaptability such as the baoshan region based on this downstream decision makers should protect the ecological environment and control the rate of soil erosion on the other hand the development and utilization of water resources should be strengthened do a good job in reservoir regulation and storage and prevent frequent drought events during non flood seasons although the lancang river is rich in water resources and thus has a large per capita water supply water should not be recklessly extracted and wasted in the future adaptability should be increased by rationally developing water resources and increasing the water supply and exposure should be reduced by protecting natural forests as adaptive countermeasures for the vulnerability and risks of the water resources system additionally the limitations in both the integrated evaluation method the indicators in this study and the fineness of the spatial zoning need to be further studied

4301,the lancang river upper mekong originated from qinghai tibet plateau is the main water source for southeast asia countries in recent years people have paid more and more attention to the impact of climate change and human activities on the lancang river water resources system due to external disturbances the vulnerability of water resources in the lancang river basin lrb is also changing leading to an increase in the probability of possible risks this study proposes an assessment framework to evaluate water resources system vulnerability and analyze its dynamic change in the lrb during 1998 2014 quantitative approaches for calculation of sensitivity exposure hazard and adaptability are respectively formulated which highlight the impacts of natural and anthropogenic interference on water resources specific management strategies are put forward based on the spatial recognition of water resources system vulnerable areas in the lrb the results indicate that the sensitivity and exposure of the lrb show an upward trend while the adaptive capacity shows a downward trend during 1998 2014 the vulnerability of the lrb is at low level currently however fluctuations in its vulnerability have increased over time as a whole the vulnerability displays a high to low gradient from southeast to northwest of the lrb during the study period the dali region is the most vulnerable region in the lrb the areas with high vulnerability are distributed in the southeast of the study area mainly in the mainstream areas with characterization of frequent human interferences tend to increase persistently based on the results some suggestions targeted at different vulnerable areas were proposed this study maps the spatiotemporal characteristics of the water resource vulnerability in the lrb which reveals hotspot areas from climate related threats and can provide useful information to improve the adaptation and resilience of the water resources system keywords climate change vulnerability spatial analyses lancang river 1 introduction the term water resource system vulnerability is considered to be the resistance of the water resources system to external interference and the ability to respond to natural disasters tang et al 2000 koutroulis et al 2019 dong et al 2020 the vulnerability of the water resources system is not only restricted by the temporal and spatial evolution of the water cycle and water resources under the influence of climate change and human activities but is also closely related to the regional characteristics of water resource demand and its impact on the social economy and ecological environment abera et al 2019 koech et al 2019 sharma et al 2019 climate change and anthropogenic activities have increasingly greater impacts on water resources systems gain and wada 2014 lee and yeh 2019 and increasing water security risks hinkel 2011 rodrigues et al 2014 zhong et al 2018 approximately 80 of the world s population faces high levels of water security risk vörösmarty et al 2010 furthermore the asymmetry between supply and demand also weakened the capacity of water resources xia jun et al 2012a acessment of water resource vulnerability which has been at the forefront of global hydrology and water research alonso et al 2019 can help reduce the vulnerability of the water resources system mitigate the consequences of climate change enhance our knowledge of the water resource status of a region and contribute to the formulation of local plans for sustainable development over the past decade extensive efforts have been made by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc to assess the risks and vulnerabilities of studies that have contributed to the development of theory and practice füssel and klein 2006 field and barros 2014 increasingly complex and diverse methodologies are being used to assess vulnerability including the index system method cai et al 2017 boruff et al 2018 alonso et al 2019 the simple index method falkenmark 1989 sullivan and meigh 2005 and the model analysis method malone and engle 2011 yao et al 2020 the index system method is currently the most widely used method in research of water resources system vulnerability anandhi and kannan 2018 paula et al 2019 nguyen et al 2020 some previous studies have attempted to establish the assessment indicator system of the vulnerability of the water resources system from many attributes such as adaptability robinson et al 2020 disaster hazard zhu et al 2019 and ecological environment kharrazi et al 2016 there were also studies that reflect vulnerability from a comprehensive perspective watson et al 2013 mortazavi naeini et al 2019 xue et al 2019 for example the driver pressure state impact response dpsir framework sun et al 2016 and ipcc s framework field and barros 2014 however there are several challenges associated with these methods first due to the mutual influence of different factors the vulnerability brought about by the change of one factor may be re changed by the impact of other factors which leads to the cumulative effect of vulnerability secondly the characteristics of strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity of water resources diverse causes of vulnerability and significant multi dimensional attributes have greatly increased the difficulty of quantifying vulnerability meanwhile a large number of indicators also require a large amount of data support there are difficulties in the availability and applicability of data therefore in the context of climate change and human activities it is necessary to comprehensively consider the impact of climate change and land cover land use based on the risk probability to select simple indicators and carry out multi indicator and multi dimensional vulnerability analysis so as to provide a scientific basis for the integrated watershed management the lancang river upper mekong originated from qinghai tibet plateau is the main water source for southeast asia countries and attracts more and more attention most studies in the lrb focus on runoff changes han et al 2019 land use changes pavisorn et al 2020 hydropower changes zhong et al 2019 under climate change there are few studies on the comprehensive vulnerability of water systems in the lrb there are two reasons the first is that the upper reaches of the lbr is still an ungauged basin with insufficient research data the second is that the lrb is located in southwest china with relatively abundant water resources where the study of water resources hazards is easier to be ignored as compared with arid regions where water resources is poor koech et al 2019 the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall in the lrb is uneven with more droughts in spring and more floods in summer which is characterized by large spatial difference high frequency and short interval of disaster ma et al 2018 in addition economic development has stimulated large scale land and water exploitation along with increasingly intensified human activities characterized by grazing intensive land use and urbanization leading to significant changes in land use and land cover in the lrb as well as ecological and environmental problems such as forest land degradation and destruction of alpine vegetation liu et al 2018 gao et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to develop systematic analysis methods that can systematically quantify water resource vulnerability in the lrb and work out adaptive countermeasures for water resources protection of lrb based on water resource vulnerability consequently in view of the lack of data in the lrb and the incomplete research on water resources vulnerability this study proposes a framework that involves physical mechanisms coupled with multiple elements for assessing the water resources system vulnerability in the lrb we not only coupled the budyko formula budyko 1974 with fu s evapotranspiration ratio fu 1981 and schaake s climate elasticity coefficient schaake 1990 to assess the sensitivity of water resources to climate but also rewrote xia and chen s formula chen et al 2016 xia et al 2017 to calculate the exposure in addition we initially considered the risk of water resource system vulnerability caused by drought flood transition events more importantly we formulated our own approach to calculate the adaptive capacity this study indicates the source of ideas and methods for each part of the calculation this framework quantitatively assesses the spatial variability and temporal dynamics of water system vulnerability through components of the sensitivity exposure hazard and adaptability furthermore our selection of indicators is simple and has a clear physical concept the data used to measure the various components of the vulnerability of water resources system is easily available and applicable this paper describes the conceptual framework and detailed methods for assessing water resources system vulnerability reports the results of its temporal changes 1998 2014 in the entire study area the results give appropriate adaptability recommendations for different vulnerability zones the current study aims to highlight the nature and human disturbances affecting the vulnerability of the water resources system in a causal context and understand the potential risks of water resources systems to facilitate the development of adaptive countermeasures 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the lancang mekong river is the largest international river in asia the chinese part of the river which is called the mekong river in other countries is known as the lancang river it originates from the northern portion of the tanggula mountains in the qinghai tibetan plateau in southwestern china fig 1 the river flows from north to south through china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam before finally discharging into the south china sea in southern vietnam zhai et al 2016 the area of the lrb is 174 000 km2 and the length is approximately 2161 km he et al 2005 it is rich in hydropower reserves and is a water tower for areas downstream zhong et al 2019 it can regulates the dry season river runoff for the downstream southeast asian countries the water resources utilization and management of the lrb are of much concern by relevant organizations and governments in both china and abroad yun et al 2020 the lrb is one of the most sensitive areas to global climate change it has diverse topographical conditions and a variety of climatic zones because of the presence of many high mountains and deep valleys in southwestern china bo et al 2009 in the rainy season april october large amounts of rainfall are stimulated by the influence of wet southwest monsoons from the bay of bengal water is abundant but unevenly distributed and approximately 90 of annual rainfall occurs during the rainy season zhong et al 2018 in contrast the dry season november march is prone to serious drought 2 2 data description this study is based on the analysis of daily meteorological data including precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine duration atmospheric pressure and wind speed observed at 42 meteorological stations situated within the lrb distribution is shown in fig 1 these data used to calculate the sensitivity were obtained from the china meteorological administration the monthly runoff data of jiuzhou and yunjinghong station were provided by the hydrological bureau of yunnan province of china the monthly runoff data of qamdo station were provided by the hydrological bureau of the tibet autonomous region of china the data used to calculate the adaptability index including total water content and water consumption were taken from the water resources bulletin of yunnan published by the ministry of water resources of china and bulletin of yangtze river basin and southwest river resources published by the changjiang water resources committee the data used to calculate the exposure index including gridded population density gdp per unit area and the type of land use with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km were provided by the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences huang et al 2014 the data used to draw topographic maps dem 90 m were obtained from the international scientific data platform of the chinese academy of sciences the information of the above data is shown in table 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 framework for quantifying the vulnerability of the water resources system under climate change the ipcc ar5 report notes the inherent relationship between climate change events vulnerabilities risks exposures and further categorizes disasters as a result of the coupling of vulnerability exposure and climate events field and barros 2014 water resource vulnerability refers to the degree of external disturbance tang et al 2000 that is the comprehensive consideration of the vulnerability of the water resources system to climate change extreme events human activities and other factors xia jun et al 2012b therefore in this study water resource vulnerability refers to the sensitivity of water resources systems to climate change the pressures on the water resources systems the exposure and damage caused by the population and socioeconomic scale the definition of water system vulnerability is to measure the degree of damage from exposure to stresses as well as the sensitivity and resilience of the system to human activities and natural causes water vulnerability in a changing environment is a function of the water resources system s sensitivity s to climate change the adaptability a of the water resources system and the exposed environment e in which the socio economic and natural resources are exposed and the possible hazard h to the system smit and wandel 2006 1 vulnerability v sensitivity s α 1 e x p o s u r e e α 2 h a z a r d h α 3 adaptability a α 4 where v is the vulnerability of the water resources system s is the sensitivity of the water resources system which indicates the impact of climate change on water resources field and barros 2014 e is the exposure which refers to the socio economic and natural resources that are threatened by a lack of water resources karmaoui and balica 2019 h is the hazard which indicates the possibility of a disaster the intensity scale and the degree of damage caused a is the adaptive capacity of the water resources system which is the capacity of any kind of system society or environment to adapt under the potential exposure to hazards pelling 2012 α i represents the weight of each component and the weight range is 0 α i 1 according to the results of previous research chen et al 2016 as well as the evaluation standards of many international organizations on the scarcity of water resources combined with the delphi method the values are respectively α 1 0 5 α 2 0 4 α 3 0 1 α 4 0 5 in this study vulnerability was grouped into five categories little vulnerability v 0 2 low vulnerability 0 2 v 0 4 moderate vulnerability 0 4 v 0 6 high vulnerability 0 6 v 0 8 and severe vulnerability 0 8 v 1 0 2 3 2 calculation of the sensitivity of the water resources system sensitivity is the degree to which a particular system or environment is affected by climate pressure climate pressure can be expressed as an indicator such as the amount of change in resources relative to climate change field and barros 2014 water resources sensitivity can be defined as the percentage change in the mean annual streamflow occurring in response to a change in the mean annual precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e 0 donohue et al 2011 the original budyko hypothesis states that actual evapotranspiration e is mainly controlled by available water and energy evapotranspiration ratio e p can be expressed as a function of aridity index φ e 0 p precipitation p reflects available water potential evapotranspiration e 0 reflects available energy budyko 1974 the budyko hydrothermal coupling equilibrium equation can better describe the quantitative relationship between precipitation potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration yang et al 2008 zhan et al 2014 guo et al 2015 wu et al 2017 this study use the f φ expression calculation proposed by fu 1981 2 e p f e 0 p ω f φ ω 1 φ 1 φ ω 1 ω where ω represents the hydrothermal coupling control parameters assuming that p e 0 and ω of above formula are independent of each other combined with the long term average water balance equation of the basin that is r p e the total differential of r can be used to assess 3 δ r r p δ p r e 0 δ e 0 r ω δ ω where r δ r are actual runoff and changes in runoff respectively δ p and δ e 0 are changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively combined with the climate elasticity coefficient proposed by schaake 1990 eg the climate elasticity coefficient of precipitation is denoted as ε p dr r dp p the eq 3 can be written 4 δ r r ε p δ p p ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 ε ω δ ω ω where ε p ε e 0 and ε ω represent the sensitivity coefficients of r with respect to p e 0 and ω respectively in this framework the impact of climate change on runoff is express as ε p δ p p ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 the last term ε ω δ ω ω in eq 4 is considered to represent the effect of changes in the catchment mainly as a result of human activities accroding the dinfition of sensitivity of the water resources system in this study we mainly considered the impact of climate change on runoff i e the first two parts of the eq 4 based on previous researchs arora 2002 the elasticity coefficient of potential evapotranspiration can be expressed by the elasticity coefficient of precipitation ε e 0 1 ε p the runoff is more correlated with precipitation therefore we selected ε p as the elasticity rate of runoff to changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration combining eq 2 3 and 4 we can deduce the expression of ε p 5 ε p 1 φ ω 1 ω 1 φ ω 1 φ ω 1 ω φ where ω can be derived from the measured rate of change of natural runoff in this study the rate of change of natural runoff was estimated by using the rate of change of the measured natural runoff in the study area from 1960 to 1990 and 1991 2006 the climate elasticity coefficient ε p increases as the aridity index increases furthermore larger values of ε p indicate larger changes in runoff if precipitation or potential evaporation changes for the convenience of subsequent calculations according to the positive relationship between s and ε p the sensitivity coefficient value is converted to the sensitivity coefficient of the 0 1 interval by the following equation 6 s 1 e ε p 1 e ε p ε p 0 ε p 0 in this study the potential evapotranspiration of each site was calculated separately by penman monteith method and kriging interpolation was used to spatialize evapotranspiration and perform subsequent sensitivity calculations 2 3 3 calculation of the exposure of the water resources system exposure is a vulnerable location for population livelihoods ecological services and resources facilities as well as social economic and cultural assets field and barros 2014 in this study exposure refers to the extent of the population gdp and land at risk in other words increased exposure corresponds to people or property occurring in dangerous areas that are more exposed to disasters the magnitude of exposure represents the amount and degree of people and property facing the risks associated with disasters exposure increases with the size of the population the value of assets or property and the extent of land use damage chen et al 2016 this study ues the formula from previous research chen et al 2016 xia et al 2017 we also consider different types of land use as risk indicators different land use can suffer from different levels of risk for example in the face of disasters farmlands cause more losses than grasslands and its ability to resist risks is weaker we believe that the three influencing factors of population economy and land are parallel and have a common impact therefore according to the positive relationship between the exposure of water resources e and the sub exposure e i we rewrite the following formula to estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of exposure based on geographic information systems gis 7 e 1 3 e pop e gdp e land where e i is the sub exposure including the population exposure e pop economic exposure e gdp and land exposure e land in the above formula the population and economic indicators use the average density which is the ratio of the population and gross domestic product gdp to the area respectively the sub exposure of population and gdp was normalized to the range of 0 1 using a normalization method eq 8 the normalized equation is presented as the difference between the calculated value and the minimum value of the entire sample divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the entire sample 8 e normalized x x min x max x min the sub exposure of land use was evaluated by the degree to which different land use types are affected by disasters table 2 2 3 4 calculation of the hazard of the water resources system the hazard of water resources refers to the possibility of a disaster the intensity scale and the degree of damage caused in a certain area cheng et al 2013 the risk of the water resources system therefore can be defined as the intensity scale and the possibility of damage caused by water disaster the hazard of water resources disaster events is mainly the occurrence of droughts and floods therefore their hazards vary with the possibility of disaster events the intensity of the event and the severity of the consequences caused by the duration of the event therefore it is necessary to analyze the risk of water resources disaster events based on the meteorological and hydrological data of the study area itself in this study the probabilistic analysis method was selected for risk analysis and evaluation the phenomenon of the drought flood transition is prominent on the ground of the frequent extreme hydrological events in the region in addition the losses caused by drought flood transition are several times that of individual disasters therefore this study mainly studies the risk of drought flood transition specifically the copula function is used to calculate the joint distribution probability of disaster duration and disaster intensity as the hazard of the water resources system sklar 1959 on the basis of the standard weighted average precipitation swap index the swap is based on the water income and decay model it characterizes the current drought and flood conditions according to the current and previous precipitation and can analyze the dry and wet conditions of the area on a daily scale lu 2009 lu et al 2014 the swap is introduced to calculate hazard in the study which considers the previous water content to replaces the traditional spi method here the definition of the drought flood transition is a flood event s w a p 0 5 occurs within 5 days after the end of a drought event s w a p 0 5 within a certain period of time in addition the start time of the drought flood transition event is the start time of the drought event and the end time is the end time of the flood event based on this use run length theory to identify duration and intensity of disaster define the following formula to describe the intensity of drought flood transition 9 s ci swa p e swa p l d i l i where s ci is the intensity of the i th drought flood transition event swap e represents the cumulative intensity of drought events before the transition point intensity of drought and swap l is the cumulative intensity of flood events after the sudden transition point intensity of flood d i is the duration of the transition event that is the number of days from the start to the end of the event l i is the interval of days that is the number of days between the end of the drought event and the start of the flood event in the i th drought flood transition event furthermore in order to determine the annual hazard it is necessary to determine the sequences of the duration and intensity of the drought flood transition events in the current year the hazard of the water resources system is caputured by the joint distribution probability of the two variable due to any high value of duration or intensity will bring a full threat and cause serious consequences therefore the joint distribution probability under the or return period is used here that is it is a dangerous event if any disaster element exceeds a given threshold the formula for calculating the hazard of water resources is as follows 10 h c f d d f s s where c is the joint distribution probability of duration and intensity f d d f s s are the probability distribution functions of disaster duration and intensity respectively the specific calculation process is explained in detail in the wang s article wang et al 2021 2 3 5 calculation of the adaptive capacity of the water resources system the adaptability of the water resources system refers to the ability of the system to reduce potential damage maintain its structural balance or respond to the consequences of impacts under the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities field and barros 2014 that is the adaptability of the water resources system is the resilience or recoverability against the pressures of climate change and human social and economic activities ning et al 2016 therefore the adaptability of water resources can be composed of indicators reflecting the pressure of water resources water stress is driven by high density population and future demand growth wan et al 2014 river basin water system stress can be decomposed into two dimensions water demand pressure and water resources carrying population pressure falkenmark and molden 2008 the pressure of water demand can be described by the exploitation ratio of water resources and the water resources carrying population pressure can be described by water crowding or available water resources per capita this study uses the water resource scarcity indicator proposed by the malin falknmark s sustaining water as an evaluation criterion as shown in table 3 when the available water resources per capita were less than 3000 m3 water shortage problems begin to occur when the per capita available water resources are less than 1700 m3 the water shortage problem that affects normal life and social order begins to occur falkenmark 1992 the integrated indicators above were used to assess the adaptability of water resources the adaptability increases as the available water resources per capita w p increases and decreases as the water resources development rate r increases thus the adaptability is directly proportional to w p but inversely proportional to r the adaptive capacity a is calculated by 11 a f r w p 1 e w p 1700 k r 1 where k is the scale factor of the pressure coefficient changing with the exploitation ratio of water resources previous research suggests that when the per capita water resources in the region are less than 500 m3 and the exploitation ratio of water resources reaches 70 serious social and ecological problems can result if efficient water use measures and ecological environmental protection measures are not adopted chen et al 2016 xia et al 2017 in addition the upper limit for the reasonable development of a river is generally thought to occur at a water resource utilization rate of 40 according to the development utilization rate of 40 and the pressure critical value of 0 4 k is 4 89 by fitting w p is the available water resources per capita here refer to the calculation method that proposaled by xia et al 2017 12 w p w a p op w t w eco μ p op where w a is the available water resources p op is the amount of the population μ is the water quality compliance rate in this study we assume that μ is equal to 1 this is because on the one hand the river of study area is generally located in the mountains and valleys and on the other hand the level of human development activities in the lrb is relatively low compared with other rivers in china during the study period the pollution level caused by human activities is relatively low w t is the total water resources w eco is the ecological water demand which consists of the ecological water demand in the river and the ecological water demand outside the river the ecological water demand in the river was calculated using the internationally popular tennant method tennant 1976 in this study the short term requirement is to minimally ensure healthy ecological growth outside of the river the retention of sufficient ecological water is necessary for ensuring the healthy development of the natural ecosystems that human beings depend on so that they continue to serve humanity therefore when calculating the utilization rate of water resources development the development and utilization of water resources in the river basin will be underestimated to a certain extent if the ecological water demand is also taken as the total amount of water resources this study uses the ratio of water withdrawn to available water resources to express the water resources development rate 13 r w u w a w u w t w eco where w u is water use which denotes the total water use for agriculture industries and domestics 3 results 3 1 the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of meteorological elements the spatial distribution of meteorological elements and sen slope in the study area were calculated according to the meteorological data the annual precipitation in the study area was not only restricted by the weather system but was also affected by geographical environment factors such as topography which exists significant spatial differences annual precipitation in the study area was generally lower upstream and greater downstream gradually decreasing from downstream to upstream the upstream source area belongs to an alpine climate zone with high terrain and dry air resulting in scarce precipitation the precipitatiom is mostly concentrated in the summer most of which comes in the form of showers the river of study area is deep and the variation change in precipitation is prominent vertically sen s slope in the study area ranged between 5 56 mm a 1 55 mm a fig 2 left the annual precipitation of stations in the upper reaches showed an increasing trend which decreased more significant in downstream additionally from 1960 to 2014 there was a slight decrease in the annual precipitation in the study area z 1 07 1 96 and the sen s slope was 6 8 mm 10a with an abrupt change around 1978 shown in fig 2 right the spatial distribution of the annual average temperature in the study area and the trend in the change of the annual average temperature are shown in fig 3 the average temperature in the study area ranged between 5 2 c and 22 0 c the average temperature decreased as latitude and altitude increased the results of the sen s slope analysis revealed that the annual average temperature of all stations showed an upward trend among which the southeast stations increased significantly the trend in temporal change and change points of annual temperature in the study area are shown in fig 3 the annual average temperature in the study area from 1960 to 2014 showed a significantly increasing trend z 6 07 greater than 1 96 and the sen s slope was 0 30 c 10a what s more the spatial distribution and the variation of annual average potential evapotranspiration in the study area are shown in fig 4 because of differences in solar radiation water vapor content and temperature the study area experiences both high total solar radiation and high evaporation and areas with higher altitudes are characterized by low potential evaporation the magnitude of potential evapotranspiration is related to wind speed radiation status and air humidity the overall spatial variation trend of the average potential evapotranspiration in the study area was low in the north and high in the south the annual average potential evapotranspiration in most areas was between 800 mm and 1100 mm in the upper reaches in the downstream area generally exceeds 1100 mm with obvious regional differences the sen s slope in the study area was approximately 2 0 mm a 5 0 mm a and most of stations showed an increasing trend as shown in fig 4 there was a significant increase in the annual potential evapotranspiration overall z 3 30 greater than 1 96 where the change could be divided into three stage first increased 1960 1984 decreased 1984 2000 and then increased 2000 2014 the sen s slope was 8 4 mm 10a with an abrupt change around around 1975 and 2006 3 2 the sensitivity of the water resources system the runoff in the lancang river region is highly sensitive to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration fig 5 the sensitivity coefficient ranged from 0 65 to 0 90 the distribution of sensitivity in the study area of southwest china was spatially variable from the upstream to the downstream the sensitivity coefficient increased indicating that the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration gradually increased the upstream portions of the lrb are located in the northeastern part of the tibetan plateau with an alpine and temperate plateau climate vegetation is sparse in the upper lrb which is mainly covered by glaciers alpine forest area and sporadic valley agricultural areas global warming has led to a reduction in glaciers and frozen soil and increased uncertainty in precipitation patterns which has led to natural disasters such as floods shrinking wetlands and debris flows compared with the upper reaches of the middle and upper reaches of the sensitivity coefficient between 0 65 and 0 75 the lower reaches are significantly higher than the middle and upper reaches and the sensitivity coefficients are almost between 0 75 and 0 90 this also means that the yunnan province which is located in the subtropical monsoon climate zone of the western yunnan guizhou plateau is more sensitive to climate in terms of water resources these consequences of global warming not only lead to the deterioration of the upstream ecological environment but also pose a threat to societies downstream comparison of the sensitivity of the water resources system of the 1960 s 1970 s 1980 s 1990 s 2000 s and 2010 s revealed that the sensitivity coefficient in the northwestern portion of the study area remained basically unchanged the northwestern region of the upper reaches has a slight fluctuation within 50 years and the change range is within 0 1 the sensitivity of water resources to climate change on the interdecadal scale in the middle reaches is basically unchanged and the change range is less than 0 05 in contrast the sensitivity difference in the southeastern part of the lancang river basin is obvious the area of the area with a sensitivity coefficient greater than 0 8 spreads from right to left over time by 2010 the sensitivity coefficient of the basic downstream area exceeded 0 8 over the past 50 years the pattern of change in precipitation has not been conspicuous but the temperature is increasing evaporation increases as the temperature increases leading to a decrease in runoff and a reduction in the sensitivity coefficient in the downstream of the lrb the landcover consists of evergreen broadleaf forest shrubs and grassland forest ecosystems often contain deep rooted plants which show better performance in terms of soil and water conservation since 1980 the middle and downstream regions of the lrb began to show rapid economic development a large number of forests have been converted into farmland and grassland which decreases the soil s water retention increasing the runoff and in turn the sensitivity coefficient 3 3 the exposure of the water resources system fig 6 shows the different types of exposure of the water resources system in the study area the distributions of population exposure and economic exposure were similar the distribution of land showed low spatial variability high values of exposure commonly appeared in the southeastern portion of the study area and high values are also scattered in the upstream of the lrb excluding a few general values the rest of the upstream regions had low exposure values compared with the rest of the regions of the study area the southeastern portion of the study area located in yunnan province china has higher population density and higher gdp the high value point in the upstream region was located in qamdo and its surroundings qamdo is a well developed city in tibet and is known as the pearl of eastern tibet regions with relatively high exposure values coincided with high population density and high unit area gdp additionally farmland is highly susceptible to disasters and is also scattered in the study area fig 6 regions with relatively low exposure values coincided with low population density low unit area gdp and predominant land use classified as woodland grassland and unused land rapid population growth and expansion of irrigated farmlands during the last two decades have imposed increasing pressure on water resources as can be seen from fig 6 the land use changes in the lrb from 1960 to 2015 were not very obvious some of the grassland has become farmland and dry land for economic development and human life table 4 residential land increased year by year residential land increased the most in 2010 2020 reaching 111 26 which also indicated the economic development and population development of the lrb changes in population economy and land use will inevitably increase the asymmetry between water supply and demand these factors will undoubtedly increase the vulnerability of the water resources system of the lrb 3 4 hazard of the water resources system due to the large number of meteorological stations and the correlation between them rotated empirical orthogonal function reof is used to divide the lancang river basin based on the swap index and the lancang river basin was divided into five regions dali lincang xishuangbanna qamdo and yushu spatio temporal analysis of the hazard of water resources system in five regions fig 7 the overall water resource system hazard of the lrb is very unstable and there is great uncertainty in the 1960 s the hazards of the lrb decreased with the decrease of latitude and altitude the upstream area had a higher risk while the downstream area had a lower risk from the 1970 s to the 1990 s the hazard in the central area of the lrb showed a significant increase which means that the probability and frequency of mild and severe drought flood transition events in qamdo dali and lincang areas were increasing in the 21st century the overall hazard of the lrb was relatively high all above 0 4 in the context of climate change the hazard of water resources systems has shown an increasing trend in the study area this means that the probability of long duration and high intensity drought flood transition is increasing and its impact is more far reaching and the losses caused are more serious 3 5 the adaptive capacity of the water resources system across the entire study area water resources were characterized by high adaptability fig 8 the adaptability coefficient of the qinghai tibet region in the upper reaches of the region was nearly 1 the exploitation ratio of water resources was only approximately 1 and per capita water resources were more than 15 000 m3 which is much larger than the threshold of 3000 m3 in the dali and lincang regions the adaptability coefficient was slightly lower compared with the upstream region this region has a larger population lower per capita water resources and a correspondingly greater exploitation ratio of water resources over the past 15 years the average water consumption in the lbr was 2 8 billion cubic meters accounting for only approximately 4 1 of the average total water resources the development and utilization of water resources in the upper and lower reaches of the region were quite different specifically the development and utilization of water resources were relatively high in the downstream areas but low in the upstream areas the exploitation ratio of water resources across the entire study area was approximately 10 and the per capita water consumption was higher than 3000 m3 water stress is considered low when the exploitation ratio of water resources does not exceed 10 perveen and james 2011 in addition to the zonal distribution the distribution of water resources was basically consistent with the distribution of precipitation fig 9 a the upstream yushu and qamdo regions have the smallest runoff depth the lincang and xishaungbanna regions in the lower reaches have the largest runoff depth in general the amount of surface water resources in the lrb has shown a decreasing trend since 2000 fig 9b the amount of surface water resources in most years was smaller than the multi year average the total water consumption of the study area generally showed a gradual increasing trend from 2000 to 2015 the total water consumption in the basin increased from 2 61 to 2 81 billion cubic meters the total water consumption in the upper and middle reaches of the river basin has increased rapidly the average annual growth rates of total water consumption in qinghai and tibet in the upper and middle reaches were 3 34 and 4 59 respectively yunnan province which is located downstream has an average annual growth rate of 0 67 with the development of the social economy the ever decreasing total amount of water resources and rising water consumption will gradually increase the pressure on water resources in the lrb in the future and the adaptability of water resources will gradually decrease 3 6 the vulnerability of the water resources system the sensitivity of the water resources system to climate change exposure hazard and the adaptability of the water resources system evaluated by eq 6 eq 7 eq 10 and eq 11 respectively were combined to calculate the vulnerability of the water resources using eq 1 after the calculations the vulnerability of the study area from 1998 to 2014 was obtained fig 10 during the study period the vulnerability exhibited an exponential function of fluctuating growth in 2009 the vulnerability of the lrb water resources system reached a high value which indicates that the water resources system is threatened the reason is that the decrease in rainfall in 2009 led to a decrease in the total amount of water resources and the extreme drought from the winter of 2009 to the spring of 2010 caused greater damage to the water resources system moreover the temperature peaked during the study period during this year which increased the evapotranspiration the vulnerability declined in 2010 but later peaked again based on the vulnerability trend the increasing trend became larger and fluctuated starting in 2003 this pattern may stem from the gradual decline in forest land and grassland with water and soil conservation functions and the gradual increase in residential land at the same time the total amount of water resources was nearly below the multi year average although the average water resource system vulnerability of the lrb is relatively low the spatial distribution varies greatly this study selected 2010 as an example to explore the spatial distribution of water resource system vulnerability fig 11 the runoff in the study area was highly sensitive to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration a 10 change in precipitation can cause a change of 13 0 19 5 in water resources and a 10 change in potential evapotranspiration can result in a 3 0 9 5 change in water resources availability regarding the exposure of water resources the upper reaches of the watershed are mainly covered by grassland and the lower reaches are mainly covered by forest land however the population and economic exposure of the middle reaches is higher than that of the upper reaches therefore the lower reaches of the lrb in the southeastern portion of the study area are more exposed the adaptability of the water resources had low spatial variability the lancang river is rich in water resources and has a small water resource utilization rate and a high per capita water use capacity which makes the water resources adaptable divided by the first line of deqin and gongshan the vulnerability of the water resources system in the northern area is between 0 and 0 1 although the upstream land exposure and risk are high the adaptability of water resources is relatively high and the population density and economic development are not high making the vulnerability low the vulnerability of the water resources system in the southern region is mainly between 0 1 and 0 2 of which the vulnerability level of 0 2 0 4 is distributed in the downstream in a patch and the vulnerability level of 0 4 0 6 is mostly distributed in sporadic blocks there is high vulnerability place in dali region which is the most vulnerable region in the whole basin the water resources system in dali is sensitive to climate and has low adaptability in addition this region with relatively large population and rapid economic development has a high exposure when a disaster occurs its water resources system is vulnerable most of all basins in the study area showed little vulnerability in the water resources system where the water was sufficient and can meet the water needs of agriculture industry and ecosystems in addition the vulnerability was high where the water resources were highly susceptible to climate the exposure and hazard was high and or the adaptability was low the southeastern portion of the study area has low vulnerability compared with elsewhere this region has a higher population density and gdp 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis of the factors affecting vulnerability the sensitivity coefficient of runoff to the change in precipitation ε p and potential evapotranspiration ε e 0 can be determined using eq 4 and 5 to determine the pattern of change in the sensitivity coefficient the relationship between the climate sensitivity coefficient and the aridity index was plotted fig 12 a under the same underlying conditions the absolute value of the climate sensitivity coefficient showed a significant increasing trend when the aridity index ranged from 0 to 1 0 when the aridity index ranged from 1 0 to 1 5 the absolute value of the climate sensitivity coefficient still showed an increasing trend but the trend was less pronounced when the aridity index was greater than 1 5 the climate sensitivity gradually stabilized compared with arid regions humid regions respond more strongly to changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in arid regions changes in precipitation are more dominant than changes in potential evapotranspiration to runoff changes the results of the sensitivity analysis above are consistent with the findings of xia et al 2017 and chen et al 2016 in eq 3 ω is closely related to vegetation type soil hydraulic characteristics and terrain yang et al 2009 this parameter can be calculated through an empirical formula but the formula is relatively complicated and includes the average slope of the watershed terrain the relative infiltration capacity of the soil and the effective water storage capacity of the vegetation yang et al 2007 analogously the relationship curve between the sensitivity coefficient of ω and the aridity index can be plotted fig 12b the absolute value of the sensitivity coefficient of ω increased as the aridity index increased when the aridity index was less than 1 0 smaller ω corresponded to greater absolute values of the sensitivity coefficient of ω when the aridity index was greater than 1 0 greater ω corresponded to greater absolute values of the sensitivity coefficient of ω in other words under humid conditions less vegetation corresponded to increased sensitivity to changes in runoff to underlying surface changes li et al 2011 that is changes in precipitation can cause greater changes in runoff in grasslands than in forests dou et al 2019 4 2 proposals for the sustainable development of water resources the lrb possesses a variety of biological and forest resources from tropical to alpine regions it is rich in mineral resources and contains a large amount of water resources but it is located in a fragile ecological environment in southwest china räsänen et al 2017 zhao et al 2012 as the ability of human activities to transform natural processes strengthens the impact of changes in human activities on surface cover and on runoff cannot be ignored zhao et al 2010 however changes in hydrothermal conditions caused by climate change will also have a profound impact on river basin runoff zhong et al 2018 based on the results of this research the vulnerability of the water resources system in the lrb is low but this result does not mean that human beings can exploit water resources recklessly and change the surface coverage without restraint or planning as there are still many potential risks fig 13 shows the pattern of change in spi in the upstream region of the study area the increasing trend in spi in the upstream region indicates that there is an increased likelihood of flooding in contrast the middle and downstream regions of study area show a decreasing trend fig 13b 13c suggesting the continued increase in drought potential in addition forests in the middle and lower reaches of the study area are converted into farmland or grassland and the area of residential land is gradually incrasing this has led to an increase in runoff and all changes caused by the changing environment will inevitably have a negative impact on the long term development of the ecological environment below some suggestions for different partitions in the study area are proposed to promote the sustainable development of water resources the upper reaches of lrb in the tibetan plateau is the main area affected by global warming and is mainly covered by alpine grassland first the protection of natural forests needs to be strengthened so that the ecological health of forests is improved natural forests have made outstanding contributions to water conservation flood control and debris flow prevention second the protection of natural grassland needs to be strengthened and desertification needs to be inhibited natural grassland is the main body of vegetation in the upper reaches of the lrb the health of the plateau ecosystem depends to a large extent on the state of grassland vegetation third disaster monitoring and early warning emergency mechanisms need to be established and improved in the future consistent increases in extreme high flow may indicate greater flood or debris flow risk in the region and downstream areas the lower reaches of the lrb located in the yunnan guizhou plateau are characterized by a primarily sub tropical monsoon climate first deforestation needs to be reduced and the ecological environment needs to be protected there are many alternative ways to improve the local economy and thus protect natural forests second the rate of water resource development and the water supply need to be increased water conservation practices and reservoirs to regulate runoff need to be used and the frequency of drought needs to be reduced in the non flood seasons third soil erosion control needs to be strengthened and landslides mudslides and other disasters need to be prevented 4 3 reviewing the proposed method there are very few studies on the vulnerability of the water resources system in the lrb in previous literatures we find some dealing with the vulnerability in the region of the lancang river compare the vulnerability of water resources by administrative region of china from which the conclusions were similar to this article the rivers in the study area flow through the three provinces of qinghai tibet and yunnan in china from upstream to downstream cai et al 2017 and yao et al 2020 found that qinghai tibet and yunnan all have low vulnerability this is consistent with our conclusion that the entire study area is in a low vulnerability level furthermore qin et al 2020 s paper found that the vulnerability of yunnan is on the rising stage but the overall level is low due to rich rainfall and abundant runoff in this area this is consistent with our conclusion that the vulnerability of the downstream area in our study has increased in terms of sensitivity han et al 2019 s research can support the conclusion that the water resources system in our study area is highly sensitive to climate there is no reservoir construction in the upper reaches of the lancang river and climate change is the main driver for the change of water resources dynamic changes in exposure are similar to those observed in zhao et al 2010 and fan et al 2012 thus this study can provide a basis for formulating plans to promote economic and water resource development for the basin however because some indicators were unavailable and data were limited a few problems require consideration first the number of meteorological stations in this paper was not sufficient and the zoning of the climate in the study area cannot be achieved by classifying the data of the meteorological stations the current research can thus only be based on the spatial distribution of the vulnerability of the river basin along the river subsequent work will assess the vulnerability of the regional water resources system based on climatic zoning to achieve clear and detailed vulnerability spatialization second the time scales in this study were all in years which may weaken the potential hazards in the hydrological process during the flood season and the non flood season however because of the difficulty of obtaining quarterly or monthly data on human activity data such as water use data the time scale should be refined to highlight flood disasters during the flood season and drought disasters during the non flood season in future research 5 conclusions in this study a framework of water resource system vulnerability assessment based on coupling sensitivity exposure risk and adaptability is proposed by comprehensively considering various factors such as water resource endowment economic and social water use structure water resource system response to climate change disaster impact and risk level from a system perspective this framework quantifies the generation mechanism and attributes of vulnerability of water resources system the constructed non linear relationship can more intuitively reflect the existence of interdependent and mutually restrictive relationships between factors which has a physical mechanism in the study basin regions with relatively tight water resources but dense population distribution and high socio economic production have higher exposure after coupling sensitivity and hazard the degree of vulnerability of water resources system is more clearly divided the results show that in the context of climate change and more frequent human activities the vulnerability of water resources system in the lrb has increased exponentially over time although it is currently at little vulnerability the growth trend is very fast in addition the lrb has large spatial difference it shows an increasing trend from upstream to downstream the upper reaches are almost at little vulnerability most of the downstream are low vulnerability and moderate vulnerability areas are scattered sporadically four key elements exposure and sensitivity and hazard and adaptability are considered respectively in accordance with the matched features of vulnerability in different regions the qinghai tibet region with large water resource reserve and weak human activities has a low water system vulnerability however in the face of high probability disasters the vulnerability of regions with large populations and high levels of socio economic development is reflected in population and economic exposure such as the qamdo region therefore the local government must not only protect natural vegetation and enhance soil conservation capabilities but also strengthen the detection and early warning of disasters such as floods and mudslides compared with the upstream basin the water resource system in the downstream is more sensitive to climate and the degree of urbanization is higher which has a higher vulnerability furthermore the vulnerability of the region in the downstream with weaker human activities is reflected by water resource adaptability such as the baoshan region based on this downstream decision makers should protect the ecological environment and control the rate of soil erosion on the other hand the development and utilization of water resources should be strengthened do a good job in reservoir regulation and storage and prevent frequent drought events during non flood seasons although the lancang river is rich in water resources and thus has a large per capita water supply water should not be recklessly extracted and wasted in the future adaptability should be increased by rationally developing water resources and increasing the water supply and exposure should be reduced by protecting natural forests as adaptive countermeasures for the vulnerability and risks of the water resources system additionally the limitations in both the integrated evaluation method the indicators in this study and the fineness of the spatial zoning need to be further studied

4302,cryohydrological processes in the eurasian arctic and qinghai tibet plateau qtp permafrost regions have been changing rapidly yet the details of the river runoff changes are still obscure here we use multidecadal natural daily discharge data to compute annual flow duration curves fdcs and percentile flows for 20 eurasian arctic and qtp river basins with permafrost underlain we provide detailed trends of various percentile flows that almost all runoff components change variably either with the distinct magnitude or opposite direction or both we demonstrate that the lower flows increase monotonically faster than higher flows most low flows increase while the high flows show spatial heterogeneity with both increased and decreased trends observed the portion of deep and total groundwater flow in total discharge increases with the deep groundwater flow increases faster interestingly the river runoff components respond differently to climatic change factors the low flows mainly sustained by groundwater are more sensitive to warming than high flows while the high flows are more sensitive to precipitation than low flows our results may suggest an increased subsurface

2009 the most prominent change of the arctic river discharge is the upward trend of winter baseflow and decreasing trend of the ratios of high and low flow probably caused by the enhancement of subsurface hydrologic processes and reservoir regulation impacts st jacques and sauchyn 2009 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 walvoord and striegl 2007 wang et al 2021a ye et al 2009 in the qtp rivers both increased yangtze and decreased yellow total discharge and baseflow were observed mao et al 2016 song et al 2020 these changes illustrate that the river discharge change is profound and widespread in permafrost regions while our understanding of the changing details such as runoff components i e streamflow components such as low medium and high flow etc change patterns are limited under the changing cryosphere in the arctic and qtp natural processes including permafrost thaw snow cover change enhanced precipitation and evapotranspiration change can affect the variations of streamflow bring et al 2016 cuo et al 2014 the extensive distribution and thawing of permafrost have already changed the river flow regime at large scales mcclelland et al 2004 song et al 2020 walvoord et al 2012 ye et al 2009 which complicates the hydrologic changes across the arctic river basins in the qtp rivers permafrost degradation enhanced groundwater recharge and winter discharge but decreased total discharge ma et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the snow cover change can affect both low flow in the cold season and high flow in the snowmelt freshet season yang et al 2003 the increased precipitation can partially contribute to the increased river discharge pavelsky and smith 2006 rawlins et al 2006 while the evapotranspiration increase vihma et al 2016 may also counteract this effect to some extent nevertheless the overall warming and associated processes and atmospheric water transport may be the most important processes affecting the surface hydrologic conditions shiklomanov et al 2021 these studies advanced our understanding of the patterns and mechanisms of river discharge changes among the arctic and qtp rivers despite many advances in discharge change of permafrost rivers our current understandings of the natural flow regime change and mechanisms in permafrost rivers are still partial for instance without exploring the runoff components change behind the annual discharge change trend we might lose an important mechanistic understanding of the flow regime change the hydrological processes of high flows and low flows are different and thus need to be considered separately gudmundsson et al 2011 smakhtin 2001 since the groundwater discharge could be divided into shallow groundwater flow fast groundwater flow and deep groundwater flow slow groundwater flow the variation trends of basin groundwater discharge components also need to be analyzed besides the active hydrological stations for the arctic are shrinking laudon et al 2017 which may lead to an uncertain future for the permafrost river discharge monitoring and prediction to improve our understanding of the ongoing change of permafrost river discharge under the context of global change we need to separate and analyze the change in natural flow regime and components although human activities such as dam constructions and reservoir regulations yang et al 2004a yang et al 2004b ye et al 2003 added challenges to differentiate the climate change versus human impacted effects on river discharge shiklomanov and lammers 2009 the natural or naturalized river discharge with the anthropogenic impacts eliminated can be useful to identify natural causations of river flow change shiklomanov and lammers 2009 the complete separations and holistic analyses of runoff components flow regime and processes bring et al 2016 shiklomanov et al 2013 shrestha et al 2021 can help us better understand the hydrological processes in permafrost regions a flow duration curve fdc which is the only tool to display the complete range and magnitude of river discharge from low flows to flood events can be used to characterize the flow components smakhtin 2001 in an fdc the high percentile region low flow characterizes the ability of the river basin to sustain low flows during dry seasons such low flow is often sustained by groundwater discharge the low percentile region high flow denotes flood events during peak flow seasons lyon and destouni 2010 smakhtin 2001 yang et al 2007 as an informative index fdc is particularly important in evaluating the flow characteristics with practical engineering hydrological applications while the potential of fdc on detecting the flow change in permafrost regions has not been fully exploited in this study we used fdcs and the corresponding percentile flows calculated from decadal daily natural or naturalized river discharge data for 20 gauge stations across the eurasia arctic and qtp which are the main permafrost regions in the northern hemisphere the percentile flow indices were used as proxies of runoff components the decadal change of fdcs and various percentile flows were analyzed we hypothesize that if the enhanced subsurface hydrological processes and low flow were widespread in permafrost regions then the river runoff components should change divergently similar to the divergence of seasonal discharge change rawlins et al 2009 our main objective is to find the multidecadal change patterns of annual runoff components and their correlations with climatic factors for the major permafrost rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data initially this study intended to include as many permafrost watersheds as possible the inclusion criterion is that the basin has permafrost distribution and long term natural daily discharge data available as a result 20 permafrost river basins and subbasins among the ob yenisey lena yangtze and yellow rivers are selected in this study table 1 and fig 1 these basins and subbasins cover a large spatial extent and represent the major permafrost regions in the northern hemisphere the river basins and subbasins have drainage areas range from 17 000 to 2 950 000 km2 table 1 ob yenisey and lena are the three largest rivers in the eurasia arctic region from 2015 to 2017 the three rivers deliver averagely of 1672 km3 of water flux per year or 68 of the total arctic river discharge to the arctic ocean holmes et al 2018 the major land cover types for ob yenisey and lena basins are forest shrubland and cropland fig s1 the yangtze and yellow river source regions are the headwaters of two great rivers in china the predominant land cover type for yangtze and yellow river source regions is grassland fig s1 the main soil types in the studied arctic and qinghai tibet plateau qtp are gelisol and inceptisol according to the united states department of agriculture soil taxonomy lithologically the ob yenisey and lena basins are mainly underlain by carbonate sedimentary rocks siliciclastic sedimentary rocks unconsolidated sediments and basic volcanic rocks while the yangtze and yellow headwaters are mainly underlain by siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and mixed sedimentary rocks fig s1 the basins are characterized by a cold and dry climate the ob yenisei lena and source regions of yangtze and yellow river basins have multiyear mean 1950 2015 basin averaged temperature of 0 2 5 6 9 8 3 3 and 1 6 respectively the mean annual precipitations ranged from 343 to 520 mm table s1 approximately 10 1 49 5 and 85 5 of ob yenisey and lena drainage basins are underlain by permafrost as the main rivers in the qtp permafrost region 77 3 and 56 1 of the yangtze and yellow source regions are underlain by permafrost zou et al 2017 permafrost in siberia has active layers about 30 60 cm thick and permafrost thickness over 500 m tarnocai 2009 the qtp permafrost region has thinner permafrost layers 10 120 m and thicker active layers 1 5 m wu and zhang 2010 the hydrogeologic function of permafrost in these basins is considered to be an aquitard however the warming and thawing of permafrost in recent decades have caused active layer thickening enhanced groundwater circulation open taliks and thermokarst landform developments which can greatly affect the hydrologic regime kurylyk and walvoord 2021 yang et al 2010 the multidecadal daily flow data of ob yenisey and lena rivers was retrieved from the r arcticnet v4 0 data repository shiklomanov 2010 both daily observed and naturalized discharge data in three larger rivers are available in this dataset the observed discharge was obtained from the state hydrological institute russia the naturalized discharge data was generated using a specially developed hydrograph transformation model htm also named as hydrograph routing model hrm which eliminated anthropogenic impacts on the river flow records shiklomanov et al 2007a stuefer et al 2011 briefly the htm routes observed daily hydrographs from upstream stations without human impacts towards the downstream using a duhamel integral approach and naturalizes the river discharge shiklomanov lammers 2009 stuefer et al 2011 the htm can provide more accurate hydrograph simulations shiklomanov lammers 2009 than the methods based on comparisons of mean pre dam and post dam hydrographs e g yang et al 2004a only the naturalized data records were used in this study since we were intended to decipher the natural change patterns of discharge for the yangtze and yellow headwater sites the natural daily discharge data were collected from the hydrographic bureau of the qinghai province the gridded precipitation matsuura and willmott 2020 and surface air temperature data cowtan et al 2019 were obtained from national center for atmospheric research website https climatedataguide ucar edu and then calculated as basin average data at an annual basis the monthly precipitation and air temperature data sets covered 1900 2017 and 1700 2019 period respectively the spatial resolutions for the precipitation and air temperature data sets are 0 5x0 5 degree and 1x1 degree respectively we chose these data sets for their long temporal coverage and high reliability the overall permafrost coverage for each basin was calculated in the same method used before song et al 2020 by allocating different percentages for each permafrost category mcclelland et al 2004 2 2 flow duration curves and percentile flows the fdc is a statistical representation of observed streamflow variability over the period of record which is composed of percentile flows that identify the flow equaled or exceeded for a given percent of time fouad et al 2018 ghotbi et al 2020 fdc is a hydrologically meaningful method that can display the complete range of river discharges from low flows to flood events smakhtin 2001 a specific frequency flow associated with fdc q pi indicates the streamflow at a given frequency pi for instance q10 and q90 represent the streamflow at exceedance probabilities of 10 and 90 respectively the percentile flows in permafrost rivers have statistically representative meaning for annual runoff components for our study basins higher flood flows at lower frequencies are associated with storm rainfall and snowmelt flows in the spring and summer seasons while the lower flows at higher frequencies reflect the low or base flows that mostly originate from groundwater figure s2 the ratios of low flow indices like q90 to q50 are commonly used to represent the groundwater contribution to total runoff al faraj and scholz 2014 smakhtin 2001 due to active groundwater evolution walvoord and kurylyk 2016 the low flow index q75 in permafrost basins should include total groundwater shallow and deep groundwater flow together but possibly exceed groundwater while q90 can reflect only steady deep groundwater for permafrost rivers as such the ratios of q90 to q50 q90 q50 and q75 to q50 q75 q50 are used as indexes representing the proportion of streamflow originating from deep and total groundwater stores respectively we used the fdc software version 2 1 https hydrooffice org tool fdc aspx to derive the fdcs and the corresponding percentile flows for each river basin using the daily natural discharge data fig s3 we computed fdcs and q pi for each year and used the q10 q20 q30 q40 q50 q60 q70 q80 q90 as representative fdc indexes and flow magnitudes for the time period examined in this study according to the common understanding of fdc the q pi spectrum from q10 to q30 represent the high flows q40 to q60 represents medium flows while q70 to q90 represents low flows fouad and loáiciga 2020 smakhtin 2001 as such q10 to q90 formed a flow gradient from high to low the surface air temperature of the northern hemisphere showed an accelerated warming rate since the 1980s cohen et al 2014 semenov et al 2010 as such we divided the naturalized discharge covered years into two periods fig s4 before 1980 p1 and since 1980 p2 the change rates of q pi from fdcs monthly and seasonal discharge were computed based on the two periods for example the change rates of qpi were calculated as follows 1 δ q pi q pi p 2 q pi p 1 q pi p 1 100 δqpi is defined as the change rate of q pi q pi p 2 and q pi p 1 is the average q pi for the period p2 and p1 respectively 2 3 data analyses we used the non parametric mann kendall trend test mk test method kendall 1975 mann 1945 to further assess the decadal change trend of different percentile flows this method is widely used in detecting trends in hydrometeorological time series data wang et al 2020 mk test gives standardized test statistic z which follows the standard normal distribution with e z 0 and v z 1 in a two tailed test for trends the null hypothesis is rejected if the absolute value of z is larger than the theoretical value z 1 α 2 where α is the statistical significance level of the test in this study we set α as 0 1 as recommended by wang et al 2020 the magnitude of the trend is also estimated with the sen s slope method sen 1968 the method computes both the slope i e linear change rate and confidence levels based on sen s method both mann kendall test and sen s slope methods were computed in r using the r package trend pohlert 2020 we used one way analysis of variance anova analysis and tukey s hsd post hoc test to compare the changes of percentile discharges for each gauge site before and after 1980 correlation analysis was used to estimate the correlation coefficients between percentile flows and annual mean surface air temperature anomaly and annual mean precipitation 3 results 3 1 variable changes of runoff components for the past decades the shapes of fdc varied by basins while the two period fdc comparisons revealed the general change patterns across the study river basins fig 2 see the enlarged version in the supplementary materials most of the fdcs showed higher high percentile parts of p2 than that of p1 for 20 basins in this study 14 of them exhibited higher fdcs after 1980 at the high percentile parts which indicated the prevalent increase of low flows in addition about half of the basins 6076 6539 6543 6544 6656 6664 6666 6950 7142 tnh jm showed lower fdcs at the high flow part suggesting decreases of specific high discharge in those basins from p1 to p2 while higher fdcs at the high flow part can also be observed fig 2 the percentile flows across river basins behaved uneven change rates at all percentiles with most percentile flows increased from p1 to p2 fig 3 a averagely q10 slightly decreased while other higher percentile flow increased q90 increased by 18 4 while q10 decreased by 1 from p1 to p2 period although the average decrease proportion of q10 was small the reduction of q10 flow can be substantial since the high magnitude of q10 flow interestingly the change rates for percentile flows increased at a positive monotonic trend along with the percentile sequences fig 3a one way anova with tukey s hsd post hoc tests showed that most of the percentile flows had statistically significant change from p1 to p2 period fig s5 as shown in fig 4 a the higher percentile flows had more upward trends while the lower percentile flows had more downward trends overall high percentile flows showed more statistically significant changes from p1 to p2 period both q75 q50 and q90 q50 ratios showed increasing trends from p1 to p2 period with average change rates of 6 for q75 q50 and 9 7 for q90 q50 fig 3b to reveal the changes of deep and total groundwater flow contributions to total runoff q75 qa and q90 qa respectively we also calculated the ratios and change rates of q75 and q90 to mean annual discharge qa for p1 and p2 as expected q90 qa also increased faster than q75 qa averagely 13 65 vs 9 67 from p1 to p2 table s2 the mann kendall test and sen s slope methods further confirmed the variable multidecadal trends of different percentile flows at almost all basins fig 4b fig 5 these results were generally consistent with the p1 p2 change rates of percentile discharge fig 3 as shown in fig 4b the higher percentile flows have more significant upward trends while the lower percentile flows have more downward trends overall high percentile flows showed more statistically significant changes from p1 to p2 period than that of low percentile flows about 73 of low flows showed significant increases from p1 to p2 while the mk test revealed 72 of significantly increased low flows fig 4 likewise streamflow at different percentiles had variable change directions and magnitudes all sites except vilyuy at chernyshevskiy 6263 showed increasing trends for the low flow indices from q70 to q90 instead a considerable portion of the high flows q10 to q30 showed decreasing trend though many of the trends are insignificant fig 4b five percent of high flows showed significant decreases from p1 to p2 while the mk test revealed about 17 of significantly decreased high flows fig 4 a small portion of stations showed increased high flows fig 4 suggesting the spatial heterogeneity of high flow change across the study basins among yenisey river basins the annual change rates of percentile flow showed increasing trends from q10 to q90 there was a tendency that the change rates shift from decreasing negative z value and sen s slope to increasing trend positive z value and sen s slope with the tipping point around q50 among the q10 to q90 sequences fig 4b fig 5 especially for yenisey basins most of the ob and lena basins sites showed overall increased percentile flows but disproportional change rates for percentile flows for the yangtze river source region both zmd and tth sites showed increasing trends for all percentile flows while the sen s slope differed by percentiles nevertheless percentile flows for all sites showed different trends at different percentiles either in the change direction or the magnitude or both 3 2 dissimilar correlations of runoff components with temperature and precipitation percentile flows showed dissimilar correlations with climate factors including temperature and precipitation high percentile flows were more closely correlated with the mean annual air temperature mat anomaly but showed little relations with mean annual precipitation map fig 6 the correlation coefficients between percentile discharge and annual mean surface air temperature anomaly rqt and annual mean precipitation rqp displayed distinct increased and decreased trends along the percentile gradient respectively averagely q10 q20 q30 and q40 showed negative correlations while q50 q60 q70 q80 and q90 showed positive correlations with mat anomaly fig 6a q80 and q90 showed the highest correlations with mat unlike the temperature correlations map was more closely correlated with low percentile flows fig 6b most of the percentile flows showed positive mean correlations with map q30 and q40 show the highest correlations with map while q90 showed minor correlations with map 4 discussions in this study we have discovered the variable changes of the runoff components represented by percentile flows across several main eurasia arctic and qtp river basins where cryospheric elements are changing rapidly under a warming climate the percentile flows also respond differently to air temperature and precipitation our results suggest those variable changes can occur across various spatial and long term temporal scales our study demonstrates that low flows increase for most of the study permafrost basins but high flows change both upwardly and downwardly the high increase rate of high percentile flows e g q90 q80 and q70 in our results are aligned with previous studies in which baseflow or winter low flow increased for many cold region rivers evans et al 2020 smith et al 2007 song et al 2020 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 the increases of high flows may be caused by the increased net precipitation zhang et al 2013 while warming induced snow cover reduction yang et al 2003 and more water storage capacity of the catchment matti et al 2016 may also decrease the high flow the relative importance of these factors among basins may differ which cause the heterogeneity of high flow change among basins among all considered basins the decrease of low percentile flows e g q10 across the yenisey basin is also consistent with the fact that the maximum river discharge decreased significantly in the south central siberia rivers shiklomanov et al 2013 decreasing maximum minimum discharge ratios and asymmetrical change of high and low flows were widespread across cold region rivers shiklomanov et al 2007b smith et al 2007 wang et al 2017 ye et al 2004 overall the variability of percentile flow change is inconsistent with some previous results including increased high flow but decreased low flow van vliet et al 2013 or the same change direction of both high and low flow gudmundsson et al 2019 in many other regions suggesting the unique hydrologic patterns of cold region rivers as shown in figs s6 and s7 and rawlins et al 2009 the change rates of winter discharge are higher than other seasons of the year for most eurasia arctic basins this lines up with the percentile flow change results since winter discharge is certainly high percentile flows ie low flow beyond this understanding we showed more details of flow change with the application of fdc and percentile flows all representative percentile flows change at different rates interestingly the average change rate of the percentile flows increased with percentiles with change direction shifts occurred in most yenisey basins not just low flow increases faster than high flow but the lower flow increases faster than the higher flow the linearly increased change rates of discharge along the percentile sequences fig 3a suggest that the fdcs of some study river basins may rotate anticlockwise in the future with upward tails low flow part as the warming and wetting continue the annual flows and low flows may increase while the high flows may change in both directions shrestha et al 2021 this will affect the water resources management and utilization strategy and river ecosystems across the cold basins as the important regulators for cryohydrology warming driven permafrost thaw and increased active layer thickness can change the river flow regime in many ways walvoord and kurylyk 2016 when flow paths propagate deeper with intensified subsurface flow connectivity and more open taliks st jacques and sauchyn 2009 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 groundwater flow in permafrost basins could increase besides as the active layer thaws deep in summer the infiltration rate and soil water capacity can increase which can lead to a lower runoff coefficient in rain runoff events thereby may decrease the peak flows in flood seasons matti et al 2016 the formation of thermokarst ponds and lake expansions can also regulate the water balance and storage capacity of the basins and eventually affect the river runoff karlsson et al 2012 nitzbon et al 2020 the higher change rate of q90 q50 than q75 q50 indicates that the components of groundwater flow increased at different speeds the faster increasing rate of deep groundwater flow q90 q50 is plausible since higher percentile flows increased faster than lower percentile flows this can also be corroborated by the fact that q90 qa increased faster than q75 qa from p1 to p2 table s2 although the increased subsurface hydrologic connectivity in permafrost basins under warming has been expected by many permafrost hydrologists it is difficult to corroborate since the lack of relevant observational data walvoord and kurylyk 2016 in winter the river discharge is sustained by the intra permafrost and sub permafrost groundwater since the active layer and supra permafrost aquifer are entirely frozen kurylyk and walvoord 2021 such steady groundwater discharge is certainly the lowest during the year with high percentiles in flood seasons low percentile flow occurs with active surface hydrologic processes and opened flow paths hence low percentile flows are associated with surface hydrologic connectivity and high percentile flows are associated with subsurface hydrologic connectivity in those permafrost basins as shown in our results the higher percentile flow increased faster than the lower percentile flow which likely suggests that the subsurface hydrologic processes are becoming more active for the past decades monitoring the subsurface hydrologic activities is challenging while the high percentile flows may provide indices for them if the subsurface hydrologic connectivity decreased or no change the variable change patterns of percentile flow cannot happen from the aforementioned interpretation therefore our analyses may provide a way to unearth the increased subsurface hydrologic connectivity in permafrost basins evans et al 2020 climate change can affect river discharge profoundly on a global scale gudmundsson et al 2021 nohara et al 2006 interestingly our results suggest that low flow discharge is more positively correlated to mat anomaly than high flow discharge which indicates that the atmospheric warming correlates with the subsurface flow more positively this pattern is likely linked to the seasonality of river discharge since increased winter baseflow or groundwater flow is largely caused by the warming induced permafrost thaw and active layer deepening evans et al 2020 huang et al 2019 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 xu et al 2020 wang et al 2021a besides the lower the runoff the closer its relationship with air temperature anomaly which may be related to the nonuniform seasonal warming the colder seasons with low flows are warming faster than warmer seasons with high lows xu et al 2013 leads to a larger impact of temperature anomaly in lower flows via enhancing subsurface hydrology warming may also change the high flows through warming induced snow cover extent reduction which can decrease the snowmelt floods bring et al 2016 the smoothed rqt curve fig 6a suggests that future climate warming can enhance not only more deep groundwater flow but also the medium low flow at different magnitudes the eurasia arctic and qtp have observed faster warming rates in winter than other seasons bintanja and van der linden 2013 graham et al 2017 liu and chen 2000 which may further enhance the winter discharge increase and strengthen the relations between low flow and temperature via multiple processes except for warming precipitation is another major driver of runoff components change in cold region basins both the arctic vihma et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 and qtp wang et al 2021b regions are wetting due to enhanced precipitation which causes increased annual mean flow percentile flows are correlated with precipitation differently as the hydrological processes of high flow and low flow are different gudmundsson et al 2011 the high flow showed high correlations with precipitations fig 6b which is plausible since the high flow is dominated by spring snowmelt events in the arctic rivers or by summer monsoonal rainfall in the qtp rivers the low flow has little relation with map which is reasonable since low flow in winter is mainly controlled by groundwater in our considered regions the increased winter solid precipitation can increase snowmelt floods in the coming year rain on snow events may also enhance snowmelt driven high flow shrestha et al 2021 however climatic warming can also change the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration bring et al 2016 posing complex controls of temperature and precipitation on river discharge change future climatic warming precipitation increase and other associated processes can have coupled effects on flow regime change nevertheless the gradually change rqt and rqp curves fig 6 suggest that river runoff components can respond differently to climatic change though note that both temperature and precipitation show relatively low correlations with each percentile flow which means neither temperature nor precipitation can fully explain the variations of percentile flow we do not rule out other factors or mechanisms that govern the changes of different percentile flows in addition the physiography difference between basins may cause different responses of streamflow change to climatic change and permafrost thaw the dominant drivers of streamflow change between basins may also differ which should be constrained in future studies 5 conclusions and implications based on the long term natural daily discharge record and the classic fdc method in hydrology we assessed the runoff components change across eurasia arctic and qtp rivers we find that the flow change varies by percentiles with high percentile flow increased faster the change rates of percentile flows increase linearly with percentiles most low flows increase for the study permafrost basins but high flows change both upwardly and downwardly the contribution of deep groundwater flow proxied by q90 qa and q90 q50 to total runoff increase faster than total groundwater flow proxied by q75 qa and q75 q50 we show that low flow is more sensitive to warming but the high flow is more sensitive to precipitation our results imply that it is necessary to separate the runoff components and gain a better understanding of the details and mechanisms of the runoff changes in cold region rivers we demonstrate that fdc has the potential for studying the permafrost river flow regime change especially for the low flow section of an fdc as the permafrost regions have intensified sub surface hydrological processes and increased baseflow the low flow indices from fdcs can be useful proxies to study the sub surface hydrology connectivity change given the sharp decline of active monitoring sites across arctic rivers laudon et al 2017 the efforts based on fdc analyses are particularly helpful to predict future flow change in those regions where flow data is lacking future studies should direct to the controls of each runoff component changes to disentangle the complex cryohydrological process changes in the permafrost regions credit authorship

4302,cryohydrological processes in the eurasian arctic and qinghai tibet plateau qtp permafrost regions have been changing rapidly yet the details of the river runoff changes are still obscure here we use multidecadal natural daily discharge data to compute annual flow duration curves fdcs and percentile flows for 20 eurasian arctic and qtp river basins with permafrost underlain we provide detailed trends of various percentile flows that almost all runoff components change variably either with the distinct magnitude or opposite direction or both we demonstrate that the lower flows increase monotonically faster than higher flows most low flows increase while the high flows show spatial heterogeneity with both increased and decreased trends observed the portion of deep and total groundwater flow in total discharge increases with the deep groundwater flow increases faster interestingly the river runoff components respond differently to climatic change factors the low flows mainly sustained by groundwater are more sensitive to warming than high flows while the high flows are more sensitive to precipitation than low flows our results may suggest an increased subsurface hydrological connectivity under the warming climate and thawing permafrost we show that fdcs have the potential to reveal the long term runoff components change future climatic change may alter the

subsurface hydrologic processes and reservoir regulation impacts st jacques and sauchyn 2009 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 walvoord and striegl 2007 wang et al 2021a ye et al 2009 in the qtp rivers both increased yangtze and decreased yellow total discharge and baseflow were observed mao et al 2016 song et al 2020 these changes illustrate that the river discharge change is profound and widespread in permafrost regions while our understanding of the changing details such as runoff components i e streamflow components such as low medium and high flow etc change patterns are limited under the changing cryosphere in the arctic and qtp natural processes including permafrost thaw snow cover change enhanced precipitation and evapotranspiration change can affect the variations of streamflow bring et al 2016 cuo et al 2014 the extensive distribution and thawing of permafrost have already changed the river flow regime at large scales mcclelland et al 2004 song et al 2020 walvoord et al 2012 ye et al 2009 which complicates the hydrologic changes across the arctic river basins in the qtp rivers permafrost degradation enhanced groundwater recharge and winter discharge but decreased total discharge ma et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the snow cover change can affect both low flow in the cold season and high flow in the snowmelt freshet season yang et al 2003 the increased precipitation can partially contribute to the increased river discharge pavelsky and smith 2006 rawlins et al 2006 while the evapotranspiration increase vihma et al 2016 may also counteract this effect to some extent nevertheless the overall warming and associated processes and atmospheric water transport may be the most important processes affecting the surface hydrologic conditions shiklomanov et al 2021 these studies advanced our understanding of the patterns and mechanisms of river discharge changes among the arctic and qtp rivers despite many advances in discharge change of permafrost rivers our current understandings of the natural flow regime change and mechanisms in permafrost rivers are still partial for instance without exploring the runoff components change behind the annual discharge change trend we might lose an important mechanistic understanding of the flow regime change the hydrological processes of high flows and low flows are different and thus need to be considered separately gudmundsson et al 2011 smakhtin 2001 since the groundwater discharge could be divided into shallow groundwater flow fast groundwater flow and deep groundwater flow slow groundwater flow the variation trends of basin groundwater discharge components also need to be analyzed besides the active hydrological stations for the arctic are shrinking laudon et al 2017 which may lead to an uncertain future for the permafrost river discharge monitoring and prediction to improve our understanding of the ongoing change of permafrost river discharge under the context of global change we need to separate and analyze the change in natural flow regime and components although human activities such as dam constructions and reservoir regulations yang et al 2004a yang et al 2004b ye et al 2003 added challenges to differentiate the climate change versus human impacted effects on river discharge shiklomanov and lammers 2009 the natural or naturalized river discharge with the anthropogenic impacts eliminated can be useful to identify natural causations of river flow change shiklomanov and lammers 2009 the complete separations and holistic analyses of runoff components flow regime and processes bring et al 2016 shiklomanov et al 2013 shrestha et al 2021 can help us better understand the hydrological processes in permafrost regions a flow duration curve fdc which is the only tool to display the complete range and magnitude of river discharge from low flows to flood events can be used to characterize the flow components smakhtin 2001 in an fdc the high percentile region low flow characterizes the ability of the river basin to sustain low flows during dry seasons such low flow is often sustained by groundwater discharge the low percentile region high flow denotes flood events during peak flow seasons lyon and destouni 2010 smakhtin 2001 yang et al 2007 as an informative index fdc is particularly important in evaluating the flow characteristics with practical engineering hydrological applications while the potential of fdc on detecting the flow change in permafrost regions has not been fully exploited in this study we used fdcs and the corresponding percentile flows calculated from decadal daily natural or naturalized river discharge data for 20 gauge stations across the eurasia arctic and qtp which are the main permafrost regions in the northern hemisphere the percentile flow indices were used as proxies of runoff components the decadal change of fdcs and various percentile flows were analyzed we hypothesize that if the enhanced subsurface hydrological processes and low flow were widespread in permafrost regions then the river runoff components should change divergently similar to the divergence of seasonal discharge change rawlins et al 2009 our main objective is to find the multidecadal change patterns of annual runoff components and their correlations with climatic factors for the major permafrost rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data initially this study intended to include as many permafrost watersheds as possible the inclusion criterion is that the basin has permafrost distribution and long term natural daily discharge data available as a result 20 permafrost river basins and subbasins among the ob yenisey lena yangtze and yellow rivers are selected in this study table 1 and fig 1 these basins and subbasins cover a large spatial extent and represent the major permafrost regions in the northern hemisphere the river basins and subbasins have drainage areas range from 17 000 to 2 950 000 km2 table 1 ob yenisey and lena are the three largest rivers in the eurasia arctic region from 2015 to 2017 the three rivers deliver averagely of 1672 km3 of water flux per year or 68 of the total arctic river discharge to the arctic ocean holmes et al 2018 the major land cover types for ob yenisey and lena basins are forest shrubland and cropland fig s1 the yangtze and yellow river source regions are the headwaters of two great rivers in china the predominant land cover type for yangtze and yellow river source regions is grassland fig s1 the main soil types in the studied arctic and qinghai tibet plateau qtp are gelisol and inceptisol according to the united states department of agriculture soil taxonomy lithologically the ob yenisey and lena basins are mainly underlain by carbonate sedimentary rocks siliciclastic sedimentary rocks unconsolidated sediments and basic volcanic rocks while the yangtze and yellow headwaters are mainly underlain by siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and mixed sedimentary rocks fig s1 the basins are characterized by a cold and dry climate the ob yenisei lena and source regions of yangtze and yellow river basins have multiyear mean 1950 2015 basin averaged temperature of 0 2 5 6 9 8 3 3 and 1 6 respectively the mean annual precipitations ranged from 343 to 520 mm table s1 approximately 10 1 49 5 and 85 5 of ob yenisey and lena drainage basins are underlain by permafrost as the main rivers in the qtp permafrost region 77 3 and 56 1 of the yangtze and yellow source regions are underlain by permafrost zou et al 2017 permafrost in siberia has active layers about 30 60 cm thick and permafrost thickness over 500 m tarnocai 2009 the qtp permafrost region has thinner permafrost layers 10 120 m and thicker active layers 1 5 m wu and zhang 2010 the hydrogeologic function of permafrost in these basins is considered to be an aquitard however the warming and thawing of permafrost in recent decades have caused active layer thickening enhanced groundwater circulation open taliks and thermokarst landform developments which can greatly affect the hydrologic regime kurylyk and walvoord 2021 yang et al 2010 the multidecadal daily flow data of ob yenisey and lena rivers was retrieved from the r arcticnet v4 0 data repository shiklomanov 2010 both daily observed and naturalized discharge data in three larger rivers are available in this dataset the observed discharge was obtained from the state hydrological institute russia the naturalized discharge data was generated using a specially developed hydrograph transformation model htm also named as hydrograph routing model hrm which eliminated anthropogenic impacts on the river flow records shiklomanov et al 2007a stuefer et al 2011 briefly the htm routes observed daily hydrographs from upstream stations without human impacts towards the downstream using a duhamel integral approach and naturalizes the river discharge shiklomanov lammers 2009 stuefer et al 2011 the htm can provide more accurate hydrograph simulations shiklomanov lammers 2009 than the methods based on comparisons of mean pre dam and post dam hydrographs e g yang et al 2004a only the naturalized data records were used in this study since we were intended to decipher the natural change patterns of discharge for the yangtze and yellow headwater sites the natural daily discharge data were collected from the hydrographic bureau of the qinghai province the gridded precipitation matsuura and willmott 2020 and surface air temperature data cowtan et al 2019 were obtained from national center for atmospheric research website https climatedataguide ucar edu and then calculated as basin average data at an annual basis the monthly precipitation and air temperature data sets covered 1900 2017 and 1700 2019 period respectively the spatial resolutions for the precipitation and air temperature data sets are 0 5x0 5 degree and 1x1 degree respectively we chose these data sets for their long temporal coverage and high reliability the overall permafrost coverage for each basin was calculated in the same method used before song et al 2020 by allocating different percentages for each permafrost category mcclelland et al 2004 2 2 flow duration curves and percentile flows the fdc is a statistical representation of observed streamflow variability over the period of record which is composed of percentile flows that identify the flow equaled or exceeded for a given percent of time fouad et al 2018 ghotbi et al 2020 fdc is a hydrologically meaningful method that can display the complete range of river discharges from low flows to flood events smakhtin 2001 a specific frequency flow associated with fdc q pi indicates the streamflow at a given frequency pi for instance q10 and q90 represent the streamflow at exceedance probabilities of 10 and 90 respectively the percentile flows in permafrost rivers have statistically representative meaning for annual runoff components for our study basins higher flood flows at lower frequencies are associated with storm rainfall and snowmelt flows in the spring and summer seasons while the lower flows at higher frequencies reflect the low or base flows that mostly originate from groundwater figure s2 the ratios of low flow indices like q90 to q50 are commonly used to represent the groundwater contribution to total runoff al faraj and scholz 2014 smakhtin 2001 due to active groundwater evolution walvoord and kurylyk 2016 the low flow index q75 in permafrost basins should include total groundwater shallow and deep groundwater flow together but possibly exceed groundwater while q90 can reflect only steady deep groundwater for permafrost rivers as such the ratios of q90 to q50 q90 q50 and q75 to q50 q75 q50 are used as indexes representing the proportion of streamflow originating from deep and total groundwater stores respectively we used the fdc software version 2 1 https hydrooffice org tool fdc aspx to derive the fdcs and the corresponding percentile flows for each river basin using the daily natural discharge data fig s3 we computed fdcs and q pi for each year and used the q10 q20 q30 q40 q50 q60 q70 q80 q90 as representative fdc indexes and flow magnitudes for the time period examined in this study according to the common understanding of fdc the q pi spectrum from q10 to q30 represent the high flows q40 to q60 represents medium flows while q70 to q90 represents low flows fouad and loáiciga 2020 smakhtin 2001 as such q10 to q90 formed a flow gradient from high to low the surface air temperature of the northern hemisphere showed an accelerated warming rate since the 1980s cohen et al 2014 semenov et al 2010 as such we divided the naturalized discharge covered years into two periods fig s4 before 1980 p1 and since 1980 p2 the change rates of q pi from fdcs monthly and seasonal discharge were computed based on the two periods for example the change rates of qpi were calculated as follows 1 δ q pi q pi p 2 q pi p 1 q pi p 1 100 δqpi is defined as the change rate of q pi q pi p 2 and q pi p 1 is the average q pi for the period p2 and p1 respectively 2 3 data analyses we used the non parametric mann kendall trend test mk test method kendall 1975 mann 1945 to further assess the decadal change trend of different percentile flows this method is widely used in detecting trends in hydrometeorological time series data wang et al 2020 mk test gives standardized test statistic z which follows the standard normal distribution with e z 0 and v z 1 in a two tailed test for trends the null hypothesis is rejected if the absolute value of z is larger than the theoretical value z 1 α 2 where α is the statistical significance level of the test in this study we set α as 0 1 as recommended by wang et al 2020 the magnitude of the trend is also estimated with the sen s slope method sen 1968 the method computes both the slope i e linear change rate and confidence levels based on sen s method both mann kendall test and sen s slope methods were computed in r using the r package trend pohlert 2020 we used one way analysis of variance anova analysis and tukey s hsd post hoc test to compare the changes of percentile discharges for each gauge site before and after 1980 correlation analysis was used to estimate the correlation coefficients between percentile flows and annual mean surface air temperature anomaly and annual mean precipitation 3 results 3 1 variable changes of runoff components for the past decades the shapes of fdc varied by basins while the two period fdc comparisons revealed the general change patterns across the study river basins fig 2 see the enlarged version in the supplementary materials most of the fdcs showed higher high percentile parts of p2 than that of p1 for 20 basins in this study 14 of them exhibited higher fdcs after 1980 at the high percentile parts which indicated the prevalent increase of low flows in addition about half of the basins 6076 6539 6543 6544 6656 6664 6666 6950 7142 tnh jm showed lower fdcs at the high flow part suggesting decreases of specific high discharge in those basins from p1 to p2 while higher fdcs at the high flow part can also be observed fig 2 the percentile flows across river basins behaved uneven change rates at all percentiles with most percentile flows increased from p1 to p2 fig 3 a averagely q10 slightly decreased while other higher percentile flow increased q90 increased by 18 4 while q10 decreased by 1 from p1 to p2 period although the average decrease proportion of q10 was small the reduction of q10 flow can be substantial since the high magnitude of q10 flow interestingly the change rates for percentile flows increased at a positive monotonic trend along with the percentile sequences fig 3a one way anova with tukey s hsd post hoc tests showed that most of the percentile flows had statistically significant change from p1 to p2 period fig s5 as shown in fig 4 a the higher percentile flows had more upward trends while the lower percentile flows had more downward trends overall high percentile flows showed more statistically significant changes from p1 to p2 period both q75 q50 and q90 q50 ratios showed increasing trends from p1 to p2 period with average change rates of 6 for q75 q50 and 9 7 for q90 q50 fig 3b to reveal the changes of deep and total groundwater flow contributions to total runoff q75 qa and q90 qa respectively we also calculated the ratios and change rates of q75 and q90 to mean annual discharge qa for p1 and p2 as expected q90 qa also increased faster than q75 qa averagely 13 65 vs 9 67 from p1 to p2 table s2 the mann kendall test and sen s slope methods further confirmed the variable multidecadal trends of different percentile flows at almost all basins fig 4b fig 5 these results were generally consistent with the p1 p2 change rates of percentile discharge fig 3 as shown in fig 4b the higher percentile flows have more significant upward trends while the lower percentile flows have more downward trends overall high percentile flows showed more statistically significant changes from p1 to p2 period than that of low percentile flows about 73 of low flows showed significant increases from p1 to p2 while the mk test revealed 72 of significantly increased low flows fig 4 likewise streamflow at different percentiles had variable change directions and magnitudes all sites except vilyuy at chernyshevskiy 6263 showed increasing trends for the low flow indices from q70 to q90 instead a considerable portion of the high flows q10 to q30 showed decreasing trend though many of the trends are insignificant fig 4b five percent of high flows showed significant decreases from p1 to p2 while the mk test revealed about 17 of significantly decreased high flows fig 4 a small portion of stations showed increased high flows fig 4 suggesting the spatial heterogeneity of high flow change across the study basins among yenisey river basins the annual change rates of percentile flow showed increasing trends from q10 to q90 there was a tendency that the change rates shift from decreasing negative z value and sen s slope to increasing trend positive z value and sen s slope with the tipping point around q50 among the q10 to q90 sequences fig 4b fig 5 especially for yenisey basins most of the ob and lena basins sites showed overall increased percentile flows but disproportional change rates for percentile flows for the yangtze river source region both zmd and tth sites showed increasing trends for all percentile flows while the sen s slope differed by percentiles nevertheless percentile flows for all sites showed different trends at different percentiles either in the change direction or the magnitude or both 3 2 dissimilar correlations of runoff components with temperature and precipitation percentile flows showed dissimilar correlations with climate factors including temperature and precipitation high percentile flows were more closely correlated with the mean annual air temperature mat anomaly but showed little relations with mean annual precipitation map fig 6 the correlation coefficients between percentile discharge and annual mean surface air temperature anomaly rqt and annual mean precipitation rqp displayed distinct increased and decreased trends along the percentile gradient respectively averagely q10 q20 q30 and q40 showed negative correlations while q50 q60 q70 q80 and q90 showed positive correlations with mat anomaly fig 6a q80 and q90 showed the highest correlations with mat unlike the temperature correlations map was more closely correlated with low percentile flows fig 6b most of the percentile flows showed positive mean correlations with map q30 and q40 show the highest correlations with map while q90 showed minor correlations with map 4 discussions in this study we have discovered the variable changes of the runoff components represented by percentile flows across several main eurasia arctic and qtp river basins where cryospheric elements are changing rapidly under a warming climate the percentile flows also respond differently to air temperature and precipitation our results suggest those variable changes can occur across various spatial and long term temporal scales our study demonstrates that low flows increase for most of the study permafrost basins but high flows change both upwardly and downwardly the high increase rate of high percentile flows e g q90 q80 and q70 in our results are aligned with previous studies in which baseflow or winter low flow increased for many cold region rivers evans et al 2020 smith et al 2007 song et al 2020 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 the increases of high flows may be caused by the increased net precipitation zhang et al 2013 while warming induced snow cover reduction yang et al 2003 and more water storage capacity of the catchment matti et al 2016 may also decrease the high flow the relative importance of these factors among basins may differ which cause the heterogeneity of high flow change among basins among all considered basins the decrease of low percentile flows e g q10 across the yenisey basin is also consistent with the fact that the maximum river discharge decreased significantly in the south central siberia rivers shiklomanov et al 2013 decreasing maximum minimum discharge ratios and asymmetrical change of high and low flows were widespread across cold region rivers shiklomanov et al 2007b smith et al 2007 wang et al 2017 ye et al 2004 overall the variability of percentile flow change is inconsistent with some previous results including increased high flow but decreased low flow van vliet et al 2013 or the same change direction of both high and low flow gudmundsson et al 2019 in many other regions suggesting the unique hydrologic patterns of cold region rivers as shown in figs s6 and s7 and rawlins et al 2009 the change rates of winter discharge are higher than other seasons of the year for most eurasia arctic basins this lines up with the percentile flow change results since winter discharge is certainly high percentile flows ie low flow beyond this understanding we showed more details of flow change with the application of fdc and percentile flows all representative percentile flows change at different rates interestingly the average change rate of the percentile flows increased with percentiles with change direction shifts occurred in most yenisey basins not just low flow increases faster than high flow but the lower flow increases faster than the higher flow the linearly increased change rates of discharge along the percentile sequences fig 3a suggest that the fdcs of some study river basins may rotate anticlockwise in the future with upward tails low flow part as the warming and wetting continue the annual flows and low flows may increase while the high flows may change in both directions shrestha et al 2021 this will affect the water resources management and utilization strategy and river ecosystems across the cold basins as the important regulators for cryohydrology warming driven permafrost thaw and increased active layer thickness can change the river flow regime in many ways walvoord and kurylyk 2016 when flow paths propagate deeper with intensified subsurface flow connectivity and more open taliks st jacques and sauchyn 2009 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 groundwater flow in permafrost basins could increase besides as the active layer thaws deep in summer the infiltration rate and soil water capacity can increase which can lead to a lower runoff coefficient in rain runoff events thereby may decrease the peak flows in flood seasons matti et al 2016 the formation of thermokarst ponds and lake expansions can also regulate the water balance and storage capacity of the basins and eventually affect the river runoff karlsson et al 2012 nitzbon et al 2020 the higher change rate of q90 q50 than q75 q50 indicates that the components of groundwater flow increased at different speeds the faster increasing rate of deep groundwater flow q90 q50 is plausible since higher percentile flows increased faster than lower percentile flows this can also be corroborated by the fact that q90 qa increased faster than q75 qa from p1 to p2 table s2 although the increased subsurface hydrologic connectivity in permafrost basins under warming has been expected by many permafrost hydrologists it is difficult to corroborate since the lack of relevant observational data walvoord and kurylyk 2016 in winter the river discharge is sustained by the intra permafrost and sub permafrost groundwater since the active layer and supra permafrost aquifer are entirely frozen kurylyk and walvoord 2021 such steady groundwater discharge is certainly the lowest during the year with high percentiles in flood seasons low percentile flow occurs with active surface hydrologic processes and opened flow paths hence low percentile flows are associated with surface hydrologic connectivity and high percentile flows are associated with subsurface hydrologic connectivity in those permafrost basins as shown in our results the higher percentile flow increased faster than the lower percentile flow which likely suggests that the subsurface hydrologic processes are becoming more active for the past decades monitoring the subsurface hydrologic activities is challenging while the high percentile flows may provide indices for them if the subsurface hydrologic connectivity decreased or no change the variable change patterns of percentile flow cannot happen from the aforementioned interpretation therefore our analyses may provide a way to unearth the increased subsurface hydrologic connectivity in permafrost basins evans et al 2020 climate change can affect river discharge profoundly on a global scale gudmundsson et al 2021 nohara et al 2006 interestingly our results suggest that low flow discharge is more positively correlated to mat anomaly than high flow discharge which indicates that the atmospheric warming correlates with the subsurface flow more positively this pattern is likely linked to the seasonality of river discharge since increased winter baseflow or groundwater flow is largely caused by the warming induced permafrost thaw and active layer deepening evans et al 2020 huang et al 2019 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 xu et al 2020 wang et al 2021a besides the lower the runoff the closer its relationship with air temperature anomaly which may be related to the nonuniform seasonal warming the colder seasons with low flows are warming faster than warmer seasons with high lows xu et al 2013 leads to a larger impact of temperature anomaly in lower flows via enhancing subsurface hydrology warming may also change the high flows through warming induced snow cover extent reduction which can decrease the snowmelt floods bring et al 2016 the smoothed rqt curve fig 6a suggests that future climate warming can enhance not only more deep groundwater flow but also the medium low flow at different magnitudes the eurasia arctic and qtp have observed faster warming rates in winter than other seasons bintanja and van der linden 2013 graham et al 2017 liu and chen 2000 which may further enhance the winter discharge increase and strengthen the relations between low flow and temperature via multiple processes except for warming precipitation is another major driver of runoff components change in cold region basins both the arctic vihma et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 and qtp wang et al 2021b regions are wetting due to enhanced precipitation which causes increased annual mean flow percentile flows are correlated with precipitation differently as the hydrological processes of high flow and low flow are different gudmundsson et al 2011 the high flow showed high correlations with precipitations fig 6b which is plausible since the high flow is dominated by spring snowmelt events in the arctic rivers or by summer monsoonal rainfall in the qtp rivers the low flow has little relation with map which is reasonable since low flow in winter is mainly controlled by groundwater in our considered regions the increased winter solid precipitation can increase snowmelt floods in the coming year rain on snow events may also enhance snowmelt driven high flow shrestha et al 2021 however climatic warming can also change the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration bring et al 2016 posing complex controls of temperature and precipitation on river discharge change future climatic warming precipitation increase and other associated processes can have coupled effects on flow regime change nevertheless the gradually change rqt and rqp curves fig 6 suggest that river runoff components can respond differently to climatic change though note that both temperature and precipitation show relatively low correlations with each percentile flow which means neither temperature nor precipitation can fully explain the variations of percentile flow we do not rule out other factors or mechanisms that govern the changes of different percentile flows in addition the physiography difference between basins may cause different responses of streamflow change to climatic change and permafrost thaw the dominant drivers of streamflow change between basins may also differ which should be constrained in future studies 5 conclusions and implications based on the long term natural daily discharge record and the classic fdc method in hydrology we assessed the runoff components change across eurasia arctic and qtp rivers we find that the flow change varies by percentiles with high percentile flow increased faster the change rates of percentile flows increase linearly with percentiles most low flows increase for the study permafrost basins but high flows change both upwardly and downwardly the contribution of deep groundwater flow proxied by q90 qa and q90 q50 to total runoff increase faster than total groundwater flow proxied by q75 qa and q75 q50 we show that low flow is more sensitive to warming but the high flow is more sensitive to precipitation our results imply that it is necessary to separate the runoff components and gain a better understanding of the details and mechanisms of the runoff changes in cold region rivers we demonstrate that fdc has the potential for studying the permafrost river flow regime change especially for the low flow section of an fdc as the permafrost regions have intensified sub surface hydrological processes and increased baseflow the low flow indices from fdcs can be useful proxies to study the sub surface hydrology connectivity change given the sharp decline of active monitoring sites across arctic rivers laudon et al 2017 the efforts based on fdc analyses are particularly helpful to predict future flow change in those regions where flow data is lacking future studies should direct to the controls of each runoff component changes to disentangle the complex cryohydrological process changes in the permafrost regions credit authorship

4303,on the assessment of groundwater potentiality in aquifers a better understanding of the recharge patterns and flow pathways at the deeper depth is required but remains difficult by studying the long term temperature depth variation data derived from using fiber bragg grating fbg sensors the objective of the present research is to discuss and demonstrate how this technique can provide information on the groundwater flow dynamics in a multilayered fractured formation a series of borehole geophysical tests were first conducted to enable the characterization of the geological features and the presence of fracture flow an array of 12 fbg sensors is deployed at multiple predetermined screening depths after well construction has completed and the temperature depth t z trend line was established by fitting a polynomial curve to all the data points the obtained temperature gradients in the upper depth of 5 80 m were found to be convex upward from january to april uniform from may to july and concave upward from august to december which reveals a trend that the subsurface flow pattern actually varied throughout the year in other words groundwater recharge is not always a continuous steady state process a significant time delay between rainfall and its substantial contribution to the aquifer as a form of deep groundwater recharge may take place and needs to be systematically investigated keywords fractured rocks temperature monitoring fbg sensors deep groundwater recharge taiwan 1 introduction groundwater recharge is a crucial hydrological process for refreshing aquifers as defined by smerdon 2017 the recharge is an intricate connection to energy and moisture occurring in the critical zone between atmosphere and subsurface and riedel and weber 2020 stated that it is all water that increases the volume of aquifer the status of groundwater recharge is thus subject to all sorts of natural and human induced processes and to conduct an objective and impartial evaluation on its spatial and temporal variability is challenging since the direct measurement of recharge was deemed to be extremely difficult sharma 1986 or simply not possible bakker et al 2013 a variety of techniques were only dedicated to the broad estimation of recharge potential on the basis of the velocity approach sophocleous and perry 1984 shanafield and cook 2014 martos rosillo et al 2015 doble and crosbie 2017 as pointed out in the review of scanlon et al 2002 the reliability of recharge estimates needs to be checked against field information to reduce uncertainties lacking reliable flow velocity data concerning recharge to aquifers is thus a critical issue as it implies that the prediction from modeling is likely to be unreliable kitching et al 1980 among all the current quantification techniques the use of temperature depth t z profile for computing groundwater velocity has been considered as a feasible and promising approach bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 cartwright 1979 constantz et al 2003 blasch et al 2007 theoretically speaking the distribution of subsurface temperature in an aquifer is subject to the ratio of hydraulic conductivity to thermal diffusivity the geometry of flow domenico and palciauskas 1973 and a variety of near surface geological processes including weathering glaciation and irregular topography richardson and oxburgh 1978 bense and kooi 2004 as such the variations in temperature can therefore use to track the heat carried by the flow of groundwater stonestrom and constantz 2003 in the recent decade the majority of temperature logging applications have been placed on characterizing the shallow infiltration process of groundwater within the top few meters bair and parizek 1978 kayane et al 1985 jaynes 1990 taniguchi and sharma 1993 constantz et al 1994 ronan et al 1998 anibas et al 2008 duque et al 2010 gosselin et al 2016 kikuchi and ferré 2017 while by comparison the application cases presented in investigating the groundwater recharge in the consolidated aquifer at deeper depths were relatively limited anderson 2005 pointed out that it is probably due to difficulties in acquiring the necessary input data in fractured formations for analyzing convective heat transfer flow and temporal measurements in every depth of the water column are time consuming and economically impractical berthold and börner 2008 attempting to reveal the potential mechanism of deep groundwater recharge in the field most of the earlier studies were conducted to observe the presence of temperature gradient anomalies

1984 to achieve an accurate estimate of the rate of fluid flow by analyzing thermal anomalies a rule of thumb is to establish precise temperature measurements at closely spaced intervals ferguson and woodbury 2005 also suggested that temperature measurements ought to be placed at the depth at which the specific discharge is high that is to say a continuous t z profile established in space and time is inevitably needed which is however a common limitation for the platinum resistance transducer or thermocouple sensor because of different logging rates and response times of the probes may result

al 2012 blume et al 2013 pehme et al 2013 banks et al 2014 matheswaran et al 2014 klepikova et al 2014 coleman et al 2015 hare et al 2015 seibertz et al 2016 mawer et al 2016 arricibita et al 2018 sebok et al 2018 marruedo arricibita et al 2018 medina et al 2020 both in the field forced convection or under laboratory controlled conditions the majority of current applications were focused on monitoring shallow groundwater discharge to surface water while very few investigating the potential of recharge in consolidated formations besides before deploying the measurement device into the borehole dts needs to be wrapped around either a cable or the casing and installed immediately after drilling and the wrapping interval and spatial sampling resolution thus need to be adequately taken into account since it is non replaceable by contrast as indicated by bense et al 2016 and shanafield et al 2018 the use of fiber bragg gratings fbg as a downhole distributed sensor would be an alternative option because it has higher flexibility in installment location and spacing the principle of fbg temperature measurement has been well elucidated in many studies based on fresnel reflection and transmission formula the fbg sensor is etched with a diffraction grating that associated with periodic modulation of refractive index which functionally leads to the reflection of light at a particular wavelength when the fbg is illuminated by a broadband source only a narrow band of wavelengths the bragg resonance wavelength will be reflected since the reflected range of wavelengths subject to the change of strain and thermal effect fbg sensor can be used to provide a single output of actual temperature while isolated from any mechanical strain or arranged multipoint in series to detect the variation of temperature in distinct spatial and temporal patterns in comparison with the dts technique fbg sensor has lower fiber loss electromagnetic immunity smaller sensor sizes higher sensitivity and multiplexing capability sabri et al 2015 additionally the sensing time of the fbg sensor is way much shorter within the range of seconds to milliseconds fujihashi et al 2007 as selker et al 2006 has described that the use of fbgs can be seen as a semi distributed fiber optic method this technique would therefore be more suited for in situ applications if real time data monitoring is a significant demand at the present time a number of current studies have applied fbg temperature sensing in civil engineering and environmental monitoring li et al 2004 moyo et al 2005 hong et al 2016 however to the best of knowledge very few were found that adopted this technique for long term hydrogeological investigation the usability of fbg sensors can be connected in series or parallel and placed exclusively at specifically concerned depths according to site specific considerations in situ test data and prior knowledge this technique provides partially distributed space time temperature measurements to investigate continuous groundwater flow and the associated thermal gradients it accompanies with no physical limitations to the traditional distributed temperature sensing dts technique such as signal loss due to poor mechanical connection sampling rate limited by the circuit processing speeds and long term temporal repeatability tyler et al 2009 most importantly this technique is low in maintenance and operation costs this study presents an experimental investigation on the long term groundwater dynamics in a mountainous igneous rock aquifer in taiwan less attention was devoted to the study of hydrogeological conditions in this specific area the objective of the present research is to ascertain whether the aquifer is affected by advection due to localized recharge of the deep groundwater system and more specifically to examine the feasibility of applying fbg temperature sensing in this setting in situ borehole geophysical logging straddle packer hydraulic testing and stratified groundwater monitoring were carried out since 2018 2019 the year round subsurface temperature depth t z profile was continuously monitored and used as a passive tracer of groundwater flow based on the acquired informative data this paper shows how seasonal variation of groundwater recharge patterns are quantified by analyzing the stratified temperature gradient 2 methodology 2 1 site description the study was conducted at beitou taipei city northern taiwan this area is known for mineral and geothermal potential from the early 1900s where a series of studies on that focused on the surficial hydrological systems have been performed jang 2015 jean et al 2016 liu et al 2016 maity et al 2017 but very few documented aquifer hydraulic tests have been described to allow accurate interpretation of local hydrogeological properties huang gang creek named for the presence of sulfur in the water is the main river flowing through beitou as the flow directed into the river originates from tatun mountain volcano group the relatively high concentration of aquatic heavy metals such as arsenic have been identified in the river basin as a result it is of great significance to understand the active interactions between surface water groundwater and all related geo environmental consequences the investigation site locates inside the campus of yi fang elementary school near the huang gang creek the altitude of the site is 96 m a s l situated on the foothill of tatun mountain fig 1 according to lithological interpretations by central geological survey of taiwan 2018 five units from top to bottom can be broadly identified a colluvium layer on the top that extends to a depth of 7 4 m which is composed of unconsolidated sediments and rock fragments the interface of colluvium bedrock is likely equivalent to the bottom elevation of huang gang creek four types of bedrocks are underlain including tuff b1 12 9 m andesite b2 55 7 m tuff breccia b3 61 5 m and volcanic pyroclastic breccia b4 100 m as such it is typically a multi layered igneous rock formation 2 2 in situ downhole investigation the preliminary hydrogeological investigation was conducted in june to july 2018 the first borehole bh1 4 in was drilled to a depth of 100 m that penetrates all five lithological units in the progress of drilling the groundwater level declined from 6 to 14 m below the surface which infers that the presence of geological barriers to groundwater flow has been unblocked after the drilling was completed a series of geophysical tests have been conducted including geophysical logging borehole imaging core inspection and straddle packer hydraulic testing the measurement of the fluid temperature probe one off logging has indicated that groundwater temperature increases from 25 to 35 c bottom of the borehole vertical flowmeter logging has identified that discontinuities in hydraulic head occurred along with several upwelling flow paths at depths between 45 and 75 m below the surface the implementation of the straddle packer hydraulic test based on the constant head method revealed that the hydraulic conductivity in the formation of andesite b2 lies between 1 4 10 6 3 9 10 5 m s higher than the results obtained in the lower volcanic pyroclastic breccia b4 2 9 10 8 1 3 10 7 m s among all the tests the most significant response subject to lithological difference is likely to be the bulk porosity φ calculated from full waveform sonic logging this type of sonde provides insight into the acoustic velocity of compressional waves passing through the formation which is correlated with the rock strength elastic properties of formations rock matrix density and lithological porosity in general the velocity depth profile of consolidated igneous or metamorphic rock is relatively faster in comparison with that of unconsolidated rock typically the greater the acoustic velocity of the formation the higher the formation density and the lower the obtained rock porosity as illustrated in fig 1 a strong consistency with the distribution of lithology and geological structures is shown the formation having the lower mean porosity is the andesite b2 while the tuff breccia b3 and the volcanic pyroclastic breccia b4 are characterized by higher porosity values the well logging result is illustrated in fig 2 based on the initial investigation using geophysical logs the second borehole bh2 8 in was drilled to a depth of 25 m and spaced by a distance of 3 m from borehole bh1 according to the results of the geophysical logging straddle packer hydraulic testing and rock core evaluation well screens were installed at three depths to allow monitoring of the groundwater levels including 74 80 m 58 64 m below the borehole bh1 and 10 22 m below the borehole bh2 two high precision piezometers are placed in each borehole the focus of borehole bh1 is on monitoring the upwelling flow pattern identified by flowmeter logging while borehole bh2 is on monitoring the shallow down welling flow pattern observed in the initial round of drilling 2 3 instrumentation after one month of stabilization period while well construction has completed an optical fiber bragg grating fbg sensing assembly was deployed in situ at multiple predetermined depths the assembly consists of a pair of single mode fibers an optical sensing interrogator si155 micron optics one channel 1500 1600 nm scan range and 1000 hz scan rate and a tablet computer with ac power supply since the focus of the current study is paid on advection derived temperature variation the majority of fbg sensors have been deployed in the range of borehole screen i e the intake portion of wells that have been identified to be the zones of focused groundwater discharge eight fbg temperature sensors were installed in borehole bh1 at the depths of 5 m 40 m 59 m 61 m 63 m 75 m 77 m and 79 m below the surface while four sensors were installed in borehole bh2 at the depths of 14 m 16 m 18 m and 20 m below the surface with a spatial sampling interval of 2 m the configuration fbg temperature monitoring points are illustrated in fig 3 and presented in table 1 the temperature dependence of each fbg sensor is calibrated by equation 1 below 1 λb t λb t0 kt t t0 where λb t is the bragg resonance wavelength nm measured at temperature t t0 is the reference temperature c kt is the temperature sensitivity factor nm c the magnitude of λb t0 and kt were calculated in a thermally controlled oven as such the applied temperature can be directly measured in the field for the continuous monitoring of subsurface temperature the scanning frequency is set to a rate of 1 60 hz to have temperature records once every second to a minute fig 4 shows a comparison of temperature depth t z profile obtained by using a fluid temperature probe before well construction and by using distributed fbg sensors one month later two runs of temperature logs take the measurements in the borehole center have shown a close match at the shallow depth only while the temperature measurement at the greater depth obtained by using fbg sensors is generally lower it means the thermal recovery effect induced by drilling and well construction has eliminated in addition both types of measurement reveal a more significant thermal gradient below the depth of 50 m and it accounts for the fact that the thermal conductivity at the deeper depth tuff breccia b3 and volcanic pyroclastic breccia b4 is much lower in comparison with that in the formation of andesite b2 as shown above in fig 3 the first law of heat conduction known as fourier s law states that if the heat transfer rate is kept constant a larger thermal conductivity would provide a smaller temperature gradient and vice versa in fig 4 a more significant thermal gradient can be observed at the deeper formations that have higher porosity values which represents that the thermal conductivity at the deeper depth is lower in comparison with that in the shallow formation of andesite b2 associated with lower porosity it is self evident that an inverse correlation exists between bulk porosity see fig 1 and thermal conductivity besides steps in fbgs temperature logs have shown at the sections of the screen and it reveals that there is presence of hydraulic leakages berthold and börner 2008 down into b3 and b4 units proving warmer fluid flow to the borehole and serving as the primary control of borehole temperature profiles klepikova et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishment of temperature depth profile by taking a period of one month as a basis for discussion the t z profile was established as illustrated in fig 5 and at which the temperature logs obtained at the depth of fbg sensors were marked by dark points the temperature profile for the water columns at the well casing is assumed to be governed by natural convection and as suggested by berthold and börner 2008 a linear interpolation is applied to two consecutive fbg data points of the sequence to represent the corresponding temperature distribution those are marked by hollow points the temperature depth trend line is produced by fitting a polynomial curve an order of 3 to all the data points in fig 5 and shown by a thick dashed line for a monthly average value as well as a pair of solid lines for monthly maximum and minimum as can be seen in the current case a much significant temperature difference has shown at the deeper depth in borehole bh1 and an overall convex upward temperature depth profile has shown to reflect a downward discharge groundwater flow pattern anderson 2005 taniguchi et al 2007 3 2 distribution of annual temperature logs fig 6 shows the scatter plot and distribution of annual temperature logs within the observation period of 2019 measured by fbg sensors as our survey reveals there were no groundwater pumping or water treatment facilities in the area it can be reasonably inferred that the observed underground temperature disturbance was governed by groundwater flow due to the localized hydraulic gradient for comparison temperature records were arranged in terms of screen depth as the following a the temperature logs of t6 t7 t8 and t9 over the screen depth in borehole bh2 b the temperature logs of t3 t4 and t5 over the first screen depth in borehole bh1 and c the temperature logs of t9 t10 and t11 over the second screen depth in borehole bh1 as can be seen in fig 6 there is considerable variability among individual temperature profiles obtained at different depths seasonal temperature oscillation was not shown at both shallow and deep subsurface levels that is to say the subsurface temperature depth profiles are not influenced by seasonal temperature variations of the land surface but instead sensitive to vertical borehole flow velocities klepikova et al 2014 noticeably by taking the change of temperature gradients across t6 and t9 as a reference a short period of temperature rising was detected at t7 16 m below the land surface between may and june followed by a continuous recession over the second half of 2019 the possible explanation as referred to the study of anderson 2005 with respect to the change of temperature gradients induced by the vertical borehole flow is that under ambient flow condition when t z gradient showed a convex upward pattern in the vicinity of a permeable fracture zone it tends to reflect the outflow or discharge of groundwater i e the aquifer was losing water to the downstream along the course of the fractured zone while a concave upward pattern of t z gradient owing to the continuous recession of temperature at t7 identified hereafter june reflects the opposite the convective inflow of groundwater i e the aquifer was gaining water receives recharge from the upstream and the temperature of inflow water was relatively colder than the surrounding stratigraphic horizons away from the fracture zone the obtained temperature time series characteristics at various depths in borehole bh1 are found to increase with time over the first screen depth in borehole bh1 the variation of temperature logs among t3 t4 and t5 was observed to be in a manner consistent with each other and the annual temperature increment was about 2 c interestingly temperature logs at the middle of the screen t4 were found to be persistently lower than the top and bottom monitoring points t3 and t5 during the investigation and it accounts for the fact that the first screen depth in borehole bh1 served as a drainage divide between two adjacent outflow openings over the second screen depth in borehole bh1 as the temperature logs at the top edge t10 was relatively higher than the rest two monitoring points t11 and t12 a negative temperature gradient was formed which implies a heat sink due to the existence of lateral flow somewhere above t10 75 m below the land surface and the flow was in a state of discharge the temperature gradient became larger after april and the annual temperature increment was about 5 6 c it accounts for the fact that the second screen depth 74 to 80 m below the land surface is of the most significant convective zone of groundwater flow in borehole bh1 in this manner the convective flow pattern and temperature field throughout observation are interlinked 3 3 seasonal variation of temperature depth profile the variation of the temperature gradient is then established based on the monthly t z profile the monthly average temperature of 12 fbg temperature monitoring points was summarized in table 2 and a comparison between water levels and rainfall data was shown in fig 7 rainfall data were collected at tian mu station provided by the central weather bureau cwb of taiwan the station locates at the southeast in the same catchment area of yi fang with a straight line distance of 3 8 km the histogram depicting the monthly rainfall in 2019 for tian mu has been displayed at the bottom right of fig 7 according to the data of rainfall distribution by month the climate is characterized by strong seasonal variations rainfall is monsoonal with a wetter south westerly monsoon from may to september and a drier north easterly one from october to next april this results in two distinct rainy periods long and significant rains from may to september and short rains in march and december with an annual rainfall above 2 300 mm as can be seen in fig 7 a gradual change of the monthly temperature gradient was shown which can be classified into three stages for discussion from january to april stage i at the turn of winter and spring the temperature depth profiles were observed to be convex upward which represents a downward discharge groundwater flow pattern anderson 2005 the accumulated rainfall in this period was 341 5 mm accounting for 14 3 of the whole year s amount the continuous drop of groundwater level has been observed in borehole bh1 the deep subsurface levels but not in borehole bh2 which means the aquifer was losing water from the lower part based on the mass conservation principle for a closed controlsystem it can be explained by a decrease in storage delta s 0 in this groundwater system such condition was slow down by the end of april from may to july stage ii at the turn of spring and summer the accumulated rainfall was recorded to be 1 080 mm accounting for 45 3 of the whole year s amount the variations of observed groundwater levels in formation b1 and b2 were mixed and both are found to be inconsistent with rainfall patterns interestingly the differences in monthly temperature depth profiles were not significant meanwhile the corresponding temperature gradient was relatively uniform which means the groundwater flow pattern was nearly still and the aquifer was in a dormant state in other words a quasi balance in gains and losses of groundwater in the aquifer has held constant throughout this period and the contribution of rainfall recharge to the aquifer was yet to emerge over these three months from august to december stage iii throughout the autumn and winter the temperature depth profiles have slowly turned into a concave upward profile showing a groundwater recharge flow pattern the piezometric level in bh1 and bh2 keeps at a level around 15 m and 6 m underground respectively and infrequent pulses can be observed subsequent to precipitation the accumulated rainfall in the same period was 959 9 mm account for 40 3 of the whole year s total as shown by the rainfall histogram for monthly precipitation in fig 7 the bulk is only concentrated in september in this context to take reference to the variation of individual temperature logs as shown in fig 6 the aquifer was in a state of gaining water from the higher part i e the screen depth in bh2 and the contribution of rainfall in the previous time was deposited and probably recharged to the aquifer at this moment since the storage has increased delta s 0 according to the indication of temperature depth profiles 3 4 interpretations of subsurface flow patterns the seasonal variation of subsurface flow pattern at yi fang indicated by t z profile is illustrated in fig 8 which enables different spatial configurations and interpretations to be studied firstly at a borehole scale the ambient flow pattern is location specific as the estimation of hydraulic properties depends upon not only the lithological features but also the corresponding ratio of flow velocity to the hydraulic gradient the analysis of subsurface flow patterns at various depths thus plays an important role a direct comparison between the temperature logging derived and actual flow patterns is required which needs to compute over a relatively small temporal variance secondly for the interpretation at a local scale the integration of site specific information and appropriate field measurements is compulsory not only the effects of geological structure upon the varied flow patterns need to be well considered but attention also requires to be paid on giving a rational account of time lapse between rainfall and the rise in groundwater level similar findings have also been reported by cai and ofterdinger 2016 and kotchoni et al 2019 as indicated in their studies the time lapse between rainfalls to groundwater level response is attributed to matrix storage features or local lithological controls on rain fed recharge as well as the thickness of unsaturated zone in our present case of a multilayered fractured formation as the t z gradients associated with subsurface flow pattern shown in fig 7 a multi month time lag has shown after post monsoonal time it accounts for the fact that possibly the local groundwater domain tends to be dominated by very slow flow pathways lastly at a regional scale the temporal variation of temperature depth profile indicates that different boundary conditions geometrical parameters the occurrence of rainfall events and the actual time interval of aquifer responses all need to be taken into account when simulating deep groundwater recharge behaviors in a catchment as shown in fig 7 the concave upward temperature depth profile mainly occurs in the second half of the year which means the aquifer was gaining water at the shallow depth from the rain fed recharge but continuously losing water at the deeper depth during the autumn and winter time similar findings were also noted by gabrielli and mcdonnell 2018 whose study was based on groundwater isotopic signatures and noble gas temperatures analysis as indicated in the previous study that multi scale investigations could lead to substantial variability in hydraulic properties and flow ranking dausse et al 2019 the approach of temperature logging that adopted in this study would provide a posteriori information on the internal structure of aquifer system and enable reliable predictions on the properties of different investigated scales it is crucial and of prime importance for groundwater modeling 4 conclusions groundwater recharge is a fundamental hydrologic process but there are very few field studies providing reliable and conclusive support for its temporal variability the reliability of recharge estimates needs to be carefully checked against field information to reduce uncertainties that is to say if lacking direct measurement or evidence of groundwater flow over different time scales it is challenging to quantify the actual contribution of recharge to the aquifer and particularly more complicated when the evaluation is undertaken in a deep fractured formation unlike the majority of previous studies where all temperature sensors were distributed all along the borehole we proposed a new and efficient approach for qualitative assessment of groundwater recharge in case the geometrical configuration of well has long been determined this study demonstrates that with an adequately designed investigation subsurface temperature logging would be a feasible and efficient approach to evaluate the pattern of deep groundwater recharge in fractured aquifer in a multi layered fractured aquifer where wells were screened at varying depths the use of fiber bragg grating fbg temperature sensors is a promising option for long term monitoring the usability of fbg sensors can be connected in series and placed exclusively at specifically concerned depths this technique provides partially distributed space time temperature measurements to assist in the investigation of continuous groundwater flow and the associated thermal gradients although the acquired data in the current study is limited it is informative enough to reveal a trend that the general assumption of groundwater recharge being a continuous year round process needs to systematically investigate since it may not be the case if the groundwater flow pattern was governed by a multi layered complex fracture system a significant time delay between rainfall and its substantial contribution to the aquifer as a form of deep groundwater recharge could occur such time lapse response is deemed to relate to local lithological composition and matrix storage features it accounts for the fact that especially in a compound multi layered fractured formation the movement of groundwater tends to be dominated by a series of slow flow pathways including intergranular pore spaces large fracture continua and neighboring horizons at the contact between two strata in such case the observed pattern of groundwater level change at different depths is likely a combination effect of piston flow and preferential flow paths i e there is a multi step change in hydraulic head in this type of aquifer if the variability of rainfall inputs is high and the interconnectivity of flow pathways is low an uneven velocity distribution along each strata may be formed which in our opinion would become a critical point of influence in the calculation of regional water budget with regard to the follow up study as the current study has suggested a trend it is recommended that a much longer period of data acquisition for multi depth temperature logs stratified groundwater level records and seasonal rainfall distribution would be needed for obtaining continuous recharge assessment only in this way an adequate and comprehensive interpretation of subsurface flow patterns can be obtained in addition more data on a lateral scale is also important to validate the findings drawn and to support the application of the fbg sensors in groundwater recharge credit authorship contribution statement po yi chou conceptualization methodology data curation

4303,on the assessment of groundwater potentiality in aquifers a better understanding of the recharge patterns and flow pathways at the deeper depth is required but remains difficult by studying the long term temperature depth variation data derived from using fiber bragg grating fbg sensors the objective of the present research is to discuss and demonstrate how this technique can provide information on the groundwater flow dynamics in a multilayered fractured formation a series of borehole geophysical tests were first conducted to enable the characterization of the geological features and the presence of fracture flow an array of 12 fbg sensors is deployed at multiple predetermined screening depths after well construction has completed and the temperature depth t z trend line was established by fitting a polynomial curve to all the data points the obtained temperature gradients in the upper depth of 5 80 m were found to be convex upward from january to april uniform from may to july and concave upward from august to december which reveals a trend that the subsurface flow pattern actually varied throughout the year in other words groundwater recharge is not always a continuous steady state process a significant time delay between rainfall and its substantial contribution to the aquifer as a form of deep groundwater recharge may take place and needs to be systematically investigated keywords fractured rocks temperature monitoring fbg sensors deep groundwater recharge taiwan 1 introduction groundwater recharge is a crucial hydrological process for refreshing aquifers as defined by smerdon 2017 the recharge is an intricate connection to energy and moisture occurring in the critical zone between atmosphere and subsurface and riedel and weber 2020 stated that it is all water that increases the volume of aquifer the status of groundwater recharge is thus subject to all sorts of natural and human induced processes and to conduct an objective and impartial evaluation on its spatial and temporal variability is challenging since the direct measurement of recharge was deemed to be extremely difficult sharma 1986 or simply not possible bakker et al 2013 a variety of techniques were only dedicated to the broad estimation of recharge potential on the basis of the velocity approach sophocleous and perry 1984 shanafield and cook 2014 martos rosillo et al 2015 doble and crosbie 2017 as pointed out in the review of scanlon et al 2002 the reliability of recharge estimates needs to be checked against field information to reduce uncertainties lacking reliable flow velocity data concerning recharge to aquifers is thus a critical issue as it implies that the prediction from modeling is likely to be unreliable kitching et al 1980 among all the current quantification techniques the use of temperature depth t z profile for computing groundwater velocity has been considered as a feasible and promising approach bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 cartwright 1979 constantz et al 2003 blasch et al 2007 theoretically speaking the distribution of subsurface temperature in an aquifer is subject to the ratio of hydraulic conductivity to thermal diffusivity the geometry of flow domenico and palciauskas 1973 and a variety of near surface geological processes including weathering glaciation and irregular topography richardson and oxburgh 1978 bense and kooi 2004 as such the variations in temperature can therefore use to track the heat carried by the flow of groundwater stonestrom and constantz 2003 in the recent decade the majority of temperature logging applications have been placed on characterizing the shallow infiltration process of groundwater within the top few meters bair and parizek 1978 kayane et al 1985 jaynes 1990

investigating the groundwater recharge in the consolidated aquifer at deeper depths were relatively limited anderson 2005 pointed out that it is probably due to difficulties in acquiring the necessary input data in fractured formations for analyzing convective heat transfer flow and temporal measurements in every depth of the water column are time consuming and economically impractical berthold and

attention was devoted to the study of hydrogeological conditions in this specific area the objective of the present research is to ascertain whether the aquifer is affected by advection due to localized recharge of the deep groundwater system and more specifically to examine the feasibility of applying fbg temperature sensing in this setting in situ borehole geophysical logging straddle packer hydraulic testing and stratified groundwater monitoring were carried out since 2018 2019 the year round subsurface temperature depth t z profile was continuously monitored and used as a passive tracer of groundwater flow based on the acquired informative data this paper shows how seasonal variation of groundwater recharge patterns are quantified by analyzing the stratified temperature gradient 2 methodology 2 1 site description the study was conducted at beitou taipei city northern taiwan this area is known for mineral and geothermal potential from the early 1900s where a series of studies on that focused on the surficial hydrological systems have been performed jang 2015 jean et al 2016 liu et al 2016 maity et al 2017 but very few documented aquifer hydraulic tests have been described to allow accurate interpretation of local hydrogeological properties huang gang creek named for the presence of sulfur in the water is the main river flowing through beitou as the flow directed into the river originates from tatun mountain volcano group the relatively high concentration of aquatic heavy metals such as arsenic have been identified in the river basin as a result it is of great significance to understand the active interactions between surface water groundwater and all related geo environmental consequences the investigation site locates inside the campus of yi fang elementary school near the huang gang creek the altitude of the site is 96 m a s l situated on the foothill of tatun mountain fig 1 according to lithological interpretations by central geological survey of taiwan 2018 five units from top to bottom can be broadly identified a colluvium layer on the top that extends to a depth of 7 4 m which is composed of unconsolidated sediments and rock fragments the interface of colluvium bedrock is likely equivalent to the bottom elevation of huang gang creek four types of bedrocks are underlain including tuff b1 12 9 m andesite b2 55 7 m tuff breccia b3 61 5 m and volcanic pyroclastic breccia b4 100 m as such it is typically a multi layered igneous rock formation 2 2 in situ downhole investigation the preliminary hydrogeological investigation was conducted in june to july 2018 the first borehole bh1 4 in was drilled to a depth of 100 m that penetrates all five lithological units in the progress of drilling the groundwater level declined from 6 to 14 m below the surface which infers that the presence of geological barriers to groundwater flow has been unblocked after the drilling was completed a series of geophysical tests have been conducted including geophysical logging borehole imaging core inspection and straddle packer hydraulic testing the measurement of the fluid temperature probe one off logging has indicated that groundwater temperature increases from 25 to 35 c bottom of the borehole vertical flowmeter logging has identified that discontinuities in hydraulic head occurred along with several upwelling flow paths at depths between 45 and 75 m below the surface the implementation of the straddle packer hydraulic test based on the constant head method revealed that the hydraulic conductivity in the formation of andesite b2 lies between 1 4 10 6 3 9 10 5 m s higher than the results obtained in the lower volcanic pyroclastic breccia b4 2 9 10 8 1 3 10 7 m s among all the tests the most significant response subject to lithological difference is likely to be the bulk porosity φ calculated from full waveform sonic logging this type of sonde provides insight into the acoustic velocity of compressional waves passing through the formation which is correlated with the rock strength elastic properties of formations rock matrix density and lithological porosity in general the velocity depth profile of consolidated igneous or metamorphic rock is relatively faster in comparison with that of unconsolidated rock typically the greater the acoustic velocity of the formation the higher the formation density and the lower the obtained rock porosity as illustrated in fig 1 a strong consistency with the distribution of lithology and geological structures is shown the formation having the lower mean porosity is the andesite b2 while the tuff breccia b3 and the volcanic pyroclastic breccia b4 are characterized by higher porosity values the well logging result is illustrated in fig 2 based on the initial investigation using geophysical logs the second borehole bh2 8 in was drilled to a depth of 25 m and spaced by a distance of 3 m from borehole bh1 according to the results of the geophysical logging straddle packer hydraulic testing and rock core evaluation well screens were installed at three depths to allow monitoring of the groundwater levels including 74 80 m 58 64 m below the borehole bh1 and 10 22 m below the borehole bh2 two high precision piezometers are placed in each borehole the focus of borehole bh1 is on monitoring the upwelling flow pattern identified by flowmeter logging while borehole bh2 is on monitoring the shallow down welling flow pattern observed in the initial round of drilling 2 3 instrumentation after one month of stabilization period while well construction has completed an optical fiber bragg grating fbg sensing assembly was deployed in situ at multiple predetermined depths the assembly consists of a pair of single mode fibers an optical sensing interrogator si155 micron optics one channel 1500 1600 nm scan range and 1000 hz scan rate and a tablet computer with ac power supply since the focus of the current study is paid on advection derived temperature variation the majority of fbg sensors have been deployed in the range of borehole screen i e the intake portion of wells that have been identified to be the zones of focused groundwater discharge eight fbg temperature sensors were installed in borehole bh1 at the depths of 5 m 40 m 59 m 61 m 63 m 75 m 77 m and 79 m below the surface while four sensors were installed in borehole bh2 at the depths of 14 m 16 m 18 m and 20 m below the surface with a spatial sampling interval of 2 m the configuration fbg temperature monitoring points are illustrated in fig 3 and presented in table 1 the temperature dependence of each fbg sensor is calibrated by equation 1 below 1 λb t λb t0 kt t t0 where λb t is the bragg resonance wavelength nm measured at temperature t t0 is the reference temperature c kt is the temperature sensitivity factor nm c the magnitude of λb t0 and kt were calculated in a thermally controlled oven as such the applied temperature can be directly measured in the field for the continuous monitoring of subsurface temperature the scanning frequency is set to a rate of 1 60 hz to have temperature records once every second to a minute fig 4 shows a comparison of temperature depth t z profile obtained by using a fluid temperature probe before well construction and by using distributed fbg sensors one month later two runs of temperature logs take the measurements in the borehole center have shown a close match at the shallow depth only while the temperature measurement at the greater depth obtained by using fbg sensors is generally lower it means the thermal recovery effect induced by drilling and well construction has eliminated in addition both types of measurement reveal a more significant thermal gradient below the depth of 50 m and it accounts for the fact that the thermal conductivity at the deeper depth tuff breccia b3 and volcanic pyroclastic breccia b4 is much lower in comparison with that in the formation of andesite b2 as shown above in fig 3 the first law of heat conduction known as fourier s law states that if the heat transfer rate is kept constant a larger thermal conductivity would provide a smaller temperature gradient and vice versa in fig 4 a more significant thermal gradient can be observed at the deeper formations that have higher porosity values which represents that the thermal conductivity at the deeper depth is lower in comparison with that in the shallow formation of andesite b2 associated with lower porosity it is self evident that an inverse correlation exists between bulk porosity see fig 1 and thermal conductivity besides steps in fbgs temperature logs have shown at the sections of the screen and it reveals that there is presence of hydraulic leakages berthold and börner 2008 down into b3 and b4 units proving warmer fluid flow to the borehole and serving as the primary control of borehole temperature profiles klepikova et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishment of temperature depth profile by taking a period of one month as a basis for discussion the t z profile was established as illustrated in fig 5 and at which the temperature logs obtained at the depth of fbg sensors were marked by dark points the temperature profile for the water columns at the well casing is assumed to be governed by natural convection and as suggested by berthold and börner 2008 a linear interpolation is applied to two consecutive fbg data points of the sequence to represent the corresponding temperature distribution those are marked by hollow points the temperature depth trend line is produced by fitting a polynomial curve an order of 3 to all the data points in fig 5 and shown by a thick dashed line for a monthly average value as well as a pair of solid lines for monthly maximum and minimum as can be seen in the current case a much significant temperature difference has shown at the deeper depth in borehole bh1 and an overall convex upward temperature depth profile has shown to reflect a downward discharge groundwater flow pattern anderson 2005 taniguchi et al 2007 3 2 distribution of annual temperature logs fig 6 shows the scatter plot and distribution of annual temperature logs within the observation period of 2019 measured by fbg sensors as our survey reveals there were no groundwater pumping or water treatment facilities in the area it can be reasonably inferred that the observed underground temperature disturbance was governed by groundwater flow due to the localized hydraulic gradient for comparison temperature records were arranged in terms of screen depth as the following a the temperature logs of t6 t7 t8 and t9 over the screen depth in borehole bh2 b the temperature logs of t3 t4 and t5 over the first screen depth in borehole bh1 and c the temperature logs of t9 t10 and t11 over the second screen depth in borehole bh1 as can be seen in fig 6 there is considerable variability among individual temperature profiles obtained at different depths seasonal temperature oscillation was not shown at both shallow and deep subsurface levels that is to say the subsurface temperature depth profiles are not influenced by seasonal temperature variations of the land surface but instead sensitive to vertical borehole flow velocities klepikova et al 2014 noticeably by taking the change of temperature gradients across t6 and t9 as a reference a short period of temperature rising was detected at t7 16 m below the land surface between may and june followed by a continuous recession over the second half of 2019 the possible explanation as referred to the study of anderson 2005 with respect to the change of temperature gradients induced by the vertical borehole flow is that under ambient flow condition when t z gradient showed a convex upward pattern in the vicinity of a permeable fracture zone it tends to reflect the outflow or discharge of groundwater i e the aquifer was losing water to the downstream along the course of the fractured zone while a concave upward pattern of t z gradient owing to the continuous recession of temperature at t7 identified hereafter june reflects the opposite the convective inflow of groundwater i e the aquifer was gaining water receives recharge from the upstream and the temperature of inflow water was relatively colder than the surrounding stratigraphic horizons away from the fracture zone the obtained temperature time series characteristics at various depths in borehole bh1 are found to increase with time over the first screen depth in borehole bh1 the variation of temperature logs among t3 t4 and t5 was observed to be in a manner consistent with each other and the annual temperature increment was about 2 c interestingly temperature logs at the middle of the screen t4 were found to be persistently lower than the top and bottom monitoring points t3 and t5 during the investigation and it accounts for the fact that the first screen depth in borehole bh1 served as a drainage divide between two adjacent outflow openings over the second screen depth in borehole bh1 as the temperature logs at the top edge t10 was relatively higher than the rest two monitoring points t11 and t12 a negative temperature gradient was formed which implies a heat sink due to the existence of lateral flow somewhere above t10 75 m below the land surface and the flow was in a state of discharge the temperature gradient became larger after april and the annual temperature increment was about 5 6 c it accounts for the fact that the second screen depth 74 to 80 m below the land surface is of the most significant convective zone of groundwater flow in borehole bh1 in this manner the convective flow pattern and temperature field throughout observation are interlinked 3 3 seasonal variation of temperature depth profile the variation of the temperature gradient is then established based on the monthly t z profile the monthly average temperature of 12 fbg temperature monitoring points was summarized in table 2 and a comparison between water levels and rainfall data was shown in fig 7 rainfall data were collected at tian mu station provided by the central weather bureau cwb of taiwan the station locates at the southeast in the same catchment area of yi fang with a straight line distance of 3 8 km the histogram depicting the monthly rainfall in 2019 for tian mu has been displayed at the bottom right of fig 7 according to the data of rainfall distribution by month the climate is characterized by strong seasonal variations rainfall is monsoonal with a wetter south westerly monsoon from may to september and a drier north easterly one from october to next april this results in two distinct rainy periods long and significant rains from may to september and short rains in march and december with an annual rainfall above 2 300 mm as can be seen in fig 7 a gradual change of the monthly temperature gradient was shown which can be classified into three stages for discussion from january to april stage i at the turn of winter and spring the temperature depth profiles were observed to be convex upward which represents a downward discharge groundwater flow pattern anderson 2005 the accumulated rainfall in this period was 341 5 mm accounting for 14 3 of the whole year s amount the continuous drop of groundwater level has been observed in borehole bh1 the deep subsurface levels but not in borehole bh2 which means the aquifer was losing water from the lower part based on the mass conservation principle for a closed controlsystem it can be explained by a decrease in storage delta s 0 in this groundwater system such condition was slow down by the end of april from may to july stage ii at the turn of spring and summer the accumulated rainfall was recorded to be 1 080 mm accounting for 45 3 of the whole year s amount the variations of observed groundwater levels in formation b1 and b2 were mixed and both are found to be inconsistent with rainfall patterns interestingly the differences in monthly temperature depth profiles were not significant meanwhile the corresponding temperature gradient was relatively uniform which means the groundwater flow pattern was nearly still and the aquifer was in a dormant state in other words a quasi balance in gains and losses of groundwater in the aquifer has held constant throughout this period and the contribution of rainfall recharge to the aquifer was yet to emerge over these three months from august to december stage iii throughout the autumn and winter the temperature depth profiles have slowly turned into a concave upward profile showing a groundwater recharge flow pattern the piezometric level in bh1 and bh2 keeps at a level around 15 m and 6 m underground respectively and infrequent pulses can be observed subsequent to precipitation the accumulated rainfall in the same period was 959 9 mm account for 40 3 of the whole year s total as shown by the rainfall histogram for monthly precipitation in fig 7 the bulk is only concentrated in september in this context to take reference to the variation of individual temperature logs as shown in fig 6 the aquifer was in a state of gaining water from the higher part i e the screen depth in bh2 and the contribution of rainfall in the previous time was deposited and probably recharged to the aquifer at this moment since the storage has increased delta s 0 according to the indication of temperature depth profiles 3 4 interpretations of subsurface flow patterns the seasonal variation of subsurface flow pattern at yi fang indicated by t z profile is illustrated in fig 8 which enables different spatial configurations and interpretations to be studied firstly at a borehole scale the ambient flow pattern is location specific as the estimation of hydraulic properties depends upon not only the lithological features but also the corresponding ratio of flow velocity to the hydraulic gradient the analysis of subsurface flow patterns at various depths thus plays an important role a direct comparison between the temperature logging derived and actual flow patterns is required which needs to compute over a relatively small temporal variance secondly for the interpretation at a local scale the integration of site specific information and appropriate field measurements is compulsory not only the effects of geological structure upon the varied flow patterns need to be well considered but attention also requires to be paid on giving a rational account of time lapse between rainfall and the rise in groundwater level similar findings have also been reported by cai and ofterdinger 2016 and kotchoni et al 2019 as indicated in their studies the time lapse between rainfalls to groundwater level response is attributed to matrix storage features or local lithological controls on rain fed recharge as well as the thickness of unsaturated zone in our present case of a multilayered fractured formation as the t z gradients associated with subsurface flow pattern shown in fig 7 a multi month time lag has shown after post monsoonal time it accounts for the fact that possibly the local groundwater domain tends to be dominated by very slow flow pathways lastly at a regional scale the temporal variation of temperature depth profile indicates that different boundary conditions geometrical parameters the occurrence of rainfall events and the actual time interval of aquifer responses all need to be taken into account when simulating deep groundwater recharge behaviors in a catchment as shown in fig 7 the concave upward temperature depth profile mainly occurs in the second half of the year which means the aquifer was gaining water at the shallow depth from the rain fed recharge but continuously losing water at the deeper depth during the autumn and winter time similar findings were also noted by gabrielli and mcdonnell 2018 whose study was based on groundwater isotopic signatures and noble gas temperatures analysis as indicated in the previous study that multi scale investigations could lead to substantial variability in hydraulic properties and flow ranking dausse et al 2019 the approach of temperature logging that adopted in this study would provide a posteriori information on the internal structure of aquifer system and enable reliable predictions on the properties of different investigated scales it is crucial and of prime importance for groundwater modeling 4 conclusions groundwater recharge is a fundamental hydrologic process but there are very few field studies providing reliable and conclusive support for its temporal variability the reliability of recharge estimates needs to be carefully checked against field information to reduce uncertainties that is to say if lacking direct measurement or evidence of groundwater flow over different time scales it is challenging to quantify the actual contribution of recharge to the aquifer and particularly more complicated when the evaluation is undertaken in a deep fractured formation unlike the majority of previous studies where all temperature sensors were distributed all along the borehole we proposed a new and efficient approach for qualitative assessment of groundwater recharge in case the geometrical configuration of well has long been determined this study demonstrates that with an adequately designed investigation subsurface temperature logging would be a feasible and efficient approach to evaluate the pattern of deep groundwater recharge in fractured aquifer in a multi layered fractured aquifer where wells were screened at varying depths the use of fiber bragg grating fbg temperature sensors is a promising option for long term monitoring the usability of fbg sensors can be connected in series and placed exclusively at specifically concerned depths this technique provides partially distributed space time temperature measurements to assist in the investigation of continuous groundwater flow and the associated thermal gradients although the acquired data in the current study is limited it is informative enough to reveal a trend that the general assumption of groundwater recharge being a continuous year round process needs to systematically investigate since it may not be the case if the groundwater flow pattern was governed by a multi layered complex fracture system a significant time delay between rainfall and its substantial contribution to the aquifer as a form of deep groundwater recharge could occur such time lapse response is deemed to relate to local lithological composition and matrix storage features it accounts for the fact that especially in a compound multi layered fractured formation the movement of groundwater tends to be dominated by a series of slow flow pathways including intergranular pore spaces large fracture continua and neighboring horizons at the contact between two strata in such case the observed pattern of groundwater level change at different depths is likely a combination effect of piston flow and preferential flow paths i e there is a multi step change in hydraulic head in this type of aquifer if the variability of rainfall inputs is high and the interconnectivity of flow pathways is low an uneven velocity distribution along each strata may be formed which in our opinion would become a critical point of influence in the calculation of regional water budget with regard to the follow up study as the current study has suggested a trend it is recommended that a much longer period of data acquisition for multi depth temperature logs stratified groundwater level records and seasonal rainfall distribution would be needed for obtaining continuous recharge assessment only in this way an adequate and comprehensive interpretation of subsurface flow patterns can be obtained in addition more data on a lateral scale is also important to validate the findings drawn and to support the application of the fbg sensors in groundwater recharge credit authorship contribution statement po yi chou conceptualization methodology data curation

4304,process based streamflow prediction is subjected to large uncertainties in model parameters and parameterizations related to the complex processes involved in streamflow generation the data driven models offer efficient alternatives without considering the physical processes but their applications are limited by non stationarity existing in observations in this study we propose a hybrid model namely the diff ffnn lstm model to predict hourly streamflow the model comprises three components namely the first order difference diff feedforward neural network ffnn and long short term memory network lstm when applied to the andun basin of china the proposed diff ffnn lstm model performs very well in hourly streamflow prediction with a rmse of 9 31 m3 s with average streamflow rate of 54 m3 s and a mae of 3 63 m3 s for all the flood events in the testing period the comparison with five other machine learning models of similar complexity or model structure and four statistical models show superiority of our proposed diff ffnn lstm model the shapley additive explanations was used to quantify the contribution of each model input to the prediction skill streamflow at the previous hour was identified as the most important input and streamflow generally contribute more than precipitation inputs closer to the prediction time do not necessarily have a greater impact on the model prediction the study highlights the power of the combining of different data driven methods and the promising prospect of our hybrid model in hydrological predictions keywords streamflow prediction difference method feedforward neural network algorithm long short term memory network 1 introduction short term streamflow prediction is essential for flood control and mid and long term predictions are important for water resources management and hydropower generation the models for streamflow prediction can be divided into two categories physical process based models and data driven models kratzert et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 physical process based models are developed based on the understanding of the runoff generation processes transport in channels and mathematical formulations or parameterization of these physical processes data on topography soil texture and land use cover among others are the most critical inputs to process based hydrological models in addition large amount of hydrometeorological data are needed to calibrate the model parameters and the conceptual model can even be influenced when the catchment data do not meet the water balance constraints well beven 2020 in addition the uncertainty from precipitation and hydrology has an unnegligible influence on streamflow prediction krzysztofowicz 2002 and the complex interaction between different sources of errors can further depress the prediction accuracy biondi and de luca 2013 the problem of equifinality of different model structures and parameter sets also bring difficulties for model users beven and freer 2001 all these requirements and the issues of uncertainty and equifinality have limited the operational use of process based models yoon et al 2011 on the other hand data driven models have the advantages of low demand of model input and ease of use statistical models are the typical examples of this category and have been widely used in streamflow predictions over different regions chen et al 2017 huang et al 2014 including for example moving average model adnan et al 2017 autoregressive model ar li et al 2015 autoregressive moving average model arma mohammadi et al 2006 autoregressive integrated moving average model arima valipour et al 2013 wen et al 2019 however these models typically assume a linear relationship between input and output which cannot account for the nonlinearity of the processes related to runoff generation and thus negatively affects the model performance amiri and esmail 2015 different from statistical models machine learning methods are effective in describing the nonlinear characteristics of the observations and offer an alternative approach for streamflow prediction machine learning methods such as support vector regression svr yu et al 2018 bayesian regression br achieng and zhu 2019 artificial neural network ann tan et al 2018 random forest rf oppel and schumann 2020 and long short term memory network lstm kao et al 2020 have been increasingly used in the recent years and show good prediction skills the feedforward neural networks ffnn is one of the most widely used ann algorithm elena and armando 2002 used a ffnn to simulate the runoff processes in the sieve river basin in italy and showed that when trained on an adequately representative data the ffnn model outperforms the conceptual approach chowdhary and shrivastava 2010 used a ffnn combined with radial basis function to forecast runoff in indian rivers and produced an accurate forecast of daily streamflow at particular gauges discharge stations awchi 2014 used ffnn grnn rbfnn and mlr respectively to forecast the river discharge at the monthly time scale at bakhma and dokan sites in the upper and lower zab river of northern iraq and showed that the ffnn performance was superior to others however ffnn has limitations in fully extracting information from time series data specifically ffnn erases the past states of the network when processing time series data and thus cannot capture or benefit from information associated with data sequence kao et al 2020 different from ffnn recurrent neural networks rnn transform the hidden nodes into a cyclic structure and serialize the input data when learning the nonlinear relationship between input and output and are able to capture the temporal dynamic very well as a kind of rnn long short term memory network lstm offers unique advantages while keeping the general characteristic of rnn lstm can store the long term memory and overcome the gradient fading problem existing in the original rnn because lstm adds a forget gate besides the input and output gates lee et al 2020 hochreiter and schmidhuber showed that lstm performed better than an original rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 in recent years lstm has been used as a strong tool in various studies such as accident diagnosis yang and kim 2018 electricity price prediction ghoddusi et al 2019 soil moisture forecast shen and fang 2019 and precipitation nowcasting shi et al 2015 for hydrological applications zhang et al 2018 compared the performance of different neural network architectures for simulating and predicting the water levels of a combined sewer structure in drammen norway they confirmed that lstm as well as another rnn structure with the cellular memory is more suitable for multi step prediction than the traditional structure without explicit cellular memory in many applications lstm s performance was shown to be superior for example yuan et al 2018 showed that the lstm model was more accurate than other models in predicting monthly runoff wang et al 2017 showed that the lstm model outperforms back propagation neural network bp nn and online sequential extreme learning machine os elm models in water quality forecast bowes et al 2019 found that lstm performs better than the original rnn in predicting groundwater table response to storm events in a coastal environment one challenge facing the practical application of machine learning based predictions is the non stationarity of the observational data machine learning models cannot fully deal with the highly non stationary time series zhang et al 2015 to address this issue decomposition methods e g empirical mode decomposition emd can be used to smooth the data however direct application of the time series decomposition technique to the whole data set will bring the information associated the verification data into the training data in other words the future information could guide the training process of the model with the decomposition methods which leads to the backward induction problem and makes the results unreliable zhang et al 2015 in addition previous studies have shown that severe boundary effects may occur when a model with an integrated decomposition approach is used for prediction zuo et al 2020 which can reduce the accuracy of runoff predictions zhang et al 2015 the differential method is easy to use and straightforward to make the data stationary and does not suffer from the boundary effect in this study we propose a new hybrid streamflow prediction model namely diff ffnn lstm model to predict streamflow at the hourly time scale the proposed model is the combination of the differential method diff the ffnn and the lstm to test the effectiveness of each component we compare predictions using this hybrid model with those based on the ffnn lstm model diff ffnn model diff lstm model ffnn model lstm model and four other statistical models i e multiple linear regression mlr autoregressive ar autoregressive moving average arma and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model to examine the improvement brought by each component of the combined model furthermore we carry out the explanatory analysis and quantify the impact of various model inputs on the model prediction 2 methods 2 1 model algorithm 2 1 1 difference method in this study the first order difference is used to stabilize the streamflow time series 1 x t diff x t 1 o x t o t 1 n 1 where n is the length of data series x t o and x t 1 o are the data record at time t and t 1 respectively and x t diff is the first order difference based on x t o and x t 1 o and will be used as the input for the prediction model 2 1 2 feedforward neural network algorithm feedforward neural network ffnn adopts a unidirectional multi layer structure consisting of an input layer multiple hidden layers and an output layer each layer contains several neurons that are connected between adjacent layers the signal comes from the input layer and propagates one way to the output layer in ffnn with no feedback connections a typical multi layer feedforward neural network is shown in fig 1 for each neuron the following conversion occurs when signal flows through the network 2 y f i 1 n x i w i b i where y is the output x i is the input n is the number of inputs w i is the weight b i is the deviation and f is the activation function the relu function is taken as the activation function in this study as it can overcome the problem of the gradient disappearance and accelerate the training process in addition relu can make the network sparse and reduce the interdependence of parameters which helps to alleviate the overfitting problem the relu function is expressed as 3 r e l u x x x 0 0 x 0 2 1 3 long short term memory network algorithm the lstm is a kind of rnn and was proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 to overcome the shortcomings e g gradient fading problem of the conventional rnn over the years the lstm has been widely used in hydrology such as river flood prediction le et al 2019 runoff prediction sezen et al 2019 streamflow prediction feng et al 2020 and groundwater level prediction jeong and park 2019 in general a complete lstm model contains multiple lstm blocks and each lstm block has two transfer states neuron state represented by ct and hidden state represented by ht as shown in fig 2 the neuron states are similar between adjacent lstm blocks while the hidden states are quite different in different lstm blocks for a single lstm block it receives the current input xt from the outside and the hidden state ht 1 and neuron state ct 1 from the previous lstm block fig 3 shows the internal structure of a lstm block there are four internal states zi t zf t zo t and zg t which are estimated as follows 4 z t i σ s w hi h t 1 w i x t b i 5 z t f σ s w hf h t 1 w f x t b f 6 z t o σ s w ho h t 1 w o x t b o 7 z t g t a n h w hg h t 1 w g x t b g in eqs 4 7 w and b represent the weight and the deviation respectively zi t zf t and zo t respectively represent the input gate the forget gate and the output gate a sigmoid activated function σ s in eqs 4 6 are used to transform the output to a value between 0 and 1 zg t is treated as the input information of the current lstm block and is converted to a value between 1 and 1 by a tanh activation function the internal operation of a lstm block consists of three stages the first stage is regulated by the forget gate zf t which determines what information coming from the previous lstm block ct 1 will be thrown away from the neurons the second stage is regulated by the input gate zi t the stored new information in the neurons is determined in this stage the third stage is regulated by output gate zo t where the hidden state is updated based on information obtained in stages 1 and 2 the mathematical expressions of the process in the three stages are as follows 8 c t z t f c t 1 z t i z t g 9 h t y t z t o t a n h c t where and represent matrix multiplication and matrix addition respectively y t is an output of the current lstm block 2 1 4 diff ffnn lstm model the diff ffnn lstm model contains three different methods the difference method diff the ffnn and the lstm the three methods and the combination of ffnn and lstm are four components of the hybrid model as shown in fig 4 in the first stage diff is used to stabilize the initialized streamflow data in the middle stage the stabilized streamflow and rainfall from the component diff is processed by a multi layer ffnn in addition a lstm also processes the stabilized streamflow we use lstm only for streamflow because a robust sequential correlation exists in the hourly streamflow data but weak in the precipitation data some studies have shown that the previous runoff sequence is very helpful to improve the performance of the model feng et al 2020 in the last stage a shallow ffnn is used to combine the outputs from the multi layer ffnn and the lstm in the middle stage and obtain the final streamflow prediction the commonly used training approach is to treat each sub model in the integrated system independently with such training approaches the sub models are trained separately and are combined together until the performance of all the sub models are satisfied chen et al 2019 2020 different from previous studies the sub models are connected in the training process in this study the parameters of all the sub models are updated synchronously as one sub model has an impact on

explanations shap to understand the model behaviors at present a common method to quantify feature sensitivity is to score feature importance by recording the total average information gain of features in the training process for example gradient boosting decision tree xu et al 2014 random forest yaseen et al 2020 and other ensemble models use this type of method for the feature sensitivity analysis however this type of method is not suitable for the diff ffnn lstm model in this study since the splitting number and the information gain do not exist in neural network models other methods used to analyze the feature sensitivity of neural network model include the methods based on the connection weight garson 1991 based on the partial derivative dimopoulos et al 1995 or based on the input variable disturbance qi et al 2016 however these methods are local sensitivity analysis which only consider the influence of a single variable on the output in fact it is necessary to consider the interactions between variables in designing sensitivity analysis experiment gevrey et al 2006 based on the game theory shap is a global sensitivity analysis method proposed by lundberg and lee 2017 which can be used to quantify the contribution of each model input to the model output since it considers the influence of the interactions between input variables on the output it is more in line with the actual situation the solid theoretical foundation lends additional credibility to the shap analysis results using shap the contribution of input variable is calculated based on the marginal contribution 16 i s n i s n s 1 n v s i v s where i represents the contribution of input variable i to the model output n represents the number of input variables n is the complete set of input variables s represents the set of elements before variable i in the sequence which is a subset of n v s represents the value generated by the cooperation of the elements included in the subset s one can clearly see the effect of each input on the model output by comparing their corresponding shap values 3 study area and data we test the performance of the machine learning based streamflow forecast in the andun basin of southeast china located in guangdong province the andun river basin has a subtropical monsoon climate with high temperature and humidity due to the influence of the southeast asian monsoon and the lotus mountains heavy rain and flood often occur in the monsoon season in this basin the annual precipitation is 1761 mm of which approximately 80 is accounted for by rainfall during the flood season april to september the total catchment area of the andun basin is 404 km2 and the upstream area of the jiuzhou hydrological station is 385 km2 the length of the basin is 51 km and the average slope is 4 33 there are six rain stations within the andun basin including meiziping yangtan cangxia songkeng andun and jiuzhou and jiuzhou is also the only hydrological station in the basin with long term mean river discharge at the average of 54 m3 s or 1056 mm of annual streamflow over the basin the information of each station is listed in table 1 and the spatial distribution of the stations is shown in fig 5 observations at the six rain stations and the jiuzhou hydrological station during the period of 1980 2016 is used in this study as show in table 1 the arithmetic average of rainfall data across the six stations is taken as the areal rainfall due to small size of the basin based on results from the streamflow autocorrelation and streamflow rainfall cross correlation analyses we choose rainfall with a previous time of 1 10 h and the streamflow with a previous time of 1 7 h as the model inputs and predict the streamflow for the next hour based on these 17 inputs we divide the data into training and testing sets in chronological order each accounting for 80 and 20 of the total records respectively the training set is used to calibrate the model parameters while the testing set is used to evaluate model performance to make model inputs consistent and speed up the convergence during the model training grus 2015 ioffe and szegedy 2015 the rainfall and streamflow are normalized before the training process 17 d i n o r m d i o r i g d m i n o r i g d m a x o r i g d m i n o r i g where i is the sequence number of observational records and d i n o r m d i o r i g d m i n o r i g and d m a x o r i g represent the normalized value the original value the minimum and the maximum in the original time series respectively 4 results and discussions the ffnn and lstm in the middle stage of the model are two components of the proposed diff ffnn lstm model the number of the hidden layer and neuron node for these two components is determined by the grid search method separately the final prediction is achieved with a shallow ffnn by taking the output of the middle stage of the model as the inputs table 2 shows the structures of these three components of the diff ffnn lstm model the back propagation bp algorithm and adam are used as the model training algorithm and the optimizer for model training respectively and the training process is divided into two steps in the first step we train the entire network with a learning rate of 0 001 in the second step we lower the learning rate of the ffnn component to 0 0001 while keeping the learning rate of other components as 0 001 and then train the hybrid model on the basis of parameters obtained in the first step through the training in the second step the model can further extract useful information contained in the previous runoff sequence fig 6 shows the final prediction of the diff ffnn lstm model for the training set and the testing test respectively the predictions for the two sets are in good agreement with observations the trained model can even capture very high streamflow in the testing set that have not occurred in the training set which demonstrates the generalized ability of the diff ffnn lstm model to show the diff ffnn lstm model s effectiveness we further compare the performance of this proposed model with that of four statistical models multiple linear regression mlr autoregressive ar autoregressive moving average arma and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model in addition to examine the improvement from one or two components to the diff ffnn lstm model we present the predictions using lstm ffnn ffnn lstm diff ffnn diff lstm according to the statistics the diff ffnn lstm model is the best among the ten models for both training and testing sets tables 3 and 4 in general the prediction accuracies of all models are lower in the validation process than those in the calibration process for the testing set ar performs worst among all the ten models and all machine learning algorithms improve the streamflow prediction among the six machine learning models lstm is the worst based on all statistics adding the different treatments into the lstm model helps in improving the model performance for example rmse is reduced by 8 6 from 20 29 m3 s in the lstm model to 18 54 m3 s in the diff lstm model similar improvement is found from the ffnn models compared to the diff ffnn model the combination of ffnn with lstm also leads to improvement over ffnn or lstm alone as shown by a reduction of rmse mae mre and an increase of nse and cc diff ffnn lstm model is superior to the four statistical models and all the other five machine learning models with a rmse of 9 31 m3 s a mae of 3 63 m3 s a mre of 0 076 a nse of 0 99 a cc of 0 995 and a qr of 94 the comparison among these ten models can also be seen in fig 7 the fitted lines for the diff lstm diff ffnn and diff ffnn lstm models are very close to the 1 1 line by contrast the predictions by the lstm ffnn and ffnn lstm models show less agreement with observations which indicates the validity of difference method we divide the streamflow into three categories based on its value low 0 m3 s 50 m3 s medium 50 m3 s 400 m3 s and high 400 m3 s and evaluate the performance of the diff ffnn lstm model in predicting the streamflow at different categories as shown in table 5 the proposed hybrid model can accurately predict streamflow across different levels although the performance in predicting low streamflow show a certain degree of deterioration from the training set to the testing set as shown in fig 8 five flood events were selected to evaluate the diff ffnn lstm model s ability to capture the temporal evolution of streamflow these five events cover different times of peak flow and different durations the shortest flood lasted for 3 days and the most prolonged flood lasted for 18 days as shown in fig 8 the hybrid model can reasonably reproduce flood fluctuations over time for different flood types reflecting its stability and robustness the shap values for each of the diff ffnn lstm model inputs are shown in fig 9 the inputs are in descending order from top to bottom on the y axis according to their contribution to the model s prediction and the corresponding shap value is on the x axis a positive negative shap value means that the contribution of the input to the model prediction is positive negative and the larger the absolute value of shap is the higher the contribution is if the contributions of multiple samples are similar the points are piled in a vertical arrangement to be visually distinguished from one another the color of a point represents the value of inputs in the samples with green representing the maximum value and blue representing the minimum value it is concluded from fig 9 that on the whole the contribution of streamflow inputs is more significant than that of precipitation inputs and dt 1 has the greatest positive influence on the predicted results among other elements in time series some inputs e g dt 2 dt 3 dt 6 pt 6 and pt 10 have negative contributions to the model which means that a larger value of these inputs leads to a smaller predicted streamflow value moreover inputs closer to the prediction time do not always mean a greater impact on the model prediction for example the contribution of dt 4 is smaller than that of dt 5 and dt 6 another example is that the contribution of pt 4 is the largest among all the precipitation time series 5 conclusions a hybrid model the diff ffnn lstm model is proposed in this study to improve streamflow prediction based on the non stationary hourly data the model combines three methods namely the difference method the ffnn algorithm and the lstm algorithm the hybrid diff ffnn lstm model is compared with four different statistical models and different combinations of its component models in addition the shap value is used to further analyze the diff ffnn lstm model to understand the influence of various inputs on the model predictions the prediction results show that the machine learning methods perform better than the statistical methods the prediction of the model combining ffnn and lstm is better than that of the ffnn algorithm or the lstm algorithm alone the difference method in the diff ffnn lstm model can effectively stabilize the non stationary streamflow sequence and it is more convenient and straightforward than the decomposition method more importantly the difference method can avoid the backward induction problem and boundary effects exiting in the decomposition method in general the diff ffnn lstm model proposed in this paper can effectively improve the non stationary data based predictions the analysis using the shap value shows that on the whole previous streamflow has a greater impact on the prediction than previous precipitation and inputs closer to the prediction time may not mean greater impact on the prediction previous streamflow and precipitation with certain lag times may have negative contributions to the model which is different from our understanding based on the physical process based models in this study we only carried out a streamflow prediction with a leading time of 1 h predictions with a longer lead time would be more useful for decision makers and will be tackled in our future research using the hybrid model developed in this study in addition we will test the model transferability in basins with different hydrometeorological conditions to establish the robustness of the algorithm funding this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no

4304,process based streamflow prediction is subjected to large uncertainties in model parameters and parameterizations related to the complex processes involved in streamflow generation the data driven models offer efficient alternatives without considering the physical processes but their applications are limited by non stationarity existing in observations in this study we propose a hybrid model namely the diff ffnn lstm model to predict hourly streamflow the model comprises three components namely the first order difference diff feedforward neural network ffnn and long short term memory network lstm when applied to the andun basin of china the proposed diff ffnn lstm model performs very well in hourly streamflow prediction with a rmse of 9 31 m3 s with average streamflow rate of 54 m3 s and a mae of 3 63 m3 s for all the flood events in the testing period the comparison with five other machine learning models of similar complexity or model structure and four statistical models show superiority of our proposed diff ffnn lstm model the shapley additive explanations was used to quantify the contribution of each model input to the prediction skill streamflow at the previous hour was identified as the most important input and streamflow generally contribute more than precipitation inputs closer to the prediction time do not necessarily have a greater impact on the model prediction the study highlights the power of the combining of different data driven methods and the promising prospect of our hybrid model in hydrological predictions keywords streamflow prediction difference method feedforward neural network algorithm long short term memory network 1 introduction short term streamflow prediction is essential for flood control and mid and long term predictions are important for water resources management and hydropower generation the models for streamflow prediction can be divided into two categories physical process based models and data driven models kratzert et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 physical process based models are developed based on the understanding of the runoff generation processes transport in channels and mathematical formulations or parameterization of these physical processes data on topography soil texture and land use cover among others are the most critical inputs to process based hydrological models in addition large amount of hydrometeorological data are needed to calibrate the model parameters and the conceptual model can even be influenced when the catchment data do not meet the water balance constraints well beven 2020 in addition the uncertainty from precipitation and hydrology has an unnegligible influence on streamflow prediction krzysztofowicz 2002 and the complex interaction between different sources of errors can further depress the prediction accuracy biondi and de luca 2013 the problem of equifinality of different model structures and parameter sets also bring difficulties for model users beven and freer 2001 all these requirements and the issues of uncertainty and equifinality have limited the operational use of process based models yoon et al 2011 on the other hand data driven models have the advantages of low demand of model input and ease of use statistical models are the typical examples of this category and have been widely used in streamflow predictions over different regions chen et al 2017 huang et al 2014 including for example moving average model adnan et al 2017 autoregressive model ar li et al 2015 autoregressive moving average model arma mohammadi et al 2006 autoregressive integrated moving average model arima valipour et al 2013 wen et al 2019 however these models typically assume a linear relationship between input and output which cannot account for the nonlinearity of the processes related to runoff generation and thus negatively affects the model performance amiri and esmail 2015 different from statistical models machine learning methods are effective in describing the nonlinear characteristics of the observations and offer an alternative approach for streamflow prediction machine learning methods such as support vector regression svr yu et al 2018 bayesian regression br achieng and zhu 2019 artificial neural network ann tan et al 2018 random forest rf oppel and schumann 2020 and long short term memory network lstm kao et al 2020 have been increasingly used in the recent years and show good prediction skills the feedforward neural networks ffnn is one of the most widely used ann algorithm elena and armando 2002 used a ffnn to simulate the runoff processes in the sieve river basin in italy and showed that when trained on an adequately representative data the ffnn model outperforms the conceptual approach chowdhary and shrivastava 2010 used a ffnn combined with radial basis function to forecast runoff in indian rivers and produced an accurate forecast of daily streamflow at particular gauges discharge stations awchi 2014 used ffnn grnn rbfnn and mlr respectively to forecast the river discharge at the monthly time scale at bakhma and dokan sites in the upper and lower zab river of northern iraq and showed that the ffnn performance was superior to others however ffnn has limitations in fully extracting information from time series data specifically ffnn erases the past states of the network when processing time series data and thus cannot capture or benefit from information associated with data sequence kao et al 2020 different from ffnn recurrent neural networks rnn transform the hidden nodes into a cyclic structure and serialize the input data when learning the nonlinear relationship between input and output and are able to capture the temporal dynamic very well as a kind of rnn long short term memory network lstm offers unique advantages while keeping the general characteristic of rnn lstm can store the long term memory and overcome the gradient fading problem existing in the original rnn because lstm adds a forget gate besides the input and output gates lee et al 2020 hochreiter and schmidhuber showed that lstm performed better than an original rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 in recent years lstm has been used as a strong tool in various studies such as accident diagnosis yang and kim 2018 electricity price prediction ghoddusi et al 2019 soil moisture forecast shen and fang 2019 and precipitation nowcasting shi et al 2015 for hydrological applications zhang et al 2018 compared the performance of different neural network architectures for simulating and predicting the water levels of a combined sewer structure in drammen norway they confirmed that lstm as well as another rnn structure with the cellular memory is more suitable for multi step prediction than the traditional structure without explicit cellular memory in many applications lstm s performance was shown to be superior for example yuan et al 2018 showed that the lstm model was more accurate than other models in predicting monthly runoff wang et al 2017 showed that the lstm model outperforms back propagation neural network bp nn and online sequential extreme learning machine os elm models in water quality forecast bowes et al 2019 found that lstm performs better than the original rnn in predicting groundwater table response to storm events in a coastal environment one challenge facing the practical application of machine learning based predictions is the non stationarity of the observational data machine learning models cannot fully deal with the highly non stationary time series zhang et al 2015 to address this issue decomposition methods e g empirical mode decomposition emd can be used to smooth the data however direct application of the time series decomposition technique to the whole data set will bring the information associated the verification data into the training data in other words the future information could guide the training process of the model with the decomposition methods which leads to the backward induction problem and makes the results unreliable zhang et al 2015 in addition previous studies have shown that severe boundary effects may occur when a model with an integrated decomposition approach is used for prediction zuo et al 2020 which can reduce the accuracy of runoff predictions zhang et al 2015 the differential method is easy to use and straightforward to make the data stationary and does not suffer from the boundary effect in this study we propose a new hybrid streamflow prediction model namely diff ffnn lstm model to predict streamflow at the hourly time scale the proposed model is the combination of the differential method diff the ffnn and the lstm to test the effectiveness of each component we compare predictions using this hybrid model with those based on the ffnn lstm model diff ffnn model diff lstm model ffnn model lstm model and four other statistical models i e multiple linear regression mlr autoregressive ar autoregressive moving average arma and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model to examine the improvement brought by each component of the combined model furthermore we carry out the explanatory analysis and quantify the impact of various model inputs on the model prediction 2 methods 2 1 model algorithm 2 1 1 difference method in this study the first order difference is used to stabilize the streamflow time series 1 x t diff x t 1 o x t o t 1 n 1 where n is the length of data series x t o and x t 1 o are the data record at time t and t 1 respectively and x t diff is the first order difference based on x t o and x t 1 o and will be used as the input for the prediction model 2 1 2 feedforward neural network algorithm feedforward neural network ffnn adopts a unidirectional multi layer structure consisting of an input layer multiple hidden layers and an output layer each layer contains several neurons that are connected between adjacent layers the signal comes from the input layer and propagates one way to the output layer in ffnn with no feedback connections a typical multi layer feedforward neural network is shown in fig 1 for each neuron the following conversion occurs when signal flows through the network 2 y f i 1 n x i w i b i where y is the output x i is the input n is the number of inputs w i is the weight b i is the deviation and f is the activation function the relu function is taken as the activation function in this study as it can overcome the problem of the gradient disappearance and accelerate the training process in addition relu can make the network sparse and reduce the interdependence of parameters which helps to alleviate the overfitting problem the relu function is expressed as 3 r e l u x x x 0 0 x 0 2 1 3 long short term memory network algorithm the lstm is a kind of rnn and was proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 to overcome the shortcomings e g gradient fading problem of the conventional rnn over the years the lstm has been widely used in hydrology such as river flood prediction le et al 2019 runoff prediction sezen et al 2019 streamflow prediction feng et al 2020 and groundwater level prediction jeong and park 2019 in general a complete lstm model contains multiple lstm blocks and each lstm block has two transfer states neuron state represented by ct and hidden state represented by ht as shown in fig 2 the neuron states are similar between adjacent lstm blocks while the hidden states are quite different in different lstm blocks for a single lstm block it receives the current input xt from the outside and the hidden state ht 1 and neuron state ct 1 from the previous lstm block fig 3 shows the internal structure of a lstm block there are four internal states zi t zf t zo t and zg t which are estimated as follows 4 z t i σ s w hi h t 1 w i x t b i 5 z t f σ s w hf h t 1 w f x t b f 6 z t o σ s w ho h t 1 w o x t b o 7 z t g t a n h w hg h t 1 w g x t b g in eqs 4 7 w and b represent the weight and the deviation respectively zi t zf t and zo t respectively represent the input gate the forget gate and the output gate a sigmoid activated function σ s in eqs 4 6 are used to transform the output to a value between 0 and 1 zg t is treated as the input information of the current lstm block and is converted to a value between 1 and 1 by a tanh activation function the internal operation of a lstm block consists of three stages the first stage is regulated by the forget gate zf t which determines what information coming from the previous lstm block ct 1 will be thrown away from the neurons the second stage is regulated by the input gate zi t the stored new information in the neurons is determined in this stage the third stage is regulated by output gate zo t where the hidden state is updated based on information obtained in stages 1 and 2 the mathematical expressions of the process in the three stages are as follows 8 c t z t f c t 1 z t i z t g 9 h t y t z t o t a n h c t where and represent matrix multiplication and matrix addition respectively y t is an output of the current lstm block 2 1 4 diff ffnn lstm model the diff ffnn lstm model contains three different methods the difference method diff the ffnn and the lstm the three methods and the combination of ffnn and lstm are four components of the hybrid model as shown in fig 4 in the first stage diff is used to stabilize the initialized streamflow data in the middle stage the stabilized streamflow and rainfall from the component diff is processed by a multi layer ffnn in addition a lstm also processes the stabilized streamflow we use lstm only for streamflow because a robust sequential correlation exists in the hourly streamflow data but weak in the precipitation data some studies have shown that the previous runoff sequence is very helpful to improve the performance of the model feng et al 2020 in the last stage a shallow ffnn is used to combine the outputs from the multi layer ffnn and the lstm in the middle stage and obtain the final streamflow prediction the commonly used training approach is to treat each sub model in the integrated system independently with such training approaches the sub models are trained separately and are combined together until the performance of all the sub models are satisfied chen et al 2019 2020 different from previous studies the sub models are connected in the training process in this study the parameters of all the sub models are updated synchronously as one sub model has an impact on the other sub models 2 2 evaluation statistics 10 c c 1 n i 1 n x o i x o x m i x m i 1 n x o i x o 2 i 1 n x m i x m 2 correlation coefficient cc mean absolute error mae mean relative error mre root

statistics adding the different treatments into the lstm model helps in improving the model performance for example rmse is reduced by 8 6 from 20 29 m3 s in the lstm model to 18 54 m3 s in the diff lstm model similar improvement is found from the ffnn models compared to the diff ffnn model the combination of ffnn with lstm also leads to improvement over ffnn or lstm alone as shown by a reduction of rmse mae mre and an increase of nse and cc diff ffnn lstm model is superior to the four statistical models and all the other five machine learning models with a rmse of 9 31 m3 s a mae of 3 63 m3 s a mre of 0 076 a nse of 0 99 a cc of 0 995 and a qr of 94 the comparison among these ten models can also be seen in fig 7 the fitted lines for the diff lstm diff ffnn and diff ffnn lstm models are very close to the 1 1 line by contrast the predictions by the lstm ffnn and ffnn lstm models show less agreement with observations which indicates the validity of difference method we divide the streamflow into three categories based on its value low 0 m3 s 50 m3 s medium 50 m3 s 400 m3 s and high 400 m3 s and evaluate the performance of the diff ffnn lstm model in predicting the streamflow at different categories as shown in table 5 the proposed hybrid model can accurately predict streamflow across different levels although the performance in predicting low streamflow show a certain degree of deterioration from the training set to the testing set as shown in fig 8 five flood events were selected to evaluate the diff ffnn lstm model s ability to capture the temporal evolution of streamflow these five events cover different times of peak flow and different durations the shortest flood lasted for 3 days and the most prolonged flood lasted for 18 days as shown in fig 8 the hybrid model can reasonably reproduce flood fluctuations over time for different flood types reflecting its stability and robustness the shap values for each of the diff ffnn lstm model inputs are shown in fig 9 the inputs are in descending order from top to bottom on the y axis according to their contribution to the model s prediction and the corresponding shap value is on the x axis a positive negative shap value means that the contribution of the input to the model prediction is positive negative and the larger the absolute value of shap is the higher the contribution is if the contributions of multiple samples are similar the points are piled in a vertical arrangement to be visually distinguished from one another the color of a point represents the value of inputs in the samples with green representing the maximum value and blue representing the minimum value it is concluded from fig 9 that on the whole the contribution of streamflow inputs is more significant than that of precipitation inputs and dt 1 has the greatest positive influence on the predicted results among other elements in time series some inputs e g dt 2 dt 3 dt 6 pt 6 and pt 10 have negative contributions to the model which means that a larger value of these inputs leads to a smaller predicted streamflow value moreover inputs closer to the prediction time do not always mean a greater impact on the model prediction for example the contribution of dt 4 is smaller than that of dt 5 and dt 6 another example is that the contribution of pt 4 is the largest among all the precipitation time series 5 conclusions a hybrid model the diff ffnn lstm model is proposed in this study to improve streamflow prediction based on the non stationary hourly data the model combines three methods namely the difference method the ffnn algorithm and the lstm algorithm the hybrid diff ffnn lstm model is compared with four different statistical models and different combinations of its component models in addition the shap value is used to further analyze the diff ffnn lstm model to understand the influence of various inputs on the model predictions the prediction results show that the machine learning methods perform better than the statistical methods the prediction of the model combining ffnn and lstm is better than that of the ffnn algorithm or the lstm algorithm alone the difference method in the diff ffnn lstm model can effectively stabilize the non stationary streamflow sequence and it is more convenient and straightforward than the decomposition method more importantly the difference method can avoid the backward induction problem and boundary effects exiting in the decomposition method in general the diff ffnn lstm model proposed in this paper can effectively improve the non stationary data based predictions the analysis using the shap value shows that on the whole previous streamflow has a greater impact on the prediction than previous precipitation and inputs closer to the prediction time may not mean greater impact on the prediction previous streamflow and precipitation with certain lag times may have negative contributions to the model which is different from our understanding based on the physical process based models in this study we only carried out a streamflow prediction with a leading time of 1 h predictions with a longer lead time would be more useful for decision makers and will be tackled in our future research using the hybrid model developed in this study in addition we will test the model transferability in basins with different hydrometeorological conditions to establish the robustness of the algorithm funding this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no
