25180,a highly advocated approach to enhance pest control by indigenous predators is to add or maintain appropriate non crop plant habitats in agrosystems although the addition of non crop plant habitats can enhance the number of predators in crop by increasing their food resources or shelter the effect is often insufficient to reduce pest abundance or damage a number of explanations were identified in previous studies the ability of such habitats to enhance predators in particular is affected by the spatial organisation of the habitats at the landscape level here we explore how intra plot spatial patterns of non crop habitats affect the per capita predator effect on pest control we use a spatially explicit and individual based model to simulate the foraging movements of an earwig like predator in a banana field predator movements within a day were based on a simple non specific behavioural assumption movement is a correlated random walk affected by habitats and edges population dynamic processes occurring at larger time or spatial scales such as reproduction and immigration were not considered in this model non crop habitats added to plots were considered favourable to predators movements were slower and more sinuous in non crop habitat than in unfavourable habitats the intra plot spatial patterns of the non crop habitat were built and characterised using landscape ecology concepts and metrics we found that the per capita predator effect was strongly affected by a spatial dilution of predators induced by non crop habitat addition but this negative effect could be partially or fully mitigated by the spatial organisation of the non crop habitat at the banana plant level a long edge length between the crop and non crop habitat can compensate for this dilution effect by reducing the duration of the periods between predator visits to the banana plant at the plot level the best plots i e those in which all banana plants were often visited by predators were those with non crop strips in the banana plant rows overall the results support the idea that the spatial organisation of non crop habitats at the plot level characterised by the metric edge length in particular can be managed to minimise the negative impact of the dilution effect abbreviations cbc conservation biological control keywords euborellia caraibea generalist

attention in the last 40 years altieri and letourneau 1982 jonsson et al 2008 begg et al 2017 this strategy is known as conservation biological control cbc eilenberg et al 2001 a highly advocated cbc approach is to add or maintain appropriate non crop plant habitats in agrosystems to provide alternative shelter or food for predators landis et al 2000 the aim is to support long term increases in the abundance of predators resulting from an increase in habitat resources that support predator population growth holt 1977 or an increase in habitat attractiveness that supports an increase in predator immigration schellhorn et al 2014 although adding non crop habitats can help maintain or enhance predators locally it often fails to reduce pest abundance or damage letourneau et al 2011 begg et al 2017 former studies indicate that the effects of non crop habitats may greatly depend on their spatial organisation at the crop farm or landscape level landis et al 2000 tscharntke et al 2016 tscharntke et al 2016 in particular stressed that non crop habitats at the landscape level must be large and close enough to crops to enhance pest control in the context of changing agricultural practices towards agroecology the addition of non crop habitats in agricultural plots has recently seen a renewed interest fao 2017 the presence of other trophic resources within the plot may however divert predators from the crops and pests corbett and plant 1993 rand et al 2006 holland et al 2009 this approach may then reduce the per capita predator effect on pests and in turn decrease the cbc at the landscape scale the potential effect of other trophic resources on a species was termed the landscape moderated dilution hypothesis by tscharntke et al 2012 at the plot scale we will refer to it as the dilution effect the per capita predator effect should furthermore be affected by the spatial organisation of the non crop habitats several field studies indeed have shown that increasing the distance from the non crop habitat to the crop decreased the ground dwelling predator efficiency to control pests collins et al 2002 thomson and hoffmann 2013 penn 2018 therefore our working hypothesis is that intra plot spatial patterns of non crop habitats could influence the per capita predator effect and thereby limit the dilution effect on foraging behaviour anticipating the effects of the spatial organisation and quantity of non crop habitats on cbc or the spatial scale at which their variations will matter is not straightforward for instance predator abundance and diversity could be affected by non crop habitat at different landscape levels tscharntke et al 2007 martin et al 2016 depending on predator dispersal ability jackson and fahrig 2012 henri et al 2015 or predator diet specialist or generalist symondson et al 2002 chaplin kramer et al 2011 the effects of spatial patterns on biological processes have long been studied by landscape ecologists hence spatial concepts such as proximity edge length connectivity and aggregation and associated metrics were developed mainly at the landscape level which commonly refers to areas ranging from hectares to many square kilometres turner 1989 and to long term population dynamics kruess and tscharntke 1994 tscharntke et al 2007 bianchi et al 2010 in the field of biological control these concepts and metrics have facilitated the use of spatially explicit models to investigate how prey and predator temporal dynamics are linked to the prey resource bianchi et al 2009a 2010 or to habitat distribution bianchi and van der werf 2003 bianchi et al 2010 for instance showed that the nearest neighbour distance between pest and predator patches explained pest abundance during the early colonisation of aphid patches by ladybird beetles these same spatial concepts however have not been directly used at the plot level areas of a few hundred square metres as can be found in intermediately intensive agricultural landscapes for considering routine movements within a day such as the foraging movements of arthropod predators we argue that the use of spatial concepts at the plot level could be useful given the current social enthusiasm for habitat diversification in agriculture because plot level foraging behaviour directly influences the per capita predator effect and because foraging behaviours are influenced by the spatial distribution of resources to our knowledge only two models have been built at the plot level to explore the effects of the spatial pattern of habitats on predator movements corbett and plant 1993 westerberg et al 2005 only one of them corbett and plant 1993 specifically investigated how non crop spatial organisation altered the dilution effect relative to cbc but that study considered only simple non crop strips at a daily scale to build on this earlier work we assume that the use of landscape ecology concepts such as proximity edge length or aggregation at the plot level could improve our understanding of how spatial organisation of non crop habitats may alter the per capita predator effect the assessment of the per capita predator effect is not simple and depends on the relation between the predator and the pest under consideration both the residence time of predators on crops arrignon et al 2007 wajnberg et al 2016 and the timing of the predator s presence mailleret and grognard 2006 bianchi et al 2009b pei et al 2018 are important for pest control longer residence time on pest patches allows predators to consume more pests and thus should improve the predator efficiency to reduce the level of pest infestation on a crop the timing of predator presence on the other hand is more critical for preventing pest establishment and the timing especially matters for pests that have a rapid population growth rate such as aphids snyder and ives 2003 or for pests that have a stage that is especially sensitive to predation such as the egg of the banana weevil cosmopolites sordidus germar a serious pest of banana plants gold et al 2001 in the present study we used a spatially explicit model named foragescape to investigate how intra plot spatial patterns of non crop habitats alter the per capita predator effect and thus the potential for cbc we built and characterised the intra plot spatial patterns by using spatial metrics at the landscape scale we focus on generalist predators whose behaviours are modified by the availability of alternative prey symondson et al 2002 and on ground dwelling arthropod predators because the foraging movements of such predators are affected by non crop habitat localisation at the plot level because foragescape is an individual based model we could use it to simulate individual adaptive decisions within heterogeneous environments and to understand which aspects of individual behaviour lead to particular results grimm et al 2005 we used metrics of cultivated plant visits by predators duration frequency of visits and duration of absence of predators as proxies for the per capita predator effect on pest control here absence duration was used to evaluate predator efficiency in preventing pest establishment and the duration and frequency of cultivated plant visits were used to evaluate predator efficiency in reducing established pests we considered the timing of predator visits because generalist predators are usually assumed to be more efficient at preventing pest establishment since they are present before the arrival of the pest landis et al 2000 symondson et al 2002 snyder and ives 2003 the present study is a theoretical contribution however we focused on an existing case of pest control to specify the quantitative boundaries of the model and to ensure that our conclusions were not too disconnected from a real situation in terms of cbc we focused on banana fields where plant cover is already used for weed control lavigne et al 2012 fine grained spatial heterogeneity is particularly relevant for orchard crops in which growers can manage areas of bare soil plant cover or other habitats under crops lys et al 1994 in addition evidence exists that plant cover in banana fields may alter the food web duyck et al 2011 and increase rates of egg predation of the banana weevil mollot et al 2012 the eggs are laid on the corm of the banana plant and last 4 to 7 days before larva dig into and hide in the corm gold et al 2001 therefore an absence duration shorter than this period could help prevent pest establishment among the several potential predators of c sordidus the earwigs euborellia caraibea hebard and euborellia stali dohrn anisolabidae are generalist predators and good candidates for cbc of c sordidus mollot et al 2014 carval et al 2016 we used the model to answer the following questions i how are the duration frequency and absence duration of banana plant visits by predators affected by the edge length between the plant and the non crop habitats or by its proximity to such habitats ii are the duration frequency and absence duration of banana plant visits by predators affected by the quantity and the organisation of non crop habitats at the plot level and iii can the spatial organisation of non crop habitats at the plot level enhance the per capita predator effect and compensate for dilution effects 2 materials and methods to explore how the spatial pattern of added favourable habitats affects the cultivated plant visits by predators and thereby affects the potential of pest control we simulated the foraging movements of an earwig like predator in diversified banana fields the individual based foragescape model was implemented in netlogo wilensky 1999 and its description is detailed using the odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 in the supplementary materials a 2 1 plots simulation the experimental plots were generated in netlogo and consisted of plots of 19 2 x 19 2 m treated as a torus and modelled as squared grids of 48 48 cells with a grain of 0 4 x 0 4 m fig 1 we kept the grain small to account for differences in habitat configuration in close vicinity to the banana plants all plots comprised 8 rows of 8 banana plants six cells apart from each other and were characterised by a percentage of alternative favourable habitats pa and three structural metrics shaping the configuration of the alternative favourable habitats each cell of the plot is defined by a habitat type the crop habitat i e banana plants the alternative habitats that are favourable for predators i e non crop habitats with alternative trophic resources or shelters and the habitats that are unfavourable for predators i e bare soil both the crop and alternative favourable habitats are considered favourable and have equal effects on the predators the three structural metrics at the plot level were chosen from among a diversity of spatial metrics that have subtle differences and are often highly correlated wang et al 2014 these metrics account for plot variation in the edge length proximity and aggregation of favourable habitats supplementary material a 6 1 2 table 1 fig 1 the crop edge length the standard deviation of distances of banana plants to the nearest favourable habitat and the clumpiness which is an aggregation metric known to be weakly correlated to the percentage of habitats wang et al 2014 the first two structural metrics at the plot level were calculated from two spatial metrics defined for each banana plant the edge length el which is the number of alternative favourable neighbours around the banana plant and the distance to the nearest favourable habitat dn table 1 the processes of generating and selecting plots with different spatial organisation of alternative favourable habitats are detailed in supplementary materials a 6 1 we generated 10 890 different random plots with netlogo by systematically varying the percentage of alternative favourable habitats 25 50 and 75 the type of shapes clump 4 strips or 8 strips the size radius or width and the number of shapes the type of shapes clump one strip per row of banana plants 8 strips and one strip every two rows 4 strips were chosen to mimic vegetation patterns observed in banana fields or in other orchards and to produce contrasting values for structural metrics at the plot level we then selected 1704 plots for simulations by sampling across the entire range of the three structural metrics ten plots with pa 0 and 10 plots with pa 100 were also included to study limit cases resulting in a total of 1724 plots 2 2 model processes the processes of the simulation model are described in the flowchart fig 2 and are detailed with the odd protocol provided in the supplementary materials a for each selected plot all predators were randomly distributed and we ran the model for 360 min 1 day to avoid the influence of initial locations we then ran the model for 10 800 minute time steps representing 30 daily activity periods of e caraibea table 2 at each time step all predators were moving forage and the absence or presence of predators was recorded on all banana plants in banana plant numeric lists banana plant observation based on the literature on habitat selection and movement ecology the predator movements are a correlated random walk that is affected by habitats and edges bell 1991 zollner and lima 1999 barraquand and benhamou 2008 the step lengths of the predators during movements follow a truncated normal distribution characterised by means standard deviations and minimum and maximum values table 2 turning angles follow a cauchy distribution characterised by concentration parameters martin and fahrig 2015 table 2 in a favourable habitat we assumed that predators can rest or search for resources while remaining protected from higher trophic level predators as a result their movements are slower and more sinuous than in an unfavourable habitat consequently in the model movement step lengths are shorter mean and standard deviation and the concentration parameter of turning angles is smaller in a favourable habitat than an unfavourable habitat table 2 apart from movement changes we also assume that the probability that predators cross an edge to enter an unfavourable habitat is lower than 1 table 2 indeed leaving a profitable place and searching for a potentially better place with a chance of being exposed to predation referred to as habitat selection is a key decision faced by any forager morris 1987 we assumed that all movement characteristics are similar for each individual and constant over time because we focus on daily foraging movements we have neglected mechanisms associated with population dynamics mortality and reproduction and with landscape scale movements immigration and emigration because we expect the numerical response of a generalist predator to be either slow or independent of pest numbers the change in pest number should not greatly influence predator abundance for the time considered landis et al 2000 2 3 model parameters the values used in our case study for each model parameter are given in table 2 and were based on the published literature and on our personal observations in particular movement parameters were set using published data from field and laboratory experiments on the european earwig forficula auricularia l and personal observations on e caraibea data for the latter species were used to establish the order of magnitude for movements table 2 predator maximal running speed was used to set the limit for step length in unfavourable habitats and the order of magnitude for other step length parameters step length in favourable habitats was difficult to find in the literature and to estimate from predator maximal running speed because step length can be reduced by multiple behaviours such as resting searching feeding etc in addition most studies on ground dwelling arthropods consider daily movement lamb 1975 corbett and plant 1993 charrier et al 1997 vinatier et al 2011 and those that considered finer time scales used remote sensing techniques that may have stressed the insects wallin and ekbom 1988 we hypothesise that speed measured as the net displacement per minute in a favourable habitat will be substantially less than the maximal running speed but also greater than the average daily speed in favourable habitats which was determined by a mark and recapture experiment with f auricularia see table 2 we set the movement in favourable habitats as 30 times lower than in the unfavourable habitats standard deviations of step lengths were set lower but near the mean values to account for potential noise in the movements 2 4 model outputs summary statistics of the banana plant visits by predators were computed via r r core team 2018 while accounting for visit duration visit frequency and mean absence duration in between visits absence duration and their means at the plot level see detailed definition of parameters in table 3 means at the plot level will be referred to as crop visit duration crop visit frequency and crop absence duration respectively because arthropod predators should have the necessary chemical information to detect herbivores when they reach a host plant vet and dicke 1992 we assumed that a single predator is capable of finding and catching pests when it visits the crop and that the effect of several predators present simultaneously on the crop are negligible therefore we define a visit as a continuous period of time when at least one predator is in a banana plant cell 2 5 model analysis model analysis was carried out on model outputs for each of the 1724 plots we analysed the model outputs independently at the banana plant level and at the plot level because the banana plant level is relevant to examine how predators visit banana plants and because properties might emerge at a higher level in individual based models grimm and railsback 2005 we assessed relations between the banana plant visit metrics at the banana plant level and the spatial metrics at two levels the banana plant level el dn and the plot level pa crop edge length clumpiness standard deviation of dn we checked pairwise interaction effects between plot level and banana plant level metrics we further assessed relations between the banana plant visit metrics at the plot level and the spatial organisation variables at the plot level the spatial metrics at the plot level and the presence and number of strips random 4 or 8 strips when needed to evaluate the strength of an effect the percentage of variation explained by an effect was quantified with a linear model see supplementary material c hence we quantified the interaction effect of pa and el on the visit frequency by analysing the variation in visit frequency with a linear model that included pa el and their interaction as independent variables r core team 2018 furthermore at the plot level we quantified the effect of proportion of time in crop habitat table 3 on the crop visit duration with a linear model including crop visit duration as the dependent variable and proportion of time on the crop habitat as the independent variable 2 6 qualitative analysis of parameter value choices to explore how parameter values affected the response of the banana plant visits to spatial organisation the model was run for all the 1724 plots and the following set of parameters were explored one at a time predator number 135 350 and 1400 global speed shorter step lengths on both favourable and unfavourable habitats divided by 2 4 and 10 speed difference higher and lower ratio of step lengths in favourable versus unfavourable habitats 15 and 60 times lower the outputs of those simulations are presented in the supplementary materials d we found that parameter values affected some values of the banana visit metrics visit duration was increased by a higher number of predators but little changed with global speed up to step lengths divided by 4 and speed differences visit frequency was increased and absence duration was decreased by a higher number of predators higher global speed and lower speed differences however overall we found that patterns of results were qualitatively similar for most parameter values and started to diverge only when the global speed was reduced 10 times 3 results 3 1 banana plant level banana plant visits by predators were affected by both the spatial organisation in their close environment and the percentage of alternative favourable habitats at the plot level pa fig 3 however the effects of the spatial organisation and pa differed for visit duration visit frequency and absence duration visit duration ranged from 9 4 to 100 and was reduced by an increase in pa regardless of the values of local spatial metrics edge length el and distance to the nearest favourable habitat dn fig 3a b in contrast visit frequency was more strongly affected by those spatial metrics than by pa visit frequency remained low and almost constant visit frequency 27 7 when the banana plants were isolated dn 2 fig 3c and increased with the number of favourable neighbours when the banana plants were not isolated el 1 fig 3d we also observed a small reduction of visit frequency with pa when el increased but this explained only a small percentage of the variation in the visit frequency 2 35 of the total variation pa el effect 0 42 0 03 visits supplementary material c as a result absence duration ranged from 4 8 min to 864 min and was affected by both pa and local spatial metrics fig 3e f when banana plants were isolated from alternative favourable habitats dn 2 el 0 the visit frequency was constant as a result as pa increased the absence duration increased concomitantly with the decrease in visit duration such that the absence duration was able to more than double fig 3e when banana plants were in contact with some alternative favourable habitats dn 1 el 1 the visit duration was not affected by el and therefore as el increased the absence duration decreased concomitantly with the increase in visit frequency fig 3f this decrease was exponential and could result in a 20 fold difference in absence duration between an isolated banana plant in a plot with a pa of 75 360 100 min and a banana plant surrounded by eight favourable neighbours 19 5 min the direct contact with the alternative favourable habitat dn 1 led to a maximum visit frequency of 292 102 visits and to a minimum absence duration of 38 8 min fig 3c e aside from pa we found no links between predator presence at the banana plant level and spatial organisation at the plot scale described by the spatial metrics clumpiness crop edge length or standard deviation of dn even when we investigated outputs for banana plants with the same local spatial organisations and in plots of similar pa see fig 4 and supplementary material e for example the effects of el dn and pa on visit outputs were not altered by the clumpiness fig 4 supplementary tests showed that the number of predators per se and the speed difference did not affect the relation between visit duration and structural metrics supplementary material d 1 however visit duration began to be negatively affected by edge length el and positively affected by distance dn when predator speeds on both favourable and unfavourable habitats were ten times lower supplementary material d 2 3 2 plot level 3 2 1 proportion of time spent by predators in each habitat and crop visit duration within each plot that offered some alternative favourable habitat pa 25 there was a moderate overlapping in predator visits and thus the time spent by predators on banana plants accounted for almost all of the variation in crop visit duration r2 99 10 the predator movement rate was high relative to plot dimensions and the proportion of time spent in unfavourable habitats was small 0 077 fig 5 or much smaller when alternative favourable habitat was present 0 007 fig 5 the remainder of the predator time was then divided between alternative favourable habitats or banana plants depending mainly on the relative percentages of these habitats as a result time spent by predators on banana plants and crop visit duration were both negatively affected by the percentage of alternative favourable habitats pa figs 5 and 6 a we also found a slight increase in crop visit duration with increasing crop edge length for a given pa fig 6a this slope was the steepest for a pa of 25 this means that time spent on banana plants was also slightly increased by the crop edge length 3 2 2 crop visit frequency as was the case for a single banana plant a high crop edge length was associated with a high crop visit frequency within a plot this relation was to some extent weaker for plots with a high pa fig 6b 3 2 3 crop absence duration clumpiness and crop edge length affected the crop absence duration differently depending on the percentage of alternative favourable habitats pa and on the absence or the presence of strips in the plot fig 7 clumpiness had a clear effect in all plots with no strips and intermediate pa 25 50 or 75 and in those plots with four strips and high pa 50 75 fig 7a in those cases given the same pa very disaggregated plots i e plots with low clumpiness had the shortest crop absence duration in contrast crop edge length had a strong effect in plots with 4 with pa 25 and 8 strips fig 7b for those plots and for a given pa the strips surrounding the plants allowed an important change in the crop absence duration plots with strips close to banana rows had a long crop edge length and thus had a short crop absence duration among plots with an intermediate percentage of alternative favourable habitats pa 25 75 those with eight strips in the banana plant rows had the shortest crop absence duration and even a shorter crop absence duration than plots with 100 alternative favourable habitats plots with strips that were not in the banana plant rows in contrast had the longest crop absence duration 4 discussion starting from a simple spatially explicit model for a foraging earwig like predator in banana fields we have shown that predator movements and visits to the cultivated plant can be affected by the quantity and the spatial organisation of alternative favourable habitats on a relatively fine scale by not accounting for broad scale variations in the local abundance of predators resulting from immigration reproduction or mortality this model allowed us to understand the reductions in per capita predator effect caused by the dilution effect and indicates strategies to compensate for it the model omits some complex behaviours or interactions such as density dependent predator movement or the ability of the predator to assess habitat quality from a distance which could influence foraging these omissions may thereby reduce the model s predictive power nevertheless the model is a first step and can be modified in the future by the addition of complexity according to the species and system under consideration our model does not represent the pest or pest damage and this approach differs from many modelling studies that represent predator and target pest dynamics bianchi and van der werf 2003 bianchi et al 2010 vinatier et al 2012 railsback and johnson 2014 the inclusion of the pest and pest damage however usually requires assumptions regarding pest dynamics and interactions with predators which can make the results less generalisable or can lead to error propagation if the assumptions are inaccurate in the current study the potential effect of the predators on the pests was assessed through their visits to the crop pest establishment could be prevented by a short absence duration and the abundance of an established pest could be reduced by a long visit duration or a high visit frequency these metrics represent well the per capita predator effect on cbc if the presence of one predator on the cultivated plant is sufficient to rapidly wipe out pests for cases in which this assumption is not reasonable examination of the impact of non crop habitat addition and the spatial organisation of these non crops on the number of predators present and the duration of each single visit on the cultivated plant is recommended with the model parameterised for an e caraibea like predator we found that the duration of banana plant visits ranged from 9 4 to 100 of the simulation period and that absence duration ranged from 4 8 min to 864 min 2 4 days with 6 h of activity per day however our model requires validation before the output can be related quantitatively to pest characteristics such as for example the duration of the egg stage of banana weevils 4 7 days gold et al 2001 and before the model can be used to predict predator effects on the pest the results below were then interpreted qualitatively 4 1 dilution effect at the plot level the dilution effect on predation was observed when the amount of alternative favourable habitat increased at the plot level and not when it increased in the vicinity of the banana plant the predator diversion from the crop induced a relatively high decrease in the duration of banana plant visits only at the plot level fig 3a b and only a small decrease in the frequency of visits the number of favourable neighbours around banana plants which could have also diluted the predator effect on a specific banana plant did not affect the visit duration and even positively affected the visit frequency fig 3d therefore as expected any increase in alternative favourable habitats if not followed by a local increase in the predator abundance immediately reduces the cbc by decreasing the duration of the banana plant visits this indicates that researchers should consider diversified plots for a sufficiently long period to assess an effect on cbc this indication is consistent with several studies in temperate areas that have shown that predator abundance requires several seasons to increase in response to non crop habitat addition lys et al 1994 bostanian et al 2004 if the pest infestation is widespread therefore predator inundation strategies see definition in eilenberg et al 2001 should be more effective in the short term than a strategy based on cbc furthermore any non crop habitat addition at the plot level should take into account the habitat s ability to increase predator abundance quickly enough relative to the expected increase in pest abundance more generally our results on the per capita predator effect help us to understand how the dilution effect is impacting cbc in the long term studies of population dynamics may show that non crop habitat addition increases predator abundance in the long term the present study shows that each of those predators account for fewer benefits in terms of cbc the dependence of the duration of banana plant visits on the quantity of alternative favourable habitats at the plot level was explained because unlike the landscape level where matrix habitats can be very large and risky for species to cross fahrig 2002 bonte et al 2012 haddad et al 2015 in the plot in our model the relatively high rate of movement allowed the predator to minimise the time spent in unfavourable habitats if alternative favourable habitats were present fig 5 in our model each favourable habitat cell equally changed the movements of the predator through space and time and each banana plant cell in the plot was visited for an equivalent time driven by the percentage of favourable habitats in the plot fig 3a b consequently the dilution effect was well explained by the area occupied by the crop in comparison to all favourable habitats beyond predator abundance assessing the relative percentage of the space occupied by the crop and favourable non crop could thus be useful for understanding and predicting cbc the finding that the relative area occupied by the crop and favourable non crop could greatly affect the duration of banana plant visits by e caraibea could be extended to many species of ground dwelling generalist predators that can move rapidly including ants hurlbert et al 2008 carabids wallin and ekbom 1988 and spiders but see baker 2007 casas et al 2008 however these findings would be different for habitat specialist species which are reluctant to cross boundaries baker 2007 4 2 edge length at the banana plant level in contrast to the results suggested by larger scale studies lys et al 1994 collins et al 2002 and larger scale models bianchi et al 2010 segoli and rosenheim 2012 distance to the nearest favourable habitat was not relevant to cbc according to the output of our model fig 3c e we found that the edge length between favourable habitats and crop but not their distance could influence banana plant visits via the number of favourable neighbours at the banana plant level visits were more frequent fig 3d and absence durations were shorter fig 3f when the number of alternative favourable habitats around banana plants increased the changes induced by edge length were strong i e absence duration could be up to 20 times shorter for a surrounded banana plant than for an isolated banana plant these results are consistent with the drift fence hypothesis concerning connectivity at the landscape level this hypothesis assumes that corridors intercept dispersing individuals from the surrounding landscape and direct them towards patches connected by corridors haddad and baum 1999 although the process of patch colonisation differs from that of banana plant visits the direct contact between a banana plant and favourable habitats affected the frequency of banana plant visits in the same way that patch connections affect patch colonisation this effect is not surprising because the link is mathematical for an organism that is walking randomly the probability that an organism reaches an area is proportional to the angle subtended by this area in its horizon haddad and baum 1999 in the model the edge length for each individual banana plant failed to directly counteract the dilution effect on visit duration at the plot level predators spent more time overall on banana plants surrounded by favourable habitats this increase was greater as the percentage of alternative favourable habitats decreased fig 6a but the increase was not enough to compensate for the dilution effect an increasing effect of the spatial organisation of a habitat as its quantity decreases is a common result of broad scale models of population dynamics hill and caswell 1999 hiebeler 2000 flather and bevers 2002 overall our model predicts that a long edge length benefits cbc an increase in edge length could reduce the risk of pest establishment on the crop especially if there are many alternative favourable habitats in the plot a long edge length could also help to lower the level of a widespread infestation by limiting the dilution effect especially if there are few alternative favourable habitats in the plot a model accounting for predator population dynamics also found that an increase in edge length increased the abundance of ground dwelling arthropod predators when strips of an alternative favourable habitat were established before an annual crop was planted corbett and plant 1993 on the other hand the latter authors found that an increase in edge length reduced the predator abundance when the annual crop and strips were established simultaneously this last result emerged because the model of corbett and plant assumed faster movements in the crop than in the alternative favourable habitats in our perennial crop based model such assumptions were less relevant because crop area was low and the difference of quality between bare soil and other habitats should be much greater than between the alternative favourable habitat and the crop 4 3 which organisations of alternative favourable habitats are best for cbc at the plot level according to our model the best kind of plot i e the plot with high visit duration and with low absence duration was one with no alternative favourable habitats this result is to some extent an artefact resulting from the absence of mortality and emigration in the model in agrosystems we should expect that a plot without alternative favourable habitats would support increased predator emigration due to a lack of food quantity or diversity and would support increased predator mortality due to increased rates of predation on the predator in unfavourable habitats a plot without alternative favourable habitats could be good for cbc however if the predator can find sufficient food and refuge in crops as is the case for field overwintering species of carabids during spring and summer in annual crops cereal or pea holland et al 2009 plots with only favourable habitats despite a strong dilution effect had shorter crop absence duration than most plots with intermediate percentages of favourable habitats this findings means that increasing the fragmentation of favourable habitats tended to reduce the rate of predator movement as has been observed in fragmented landscapes for butterfly dispersal rate baguette et al 2003 and the activity density of carabid species rusch et al 2016 for each given intermediate percentage of favourable habitat the best spatial organisations of alternative favourable habitats were strips placed in each banana plant row fig 7b apart from the effect of crop edge length on the visit duration at the plot level the effect of organisation of alternative favourable habitats on crop visits was mainly due to the variation in edge length at the banana plant level the spatial organisation that should minimise absence duration and thus help prevent pest establishment is therefore the one that maximises the edge length of each banana plant by increasing edge length equally for each banana plant plots with strips in each banana plant row had the lowest crop absence durations for a given quantity of favourable habitats in such plots the crop absence duration was also lower than plots with only favourable habitats and this finding may result from a higher frequency of visits absence duration was longest in contrast when strips were not located in the banana plant row the use of strips has been experimentally investigated mainly in intercropping systems and such strips have resulted in a greater increase in predator abundance and pest control in annual crops letourneau et al 2011 than in perennial crops mcintyre et al 2001 but see dassou et al 2015 rusch et al 2016 we did not find studies explicitly comparing the effect of strips located on rows or between rows the variability in the predator absence and visit duration generated by the overlap or disconnection of strips with banana plant rows is intriguing and supports the idea that the effect of non crop habitats on cbc depends on the configuration of these habitats in the absence of strips the plot organisation that minimised crop absence duration was a disaggregation of favourable habitats fig 7a without strips the crop edge length barely changed in between plots of similar quantity of alternative favourable habitat fig 7 indicating that a difference in crop absence duration between plots without strips was caused by variations in edge length between banana plants within each plot as only having a few favourable habitats in direct contact with a banana plant reduces the absence duration dramatically i e short edge length fig 2f crop absence duration was reduced by minimising the number of isolated banana plants in a plot together our results for the effects of strips and aggregations suggest that non crop habitat addition may not result in cbc if the non crop habitat spatial organisation is not managed at the plot level the results therefore provide insight into the lack of cbc obtained with non crop habitat addition such as field margins marshall and moonen 2002 beetle banks frank 2010 and sown flower or weedy strips haaland et al 2011 according to our model beetle banks that provide alternative prey to generalist predators should be established before pest arrival or should be located close to the crop but see corbett and plant 1993 5 conclusions the findings of the present study demonstrate that researchers should not only consider population dynamics but also the per capita predator effect when assessing the effect of non crop habitat addition on cbc the balance between these two forces may be the biggest determiner of when additional non crop habitats are beneficial or detrimental to cbc we found that the per capita predator effect is strongly affected by the dilution effect induced by non crop habitat addition but that those negative effects could also be partially mitigated by the spatial organisation of the non crop habitat at the banana plant level a long edge length between the crop and non crop habitat can compensate for this dilution effect by reducing the absence duration of predators on the cultivated plant at the plot level the highest edge lengths were in plots with non crop strips in the banana plant rows and this spatial organisation resulted in a low crop absence duration those spatial organisations of non crop habitats resulting in low crop absence duration provide a first glimpse of how the judicious addition of non crop habitats at the plot level could minimise the diversion of predators away from the pests overall our results suggest that the spatial organisation of non crop habitats is a tool that can be used by farmer to improve cbc however side effects should be considered before farmers are advised to implement a given spatial organisation such as the ability of a specific predator to wipe out pests within a single visit or the potential for competition between crop and non crop plants as already investigated in banana fields poeydebat et al 2016 given the processes scales and periods considered in the model and the use of commonly accepted assumptions about foraging movement we think the results of the study can be considered fairly robust for a diversity of ground dwelling predators unless these predators behave very differently in response to habitat quality acknowledgements this work was supported by inra

25180,a highly advocated approach to enhance pest control by indigenous predators is to add or maintain appropriate non crop plant habitats in agrosystems although the addition of non crop plant habitats can enhance the number of predators in crop by increasing their food resources or shelter the effect is often insufficient to reduce pest abundance or damage a number of explanations were identified in previous studies the ability of such habitats to enhance predators in particular is affected by the spatial organisation of the habitats at the landscape level here we explore how intra plot spatial patterns of non crop habitats affect the per capita predator effect on pest control we use a spatially explicit and individual based model to simulate the foraging movements of an earwig like predator in a banana field predator movements within a day were based on a simple non specific behavioural assumption movement is a correlated random walk affected by habitats and edges population dynamic processes occurring at larger time or spatial scales such as reproduction and immigration were not considered in this model non crop habitats added to plots were considered favourable to predators movements were slower and more sinuous in non crop habitat than in unfavourable habitats the intra plot spatial patterns of the non crop habitat were built and characterised using landscape ecology concepts and metrics we found that the per capita predator effect was strongly affected by a spatial dilution of predators induced by non crop habitat addition but this negative effect could be partially or fully mitigated by the spatial organisation of the non crop habitat at the banana plant level a long edge length between the crop and non crop habitat can compensate for this dilution effect by reducing the duration of the periods between predator visits to the banana plant at the plot level the best plots i e those in which all banana plants were often visited by predators were those with non crop strips in the banana plant rows overall the results support the idea that the spatial organisation of non crop habitats at the plot level characterised by the metric edge length in particular can be managed to minimise the negative impact of the dilution effect abbreviations cbc conservation biological control keywords euborellia caraibea generalist predators spatially explicit modelling correlated random walk banana fields edge length 1 introduction the improvement of crop pest control by promoting indigenous predators has received substantial attention in the last 40 years altieri and letourneau 1982 jonsson et al 2008 begg et al 2017 this strategy is known as conservation biological control cbc eilenberg et al 2001 a highly advocated cbc approach is to add or maintain appropriate non crop plant habitats in agrosystems to provide alternative shelter or food for predators landis et al 2000 the aim is to support long term increases in the abundance of predators resulting from an increase in habitat resources that support predator population growth holt 1977 or an increase in habitat attractiveness that supports an increase in predator immigration schellhorn et al 2014 although adding non crop habitats can help maintain or enhance predators locally it often fails to reduce pest abundance or damage letourneau et al 2011 begg et al 2017 former studies indicate that the effects of non crop habitats may greatly depend on their spatial organisation at the crop farm or landscape level landis et al 2000 tscharntke et al 2016 tscharntke et al 2016 in particular stressed that non crop habitats at the landscape level must be large and close enough to crops to enhance pest control in the context of changing agricultural practices towards agroecology the addition of non crop habitats in agricultural plots has recently seen a renewed interest fao 2017 the presence of other trophic resources within the plot may however divert predators from the crops and pests corbett and plant 1993 rand et al 2006 holland et al 2009 this approach may then reduce the per capita predator effect on pests and in turn decrease the cbc at the landscape scale the potential effect of other trophic resources on a species was termed the landscape moderated dilution hypothesis by tscharntke et al 2012 at the plot scale we will refer to it as the dilution effect the per capita predator effect should furthermore be affected by the spatial organisation of the non crop habitats several field studies indeed have shown that increasing the distance from the non crop habitat to the crop decreased the ground dwelling predator efficiency to control pests collins et al 2002 thomson and hoffmann 2013 penn 2018 therefore our working hypothesis is that intra plot spatial patterns of non crop habitats could influence the per capita predator effect and thereby limit the dilution effect on foraging behaviour anticipating the effects of the spatial organisation and quantity of non crop habitats on cbc or the spatial scale at which their variations will matter is not straightforward for instance predator abundance and diversity could be affected by non crop habitat at different landscape levels tscharntke et al 2007 martin et al 2016 depending on predator dispersal ability jackson and fahrig 2012 henri et al 2015 or predator diet specialist or generalist symondson et al 2002 chaplin kramer et al 2011 the effects of spatial patterns on biological processes have long been studied by landscape ecologists hence spatial concepts such as proximity edge length connectivity and aggregation and associated metrics were developed mainly at the landscape level which commonly refers to areas ranging from hectares to many square kilometres turner 1989 and to long term population dynamics kruess and tscharntke 1994 tscharntke et al 2007 bianchi et al 2010 in the field of biological control these concepts and metrics have facilitated the use of spatially explicit models to investigate how prey and predator temporal dynamics are linked to the prey resource bianchi et al 2009a 2010 or to habitat distribution bianchi and van der werf 2003 bianchi et al 2010 for instance showed that the nearest neighbour distance between pest and predator patches explained pest abundance during the early colonisation of aphid patches by ladybird beetles these same spatial concepts however have not been directly used at the plot level areas of a few hundred square metres as can be found in intermediately intensive agricultural landscapes for considering routine movements within a day such as the foraging movements of arthropod predators we argue that the use of spatial concepts at the plot level could be useful given the current social enthusiasm for habitat diversification in agriculture because plot level foraging behaviour directly influences the per capita predator effect and because foraging behaviours are influenced by the spatial distribution of resources to our knowledge only two models have been built at the plot level to explore the effects of the spatial pattern of habitats on predator movements corbett and plant 1993 westerberg et al 2005 only one of them corbett and plant 1993 specifically investigated how non crop spatial organisation altered the dilution effect relative to cbc but that study considered only simple non crop strips at a daily scale to build on this earlier work we assume that the use of landscape ecology concepts such as proximity edge length or aggregation at the plot level could improve our understanding of how spatial organisation of non crop habitats may alter the per capita predator effect the assessment of the per capita predator effect is not simple and depends on the relation between the predator and the pest under consideration both the residence time of predators on crops arrignon et al 2007 wajnberg et al 2016 and the timing of the predator s presence mailleret and grognard 2006 bianchi et al 2009b pei et al 2018 are important for pest control longer residence time on pest patches allows predators to consume more pests and thus should improve the predator efficiency to reduce the level of pest infestation on a crop the timing of predator presence on the other hand is more critical for preventing pest establishment and the timing especially matters for pests that have a rapid population growth rate such as aphids snyder and ives 2003 or for pests that have a stage that is especially sensitive to predation such as the egg of the banana weevil cosmopolites sordidus germar a serious pest of banana plants gold et al 2001 in the present study we used a spatially explicit model named foragescape to investigate how intra plot spatial patterns of non crop habitats alter the per capita predator effect and thus the potential for cbc we built and characterised the intra plot spatial patterns by using spatial metrics at the landscape scale we focus on generalist predators whose behaviours are modified by the availability of alternative prey symondson et al 2002 and on ground dwelling arthropod predators because the foraging movements of such predators are affected by non crop habitat localisation at the plot level because foragescape is an individual based model we could use it to simulate individual adaptive decisions within heterogeneous environments and to understand which aspects of individual behaviour lead to particular results grimm et al 2005 we used metrics of cultivated plant visits by predators duration frequency of visits and duration of absence of predators as proxies for the per capita predator effect on pest control here absence duration was used to evaluate predator efficiency in preventing pest establishment and the duration and frequency of cultivated plant visits were used to evaluate predator efficiency in reducing established pests we considered the timing of predator visits because generalist predators are usually assumed to be more efficient at preventing pest establishment since they are present before the arrival of the pest landis et al 2000 symondson et al 2002 snyder and ives 2003 the present study is a theoretical contribution however we focused on an existing case of pest control to specify the quantitative boundaries of the model and to ensure that our conclusions were not too disconnected from a real situation in terms of cbc we focused on banana fields where plant cover is already used for weed control lavigne et al 2012 fine grained spatial heterogeneity is particularly relevant for orchard crops in which growers can manage areas of bare soil plant cover or other habitats under crops lys et al 1994 in addition evidence exists that plant cover in banana fields may alter the food web duyck et al 2011 and increase rates of egg predation of the banana weevil mollot et al 2012 the eggs are laid on the corm of the banana plant and last 4 to 7 days before larva dig into and hide in the corm gold et al 2001 therefore an absence duration shorter than this period could help prevent pest establishment among the several potential predators of c sordidus the earwigs euborellia caraibea hebard and euborellia stali dohrn anisolabidae are generalist predators and good candidates for cbc of c sordidus mollot et al 2014 carval et al 2016 we used the model to answer the following questions i how are the duration frequency and absence duration of banana plant visits by predators affected by the edge length between the plant and the non crop habitats or by its proximity to such habitats ii are the duration frequency and absence duration of banana plant visits by predators affected by the quantity and the organisation of non crop habitats at the plot level and iii can the spatial organisation of non crop habitats at the plot level enhance the per capita predator effect and compensate for dilution effects 2 materials and methods to explore how the spatial pattern of added favourable habitats affects the cultivated plant visits by predators and thereby affects the potential of pest control we simulated the foraging movements of an earwig like predator in diversified banana fields the individual based foragescape model was implemented in netlogo wilensky 1999 and its description is detailed using the odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 in the supplementary materials a 2 1 plots simulation the experimental plots were generated in netlogo and consisted of plots of 19 2 x 19 2 m treated as a torus and modelled as squared grids of 48 48 cells with a grain of 0 4 x 0 4 m fig 1 we kept the grain small to account for differences in habitat configuration in close vicinity to the banana plants all plots comprised 8 rows of 8 banana plants six cells apart from each other and were characterised by a percentage of alternative favourable habitats pa and three structural metrics shaping the configuration of the alternative favourable habitats each cell of the plot is defined by a habitat type the crop habitat i e banana plants the alternative habitats that are favourable for predators i e non crop habitats with alternative trophic resources or shelters and the habitats that are unfavourable for predators i e bare soil both the crop and alternative favourable habitats are considered favourable and have equal effects on the predators the three structural metrics at the plot level were chosen from among a diversity of spatial metrics that have subtle differences and are often highly correlated wang et al 2014 these metrics account for plot variation in the edge length proximity and aggregation of favourable habitats supplementary material a 6 1 2 table 1 fig 1 the crop edge length the standard deviation of distances of banana plants to the nearest favourable habitat and the clumpiness which is an aggregation metric known to be weakly correlated to the percentage of habitats wang et al 2014 the first two structural metrics at the plot level were calculated from two spatial metrics defined for each banana plant the edge length el which is the number of alternative favourable neighbours around the banana plant and the distance to the nearest favourable habitat dn table 1 the processes of generating and selecting plots with different spatial organisation of alternative favourable habitats are detailed in supplementary materials a 6 1 we generated 10 890 different random plots with netlogo by systematically varying the percentage of alternative favourable habitats 25 50 and 75 the type of shapes clump 4 strips or 8 strips the size radius or width and the number of shapes the type of shapes clump one strip per row of banana plants 8 strips and one strip every two rows 4 strips were chosen to mimic vegetation patterns observed in banana fields or in other orchards and to produce contrasting values for structural metrics at the plot level we then selected 1704 plots for simulations by sampling across the entire range of the three structural metrics ten plots with pa 0 and 10 plots with pa 100 were also included to study limit cases resulting in a total of 1724 plots 2 2 model processes the processes of the simulation model are described in the flowchart fig 2 and are detailed with the odd protocol provided in the supplementary materials a for each selected plot all predators were randomly distributed and we ran the model for 360 min 1 day to avoid the influence of initial locations we then ran the model for 10 800 minute time steps representing 30 daily activity periods of e caraibea table 2 at each time step all predators were moving forage and the absence or presence of predators was recorded on all banana plants in banana plant numeric lists banana plant observation based on the literature on habitat selection and movement ecology the predator movements are a correlated random walk that is affected by habitats and edges bell 1991 zollner and lima 1999 barraquand and benhamou 2008 the step lengths of the predators during movements follow a truncated normal distribution characterised by means standard deviations and minimum and maximum values table 2 turning angles follow a cauchy distribution characterised by concentration parameters martin and fahrig 2015 table 2 in a favourable habitat we assumed that predators can rest or search for resources while remaining protected from higher trophic level predators as a result their movements are slower and more sinuous than in an unfavourable habitat consequently in the model movement step lengths are shorter mean and standard deviation and the concentration parameter of turning angles is smaller in a favourable habitat than an unfavourable habitat table 2 apart from movement changes we also assume that the probability that predators cross an edge to enter an unfavourable habitat is lower than 1 table 2 indeed leaving a profitable place and searching for a potentially better place with a chance of being exposed to predation referred to as habitat selection is a key decision faced by any forager morris 1987 we assumed that all movement characteristics are similar for each individual and constant over time because we focus on daily foraging movements we have neglected mechanisms associated with population dynamics mortality and reproduction and with landscape scale movements immigration and emigration because we expect the numerical response of a generalist predator to be either slow or independent of pest numbers the change in pest number should not greatly influence predator abundance for the time considered landis et al 2000 2 3 model parameters the values used in our case study for each model parameter are given in table 2 and were based on the published literature and on our personal observations in particular movement parameters were set using published data from field and laboratory experiments on the european earwig forficula auricularia l and personal observations on e caraibea data for the latter species were used to establish the order of magnitude for movements table 2 predator maximal running speed was used to set the limit for step length in unfavourable habitats and the order of magnitude for other step length parameters step length in favourable habitats was difficult to find in the literature and to estimate from predator maximal running speed because step length can be reduced by multiple behaviours such as resting searching feeding etc in addition most studies on ground dwelling arthropods consider daily movement lamb 1975 corbett and plant 1993 charrier et al 1997 vinatier et al 2011 and those that considered finer time scales used remote sensing techniques that may have stressed the insects wallin and ekbom 1988 we hypothesise that speed measured as the net displacement per minute in a favourable habitat will be substantially less than the maximal running speed but also greater than the average daily speed in favourable habitats which was determined by a mark and recapture experiment with f auricularia see table 2 we set the movement in favourable habitats as 30 times lower than in the unfavourable habitats standard deviations of step lengths were set lower but near the mean values to account for potential noise in the movements 2 4 model outputs summary statistics of the banana plant visits by predators were computed via r r core team 2018 while accounting for visit duration visit frequency and mean absence duration in between visits absence duration and their means at the plot level see detailed definition of parameters in table 3 means at the plot level will be referred to as crop visit duration crop visit frequency and crop absence duration respectively because arthropod predators should have the necessary chemical information to detect herbivores when they reach a host plant vet and dicke 1992 we assumed that a single predator is capable of finding and catching pests when it visits the crop and that the effect of several predators present simultaneously on the crop are negligible therefore we define a visit as a continuous period of time when at least one predator is in a banana plant cell 2 5 model analysis model analysis was carried out on model outputs for each of the 1724 plots we analysed the model outputs independently at the banana plant level and at the plot level because the banana plant level is relevant to examine how predators visit banana plants and because properties might emerge at a higher level in individual based models grimm and railsback 2005 we assessed relations between the banana plant visit metrics at the banana plant level and the spatial metrics at two levels the banana plant level el dn and the plot level pa crop edge length clumpiness standard deviation of dn we checked pairwise interaction effects between plot level and banana plant level metrics we further assessed relations between the banana plant visit metrics at the plot level and the spatial organisation variables at the plot level the spatial metrics at the plot level and the presence and number of strips random 4 or 8 strips when needed to evaluate the strength of an effect the percentage of variation explained by an effect was quantified with a linear model see supplementary material c hence we quantified the interaction effect of pa and el on the visit frequency by analysing the variation in visit frequency with a linear model that included pa el and their interaction as independent variables r core team 2018 furthermore at the plot level we quantified the effect of proportion of time in crop habitat table 3 on the crop visit duration with a linear model including crop visit duration as the dependent variable and proportion of time on the crop habitat as the independent variable 2 6 qualitative analysis of parameter value choices to explore how parameter values affected the response of the banana plant visits to spatial organisation the model was run for all the 1724 plots and the following set of parameters were explored one at a time predator number 135 350 and 1400 global speed shorter step lengths on both favourable and unfavourable habitats divided by 2 4 and 10 speed difference higher and lower ratio of step lengths in favourable versus unfavourable habitats 15 and 60 times lower the outputs of those simulations are presented in the supplementary materials d we found that parameter values affected some values of the banana visit metrics visit duration was increased by a higher number of predators but little changed with global speed up to step lengths divided by 4 and speed differences visit frequency was increased and absence duration was decreased by a higher number of predators higher global speed and lower speed differences however overall we found that patterns of results were qualitatively similar for most parameter values and started to diverge only when the global speed was reduced 10 times 3 results 3 1 banana plant level banana plant visits by predators were affected by both the spatial organisation in their close environment and the percentage of alternative favourable habitats at the plot level pa fig 3 however the effects of the spatial organisation and pa differed for visit duration visit frequency and absence duration visit duration ranged from 9 4 to 100 and was reduced by an increase in pa regardless of the values of local spatial metrics edge length el and distance to the nearest favourable habitat dn fig 3a b in contrast visit frequency was more strongly affected by those spatial metrics than by pa visit frequency remained low and almost constant visit frequency 27 7 when the banana plants were isolated dn 2 fig 3c and increased with the number of favourable neighbours when the banana plants were not isolated el 1 fig 3d we also observed a small reduction of visit frequency with pa when el increased but this explained only a small percentage of the variation in the visit frequency 2 35 of the total variation pa el effect 0 42 0 03 visits supplementary material c as a result absence duration ranged from 4 8 min to 864 min and was affected by both pa and local spatial metrics fig 3e f when banana plants were isolated from alternative favourable habitats dn 2 el 0 the visit frequency was constant as a result as pa increased the absence duration increased concomitantly with the decrease in visit duration such that the absence duration was able to more than double fig 3e when banana plants were in contact with some alternative favourable habitats dn 1 el 1 the visit duration was not affected by el and therefore as el increased the absence duration decreased concomitantly with the increase in visit frequency fig 3f this decrease was exponential and could result in a 20 fold difference in absence duration between an isolated banana plant in a plot with a pa of 75 360 100 min and a banana plant surrounded by eight favourable neighbours 19 5 min the direct contact with the alternative favourable habitat dn 1 led to a maximum visit frequency of 292 102 visits and to a minimum absence duration of 38 8 min fig 3c e aside from pa we found no links between predator presence at the banana plant level and spatial organisation at the plot scale described by the spatial metrics clumpiness crop edge length or standard deviation of dn even when we investigated outputs for banana plants with the same local spatial organisations and in plots of similar pa see fig 4 and supplementary material e for example the effects of el dn and pa on visit outputs were not altered by the clumpiness fig 4 supplementary tests showed that the number of predators per se and the speed difference did not affect the relation between visit duration and structural metrics supplementary material d 1 however visit duration began to be negatively affected by edge length el and positively affected by distance dn when predator speeds on both favourable and unfavourable habitats were ten times lower supplementary material d 2 3 2 plot level 3 2 1 proportion of time spent by predators in each habitat and crop visit duration within each plot that offered some alternative favourable habitat pa 25 there was a moderate overlapping in predator visits and thus the time spent by predators on banana plants accounted for almost all of the variation in crop visit duration r2 99 10 the predator movement rate was high relative to plot dimensions and the proportion of time spent in unfavourable habitats was small 0 077 fig 5 or much smaller when alternative favourable habitat was present 0 007 fig 5 the remainder of the predator time was then divided between alternative favourable habitats or banana plants depending mainly on the relative percentages of these habitats as a result time spent by predators on banana plants and crop visit duration were both negatively affected by the percentage of alternative favourable habitats pa figs 5 and 6 a we also found a slight increase in crop visit duration with increasing crop edge length for a given pa fig 6a this slope was the steepest for a pa of 25 this means that time spent on banana plants was also slightly increased by the crop edge length 3 2 2 crop visit frequency as was the case for a single banana plant a high crop edge length was associated with a high crop visit frequency within a plot this relation was to some extent weaker for plots with a high pa fig 6b 3 2 3 crop absence duration clumpiness and crop edge length affected the crop absence duration differently depending on the percentage of alternative favourable habitats pa and on the absence or the presence of strips in the plot fig 7 clumpiness had a clear effect in all plots with no strips and intermediate pa 25 50 or 75 and in those plots with four strips and high pa 50 75 fig 7a in those cases given the same pa very disaggregated plots i e plots with low clumpiness had the shortest crop absence duration in contrast crop edge length had a strong effect in plots with 4 with pa 25 and 8 strips fig 7b for those plots and for a given pa the strips surrounding the plants allowed an important change in the crop absence duration plots with strips close to banana rows had a long crop edge length and thus had a short crop absence duration among plots with an intermediate percentage of alternative favourable habitats pa 25 75 those with eight strips in the banana plant rows had the shortest crop absence duration and even a shorter crop absence duration than plots with 100 alternative favourable habitats plots with strips that were not in the banana plant rows in contrast had the longest crop absence duration 4 discussion starting from a simple spatially explicit model for a foraging earwig like predator in banana fields we have shown that predator movements and visits to the cultivated plant can be affected by the quantity and the spatial organisation of alternative favourable habitats on a relatively fine scale by not accounting for broad scale variations in the local abundance of predators resulting from immigration reproduction or mortality this model allowed us to understand the reductions in per capita predator effect caused by the dilution effect and indicates strategies to compensate for it the model omits some complex behaviours or interactions such as density dependent predator movement or the ability of the predator to assess habitat quality from a distance which could influence foraging these omissions may thereby reduce the model s predictive power nevertheless the model is a first step and can be modified in the future by the addition of complexity according to the species and system under consideration our model does not represent the pest or pest damage and this approach differs from many modelling studies that represent predator and target pest dynamics bianchi and van der werf 2003 bianchi et al 2010 vinatier et al 2012 railsback and johnson 2014 the inclusion of the pest and pest damage however usually requires assumptions regarding pest dynamics and interactions with predators which can make the results less generalisable or can lead to error propagation if the assumptions are inaccurate in the current study the potential effect of the predators on the pests was assessed through their visits to the crop pest establishment could be prevented by a short absence duration and the abundance of an established pest could be reduced by a long visit duration or a high visit frequency these metrics represent well the per capita predator effect on cbc if the presence of one predator on the cultivated plant is sufficient to rapidly wipe out pests for cases in which this assumption is not reasonable examination of the impact of non crop habitat addition and the spatial organisation of these non crops on the number of predators present and the duration of each single visit on the cultivated plant is recommended with the model parameterised for an e caraibea like predator we found that the duration of banana plant visits ranged from 9 4 to 100 of the simulation period and that absence duration ranged from 4 8 min to 864 min 2 4 days with 6 h of activity per day however our model requires validation before the output can be related quantitatively to pest characteristics such as for example the duration of the egg stage of banana weevils 4 7 days gold et al 2001 and before the model can be used to predict predator effects on the pest the results below were then interpreted qualitatively 4 1 dilution effect at the plot level the dilution effect on predation was observed when the amount of alternative favourable habitat increased at the plot level and not when it increased in the vicinity of the banana plant the predator diversion from the crop induced a relatively high decrease in the duration of banana plant visits only at the plot level fig 3a b and only a small decrease in the frequency of visits the number of favourable neighbours around banana plants which could have also diluted the predator effect on a specific banana plant did not affect the visit duration and even positively affected the visit frequency fig 3d therefore as expected any increase in alternative favourable habitats if not followed by a local increase in the predator abundance immediately reduces the cbc by decreasing the duration of the banana plant visits this indicates that researchers should consider diversified plots for a sufficiently long period to assess an effect on cbc this indication is consistent with several studies in temperate areas that have shown that predator abundance requires several seasons to increase in response to non crop habitat addition lys et al 1994 bostanian et al 2004 if the pest infestation is widespread therefore predator inundation strategies see definition in eilenberg et al 2001 should be more effective in the short term than a strategy based on cbc furthermore any non crop habitat addition at the plot level should take into account the habitat s ability to increase predator abundance quickly enough relative to the expected increase in pest abundance more generally our results on the per capita predator effect help us to understand how the dilution effect is impacting cbc in the long term studies of population dynamics may show that non crop habitat addition increases predator abundance in the long term the present study shows that each of those predators account for fewer benefits in terms of cbc the dependence of the duration of banana plant visits on the quantity of alternative favourable habitats at the plot level was explained because unlike the landscape level where matrix habitats can be very large and risky for species to cross fahrig 2002 bonte et al 2012 haddad et al 2015 in the plot in our model the relatively high rate of movement allowed the predator to minimise the time spent in unfavourable habitats if alternative favourable habitats were present fig 5 in our model each favourable habitat cell equally changed the movements of the predator through space and time and each banana plant cell in the plot was visited for an equivalent time driven by the percentage of favourable habitats in the plot fig 3a b consequently the dilution effect was well explained by the area occupied by the crop in comparison to all favourable habitats beyond predator abundance assessing the relative percentage of the space occupied by the crop and favourable non crop could thus be useful for understanding and predicting cbc the finding that the relative area occupied by the crop and favourable non crop could greatly affect the duration of banana plant visits by e caraibea could be extended to many species of ground dwelling generalist predators that can move rapidly including ants hurlbert et al 2008 carabids wallin and ekbom 1988 and spiders but see baker 2007 casas et al 2008 however these findings would be different for habitat specialist species which are reluctant to cross boundaries baker 2007 4 2 edge length at the banana plant level in contrast to the results suggested by larger scale studies lys et al 1994 collins et al 2002 and larger scale models bianchi et al 2010 segoli and rosenheim 2012 distance to the nearest favourable habitat was not relevant to cbc according to the output of our model fig 3c e we found that the edge length between favourable habitats and crop but not their distance could influence banana plant visits via the number of favourable neighbours at the banana plant level visits were more frequent fig 3d and absence durations were shorter fig 3f when the number of alternative favourable habitats around banana plants increased the changes induced by edge length were strong i e absence duration could be up to 20 times shorter for a surrounded banana plant than for an isolated banana plant these results are consistent with the drift fence hypothesis concerning connectivity at the landscape level this hypothesis assumes that corridors intercept dispersing individuals from the surrounding landscape and direct them towards patches connected by corridors haddad and baum 1999 although the process of patch colonisation differs from that of banana plant visits the direct contact between a banana plant and favourable habitats affected the frequency of banana plant visits in the same way that patch connections affect patch colonisation this effect is not surprising because the link is mathematical for an organism that is walking randomly the probability that an organism reaches an area is proportional to the angle subtended by this area in its horizon haddad and baum 1999 in the model the edge length for each individual banana plant failed to directly counteract the dilution effect on visit duration at the plot level predators spent more time overall on banana plants surrounded by favourable habitats this increase was greater as the percentage of alternative favourable habitats decreased fig 6a but the increase was not enough to compensate for the dilution effect an increasing effect of the spatial organisation of a habitat as its quantity decreases is a common result of broad scale models of population dynamics hill and caswell 1999 hiebeler 2000 flather and bevers 2002 overall our model predicts that a long edge length benefits cbc an increase in edge length could reduce the risk of pest establishment on the crop especially if there are many alternative favourable habitats in the plot a long edge length could also help to lower the level of a widespread infestation by limiting the dilution effect especially if there are few alternative favourable habitats in the plot a model accounting for predator population dynamics also found that an increase in edge length increased the abundance of ground dwelling arthropod predators when strips of an alternative favourable habitat were established before an annual crop was planted corbett and plant 1993 on the other hand the latter authors found that an increase in edge length reduced the predator abundance when the annual crop and strips were established simultaneously this last result emerged because the model of corbett and plant assumed faster movements in the crop than in the alternative favourable habitats in our perennial crop based model such assumptions were less relevant because crop area was low and the difference of quality between bare soil and other habitats should be much greater than between the alternative favourable habitat and the crop 4 3 which organisations of alternative favourable habitats are best for cbc at the plot level according to our model the best kind of plot i e the plot with high visit duration and with low absence duration was one with no alternative favourable habitats this result is to some extent an artefact resulting from the absence of mortality and emigration in the model in agrosystems we should expect that a plot without alternative favourable habitats would support increased predator emigration due to a lack of food quantity or diversity and would support increased predator mortality due to increased rates of predation on the predator in unfavourable habitats a plot without alternative favourable habitats could be good for cbc however if the predator can find sufficient food and refuge in crops as is the case for field overwintering species of carabids during spring and summer in annual crops cereal or pea holland et al 2009 plots with only favourable habitats despite a strong dilution effect had shorter crop absence duration than most plots with intermediate percentages of favourable habitats this findings means that increasing the fragmentation of favourable habitats tended to reduce the rate of predator movement as has been observed in fragmented landscapes for butterfly dispersal rate baguette et al 2003 and the activity density of carabid species rusch et al 2016 for each given intermediate percentage of favourable habitat the best spatial organisations of alternative favourable habitats were strips placed in each banana plant row fig 7b apart from the effect of crop edge length on the visit duration at the plot level the effect of organisation of alternative favourable habitats on crop visits was mainly due to the variation in edge length at the banana plant level the spatial organisation that should minimise absence duration and thus help prevent pest establishment is therefore the one that maximises the edge length of each banana plant by increasing edge length equally for each banana plant plots with strips in each banana plant row had the lowest crop absence durations for a given quantity of favourable habitats in such plots the crop absence duration was also lower than plots with only favourable habitats and this finding may result from a higher frequency of visits absence duration was longest in contrast when strips were not located in the banana plant row the use of strips has been experimentally investigated mainly in intercropping systems and such strips have resulted in a greater increase in predator abundance and pest control in annual crops letourneau et al 2011 than in perennial crops mcintyre et al 2001 but see dassou et al 2015 rusch et al 2016 we did not find studies explicitly comparing the effect of strips located on rows or between rows the variability in the predator absence and visit duration generated by the overlap or disconnection of strips with banana plant rows is intriguing and supports the idea that the effect of non crop habitats on cbc depends on the configuration of these habitats in the absence of strips the plot organisation that minimised crop absence duration was a disaggregation of favourable habitats fig 7a without strips the crop edge length barely changed in between plots of similar quantity of alternative favourable habitat fig 7 indicating that a difference in crop absence duration between plots without strips was caused by variations in edge length between banana plants within each plot as only having a few favourable habitats in direct contact with a banana plant reduces the absence duration dramatically i e short edge length fig 2f crop absence duration was reduced by minimising the number of isolated banana plants in a plot together our results for the effects of strips and aggregations suggest that non crop habitat addition may not result in cbc if the non crop habitat spatial organisation is not managed at the plot level the results therefore provide insight into the lack of cbc obtained with non crop habitat addition such as field margins marshall and moonen 2002 beetle banks frank 2010 and sown flower or weedy strips haaland et al 2011 according to our model beetle banks that provide alternative prey to generalist predators should be established before pest arrival or should be located close to the crop but see corbett and plant 1993 5 conclusions the findings of the present study demonstrate that researchers should not only consider population dynamics but also the per capita predator effect when assessing the effect of non crop habitat addition on cbc the balance between these two forces may be the biggest determiner of when additional non crop habitats are beneficial or detrimental to cbc we found that the per capita predator effect is strongly affected by the dilution effect induced by non crop habitat addition but that those negative effects could also be partially mitigated by the spatial organisation of the non crop habitat at the banana plant level a long edge length between the crop and non crop habitat can compensate for this dilution effect by reducing the absence duration of predators on the cultivated plant at the plot level the highest edge lengths were in plots with non crop strips in the banana plant rows and this spatial organisation resulted in a low crop absence duration those spatial organisations of non crop habitats resulting in low crop absence duration provide a first glimpse of how the judicious addition of non crop habitats at the plot level could minimise the diversion of predators away from the pests overall our results suggest that the spatial organisation of non crop habitats is a tool that can be used by farmer to improve cbc however side effects should be considered before farmers are advised to implement a given spatial organisation such as the ability of a specific predator to wipe out pests within a single visit or the potential for competition between crop and non crop plants as already investigated in banana fields poeydebat et al 2016 given the processes scales and periods considered in the model and the use of commonly accepted assumptions about foraging movement we think the results of the study can be considered fairly robust for a diversity of ground dwelling predators unless these predators behave very differently in response to habitat quality acknowledgements this work was supported by inra

distribution a lot of algorithms are available for modelling species distribution and more models are continuously being developed guisan and zimmermann 2000 fernández delgado et al 2014 against this background the choice of the most accurate method can be challenging modelling the distribution of an invasive species is a sensitive issue especially when it is a potential vector of human pathogens fischer et al 2014 therefore it is important to evaluate and compare the output of various modelling methods to learn which one produces the best results hastie et al 2009 from a biological perspective it is also necessary to check how different models predict the distribution of populations on a regional scale i e if they are able to show regions through a spatial simulation that are more or less suitable for colonisation than others by now a lot of different machine learning methods are applicable to biological questions e g tarca et al 2007 olden et al 2008 wieland and mirschel

performance indices e g precision and recall which are derived from a confusion matrix buckland and elston 1993 lobo et al 2008 bennett et al 2013 another approach to test the predictive power of a model can be done by analysing the spatial simulation of the occurrence of the species the resulting performance indices consist in a partially ordered set halfon 1985 which can be visualised using the hasse diagram technique hdt hasse 1952 brüggemann et al 1994 the hdt has been proven useful in many environmental studies such as ecotoxicological assessments of pollutants and comparisons of land use strategies brüggemann et al 1995 voigt et al 2006 tsonkova et al 2015 some models only work well with a certain dataset while others produce overly complex overfitted models with default settings rodda et al 2011 for the prediction of the potential distribution of ae j japonicus it is unknown which model or combination of models is the most suitable the previous ensemble forecasting method for the prediction of the potential distribution of ae j japonicus in europe used a poor dataset and without differentiating between the step by step combination of models cunze et al 2016 instead of this combination of all used models a combination of selected methods should be tested solazzo and galmarini 2014 martre et al 2015 this study is part of a joint research project and aims to test the suitability of different models for a specific dataset of mosquito occurrence points one of the goals of the joint research project is to provide maps of occurrence and dispersal of ae j japonicus in germany based on ecological and geological factors the primary objective of the present study is to find the model with the most accurate prediction of the potential distribution of ae j japonicus in germany related to weather variables as these seem to be most important in modelling the occurrence of an invasive mosquito species fischer et al 2011 2014 cunze et al 2016 for ranking the performance the indices recall precision selectivity exactness time for training adjustability and comprehensibility were compared through specific combinations of models an improvement of the performance is expected to be achieved martre et al 2015 the application of the hdt should clarify the order of the evaluation output of the single models and their combinations respectively i e the hdt should show if a single model or a combination of certain models yields the best results for predicting the potential distribution of ae j japonicus 2 methods 2 1 selection of predictors we accessed mosquito collection data via the german national mosquito database culbase which included data from the citizen science project mueckenatlas werner et al 2014 walther and kampen 2017 and from active monitoring activities kampen et al 2016 collection data of ae j japonicus and three native mosquito species were extracted from the culbase database we followed the approach of kerkow et al unpublished who assumed that environmental variables favour one species more than others thus we were able to perform a classification of mosquito species presence including weather variables as predictors with the following assumption which was based on the probability of the occurrence of a mosquito species p as a function f of weather w eq 1 1 p f w an analysis of publicly available weather variables in adequate resolution 1 km² deutscher wetterdienst https cdc dwd de according to the method by wieland et al 2017 to correlate with the potential occurrence of ae j japonicus in germany in 2014 produced the following variables to be most predictive mean precipitation in february april and june mean temperature in september october and december mean temperature in march april and may and drought index in september october and november handling the dataset was done by the python modules pandas and numpy 2 2 model selection from the many models available we focused on those which have been evaluated with the highest ranks by fernández delgado et al 2014 some classifier families have been excluded from the preselection because they produce better results in a different application area e g neural networks are more suitable for deep learning kampichler et al 2010 other classifiers had to be rejected due to poor results in pre tests e g adaboost the following models were selected decision tree dt which is easy to comprehend and to interpret breiman et al 1984 logistic regression lr a very popular and fast classifier cox 1958 random forest rf the most powerful classifier at the moment breiman 2001 fernández delgado et al 2014 and support vector machine svm which works well even with small datasets cortes and vapnik 1995 2 3 modelling the dataset of mosquito collection points was split into training data years 2011 2014 and test data year 2015 we used data of the years 2011 2014 n 2988 with a random selection of max 1000 sampling points for each training step and weather data from 2014 the python module scikit learn integrated a bunch of modern machine learning algorithms that could be used for fast and efficient supervised classification pedregosa et al 2011 it was accompanied by a precise and comprehensive documentation garreta and moncecchi 2013 we chose the four supervised algorithms from the models available in the scikit learn module see table 1 for each model we changed the default settings e g the depth of the tree for dt see table 1 to fit the model to our data until the score of the confusion matrix could not be improved anymore each model passed ten training steps to decrease the risk of choosing an unrepresentative selection of the dataset visualisation of the results with boxplots was implemented via the python module matplotlib to avoid retraining the models in case of future applications we used the python built in persistence module pickle an averaging multi model approach was used by combining the four models the binomial coefficient could calculate the number of possible combinations eq 2 2 k 1 n n k k 1 n n k n k 2 n 1 by subtracting the four single models we got 11 combinations for spatial simulation the potential distribution of ae j japonicus was compiled in an ascii grid file and visualised in maps through spatial analysis and modeling tool version 2 samt2 wieland et al 2006 2015 and qgis 2 16 3 ensemble models were produced by adding the output of specific single models and dividing the result by the number of the models in the ensemble through samt2 2 4 evaluation the evaluation of the training was done with sampling data from 2015 2 4 1 training for statistical evaluation of the single models we took the confusion matrix buckland and elston 1993 from the training and used the python metrics module to show a report with the performance indices precision and recall we considered collection points of ae j japonicus as a positive condition and handled the exclusive occurrence of other species as a negative condition for ae j japonicus 2 4 2 spatial simulation due to the lack of absence data we decided to develop an own evaluation measure to quantify the prediction performance of the spatial simulation we assumed that the lowest 10 of the predicted values can be subtracted from the prediction map since they must be expected to represent climatically unsuitable locations resulting in instable populations if they provided habitable areas at all the model should be able to predict regions with low probabilities of potential distribution predicting large areas with high occurrence probabilities resulting from false positives makes a model vague and unreliable for this reason we introduced the index selectivity s as a measure to explain the robustness of the model against false predictions of occurrence it was calculated by using the collection data from 2015 taking into account the predicted probability of each point the lowest 10 of these points were subtracted from the area of germany a0 giving a smaller area where the predicted probability p was greater than 10 of the lowest values of all points area p 10 afterwards the index was calculated by the following equation eq 3 3 s a 0 a r e a p 10 a 0 the smaller the area p 10 i e the higher the index s the more selective is the model which means that the model is able to predict accurate areas of occurrence of ae j japonicus and to minimise false predictions of occurrence of the species the index e shows the power of the models to predict the occurrence of ae j japonicus with a certain probability i e the exactness eq 4 it was calculated by the mean p m which is the arithmetic mean of the predicted probability p at the collection sites of mosquitoes in 2015 m with exclusive consideration of collection points where the predicted probability values p were greater than 10 4 e m e a n p m p 10 the higher the mean of the matched collection point values of 2015 is the more useful the model demonstrates to be for the prediction of ae j japonicus therefore the best model evaluated through the index e calculates the highest values of probability of occurrence for the collection point values of 2015 i e the test data both indices s and e are equally important making a direct comparison inadequate they represent a partially ordered set reggiani and marchetti 1975 halfon 1985 brüggemann and steinberg 1998 which can be graphically visualised by the hdt hasse 1952 halfon 1985 brüggemann et al 1994 the hdt is available via the pyhasse software package https pyhasse org in this study the hdt was used to compare the indices s1 e1 of one model m1 with the indices s2 e2 of another model m2 m1 has higher values than m2 if s1 is bigger than s2 or e1 is bigger than e2 eq 5 m1 and m2 are not comparable when s1 is bigger than s2 but e1 is lower than e2 or vice versa eq 6 5 m 1 s 1 e 1 m 2 s 2 e 2 s 1 s 2 e 1 e 2 6 m 1 s 1 e 1 m 2 s 2 e 2 s 1 s 2 e 1 e 2 s 1 s 2 e 1 e 2 2 4 3 secondary performance indices the time for training can vary highly between the algorithms especially depending on the size of the dataset and the number of estimators and input variables we measured the time needed via the python module timeit if the model has a lot of adjustable options a good performance even for a special dataset is evident on the other side it can be very time consuming to find the best configuration when there are too many options therefore we changed the settings of the models according to the documentation http scikit learn org pedregosa et al 2011 garreta and moncecchi 2013 until the results of the training could not be improved anymore a good comprehensibility of the model enables to retrace the decision path of the estimators this allows to evaluate the importance of the used input variables pedregosa et al 2011 the decision if the model was either a black box or a white box method was made by examining their functionality cox 1958 breiman et al 1984 cortes and vapnik 1995 breiman 2001 3 results 3 1 performance indices the values of the performance indices derive from 10 steps of training and testing the single models the model with the highest values of precision ranging from 0 8 to 0 85 and thus showing only small variance is svm the median of rf reaches the second highest values of 0 74 but the range of the testing results of the model has a rather high variance from 0 64 to 0 81 lr has a median precision of 0 72 fluctuating from 0 67 to 0 76 the model with the poorest results is dt with a median of 0 69 and a high variance from 0 59 to 0 82 fig 1 for the index recall svm has the highest median of all models with a value of 0 77 and a small variance from 0 74 to 0 80 lr and dt show similar results with a median of 0 74 but differ considerably in variance lr 0 74 0 76 dt 0 65 0 84 with outliers of up to 0 42 the poorest results are represented by rf with a median of 0 42 ranging from 0 31 to 0 47 fig 2 the results of the evaluation of the spatial simulation table 2 fig 3 were calculated according to eqs 3 and 4 see chapter 2 4 2 the following main results can be inferred from the hasse diagram fig 3 1 the evaluation results in a clear structure 2 dt is the model with the poorest results 3 combinations of two to three models yield the best results 4 the combination of all four models performs worse than combinations of less models or even single models 3 2 secondary quality indices lr and dt have the fastest algorithms 69 and 91 s respectively svm has a medium 171 s and rf the slowest runtime 518 s dt and rf are the only models that allow following and visualising the path of how the input variables were used for classification lr and svm are black boxes all models possess a lot of possibilities to fit them for the used dataset we had to tune some of the default settings e g number of estimators depth of tree etc until the result of the training could not be improved anymore 3 3 spatial simulation all selected models have in common that they predict high probabilities of occurrence 0 7 0 9 for almost the whole area of the federal states of baden wuerttemberg bw and north rhine westphalia nrw the highest values are calculated by svm the lowest by dt in other german federal states we find a high variation of the calculated prediction values rf shows highly fragmented areas with values 0 5 for hesse h rhineland palatinate rp lower saxony ls thuringia t and bavaria ba by contrast svm seems to calculate a more or less continuous area and very small additional spots in ba but overall rather high prediction values of 0 7 lr looks similar to svm but predicts a much smaller distribution area and values for rp but very high values of 0 8 for the foothills of the alps in southern ba dt shows the biggest calculated area with prediction values from 0 4 to 0 5 which includes ls schleswig holstein sh northern saxony anhalt sa western parts of brandenburg br mecklenburg western pomerania mp and berlin b smaller areas with higher values are calculated by dt with the focus on the borders of ba and t nrw rp and h and some spots in ba fig 4 most of the sites where individuals of ae j japonicus were collected from 2011 to 2014 bw and nrw were correctly calculated by all models looking at more recently detected presence areas e g from ba first records from 2015 zielke et al 2016 the models show marked differences the predicted probability of occurrence of ae j japonicus calculated through dt and rf shows no or only weak probability values as compared to field collections from 2015 in the southern part of ba when lr provides values of 0 5 0 7 fig 4 the combination of models results in maps with areas of predicted occurrence that are more balanced than those from single models because they are rid from outliers and much less fragmented frequently calculated high values are amplified single weaker values are diminished from the map a negative effect can be caused by a single model with very poor results it can bias the output from a combination of models with good evaluation results in such a way that it degrades the whole set e g the addition of dt fig 5 when we look at the best results according to the hasse diagram which are the combinations of rf and lr and svm rf and svm or lr and rf we see two main differences among many similarities the combination rf and svm shows higher values for ls but is much weaker for southern ba by contrast lr and rf shows much higher values for southern ba fig 5 3 4 comparison the modelling outputs can be compared by summarising the different evaluation results this is common in environmental modelling to get an overview about the quality of the models e g kampichler et al 2010 in this case each quality index contributes equally to the final result another option would be weighted ranking which can be done independently if the modelling priorities are different e g if false negatives should be absolutely avoided the recall index should have a higher value than the precision index or if there is a bigger dataset the running time becomes more important according to the summarised results of the evaluation indices in table 3 svm can be ranked as the best model due to its good results in the primary evaluation indices and despite the facts that it is a black box model and rather slow lr is faster than svm but is ranked second because it has weaker recall and precision results rf follows third due to its slow runtime and a lower value in the index recall probably owing to problems with the dataset or the training size see chapter 4 1 dt is presented at the end because its variance makes it unreliable however the indices listed in table 3 are incomparable therefore the summarised results of the evaluation indices should be taken with caution instead for an accurate comparison of the models it is advised to prefer the results from the hasse diagram chapter 3 1 4 discussion 4 1 performance all models show good precision index results with the exception of dt which shows a rather high variance of this index creating the impression that this model produces overfitted and unreliable output an explanation could be the specific dataset where locally clustered occurrence points can lead to an improper result dt is prone to overfitting anyway producing rather inaccurate and variable outputs with certain datasets compared to other models james et al 2013 géron 2017 regarding the recall index all models show good results with the exception of rf this could be the result of the randomised dts number of estimators 10 in the training process when the calculated maps are considered the output of rf shows scattered tessellated projected distribution areas even in regions where a more contiguous area was expected such a mosaic like pattern could be the reason for missing many of the testing points from 2015 and conveys the impression that the model is rather insensitive when we changed the number of estimators we got the worse results for the classification performance the more estimators we included this is a well known problem in machine learning and is attributed to the bias variance trade off hastie et al 2009 as rf reduces the variance of the single dts the bias of the model increases resulting in underfitting and becoming overly conservative this makes rf rather unreliable for helping detect unknown occurrence outside of the area of training data origin on the other hand it reduces the risk of calculating false positives when we changed the training size from 1000 to 300 individuals the recall index became much better but led to a rather liberal unselective model probably resulting from the insufficient number of training data and or unbalanced input data subramanian 2015 with a bigger dataset we assume that rf should yield a much better result especially if some of the parameters for regularisation are adjusted e g max depth min samples leaf max leaf nodes for evaluating the modelling performance the concept of partial ordering halfon 1985 visualised through the hdt brüggemann et al 1995 proves to be highly efficient the approach of using the hdt to support the common evaluation method is new in entomological modelling studies and seems to be a promising tool for ranking model output comparing the results from calculating the hdt via the partially ordered set of selectivity and exactness indices the combinations of lr and rf svm and rf and svm and lr and rf produced the best results specific ensembles containing two or three models performed better than single models the combination of all studied models was outperformed by most of the combinations with two or three models and also by some single models e g svm similar results evaluated by other approaches were recently obtained for example a combination of up to 10 out of 27 models improved the training output martre et al 2015 and subsets of five to seven models are outscoring the whole ensemble of 13 models solazzo and galmarini 2014 regarding the time effort for modelling the rather simple structure of lr and dt may explain why these algorithms were the fastest and why rf with ten estimators was five to seven times slower as the calculation in our study was already quite time consuming despite a rather small dataset it is suggested to use lr or svm for bigger datasets when the comprehensibility of the models is compared we see that svm and lr are black box models in the white box models dt and rf the importance of variables can be ranked breiman 2001 thus in future modelling studies the use of dt and rf can help to get a better understanding of the influence of specific variables optimising the model by changing its setting does not only require understanding the model but a well described documentation which can be found for the scikit package pedregosa et al 2011 a certain setting can improve the accuracy of the model but sometimes with negative side effects like an increase in false positive or false negative prediction for example we found the problem of overfitting in dt with exceedingly complex trees which tend to learn incorrect patterns in particular with the default setting max depth none resulting in a fully grown tree anyway it is necessary to change the adjustments of each model before the application of the default settings or else the output could be prone to serious overfitting rodda et al 2011 all models showed good results after some tuning also owing to a precise documentation pedregosa et al 2011 garreta and moncecchi 2013 4 2 further modelling steps weather variables alone cannot explain the occurrence of ae j japonicus it is necessary to include further aspects such as land use altitude and host population density liu et al 2017 to get a more accurate picture of the possible distribution of ae j japonicus an approach to find such additional variables could be preliminary cluster computing which has shown to be more promising than the selection by biological expertise wieland et al 2017 when simulating the spread of this species rivers roads and railways as pathways to distant locations which may be climatically suitable but not accessible by active migration of the mosquito should also be analysed tannich 2015 holloway and miller 2017 to solve the problem of adaptability of the species to the new environment which produces uncertainties in specific variables it is proposed to use a fuzzy modelling approach wieland and mirschel 2008 costa et al 2015 5 conclusion by using eight weather variables and a dataset of different mosquito species all four models calculate accurate predictions of the potential occurrence of ae j japonicus in germany with some limitations for the rather unstable decision tree the evaluation of the spatial simulation with the introduced indices exactness and selectivity results in a partially ordered set the application of the hasse diagram technique visualises the partial set of selectivity and exactness indices of all models and combinations therefore this technique appears to be a convenient instrument for the evaluation of machine learning methods ensemble models compared to single models can give a more balanced and more diverse output which is helpful to get information about previously unnoticed mosquito populations interestingly the best results for the prediction of the species distribution are from combinations of two or three models the combination of all available models is not advised because there will always be some with weaker or instable output which disqualify the output of the whole ensemble acknowledgements this paper was funded by the german federal ministry of food and agriculture bmel grant no 2819105315 and the ministry of science research and culture of the federal state of brandenburg mwfk germany we are grateful to the german

fischer et al 2014 therefore it is important to evaluate and compare the output of various modelling methods to learn which one produces the best results hastie et al 2009 from a biological perspective it is also necessary to check how different models predict the distribution of populations on a regional scale i e if they are able to show regions through a spatial simulation that are more or less suitable for colonisation than others by now a lot of different machine learning methods are applicable to biological questions e g tarca et al 2007 olden et al 2008 wieland and mirschel 2008 kampichler et al 2010 fernández delgado et al 2014 recently the combination of several modelling methods has become popular when classifying species distribution e g thomson et al 2006 grenouillet et al 2011 solazzo and galmarini 2014 martre et al 2015 modelling climatically dependent potential distribution is lately done for various invasive mosquito species e g aedes albopictus and ae japonicus japonicus showing potentially suitable habitats fischer et al 2014 kraemer et al 2015 melaun et al 2015 cunze et al 2016 aedes j japonicus is an invasive mosquito species which has entered the usa and europe through globalised trade from eastern asia kampen and werner 2014 monitoring in germany showed occurrences in baden wuerttemberg huber et al 2012 north rhine westphalia rhineland palatinate lower saxony north rhine westphalia kampen et al 2012 werner and kampen 2013 and bavaria zielke et al 2016 the potential of the species as a vector of viruses takashima and rosen 1989 sardelis et al 2002a 2002b 2003 schaffner et al 2011 huber et al 2014 requires thorough surveillance evaluating the training results of machine learning methods is usually done through performance indices e g precision and recall which are derived from a confusion matrix buckland and elston 1993 lobo et al 2008 bennett et al 2013 another approach to test the predictive power of a model can be done by analysing the spatial simulation of the occurrence of the species the resulting performance indices consist in a partially ordered set halfon 1985 which can be visualised using the hasse diagram technique hdt hasse 1952 brüggemann et al 1994 the hdt has been proven useful in many environmental studies such as ecotoxicological assessments of pollutants and comparisons of land use strategies brüggemann et al 1995 voigt et al 2006 tsonkova et al 2015 some models only work well with a certain dataset while others produce overly complex overfitted models with default settings rodda et al 2011 for the prediction of the potential distribution of ae j japonicus it is unknown which model or combination of models is the most suitable the previous ensemble forecasting method for the prediction of the potential distribution of ae j japonicus in europe used a poor dataset and without differentiating between the step by step combination of models cunze et al 2016 instead of this combination of all used models a combination of selected methods should be tested solazzo and galmarini 2014 martre et al 2015 this study is part of a joint research project and aims to test the suitability of different models for a specific dataset of mosquito occurrence points one of the goals of the joint research project is to provide maps of occurrence and dispersal of ae j japonicus in germany based on ecological and geological factors the primary objective of the present study is to find the model with the most accurate prediction of the potential distribution of ae j japonicus in germany related to weather variables as these seem to be most important in modelling the occurrence of an invasive mosquito species fischer et al 2011 2014 cunze et al 2016 for ranking the performance the indices recall precision selectivity exactness time for training adjustability and comprehensibility were compared through specific combinations of models an improvement of the performance is expected to be achieved martre et al 2015 the application of the hdt should clarify the order of the evaluation output of the single models and their combinations respectively i e the hdt should show if a single model or a combination of certain models yields the best results for predicting the potential distribution of ae j japonicus 2 methods 2 1 selection of predictors we accessed mosquito collection data via the german national mosquito database culbase which included data from the citizen science project mueckenatlas werner et al 2014 walther and kampen 2017 and from active monitoring activities kampen et al 2016 collection data of ae j japonicus and three native mosquito species were extracted from the culbase database we followed the approach of kerkow et al unpublished who assumed that environmental variables favour one species more than others thus we were able to perform a classification of mosquito species presence including weather variables as predictors with the following assumption which was based on the probability of the occurrence of a mosquito species p as a function f of weather w eq 1 1 p f w an analysis of publicly available weather variables in adequate resolution 1 km² deutscher wetterdienst https cdc dwd de according to the method by wieland et al 2017 to correlate with the potential occurrence of ae j japonicus in germany in 2014 produced the following variables to be most predictive mean precipitation in february april and june mean temperature in september october and december mean temperature in march april and may and drought index in september october and november handling the dataset was done by the python modules pandas and numpy 2 2 model selection from the many models available we focused on those which have been evaluated with the highest ranks by fernández delgado et al 2014 some classifier families have been excluded from the preselection because they produce better results in a different application area e g neural networks are more suitable for deep learning kampichler et al 2010 other classifiers had to be rejected due to poor results in pre tests e g adaboost the following models were selected decision tree dt which is easy to comprehend and to interpret breiman et al 1984 logistic regression lr a very popular and fast classifier cox 1958 random forest rf the most powerful classifier at the moment breiman 2001 fernández delgado et al 2014 and support vector machine svm which works well even with small datasets cortes and vapnik 1995 2 3 modelling the dataset of mosquito collection points was split into training data years 2011 2014 and test data year 2015 we used data of the years 2011 2014 n 2988 with a random selection of max 1000 sampling points for each training step and weather data from 2014 the python module scikit learn integrated a bunch of modern machine learning algorithms that could be used for fast and efficient supervised classification pedregosa et al 2011 it was accompanied by a precise and comprehensive documentation garreta and moncecchi 2013 we chose the four supervised algorithms from the models available in the scikit learn module see table 1 for each model we changed the default settings e g the depth of the tree for dt see table 1 to fit the model to our data until the score of the confusion matrix could not be improved anymore each model passed ten training steps to decrease the risk of choosing an unrepresentative selection of the dataset visualisation of the results with boxplots was implemented via the python module matplotlib to avoid retraining the models in case of future applications we used the python built in persistence module pickle an averaging multi model approach was used by combining the four models the binomial coefficient could calculate the number of possible combinations eq 2 2 k 1 n n k k 1 n n k n k 2 n 1 by subtracting the four single models we got 11 combinations for spatial simulation the potential distribution of ae j japonicus was compiled in an ascii grid file and visualised in maps through spatial analysis and modeling tool version 2 samt2 wieland et al 2006 2015 and qgis 2 16 3 ensemble models were produced by adding the output of specific single models and dividing the result by the number of the models in the ensemble through samt2 2 4 evaluation the evaluation of the training was done with sampling data from 2015 2 4 1 training for statistical evaluation of the single models we took the confusion matrix buckland and elston 1993 from the training and used the python metrics module to show a report with the performance indices precision and recall we considered collection points of ae j japonicus as a positive condition and handled the exclusive occurrence of other species as a negative condition for ae j japonicus 2 4 2 spatial simulation due to the lack of absence data we decided to develop an own evaluation measure to quantify the prediction performance of the spatial simulation we assumed that the lowest 10 of the predicted values can be subtracted from the prediction map since they must be expected to represent climatically unsuitable locations resulting in instable populations if they provided habitable areas at all the model should be able to predict regions with low probabilities of potential distribution predicting large areas with high occurrence probabilities resulting from false positives makes a model vague and unreliable for this reason we introduced the index selectivity s as a measure to explain the robustness of the model against false predictions of occurrence it was calculated by using the collection data from 2015 taking into account the predicted probability of each point the lowest 10 of these points were subtracted from the area of germany a0 giving a smaller area where the predicted probability p was greater than 10 of the lowest values of all points area p 10 afterwards the index was calculated by the following equation eq 3 3 s a 0 a r e a p 10 a 0 the smaller the area p 10 i e the higher the index s the more selective is the model which means that the model is able to predict accurate areas of occurrence of ae j japonicus and to minimise false predictions of occurrence of the species the index e shows the power of the models to predict the occurrence of ae j japonicus with a certain probability i e the exactness eq 4 it was calculated by the mean p m which is the arithmetic mean of the predicted probability p at the collection sites of mosquitoes in 2015 m with exclusive consideration of collection points where the predicted probability values p were greater than 10 4 e m e a n p m p 10 the higher the mean of the matched collection point values of 2015 is the more useful the model demonstrates to be for the prediction of ae j japonicus therefore the best model evaluated through the index e calculates the highest values of probability of occurrence for the collection point values of 2015 i e the test data both indices s and e are equally important making a direct comparison inadequate they represent a partially ordered set reggiani and marchetti 1975 halfon 1985 brüggemann and steinberg 1998 which can be graphically visualised by the hdt hasse 1952 halfon 1985 brüggemann et al 1994 the hdt is available via the pyhasse software package https pyhasse org in this study the hdt was used to compare the indices s1 e1 of one model m1 with the indices s2 e2 of another model m2 m1 has higher values than m2 if s1 is bigger than s2 or e1 is bigger than e2 eq 5 m1 and m2 are not comparable when s1 is bigger than s2 but e1 is lower than e2 or vice versa eq 6 5 m 1 s 1 e 1 m 2 s 2 e 2 s 1 s 2 e 1 e 2 6 m 1 s 1 e 1 m 2 s 2 e 2 s 1 s 2 e 1 e 2 s 1 s 2 e 1 e 2 2 4 3 secondary performance indices the time for training can vary highly between the algorithms especially depending on the size of the dataset and the number of estimators and input variables we measured the time needed via the python module timeit if the model has a lot of adjustable options a good performance even for a special dataset is evident on the other side it can be very time consuming to find the best configuration when there are too many options therefore we changed the settings of the models according to the documentation http scikit learn org pedregosa et al 2011 garreta and moncecchi 2013 until the results of the training could not be improved anymore a good comprehensibility of the model enables to retrace the decision path of the estimators this allows to evaluate the importance of the used input variables pedregosa et al 2011 the decision if the model was either a black box or a white box method was made by examining their functionality cox 1958 breiman et al 1984 cortes and vapnik 1995 breiman 2001 3 results 3 1 performance indices the values of the performance indices derive from 10 steps of training and testing the single models the model with the highest values of precision ranging from 0 8 to 0 85 and thus showing only small variance is svm the median of rf reaches the second highest values of 0 74 but the range of the testing results of the model has a rather high variance from 0 64 to 0 81 lr has a median precision of 0 72 fluctuating from 0 67 to 0 76 the model with the poorest results is dt with a median of 0 69 and a high variance from 0 59 to 0 82 fig 1 for the index recall svm has the highest median of all models with a value of 0 77 and a small variance from 0 74 to 0 80 lr and dt show similar results with a median of 0 74 but differ considerably in variance lr 0 74 0 76 dt 0 65 0 84 with outliers of up to 0 42 the poorest results are represented by rf with a median of 0 42 ranging from 0 31 to 0 47 fig 2 the results of the evaluation of the spatial simulation table 2 fig 3 were calculated according to eqs 3 and 4 see chapter 2 4 2 the following main results can be inferred from the hasse diagram fig 3 1 the evaluation results in a clear structure 2 dt is the model with the poorest results 3 combinations of two to three models yield the best results 4 the combination of all four models performs worse than combinations of less models or even single models 3 2 secondary quality indices lr and dt have the fastest algorithms 69 and 91 s respectively svm has a medium 171 s and rf the slowest runtime 518 s dt and rf are the only models that allow following and visualising the path of how the input variables were used for classification lr and svm are black boxes all models possess a lot of possibilities to fit them for the used dataset we had to tune some of the default settings e g number of estimators depth of tree etc until the result of the training could not be improved anymore 3 3 spatial simulation all selected models have in common that they predict high probabilities of occurrence 0 7 0 9 for almost the whole area of the federal states of baden wuerttemberg bw and north rhine westphalia nrw the highest values are calculated by svm the lowest by dt in other german federal states we find a high variation of the calculated prediction values rf shows highly fragmented areas with values 0 5 for hesse h rhineland palatinate rp lower saxony ls thuringia t and bavaria ba by contrast svm seems to calculate a more or less continuous area and very small additional spots in ba but overall rather high prediction values of 0 7 lr looks similar to svm but predicts a much smaller distribution area and values for rp but very high values of 0 8 for the foothills of the alps in southern ba dt shows the biggest calculated area with prediction values from 0 4 to 0 5 which includes ls schleswig holstein sh northern saxony anhalt sa western parts of brandenburg br mecklenburg western pomerania mp and berlin b smaller areas with higher values are calculated by dt with the focus on the borders of ba and t nrw rp and h and some spots in ba fig 4 most of the sites where individuals of ae j japonicus were collected from 2011 to 2014 bw and nrw were correctly calculated by all models looking at more recently detected presence areas e g from ba first records from 2015 zielke et al 2016 the models show marked differences the predicted probability of occurrence of ae j japonicus calculated through dt and rf shows no or only weak probability values as compared to field collections from 2015 in the southern part of ba when lr provides values of 0 5 0 7 fig 4 the combination of models results in maps with areas of predicted occurrence that are more balanced than those from single models because they are rid from outliers and much less fragmented frequently calculated high values are amplified single weaker values are diminished from the map a negative effect can be caused by a single model with very poor results it can bias the output from a combination of models with good evaluation results in such a way that it degrades the whole set e g the addition of dt fig 5 when we look at the best results according to the hasse diagram which are the combinations of rf and lr and svm rf and svm or lr and rf we see two main differences among many similarities the combination rf and svm shows higher values for ls but is much weaker for southern ba by contrast lr and rf shows much higher values for southern ba fig 5 3 4 comparison the modelling outputs can be compared by summarising the different evaluation results this is common in environmental modelling to get an overview about the quality of the models e g kampichler et al 2010 in this case each quality index contributes equally to the final result another option would be weighted ranking which can be done independently if the modelling priorities are different e g if false negatives should be absolutely avoided the recall index should have a higher value than the precision index or if there is a bigger dataset the running time becomes more important according to the summarised results of the evaluation indices in table 3 svm can be ranked as the best model due to its good results in the primary evaluation indices and despite the facts that it is a black box model and rather slow lr is faster than svm but is ranked second because it has weaker recall and precision results rf follows third due to its slow runtime and a lower value in the index recall probably owing to problems with the dataset or the training size see chapter 4 1 dt is presented at the end because its variance makes it unreliable however the indices listed in table 3 are incomparable therefore the summarised results of the evaluation indices should be taken with caution instead for an accurate comparison of the models it is advised to prefer the results from the hasse diagram chapter 3 1 4 discussion 4 1 performance all models show good precision index results with the exception of dt which shows a rather high variance of this index creating the impression that this model produces overfitted and unreliable output an explanation could be the specific dataset where locally clustered occurrence points can lead to an improper result dt is prone to overfitting anyway producing rather inaccurate and variable outputs with certain datasets compared to other models james et al 2013 géron 2017 regarding the recall index all models show good results with the exception of rf this could be the result of the randomised dts number of estimators 10 in the training process when the calculated maps are considered the output of rf shows scattered tessellated projected distribution areas even in regions where a more contiguous area was expected such a mosaic like pattern could be the reason for missing many of the testing points from 2015 and conveys the impression that the model is rather insensitive when we changed the number of estimators we got the worse results for the classification performance the more estimators we included this is a well known problem in machine learning and is attributed to the bias variance trade off hastie et al 2009 as rf reduces the variance of the single dts the bias of the model increases resulting in underfitting and becoming overly conservative this makes rf rather unreliable for helping detect unknown occurrence outside of the area of training data origin on the other hand it reduces the risk of calculating false positives when we changed the training size from 1000 to 300 individuals the recall index became much better but led to a rather liberal unselective model probably resulting from the insufficient number of training data and or unbalanced input data subramanian 2015 with a bigger dataset we assume that rf should yield a much better result especially if some of the parameters for regularisation are adjusted e g max depth min samples leaf max leaf nodes for evaluating the modelling performance the concept of partial ordering halfon 1985 visualised through the hdt brüggemann et al 1995 proves to be highly efficient the approach of using the hdt to support the common evaluation method is new in entomological modelling studies and seems to be a promising tool for ranking model output comparing the results from calculating the hdt via the partially ordered set of selectivity and exactness indices the combinations of lr and rf svm and rf and svm and lr and rf produced the best results specific ensembles containing two or three models performed better than single models the combination of all studied models was outperformed by most of the combinations with two or three models and also by some single models e g svm similar results evaluated by other approaches were recently obtained for example a combination of up to 10 out of 27 models improved the training output martre et al 2015 and subsets of five to seven models are outscoring the whole ensemble of 13 models solazzo and galmarini 2014 regarding the time effort for modelling the rather simple structure of lr and dt may explain why these algorithms were the fastest and why rf with ten estimators was five to seven times slower as the calculation in our study was already quite time consuming despite a rather small dataset it is suggested to use lr or svm for bigger datasets when the comprehensibility of the models is compared we see that svm and lr are black box models in the white box models dt and rf the importance of variables can be ranked breiman 2001 thus in future modelling studies the use of dt and rf can help to get a better understanding of the influence of specific variables optimising the model by changing its setting does not only require understanding the model but a well described documentation which can be found for the scikit package pedregosa et al 2011 a certain setting can improve the accuracy of the model but sometimes with negative side effects like an increase in false positive or false negative prediction for example we found the problem of overfitting in dt with exceedingly complex trees which tend to learn incorrect patterns in particular with the default setting max depth none resulting in a fully grown tree anyway it is necessary to change the adjustments of each model before the application of the default settings or else the output could be prone to serious overfitting rodda et al 2011 all models showed good results after some tuning also owing to a precise documentation pedregosa et al 2011 garreta and moncecchi 2013 4 2 further modelling steps weather variables alone cannot explain the occurrence of ae j japonicus it is necessary to include further aspects such as land use altitude and host population density liu et al 2017 to get a more accurate picture of the possible distribution of ae j japonicus an approach to find such additional variables could be preliminary cluster computing which has shown to be more promising than the selection by biological expertise wieland et al 2017 when simulating the spread of this species rivers roads and railways as pathways to distant locations which may be climatically suitable but not accessible by active migration of the mosquito should also be analysed tannich 2015 holloway and miller 2017 to solve the problem of adaptability of the species to the new environment which produces uncertainties in specific variables it is proposed to use a fuzzy modelling approach wieland and mirschel 2008 costa et al 2015 5 conclusion by using eight weather variables and a dataset of different mosquito species all four models calculate accurate predictions of the potential occurrence of ae j japonicus in germany with some limitations for the rather unstable decision tree the evaluation of the spatial simulation with the introduced indices exactness and selectivity results in a partially ordered set the application of the hasse diagram technique visualises the partial set of selectivity and exactness indices of all models and combinations therefore this technique appears to be a convenient instrument for the evaluation of machine learning methods ensemble models compared to single models can give a more balanced and more diverse output which is helpful to get information about previously unnoticed mosquito populations interestingly the best results for the prediction of the species distribution are from combinations of two or three models the combination of all available models is not advised because there will always be some with weaker or instable output which disqualify the output of the whole ensemble acknowledgements this paper was funded by the german

25182,rainforest deforestation is a process controlled by both environmental and socioeconomic factors unevenly distributed in space we tested the efficacy of a machine learning approach based on maxent models to predict deforestation in the brazilian amazon with special attention to the effects of the distance to the areas with higher present deforestation rates on model predictions we use a set of variables that describe most of the mechanisms involved in the deforestation process such as infrastructure social economy and deforestation previous to 2008 to fit the model and evaluate model accuracy using real deforestation within 2009 2011 maxent models were very effective for predicting new deforestation areas in spite of the high heterogeneity among amazon municipalities both model sensitivity and positive predictive rate increased from areas with higher current deforestation to not deforested areas there is higher model sensitivity near areas where deforestation process is more active our results support this approach as an effective tool for spatial prediction of deforestation and guide command control operations against amazonian deforestation keywords deforestation landscape modelling machine learning amazon deforestation public policies deforestation frontier 1 introduction deforestationis the most persistent environmental problem in the brazilian amazon with serious consequences for global biodiversity peres et al 2010 and ecosystem services on a global scale fearnside 2012 consequently there is an increased effort to stop deforestation or at least slow it arima et al 2014 nepstad et al 2009 most of these efforts are related to a consortium of public policies known as ppcdam prevention and control of deforestation action plan in brazilian amazon this plan has focus in increase command and control actions and preventive surveillance to deter illegal deforestation and has as results a deforestation rate decrease of almost 52 between 2004 and 2012 assunção et al 2012 those actions must rely on good spatial prediction of current and future deforestation in order to produce persistent and effective effects nevertheless current strategies are mostly based on reactive responses to past deforestation actions and became only palliative since the damage to the forest has already been done ipea 2010 laurance et al 2001 a pro active response is advised and broadly expected but it is extremely dependent on effective prediction of the spatial distribution of near future deforestation in the region the amazon forest is a mosaic of heterogeneous ecological and socioeconomic systems varying largely in relation to occupation history and the role played by different social actors and environmental factors de souza et al 2013 usually initial deforestation results from the implantation of cattle raising activities in areas with low land values rodrigues et al 2009 otherwise in flat relief landscapes that help mechanization the current land use changes favored the cultivation of soybean fearnside 2001 morton et al 2006 favoring rapid land conversion this shift in land use was accompanied by an increase in the land s value and may be partially responsible for the differences in deforestation rates across other amazonian areas e g south of amazonas state as a consequence of this process it is possible to devise a general conceptual model for amazonian deforestation that uses the distance to the deforestation frontier as a surrogate for the ecological and socioeconomic factors that affect deforestation laurance et al 2002 rodrigues et al 2009 a pre frontier distance class have low levels of deforestation activity large forest remnants and small deforestation 5 a frontier class recent or current deforestation activity has a high level of deforestation activity with a deforestation rate between 40 60 of the area the post frontier classes old deforestation have low level of current deforestation activity simply because the forest is almost gone these differences resulted from the socioeconomic processes current acting in each region and may affect the efficiency of models designed to predict the spatial distribution of deforestation for instance it is possible to hypothesize that models that use previous deforestation information and the activity of socioeconomic processes will be more effective in frontier and post frontier areas where those processes are current active or was active during the near past knowledge of the factors that affect deforestation is accepted as a fundamental tool for the continuous fight against deforestation some models simulate changes in the environmental attributes of the geographic territories and represent an effort to understand how the system developed under predetermined conditions soares filho and coutinho 2002 soares et al 2006 obviously spatial models for deforestation must rely on a good understanding of how socioeconomic political and environmental conditions affect deforestation such enterprises may also help to provide a proper evaluation of the extent that surveillance efforts against deforestation are efficient linkie et al 2010 consequently the past 20 years witnessed extensive research on the causes and factors affecting deforestation fearnside 2008 nepstad et al 2009 de souza et al 2013 an analysis of these studies suggests that there are two sets of factors associated with the local occurrence of deforestation the first set is explicitly related to deforestation as a spatial process thus the presence of a deforested area can be a strong predictor of the likelihood of future deforestation nearby de souza and de marco 2014 laurance et al 2002 otherwise there are socioeconomic processes that may turn deforestation more easy or more profitable in a given location this second set of factors is linked to market availability and the difficulty of surveillance which may represent additional costs borner et al 2010 the most common variables that operationally describe these relationships are the distance from roads and rivers barber et al 2014 laurance et al 2002 the presence of livestock laurance et al 2002 the expansion of agriculture mainly soybeans martinelli et al 2010 and the absence of conservation units barber et al 2014 ricketts et al 2010 a large number of different approaches are current in use to model the deforestation process which could be included in a broad view of land use change models lópez carr et al 2012 marín et al 2011 parker et al 2003 a spatial model approach allows an improved ability to identify locations at higher risk for future deforestation by combining a set of environmental socioeconomic conditions with the occurrence of local deforestation this may resemble the modern approach of predicting species distributions by formulating correlative rules between the presence of species and a set of climate variables or other environmental conditions elith et al 2006 peterson 2006 more broadly these methods use numerical tools to combine observations of the occurrence of a target class e g species with environmental variables predicting the distribution of species across regions and sometimes requiring extrapolation in space elith and leathwick 2009 a large number of different algorithms are currently used to these general problems elith et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 wisz et al 2008 one common and successful approach is the use of the maximum entropy concept as implemented in the maxent program phillips and dudík 2008 to generate predictions the flexibility and efficiency of this tool has been well stablished in a broader number of problems such as the identification of a landscape class in a remote sensing problem li and guo 2010 or spatial prediction of fire in landscapes chen et al 2015 parisien and moritz 2009 for instance maxent was used to assess regions that were more prone to wildfires in the united states of america and specifically to the state of california parisien and moritz 2009 furthermore a study using this algorithm estimated deforestation and was successful in modelling its future distribution for a limited region in the western brazilian amazon de souza and de marco 2014 despite the promising results of this first attempt to the predict amazonian deforestation a more complete evaluation of its efficiency considering the heterogeneity of the process across different areas are essential to support it application both in academic and police strategy studies here we present the predictions of the spatial distribution for the entire brazilian amazon deforestation using the species distribution modelling approach sdm and discuss how the spatial heterogeneity of the possible deforestation controlling factors may affect these results at the biome scale we assume that the spatial prediction of deforestation is affected by the form of the human occupation process laurance et al 2002 rodrigues et al 2009 expressed by variations in deforestation rates and accompanying socioeconomic processes in relation to the deforestation frontier since the driving factors of deforestation may vary along the gradient from post to pre frontier areas we expect that our predictive ability will be lower in pre frontier areas where the existence of previous deforestation in low nevertheless this is the key issue of deforestation prediction an efficient prediction of future deforestation in pre frontier areas is the key for controlling deforestation a better predictive model under this scenario might be able to deal with these differences and maintain its predictive power this is also important since there has been no attempt to evaluate the variation of the predictive power of the previous deforestation models in relation to the changes in deforestation rates as well as the socioeconomic issues derived from the deforestation frontier framework rodrigues et al 2009 we expect that this novel approach will serve to foster more efficient planning of surveillance actions for deforestation control 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area comprises all municipalities in the brazilian legal amazon distributed across nine states this region accounts for more than 61 of the brazilian territory 5 217 423 km2 fig 1 approximately 22 million people live in the region but the area maintains an overall low population density and includes some of the poorest regions in brazil this area is a important frontier for agriculture expansion in brazil that includes a notably high conversion of natural vegetation to livestock pasture and soy monocultures over the past ten years the brazilian amazon has undergone large infrastructure projects such as the construction of dams and the creation and or paving of major highways these changes directly affect the risk of deforestation laurance et al 2002 soares filho et al 2004 and affect the process of agricultural frontier expansion nepstad et al 2002 2 2 occurrence of deforestation the deforestation monitoring program prodes available at http www obt inpe br prodes of the national institute for space research inpe which provides information regarding deforestation from 1997 to 2013 provided the deforestation data used in this study the prodes is restricted to forested areas and excludes some savannah enclaves into the amazonian forests such as a large area of the maranhão state those areas are also excluded from this analysis considering the law enforcement efforts against deforestation that took place in 2008 brasil 2008 we choose to use deforestation until 2008 as our baseline data for training the models used to predict the deforestation rates we used the observed spatial distribution of deforestation during the period of 2009 2011 to validate the generated models we choose the deforestation until 2008 as baseline because in this year a law was implemented that created a public black list limiting the ability to obtain loans and generate business for persons and companies that have committed environmental crimes this law was a new paradigm in the fight against deforestation in brazil since it creates an effective economic mechanism reaching the main avenues of support for those engaged in deforestation agricultural loans for all analysis the area unit was a 1 km 1 km cell original deforestation data are polygons with very detailed spatial information following a conservative strategy to reduce spatial autocorrelation of this original data and redundant environmental data on the model s fit we used the geographic coordinates of the center point of each deforestation polygon derived from prodes for the studied period as a record of deforestation occurrence 2 3 functional variables in this study we defined the term functional to mean the set of variables that have direct effects on local deforestation we chose this term instead of environmental variables as used under the sdm approach since the term functional variables includes many socioeconomic variables and infrastructural elements this also helps to make clear the distinction between common sdm applications and our use of these concepts in relation to our purpose the functional variables have diverse sources mainly from public open brazilian government databases table 1 neighborhood effects are well documented as being important drivers of deforestation laurance et al 2002 soares filho and coutinho 2002 for instance a landowner is less prone to deforest in areas that are closer those embargoed by the government due to it being illegal to log in those areas or the areas being protected arima et al 2014 soares filho et al 2010 the inverse situation occurs with roads as areas closer to roads have a greater probability of being deforested than do areas that are farther away barber et al 2014 laurance et al 2002 as all variables used here are expected to exert neighborhood effects a grid raster of the distance to the closest source of the particular influence road protect areas embargoed areas was generated using arcgis 9 3 esri 2009 at a spatial resolution of 1 1 km considering the deforestation as a spatial process previous deforestation distribution could be a very important predictor of short term deforestation thus we evaluated the importance of the previous deforestation information in the model s efficiency by building models with and without this variable as a component of the functional variable dataset 2 4 modelling distribution of deforestation maxent we generated the potential areas of future deforestation using the maximum entropy maxent program version 3 3 phillips and dudík 2008 maxent is based on fitting functions closer to the uniform distribution of the occurrence points constrained to the environmental information elith et al 2011 thus maxent is a very simple presence background method that finds a combination of the functional variables that discriminate known occurrence points from the background variation in these variables the program needs only the input of the position in the geographic space where the deforestation occurred and the map of each functional variable producing as output a suitability map for deforestation moreover maxent allows for the selection of some features that determine the shape of the fit curve to the deforestation occurrence data in relation to different independent variables in this study we used the auto feature option in accordance to the results of a previous study on amazonian deforestation de souza and de marco 2014 the use of the automatic features allows the program to search for adjustments to more complex empirically derived curves but these models must contain a large number of parameters phillips et al 2006 maxent uses background information to generate its predictions and does not rely on true absences in its fitting process elith et al 2011 hastie and fithian 2013 we apply the default program parameter of 10 000 background points at random to represent the environmental variation throughout the study area it is assumed that deforestation is a spatially explicit and historical phenomenon this means that areas prone to be cleared may maintain its forest simply because there was not enough time to the deforestation frontier to reach this particular site the absence of the deforestation in this site is not a surrogate of the absence of the condition that favored deforestation but simple a historical non equilibrium this may include a bias in the estimation of a response curve for deforestation for regression based models such as logistic regression and glm and gam adaptations but have little effect in presence background methods such as maxent the conversion of the output maxent variable into a binary prediction of deforestation requires the choice of an appropriate threshold elith et al 2006 liu et al 2013 we use the limits derived from the receiver operation curve roc which balances the omission and commission errors fielding and bell 1997 referred in the maxent as maximum sensitivity plus specificity thus generating conservative estimates of the deforested areas 2 5 model evaluation we use two different approaches for model evaluation the first is the usual protocol for sdm studies based on the receiver operating curve approach roc nevertheless we present these results only descriptively with intent to comparison with other sdm studies the other evaluation method is a more specific measure of the predictive properties of the models based on the direct comparison of the model predictions and the real deforestation occurred three years after 2008 2009 2011 the evaluation of the distribution models is an area of intense research liu et al 2011 since maxent is a method that uses only presences the program adds pseudo absences to generate the confusion matrix needed for model evaluation we use the roc to produce an evaluation model for each species using the area under the curve auc as a descriptive measure auc values vary between 0 and 1 with 0 5 representing predictive values that are no better than chance recent studies have become more demanding and use amounts higher than 0 7 to indicate acceptable models elith et al 2006 swets 1988 despite the ubiquitous use of this metric in sdm literature it has been questioned due to the model s dependence on the prevalence allouche et al 2006 lobo et al 2008 as well as for how pseudo absences are selected liu et al 2011 in this study the auc was used only descriptively because the main objective was to evaluate the discriminatory ability of the models in predicting the deforestation that had occurred during the three years after the 2008 data 2009 2011 for the direct evaluation we built the confusion matrices based on the model predictions and the observed deforestation using the grid cell as a sampling unit we determined the sensitivity proportion of real deforestation that was corrected predicted positive predictive power ppp and prevalence fielding and bell 1997 of all of the deforestation models for 2009 2011 at the municipality level allowing for the evaluation of differences related to the distance to the deforestation frontiers the sensitivity was chosen as the metric for this analysis by representing the probability of deforestation found within the predicted area of the models the positive predictive value was the probability that a predicted unit area was cleared the following year the ppp is a surrogate to effort the command and control actions role against deforestation the prevalence might be related to sensitivity simply as a mathematical consequence mcpherson et al 2004 if the model predicts large distributional areas it will always have a high level of sensitivity thus the best model might be one that has the higher level of sensitivity but a lower prevalence we are especially interested on evaluate how heterogeneity of socioeconomic states and development is related to the efficiency to predict amazonian deforestation we based our analysis on a general framework on the spatial distribution of amazonian deforestation rates and its most important socioeconomic causes and consequences related to the development of a deforestation frontier rodrigues et al 2009 this interpretation is entirely based on how economic forces and demands vary according to pre frontier and pos frontier areas we use this previous model to classify amazon municipalities into classes relating to the distance to the deforestation frontier this framework considered the deforestation activity and the extension of the deforested area until 2008 we employ a repeated measures analysis of variance approach anova zar 2010 with the municipality as the sample unit to evaluate the effect of position in relation to the frontier three pre frontier frontier and three pos frontier classes and the use of previous deforestation in the model on all evaluation metrics sensitivity ppp and prevalence the large number of replications with more than 800 municipalities generated an extremely high level of statistical power in this situation the statistical significance might be meaningless due to the demands for the interpretation of the effect size thus we presented the results of the statistical tests suggesting that they be used descriptively interpreting the results based on the confidence interval estimates and the effect sizes 3 results the auc values from the two sdms created in this study were usually higher than 0 7 and were always higher than the values that were expected by chance sensitivity of models only slightly increases from pre to post frontier areas but with the highest interval estimates in the last class fig 2 the sdm sensitivity values were particularly high where deforestation activity was most active and in the post frontier such as near the deforestation frontier the inclusion of previous deforestation in the models increase its sensitivity especially in the classes in classes where the natural vegetation cover was more preserved a c fig 2 this pattern of variation in sensitivity values was consistent in both the deforestation activity from 2011 and the total deforestation activity between 2009 and 2011 fig 2 the model including the distance from previous deforestation presented sensitivity values over 97 thus for every 10 pixels that were cleared between 2009 and 2011 at least nine could be correctly predicted using the sdm approach even if we only considered the deforestation activity from 2011 the average sensitivity was 71 fig 2 the model including the distance from previous deforestation also presented sensitivity values higher than did the analysis without this variable this result was similar to the validation analysis conducted using only deforestation data from 2011 however for the classes where there was more deforestation activity the difference between the sdm scenarios was not conspicuous positive predictive power ppp increases toward the post frontier areas both for deforestation prediction in 2011 and total deforestation 2009 2011 fig 2 however for deforestation prediction in 2011 the values were low and near 2 except for the most distant class area class g with a ppp value of approximately 8 as expected ppp values increases for the prediction for the cumulative deforestation between 2009 and 2011 with the largest ppp values of approximately 18 for the g class these results are similar for sdms built with and without previous deforestation as functional variable the prevalence of the models with and without previous deforestation did not indicate any significant difference compared between them the prevalence values of the models were similar when evaluated using the 2009 deforestation activity or when using the combined deforestation activity from 2009 to 2011 fig 2 nevertheless the total prevalence which is a surrogate of the potential deforestation area was close to 21 of the total area of the entire brazilian legal amazon these numbers included areas that are currently cleared excluding these areas our model predicted a future deforestation of an additional 6 of the brazilian legal amazon representing a large restriction for target conservation measures related to controlling deforestation rates fig 3 these potential deforestation areas which were not cleared yet were distributed along of region of the deforestation frontier usually these potential areas are fringes of consolidated deforested areas fig 3 additionally fig 3 highlighted eight hotspots of amazonian deforestation a h they show how it is possible to identify regions with higher concentration of pixels with higher predicted chance of deforestation to focus actions against deforestation these areas are mainly inside deforestation arc the region of rio branco in acre state and lábrea in amazonas state fig 3 area b north from rondônia state fig 3 area c apuí and humaíta south from amazonas state fig 3 area d mato grosso north fig 3 area e region from br 163 road considering the region of novo progresso in pará state pa fig 3 area f transamazônica road near the region of itaituba pa and santarém pa fig 3 area g however there are areas outside from deforestation arc as the far west from acre state fig 3 area a and left side of amazonas river near monte alegre pa and oriximiná pa fig 3 area h where old human settlements already cattle raise activities the central region of roraima state fig 3 area h not surprisingly all of these areas were focus of command control operations against deforestation by ibama between 2009 and 2010 one of these operations focus on area f novo progresso pa was the emblematic boi pirata ii with embargo of thousands livestock heads from deforestation areas 4 discussion amazon deforestation between 2009 and 2011 had at least an 80 chance of occurring within the potential areas predicted by the maxent models that were fitted using the information from 2008 this higher sensitivity combined with a similar observed prevalence to the reference models soares et al 2006 supported the claim that this constitutes a major advance in deforestation prediction the use of this model allowed for the concentration of efforts on preventive or command and control actions on only 21 of the total legal amazon area which might result in a major increase in the efficiency of these programs this result is particularly important considering difficulties in applying efficient prevention or control activities in an area of the size of the amazon region nepstad et al 2014 soares et al 2006 a similar prevalence between the various models of different municipality classes confirmed the effectiveness of the sdm approach as applied to this problem we also found that the inclusion of the distance from previous deforestation caused a significant increase in the sensitivity to predicting future deforestation consequently the model s accuracy was direct related to the distance to the deforestation frontier that in turn was related to the importance of previous deforestation on the prediction of the fate of the regional forest these results were similar to those of previous studies that evaluated part of the western amazon using the sdm approach de souza and de marco 2014 nevertheless here we expanded the previous observations to include the entire amazon region allowing for the evaluation of the existence of regional effects the amazon is very heterogeneous which is reflected in the distribution of deforestation activity in the region nevertheless the distance from the deforestation frontier was a good surrogate of the socioeconomic processes that determine the activity and extent of deforestation de souza et al 2013 rodrigues et al 2009 considering this the sdms demonstrated a higher sensitivity in almost all classes of deforestation frontier distance notably there was a greater sensitivity of the sdms for classes where deforestation was most active and recent near frontier areas recent frontier areas more hits better sensitivity occur exactly where we needed the deploy the most urgent actions against deforestation in the pre frontier and frontier municipalities increasing the usefulness of the sdm approach as a tool for deforestation prediction the spatial pattern of sensitivity variation also showed that previous deforestation was a more effective predictor in pre frontier municipalities where is not usual several deforestation areas this initially unexpected result was easily explained by two factors in these areas even a very small deforestation settlement increased the predictability of future deforestation events in addition variables such as the existence of previous deforestation were more effective predictors in these areas since other functional variables such as roads and urban areas were nearly absent the success of the modelling process relied on the choice of functional variables that could also act as surrogates for the broader economic social and political process that are known to be related to deforestation dalla nora et al 2014 de souza et al 2013 fearnside 2008 laurance et al 2002 martinelli et al 2010 variables such as roads livestock agriculture and urban areas are expected to be better predictors at the level of the deforestation frontiers in order to determine the level of deforestation activity laurance et al 2002 nepstad et al 2006 soares et al 2006 otherwise new deforestation areas have a tendency to occur near places where there has been previous deforestation activity forming adjacent cleared areas alves et al 2003 this trend occurs because the area that was previously cleared is often a surrogate for the occurrence of other factors that favor deforestation such as proximity to roads urban areas presence of crops and pastures and the absence of the command and control action in the region the intensity of the process is likely related to the increased number of single factors that occur in combination this strong relationship between new and previous deforestation activities favors the more accurate results of the sdm models that used the distance from previous deforestation areas as one of the functional variables otherwise the road itself is insignificant in and of itself but is a way to promote other impactful activities cattle timber in the forest moreover the two examples of variables strongly influence the occurrence of new deforestation in the models based in cellular automata scenarios soares et al 2006 it is possible that pursuing a modelling approach to provide long term predictions for amazonian deforestation is naïve since it is not expected that the economic system will maintain its exact process for 10 20 years because socioeconomic processes and political decisions can change over time and space it becomes necessary to monitor the evolution of these variables our approach is better suited for short term predictions of the spatial changes in deforestation rates the simplicity of use and the input of easy accessible public data make it possible to re build the sdm model every year allowing for good predictions for the near future this approach may lack the assumption of uniformity of the effect of the economic process over the course of a large span of time but it assumes that these processes are spatially homogeneous these properties of the maxent prediction fully serves the purpose of preventive surveillance as advocated by the new rif ibama 2009 and has a high level of sensitivity allowing for the modification of the variables to create different surveillance scenarios otherwise these results must open the possibility to increase the evaluation of other statistical methods previously used to model land use change especially the use of presence absence methods such as random forests and gam methods all those may represent more flexible and easy to use methods compared to the dynamica ego approach commonly use to amazonian deforestation problem in all cases the sdm models had a very low predictive power initially interpreted as model over prediction the sdm models produced predictions of areas that may be potentially deforested in the near future but with no pre determined time frame thus a low predictive power is obviously expected because we may not see the real effect until a number of years in the future this also represented that from a large set of potential areas of deforestation in amazon the current productive force in this field might select only a small subset the question of how short a time the short terms predictions derived from maxent would remain unsolved but it could be evaluated using the ability to predict new deforestations in the years to come regarding the new internal regulation surveillance of ibama rif ibama 2009 the low positive predictive value of power did not constitute a major problem for surveillance at least for ibama as they are not working on a pixel by pixel basis or on a deforestation by deforestation basis except for in critical areas however the decrease in the total surveillance area to approximately 21 through the use of sdm without disregarding previously cleared areas that will not be cleared again constituted a great advantage because of the decreased time spent on people in the field as well as cars helicopter hours and other resources the use of deforestation predictor models for improving the policies against deforestation in the brazilian amazon as command and control was an innovation because until now all of the approaches using these models did not have this intention studies of deforestation predictor models laurance et al 2002 soares et al 2006 have attempted to provide scenarios for an estimated area both currently and in the future trying to inform or and influence the decision makers however studies using models for law enforcement or economic policies are rare although there are studies in other forests such as in the sumatran rainforest with the intent of improving or evaluating law enforcement strategies against deforestation linkie et al 2010 this study in addition to using predictive models of deforestation to improve planning command and control operations was also innovative because it used a common methodology sdm for the distribution of species in order to assess the spatial distribution of potential deforestation although infrastructure features related to energy sources were not used in the construction of the study models we acknowledge that these features have been gaining importance in determining new deforestation in recent years excluding cattle and soybean farmers who deforested to generate goods directly for the consumer market nepstad et al 2006 explorations of oil pipelines and hydroelectricity and energy conveying lines that were planned and built in recent years in the amazon region have great potential for environmental and social impacts in the region if not adopted public policies finer et al 2008 finer and jenkins 2012 new models using the methods describe here designed to address the phenomenon of deforestation in the short and midterm should consider in addition to roads the variables that are related to infrastructure construction in the regions analyzed finally we consider that it is becoming clear that just command control actions are not enough to control deforestation in brazilian amazon but broad economic policies may have overweight key role in this process de souza and de marco 2015 the exhaustion of this deforestation combat model is now expressed in the recent trend of increase deforestation rates inpe 2016 models as those developed here are an important tool to improve the territorial planning of policies against deforestation besides its ability to a better relocation of the command control actions we highlight its importance in planning local proactive measures designed to foster cultural and economic changes that could prevent future deforestation 5 conclusion we have shown that a sdm approach is able to produce accurate models for short term spatial prediction of deforestation in brazilian amazon those modes presented higher sensitivity and similar observed prevalence compared to the reference models soares et al 2006 which turn they more efficient to guide command control actions against deforestation nevertheless model results have highlighted the heterogeneity of the prediction success in relation to the distance from the deforestation frontier this measure should be considered a main surrogate of the socioeconomic processes that generate deforestation rodrigues et al 2009 higher model sensitivity in near frontier areas resulted from the spatial autocorrelation of the process deforestation in the future occurs mostly near present deforestation this is a good news because it represent a higher prediction success exactly where the need for policies to stop deforestation are most need acknowledgements we thank laerte ferreira vincent nedelec and natalia torres for their comments on an early draft of this manuscript and werner gonçalves for support in

25182,rainforest deforestation is a process controlled by both environmental and socioeconomic factors unevenly distributed in space we tested the efficacy of a machine learning approach based on maxent models to predict deforestation in the brazilian amazon with special attention to the effects of the distance to the areas with higher present deforestation rates on model predictions we use a set of variables that describe most of the mechanisms involved in the deforestation process such as infrastructure social economy and deforestation previous to 2008 to fit the model and evaluate model accuracy using real deforestation within 2009 2011 maxent models were very effective for predicting new deforestation areas in spite of the high heterogeneity among amazon municipalities both model sensitivity and positive predictive rate increased from areas with higher current deforestation to not deforested areas there is higher model sensitivity near areas where deforestation process is more active our results support this approach as an effective tool for spatial prediction of deforestation and guide command control operations against amazonian deforestation keywords deforestation landscape modelling machine learning amazon deforestation public policies deforestation frontier 1 introduction deforestationis the most persistent environmental problem in the brazilian amazon with serious consequences for global biodiversity peres et al 2010 and ecosystem services on a global scale fearnside 2012 consequently there is an increased effort to stop deforestation or at least slow it arima et al 2014 nepstad et al 2009 most of these efforts are related to a consortium of public policies known as ppcdam prevention and control of deforestation action plan in brazilian amazon this plan has focus in increase command and control actions and preventive surveillance to deter illegal deforestation and has as results a deforestation rate decrease of almost 52 between 2004 and 2012 assunção et al 2012 those actions must rely on good spatial prediction of current and future deforestation in order to produce persistent and effective effects nevertheless current strategies are mostly based on reactive responses to past deforestation actions and became only palliative since the damage to the forest has already been done ipea 2010 laurance et al 2001 a pro active response is advised and broadly expected but it is extremely dependent on effective prediction of the spatial distribution of near future deforestation in the region the amazon forest is a mosaic of heterogeneous ecological and socioeconomic systems varying largely in relation to occupation history and the role played by different social actors and environmental factors de souza et al 2013 usually initial deforestation results from the implantation of cattle raising activities in areas with low land values rodrigues et al 2009 otherwise in flat relief landscapes that help mechanization the current land use changes favored the cultivation of soybean fearnside 2001 morton et al 2006 favoring rapid land conversion this shift in land use was accompanied by an increase in the land s value and may be partially responsible for the differences in deforestation rates across other amazonian areas e g south of amazonas state as a consequence of this process it is possible to devise a general conceptual model for amazonian deforestation that uses the distance to the deforestation frontier as a surrogate for the ecological and socioeconomic factors that affect deforestation laurance et al 2002 rodrigues et al 2009 a pre frontier distance class have low levels of deforestation activity large forest remnants and small deforestation 5 a frontier class recent or current deforestation activity has a high level of deforestation activity with a deforestation rate between 40 60 of the area the post frontier classes old deforestation have low level of current deforestation activity simply because the forest is almost gone these differences resulted from the socioeconomic processes current acting in each region and may affect the efficiency of models designed to predict the spatial distribution of deforestation for instance it is possible to hypothesize that models that use previous deforestation information and the activity of socioeconomic processes will be more effective in frontier and post frontier areas where those processes are current active or was active during the near past knowledge of the factors that affect deforestation is accepted as a fundamental tool for the continuous fight against deforestation some models simulate changes in the environmental attributes of the geographic territories and represent an effort to understand how the system developed under predetermined conditions soares filho and coutinho 2002 soares et al 2006 obviously spatial models for deforestation must rely on a good understanding of how socioeconomic political and environmental conditions affect deforestation such enterprises may also help to provide a proper evaluation of the extent that surveillance efforts against deforestation are efficient linkie et al 2010 consequently the past 20 years witnessed extensive research on the causes and factors affecting deforestation fearnside 2008 nepstad et al 2009 de souza et al 2013 an analysis of these studies suggests that there are two sets of factors associated with the local occurrence of deforestation the first set is explicitly related to deforestation as a spatial process thus the presence of a deforested area can be a strong predictor of the likelihood of future deforestation nearby de souza and de marco 2014 laurance et al 2002 otherwise there are socioeconomic processes that may turn deforestation more easy or more profitable in a given location this second set of factors is linked to market availability and the difficulty of surveillance which may represent additional costs borner et al 2010 the most common variables that operationally describe these relationships are the distance from roads and rivers barber et al 2014 laurance et al 2002 the presence of livestock laurance et al 2002 the expansion of agriculture mainly soybeans martinelli et al 2010 and the absence of conservation units barber et al 2014 ricketts et al 2010 a large number of different approaches are current in use to model the deforestation process which could be included in a broad view of land use change models lópez carr et al 2012 marín et al 2011 parker et al 2003 a spatial model approach allows an improved ability to identify locations at higher risk for future deforestation by combining a set of environmental socioeconomic conditions with the occurrence of local deforestation this may resemble the modern approach of predicting species distributions by formulating correlative rules between the presence of species and a set of climate variables or other environmental conditions elith et al 2006 peterson 2006 more broadly these methods use numerical tools to combine observations of the occurrence of a target class e g species with environmental variables predicting the distribution of species across regions and sometimes requiring extrapolation in space elith and leathwick 2009 a large number of different algorithms are currently used to these general problems elith et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 wisz et al 2008 one common and successful approach is the use of the maximum entropy concept as implemented in the maxent program phillips and dudík 2008 to generate predictions the flexibility and efficiency of this tool has been well stablished in a broader number of problems such as the identification of a landscape class in a remote sensing problem li and guo 2010 or spatial prediction of fire in landscapes chen et al 2015 parisien and moritz 2009 for instance maxent was used to assess regions that were more prone to wildfires in the united states of america and specifically to the state of california parisien and moritz 2009 furthermore a study using this algorithm estimated deforestation and was successful in modelling its future distribution for a limited region in the western brazilian amazon de souza and de marco 2014 despite the promising results of this first attempt to the predict amazonian deforestation a more complete evaluation of its efficiency considering the heterogeneity of the process across different areas are essential to support it application both in academic and police strategy studies here we present the predictions of the spatial distribution for the entire brazilian amazon deforestation using the species distribution modelling approach sdm and discuss how the spatial heterogeneity of the possible deforestation controlling factors may affect these results at the biome scale we assume that the spatial prediction of deforestation is affected by the form of the human occupation process laurance et al 2002 rodrigues et al 2009 expressed by variations in deforestation rates and accompanying socioeconomic processes in relation to the deforestation frontier since the driving factors of deforestation may vary along the gradient from post to pre frontier areas we expect that our predictive ability will be lower in pre frontier areas where the existence of previous deforestation in low nevertheless this is the key issue of deforestation prediction an efficient prediction of future deforestation in pre frontier areas is the key for controlling deforestation a better predictive model under this scenario might be able to deal with these differences and maintain its predictive power this is also important since there has been no attempt to evaluate the variation of the predictive power of the previous deforestation models in relation to the changes in deforestation rates as well as the socioeconomic issues derived from the deforestation frontier framework rodrigues et al 2009 we expect that this novel approach will serve to foster more efficient planning of surveillance actions for deforestation control 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area comprises all municipalities in the brazilian legal amazon distributed across nine states this region accounts for more than 61 of the brazilian territory 5 217 423 km2 fig 1 approximately 22 million people live in the region but the area maintains an overall low population density and includes some of the poorest regions in brazil this area is a important frontier for agriculture expansion in brazil that includes a notably high conversion of natural vegetation to livestock pasture and soy monocultures over the past ten years the brazilian amazon has undergone large infrastructure projects such as the construction of dams and the creation and or paving of major highways these changes directly affect the risk of deforestation laurance et al 2002 soares filho et al 2004 and affect the process of agricultural frontier expansion nepstad et al 2002 2 2 occurrence of deforestation the deforestation monitoring program prodes available at http www obt inpe br prodes of the national institute for space research inpe which provides information regarding deforestation from 1997 to 2013 provided the deforestation data used in this study the prodes is restricted to forested areas and excludes some savannah enclaves into the amazonian forests such as a large area of the maranhão state those areas are also excluded from this analysis considering the law enforcement efforts against deforestation that took place in 2008 brasil 2008 we choose to use deforestation until 2008 as our baseline data for training the models used to predict the deforestation rates we used the observed spatial distribution of deforestation during the period of 2009 2011 to validate the generated models we choose the deforestation until 2008 as baseline because in this year a law was implemented that created a public black list limiting the ability to obtain loans and generate business for persons and companies that have committed environmental crimes this law was a new paradigm in the fight against deforestation in brazil since it creates an effective economic mechanism reaching the main avenues of support for those engaged in deforestation agricultural loans for all analysis the area unit was a 1 km 1 km cell original deforestation data are polygons with very detailed spatial information following a conservative strategy to reduce spatial autocorrelation of this original data and redundant environmental data on the model s fit we used the geographic coordinates of the center point of each deforestation polygon derived from prodes for the studied period as a record of deforestation occurrence 2 3 functional variables in this study we defined the term functional to mean the set of variables that have direct effects on local deforestation we chose this term instead of environmental variables as used under the sdm approach since the term functional variables includes many socioeconomic variables and infrastructural elements this also helps to make clear the distinction between common sdm applications and our use of these concepts in relation to our purpose the functional variables have diverse sources mainly from public open brazilian government databases table 1 neighborhood effects are well documented as being important drivers of deforestation laurance et al 2002 soares filho and coutinho 2002 for instance a landowner is less prone to deforest in areas that are closer those embargoed by the government due to it being illegal to log in those areas or the areas being protected arima et al 2014 soares filho et al 2010 the inverse situation occurs with roads as areas closer to roads have a greater probability of being deforested than do areas that are farther away barber et al 2014 laurance et al 2002 as all variables used here are expected to exert neighborhood effects a grid raster of the distance to the closest source of the particular influence road protect areas embargoed areas was generated using arcgis 9 3 esri 2009 at a spatial resolution of 1 1 km considering the deforestation as a spatial process previous deforestation distribution could be a very important predictor of short term deforestation thus we evaluated the importance of the previous deforestation information in the model s efficiency by building models with and without this variable as a component of the functional variable dataset 2 4 modelling distribution of deforestation maxent we generated the potential areas of future deforestation using the maximum entropy maxent program version 3 3 phillips and dudík 2008 maxent is based on fitting functions closer to the uniform distribution of the occurrence points constrained to the environmental information elith et al 2011 thus maxent is a very simple presence background method that finds a combination of the functional variables that discriminate known occurrence points from the background variation in these variables the program needs only the input of the position in the geographic space where the deforestation occurred and the map of each functional variable producing as output a suitability map for deforestation moreover maxent allows for the selection of some features that determine the shape of the fit curve to the deforestation occurrence data in relation to different independent variables in this study we used the auto feature option in accordance to the results of a previous study on amazonian deforestation de souza and de marco 2014 the use of the automatic features allows the program to search for adjustments to more complex empirically derived curves but these models must contain a large number of parameters phillips et al 2006 maxent uses background information to generate its predictions and does not rely on true absences in its fitting process elith et al 2011 hastie and fithian 2013 we apply the default program parameter of 10 000 background points at random to represent the environmental variation throughout the study area it is assumed that deforestation is a spatially explicit and historical phenomenon this means that areas prone to be cleared may maintain its forest simply because there was not enough time to the deforestation frontier to reach this particular site the absence of the deforestation in this site is not a surrogate of the absence of the condition that favored deforestation but simple a historical non equilibrium this may include a bias in the estimation of a response curve for deforestation for regression based models such as logistic regression and glm and gam adaptations but have little effect in presence background methods such as maxent the conversion of the output maxent variable into a binary prediction of deforestation requires the choice of an appropriate threshold elith et al 2006 liu et al 2013 we use the limits derived from the receiver operation curve roc which balances the omission and commission errors fielding and bell 1997 referred in the maxent as maximum sensitivity plus specificity thus generating conservative estimates of the deforested areas 2 5 model evaluation we use two different approaches for model evaluation the first is the usual protocol for sdm studies based on the receiver operating curve approach roc nevertheless we present these results only descriptively with intent to comparison with other sdm studies the other evaluation method is a more specific measure of the predictive properties of the models based on the direct comparison of the model predictions and the real deforestation occurred three years after 2008 2009 2011 the evaluation of the distribution models is an area of intense research liu et al 2011 since maxent is a method that uses only presences the program adds pseudo absences to generate the confusion matrix needed for model evaluation we use the roc to produce an evaluation model for each species using the area under the curve auc as a descriptive measure auc values vary between 0 and 1 with 0 5 representing predictive values that are no better than chance recent studies have become more demanding and use amounts higher than 0 7 to indicate acceptable models elith et al 2006 swets 1988 despite the ubiquitous use of this metric in sdm literature it has been questioned due to the model s dependence on the prevalence allouche et al 2006 lobo et al 2008 as well as for how pseudo absences are selected liu et al 2011 in this study the auc was used only descriptively because the main objective was to evaluate the discriminatory ability of the models in predicting the deforestation that had occurred during the three years after the 2008 data 2009 2011 for the direct evaluation we built the confusion matrices based on the model predictions and the observed deforestation using the grid cell as a sampling unit we determined the sensitivity proportion of real deforestation that was corrected predicted positive predictive power ppp and prevalence fielding and bell 1997 of all of the deforestation models for 2009 2011 at the municipality level allowing for the evaluation of differences related to the distance to the deforestation frontiers the sensitivity was chosen as the metric for this analysis by representing the probability of deforestation found within the predicted area of the models the positive predictive value was the probability that a predicted unit area was cleared the following year the ppp is a surrogate to effort the command and control actions role against deforestation the prevalence might be related to sensitivity simply as a mathematical consequence mcpherson et al 2004 if the model predicts large distributional areas it will always have a high level of sensitivity thus the best model might be one that has the higher level of sensitivity but a lower prevalence we are especially interested on evaluate how heterogeneity of socioeconomic states and development is related to the efficiency to predict amazonian deforestation we based our analysis on a general framework on the spatial distribution of amazonian deforestation rates and its most important socioeconomic causes and consequences related to the development of a deforestation frontier rodrigues et al 2009 this interpretation is entirely based on how economic forces and demands vary according to pre frontier and pos frontier areas we use this previous model to classify amazon municipalities into classes relating to the distance to the deforestation frontier this framework considered the deforestation activity and the extension of the deforested area until 2008 we employ a repeated measures analysis of variance approach anova zar 2010 with the municipality as the sample unit to evaluate the effect of position in relation to the frontier three pre frontier frontier and three pos frontier classes and the use of previous deforestation in the model on all evaluation metrics sensitivity ppp and prevalence the large number of replications with more than 800 municipalities generated an extremely high level of statistical power in this situation the statistical significance might be meaningless due to the demands for the interpretation of the effect size thus we presented the results of the statistical tests suggesting that they be used descriptively interpreting the results based on the confidence interval estimates and the effect sizes 3 results the auc values from the two sdms created in this study were usually higher than 0 7 and were always higher than the values that were expected by chance sensitivity of models only slightly increases from pre to post frontier areas but with the highest interval estimates in the last class fig 2 the sdm sensitivity values were particularly high where deforestation activity was most active and in the post frontier such as near the deforestation frontier the inclusion of previous deforestation in the models increase its sensitivity especially in the classes in classes where the natural vegetation cover was more preserved a c fig 2 this pattern of variation in sensitivity values was consistent in both the deforestation activity from 2011 and the total deforestation activity between 2009 and 2011 fig 2 the model including the distance from previous deforestation presented sensitivity values over 97 thus for every 10 pixels that were cleared between 2009 and 2011 at least nine could be correctly predicted using the sdm approach even if we only considered the deforestation activity from 2011 the average sensitivity was 71 fig 2 the model including the distance from previous deforestation also presented sensitivity values higher than did the analysis without this variable this result was similar to the validation analysis conducted using only deforestation data from 2011 however for the classes where there was more deforestation activity the difference between the sdm scenarios was not conspicuous positive predictive power ppp increases toward the post frontier areas both for deforestation prediction in 2011 and total deforestation 2009 2011 fig 2 however for deforestation prediction in 2011 the values were low and near 2 except for the most distant class area class g with a ppp value of approximately 8 as expected ppp values increases for the prediction for the cumulative deforestation between 2009 and 2011 with the largest ppp values of approximately 18 for the g class these results are similar for sdms built with and without previous deforestation as functional variable the prevalence of the models with and without previous deforestation did not indicate any significant difference compared between them the prevalence values of the models were similar when evaluated using the 2009 deforestation activity or when using the combined deforestation activity from 2009 to 2011 fig 2 nevertheless the total prevalence which is a surrogate of the potential deforestation area was close to 21 of the total area of the entire brazilian legal amazon these numbers included areas that are currently cleared excluding these areas our model predicted a future deforestation of an additional 6 of the brazilian legal amazon representing a large restriction for target conservation measures related to controlling deforestation rates fig 3 these potential deforestation areas which were not cleared yet were distributed along of region of the deforestation frontier usually these potential areas are fringes of consolidated deforested areas fig 3 additionally fig 3 highlighted eight hotspots of amazonian deforestation a h they show how it is possible to identify regions with higher concentration of pixels with higher predicted chance of deforestation to focus actions against deforestation these areas are mainly inside deforestation arc the region of rio branco in acre state and lábrea in amazonas state fig 3 area b north from rondônia state fig 3 area c apuí and humaíta south from amazonas state fig 3 area d mato grosso north fig 3 area e region from br 163 road considering the region of novo progresso in pará state pa fig 3 area f transamazônica road near the region of itaituba pa and santarém pa fig 3 area g however there are areas outside from deforestation arc as the far west from acre state fig 3 area a and left side of amazonas river near monte alegre pa and oriximiná pa fig 3 area h where old human settlements already cattle raise activities the central region of roraima state fig 3 area h not surprisingly all of these areas were focus of command control operations against deforestation by ibama between 2009 and 2010 one of these operations focus on area f novo progresso pa was the emblematic boi pirata ii with embargo of thousands livestock heads from deforestation areas 4 discussion amazon deforestation between 2009 and 2011 had at least an 80 chance of occurring within the potential areas predicted by the maxent models that were fitted using the information from 2008 this higher sensitivity combined with a similar observed prevalence to the reference models soares et al 2006 supported the claim that this constitutes a major advance in deforestation prediction the use of this model allowed for the concentration of efforts on preventive or command and control actions on only 21 of the total legal amazon area which might result in a major increase in the efficiency of these programs this result is particularly important considering difficulties in applying efficient prevention or control activities in an area of the size of the amazon region nepstad et al 2014 soares et al 2006 a similar prevalence between the various models of different municipality classes confirmed the effectiveness of the sdm approach as applied to this problem we also found that the inclusion of the distance from previous deforestation caused a significant increase in the sensitivity to predicting future deforestation consequently the model s accuracy was direct related to the distance to the deforestation frontier that in turn was related to the importance of previous deforestation on the prediction of the fate of the regional forest these results were similar to those of previous studies that evaluated part of the western amazon using the sdm approach de souza and de marco 2014 nevertheless here we expanded the previous observations to include the entire amazon region allowing for the evaluation of the existence of regional effects the amazon is very heterogeneous which is reflected in the distribution of deforestation activity in the region nevertheless the distance from the deforestation frontier was a good surrogate of the socioeconomic processes that determine the activity and extent of deforestation de souza et al 2013 rodrigues et al 2009 considering this the sdms demonstrated a higher sensitivity in almost all classes of deforestation frontier distance notably there was a greater sensitivity of the sdms for classes where deforestation was most active and recent near frontier areas recent frontier areas more hits better sensitivity occur exactly where we needed the deploy the most urgent actions against deforestation in the pre frontier and frontier municipalities increasing the usefulness of the sdm approach as a tool for deforestation prediction the spatial pattern of sensitivity variation also showed that previous deforestation was a more effective predictor in pre frontier municipalities where is not usual several deforestation areas this initially unexpected result was easily explained by two factors in these areas even a very small deforestation settlement increased the predictability of future deforestation events in addition variables such as the existence of previous deforestation were more effective predictors in these areas since other functional variables such as roads and urban areas were nearly absent the success of the modelling process relied on the choice of functional variables that could also act as surrogates for the broader economic social and political process that are known to be related to deforestation dalla nora et al 2014 de souza et al 2013 fearnside 2008 laurance et al 2002 martinelli et al 2010 variables such as roads livestock agriculture and urban areas are expected to be better predictors at the level of the deforestation frontiers in order to determine the level of deforestation activity laurance et al 2002 nepstad et al 2006 soares et al 2006 otherwise new deforestation areas have a tendency to occur near places where there has been previous deforestation activity forming adjacent cleared areas alves et al 2003 this trend occurs because the area that was previously cleared is often a surrogate for the occurrence of other factors that favor deforestation such as proximity to roads urban areas presence of crops and pastures and the absence of the command and control action in the region the intensity of the process is likely related to the increased number of single factors that occur in combination this strong relationship between new and previous deforestation activities favors the more accurate results of the sdm models that used the distance from previous deforestation areas as one of the functional variables otherwise the road itself is insignificant in and of itself but is a way to promote other impactful activities cattle timber in the forest moreover the two examples of variables strongly influence the occurrence of new deforestation in the models based in cellular automata scenarios soares et al 2006 it is possible that pursuing a modelling approach to provide long term predictions for amazonian deforestation is naïve since it is not expected that the economic system will maintain its exact process for 10 20 years because socioeconomic processes and political decisions can change over time and space it becomes necessary to monitor the evolution of these variables our approach is better suited for short term predictions of the spatial changes in deforestation rates the simplicity of use and the input of easy accessible public data make it possible to re build the sdm model every year allowing for good predictions for the near future this approach may lack the assumption of uniformity of the effect of the economic process over the course of a large span of time but it assumes that these processes are spatially homogeneous these properties of the maxent prediction fully serves the purpose of preventive surveillance as advocated by the new rif ibama 2009 and has a high level of sensitivity allowing for the modification of the variables to create different surveillance scenarios otherwise these results must open the possibility to increase the evaluation of other statistical methods previously used to model land use change especially the use of presence absence methods such as random forests and gam methods all those may represent more flexible and easy to use methods compared to the dynamica ego approach commonly use to amazonian deforestation problem in all cases the sdm models had a very low predictive power initially interpreted as model over prediction the sdm models produced predictions of areas that may be potentially deforested in the near future but with no pre determined time frame thus a low predictive power is obviously expected because we may not see the real effect until a number of years in the future this also represented that from a large set of potential areas of deforestation in amazon the current productive force in this field might select only a small subset the question of how short a time the short terms predictions derived from maxent would remain unsolved but it could be evaluated using the ability to predict new deforestations in the years to come regarding the new internal regulation surveillance of ibama rif ibama 2009 the low positive predictive value of power did not constitute a major problem for surveillance at least for ibama as they are not working on a pixel by pixel basis or on a deforestation by deforestation basis except for in critical areas however the decrease in the total surveillance area to approximately 21 through the use of sdm without disregarding previously cleared areas that will not be cleared again constituted a great advantage because of the decreased time spent on people in the field as well as cars helicopter hours and other resources the use of deforestation predictor models for improving the policies against deforestation in the brazilian amazon as command and control was an innovation because until now all of the approaches using these models did not have this intention studies of deforestation predictor models laurance et al 2002 soares et al 2006 have attempted to provide scenarios for an estimated area both currently and in the future trying to inform or and influence the decision makers however studies using models for law enforcement or economic policies are rare although there are studies in other forests such as in the sumatran rainforest with the intent of improving or evaluating law enforcement strategies against deforestation linkie et al 2010 this study in addition to using predictive models of deforestation to improve planning command and control operations was also innovative because it used a common methodology sdm for the distribution of species in order to assess the spatial distribution of potential deforestation although infrastructure features related to energy sources were not used in the construction of the study models we acknowledge that these features have been gaining importance in determining new deforestation in recent years excluding cattle and soybean farmers who deforested to generate goods directly for the consumer market nepstad et al 2006 explorations of oil pipelines and hydroelectricity and energy conveying lines that were planned and built in recent years in the amazon region have great potential for environmental and social impacts in the region if not adopted public policies finer et al 2008 finer and jenkins 2012 new models using the methods describe here designed to address the phenomenon of deforestation in the short and midterm should consider in addition to roads the variables that are related to infrastructure construction in the regions analyzed finally we consider that it is becoming clear that just command control actions are not enough to control deforestation in brazilian amazon but broad economic policies may have overweight key role in this process de souza and de marco 2015 the exhaustion of this deforestation combat model is now expressed in the recent trend of increase deforestation rates inpe 2016 models as those developed here are an important tool to improve the territorial planning of policies against deforestation besides its ability to a better relocation of the command control actions we highlight its importance in planning local proactive measures designed to foster cultural and economic changes that could prevent future deforestation 5 conclusion we have shown that a sdm approach is able to produce accurate models for short term spatial prediction of deforestation in brazilian amazon those modes presented higher sensitivity and similar observed prevalence compared to the reference models soares et al 2006 which turn they more efficient to guide command control actions against deforestation nevertheless model results have highlighted the heterogeneity of the prediction success in relation to the distance from the deforestation frontier this measure should be considered a main surrogate of the socioeconomic processes that generate deforestation rodrigues et al 2009 higher model sensitivity in near frontier areas resulted from the spatial autocorrelation of the process deforestation in the future occurs mostly near present deforestation this is a good news because it represent a higher prediction success exactly where the need for policies to stop deforestation are most need acknowledgements we thank laerte ferreira vincent nedelec and natalia torres for their comments on an early draft of this manuscript and werner gonçalves for support in

25183,species are typically comprised of a large number of genotypes some of which are rare rare genotypes that are temperature sensitive will predictably be impacted by climate change more profoundly than common genotypes for which gene expression does not depend on temperature computer simulations were used in this study to analyze the impact of changing temperatures on a very rare melanic morph that expresses a temperature sensitive phenotype and is found in an abundant fish species gambusia holbrooki this numerical model assesses the frequency of the two natural color morphs silver and black spotted over time and iterates in each generation incorporating survival estimates for different life stages based upon data collected during empirical experiments using the current projections for mean surface temperature increase which are 2 5 f to 10 4 f by the year 2100 the impact of warming environment on the mosquitofish population was analyzed three different climate warming scenarios were used to address annual temperature fluctuations and incorporate predicted temperature rise at correspondingly minimal mid and maximum levels our results indicate that increasing temperatures will seriously affect the rare color morph and in some cases will result in extinction the minimal climate warming scenario produced lower extinction risks for the rare morph however it still decreased the frequency of the rare genotype to minimal values the mid range warming scenario produced a higher risk of extinction while the maximum warming scenario resulted in the extinction of the rare color morph the results of this study shed light on the possibility that the effects of climate change may have important ramifications for rare genotypes in nature and will likely drive some rare species genotypes to extinction keywords temperature sensitive genotypes natural selection computer simulations mosquitofish melanic morph 1 introduction the earth s climate has changed since the preindustrial era and is projected to continue to change throughout the 21 st century global mean surface temperature is projected to increase over the next 100 years by up to 10 4 f and it has already warmed by 1 3 f over the 20th century ipcc 2007 correlations between observed changes in climate and many factors such as survival population size and distribution reproduction time and migration have been documented thomas et al 2004 studies using mid range climate warming scenarios and sample regions covering about 20 of earth s terrestrial surface indicate that an estimated 15 37 of species and taxa in the studied regions may go extinct by 2050 this impact is anticipated to be greater if changes in climate are more extreme thomas et al 2004 recently the thermal sensitivity of 2960 ray finned fishes to future climatic exposure was investigated to find that fish will either migrate adapt or die off as temperatures continue to warm this demonstrates that global patterns of vulnerability differ substantially between freshwater and marine realms comte and olden 2017 despite a voluminous literature on the impact of climate change freshwater ecosystems have been relatively poorly studied heino et al 2009 have shown that freshwater biodiversity is highly vulnerable to climate change with extinction rates and extirpations of freshwater species matching or exceeding those suggested for better known terrestrial taxa some evidence shows that freshwater species have exhibited range shifts in response to climate change in the last millennia centuries and decades the proportion of potential losers taxa becoming extinct ranged from zero species for snails to 33 of the regional species pool for dragonflies the set of potential winners taxa becoming colonizers was much larger ranging from 53 for amphibians to 61 for dragonflies rosset and oertly 2011 however these effects are typically species specific with cold water organisms being generally negatively affected and warm water organisms positively affected heino et al 2009 recent studies of freshwater invertebrates experimentally assessed the impact of altered temperature regimes on the emerging adults in aquatic insect communities experiments showed that mean body size decreased under warming conditions however the degree to which an organism s size was affected by temperature varied within and between taxa sardiña et al 2017 these changes show the potential for changed temperature regimes to impact ecological systems at individual population and community levels which in turn will affect the global biodiversity long term preservation of biodiversity requires an understanding of the resistance of different species to environmental stress and particularly the impact of changing temperatures on ecological systems the long time periods required to study the maintenance of rare genotypes in natural populations make numerical simulations an alluring option to field study when assessing long term changes in biological systems here we use numerical simulations to assess the impact of climate change on persistently rare genotypes in nature as well as the populations that harbor them we focus this study on eastern mosquitofish gambusia holbrooki which have a natural body color polymorphism wherein the rare morph is black spotted and the common one is silver mosquitofish are small live bearing freshwater fish that were commonly and widely introduced in us in early 1900s by the former u s public health service in large part because they were thought of as an effective and inexpensive way to control mosquitoes krumholz 1948 more recent studies on mosquito control have not supported the view that gambusia are particularly effective in reducing mosquito populations or in reducing the incidence of mosquito borne diseases courtenay and meffe 1989 arthington and lloyd 1989 nevertheless mosquitofish are widely spread in atlantic and gulf slope drainages as far west as southern alabama and as far north as pennsylvania and new jersey eastern mosquitofish gambusia holbrooki is native to the southeastern united states and shares a hybrid zone with gambusia affinis western mosquitofish around mobile bay al the wild type coloration of both species is silver but small percentage of eastern mosquitofish express a rare but heritable melanic black spotted pattern that is not found in western mosquitofish the melanistic phenotype is almost entirely restricted to males and is inherited as a y chromosome linked single gene trait angus 1989 has shown that the y linked melanism allele m is temperature sensitive it is dominant with high penetrance when fish are raised at 22 c penetrance is much reduced to about 42 when fish are raised under warmer conditions 26 c 29 c angus 1989 later horth 2006 has shown that in some populations 80 of males born to melanic sires turn melanic after at least 12 weeks of cold exposure this expression pattern may result from the activation of a temperature sensitive enzyme e g tyrosine hydroxylase king et al 1991 however as horth stated melanic inheritance is more complex than can be entirely resolved from the experimental design of this work some populations have inducible melanism others constitutive therefore more than one genotype produces the melanic phenotype horth 2006 in the short term genetic variability is often less critical than other determinants of population persistence lande 1988 but over time it can play the decisive role in allowing a population to persist and adapt in a changing environment lande and shannon 1996 as phenotypic expression of melanism in majority populations is directly affected by temperature and the consequence of loss of expression of melanism is the loss of fitness for the black male phenotype genotype the increasing temperatures as a result of climate change will directly affect melanic population horth and panayotova 2012 have shown that the persistence of the rare melanic morph is maintained through negative frequency dependent selection negative frequency dependent selection occurs when there is an advantage to being rare in a population but this advantage decreases when the rare genotype increases in frequency cain and sheppard 1954 ford 1975 sinervo and lively 1996 although negative frequency dependence contributes to the persistence of melanic mosquitofish as well as rare color morphs in other live bearing fish a rise in temperature will probably change the dynamics of this stable polymorphism rodd et al 2002 the goal of this work is to use numerical simulations to study the long term effects of temperature changes predicted for the southeastern u s on the rare melanic morph and the mosquitofish population three different climate change scenarios were modeled minimal 4 f mid range 8 f and maximum climate warming scenarios 10 f all relative fitness parameters for the two color morphs used in the simulations were obtained from empirical studies addressing natural selection horth and travis 2002 horth et al 2010 2 methods and materials 2 1 algorithm the algorithm used in the simulations schematically illustrated in fig 1 models the life cycle of mosquitofish and was originally introduced in horth and panayotova 2012 simulations are initiated in august of year 1 when the largest pulse of young are born all fish are born silver but eighty percent of f1 males born to melanic sires turn melanic after at least 12 weeks of cold exposure horth 2006 this is incorporated in the model in december since that is about the time when fish born during the warmer months would express cold induced melanism differential survival of the two morphs which is contingent upon the frequency of melanic individuals in the population is invoked in april horth and travis 2002 differential survival related to predation is incorporated into the model in july when the abundance of predators is high in nature a differential birth rate is incorporated in the model in august when the largest pulse of young is born in nature the simulated population is then culled if it exceeded a carrying capacity and color morphs are culled proportionately in september the end of life mortality is invoked as adults die off after reproduction this completes the life cycle of the fish and thus one generation of selection all remaining individuals juveniles maturing into adults would then undergo differential selection regimes contingent upon their color as the next iteration of the model ensues to investigate the impact of climate change on the rare melanic morph and the mosquitofish population the original model was modified as follows simulations were initiated in august with 10 000 individuals an initial frequency of 0 06 was used for the population frequency of the melanic morph since this was the equilibrium value at which the melanic morph stabilized in previous simulations horth and panayotova 2012 next the melanic inheritance rate applied in december was considered as a parameter meaning that it was varied in different simulation runs to simulate different case scenarios that may result from the exposure of the rare morph to different environmental temperatures relative winter mortality was applied in april and relative effects of predation was applied in july in august the relative birth rates were applied for new f1 juveniles the carrying capacity of 100 000 individuals was checked and proportionate culling of the color morphs was applied if necessary in september annual mortality for adults alive for one year was applied approximating a natural age structure by the subsequent april f1 juvenile fish matured and expressed their final body color in july these f1 fish experienced differential predation the model iterated for 10 000 total generations the initial population size of 10 000 individuals was selected because this allowed for population growth and seasonal fluctuation in population size reflective of real world dynamics the maximum population size 100 000 individuals was based upon field observations and population size estimates for some lakes studied horth and travis 2002 stewart and miura 1985 to incorporate novel autosomal mutation one in 106 fish born to silver parents mutates to melanic and one in 107 fish born to a melanic mutates to silver however this may be conservative as most novel mutations are recessive schlager and dickie 1967 one iteration of the model was equivalent to one calendar year which reflects one generation for these fish simulations were run for 10 000 generations the model was written in matlab mathworks ver 7 10 0 499 r2010a and all figures were created in matlab 2 2 parameters equations and their derivations from empirical studies as the equilibrium frequency for the melanic morph population was found to be 0 06 the parameter for the initial frequency of population level melanism was set to 0 06 horth and panayotova 2012 the birth rate was set to 2 3 percent which was acquired from empirical work horth 2006 survivorship for melanic males was 0 81 when the population level frequency of melanism was 0 033 and survivorship was 0 47 when population level melanism was 0 083 horth and travis 2002 based upon these data and additional lab studies we assumed linear functional dependence between the two color morphs survival rates horth et al 2010 therefore to represent survival mathematically in our model we assumed the two linear equations that best fit our data silver survival rate 0 05 frequency of melanic males 0 01452 0 033 freq mel males 0 0 033 0 04 frequency of melanic males 0 02582 0 05 freq mel males 0 033 0 083 melanic survival rate 0 81 freq mel males 0 0 033 0 05172 0 34 frequency of melanic males 0 05 freq mel males 0 033 0 083 mathematically the effect of predation on the above equations would be to alter the frequency of surviving silver and melanic fish relative differences in survival during predation for the two color morphs were taken from empirical trials with three different predators horth 2004 for this work we used the empirical data and determined a relative predation ratio of 17 melanic 83 silver males all fish are born silver but about 80 of f1 males born to melanic sires would express melanic color after about 12 weeks of cold exposure as this fish lives generally in tropical climate areas increasing mean surface temperatures as a result of climate change will shorten the length of cold water exposure and cause melanic response to vary to explore the sensitivity of the melanic morph population to the increasing temperatures melanic inheritance was considered as a parameter called latter inheritance parameter and assumed to vary inversely with respect to temperature meaning that as mean temperature increases the percentage of fish turning melanic decreases this assumption is based on the study by angus 1989 who observed that the percentage of melanic expression in the black patterned rate morph decreased when the fish were raised in warmer environmental temperatures based on the 2007 ipcc fourth assessment report three different climate change scenarios were explored minimal mid range and maximum climate warming scenario ipcc 2007 for the minimal climate warming scenario it was assumed that the mean temperature will rise by 4 f over the next 100 year for the mid range an 8 f increase was assumed and for the maximum range scenario a 10 f average increase was assumed in addition for each climate warming scenario four different relationships between inheritance parameter and increasing temperatures were considered particularly 1 2 5 and 5 change in melanic inheritance parameter per each degree fahrenheit change in temperature year one of the model was initiated with the average low winter temperature of 42 f derived as the mean low winter temperature for northern florida for the last 10 years national oceanic and athmospheric administration noaa 2015 to model natural fluctuations in temperature from year to year matlab s random number function was utilized and the standard deviation for the temperature in florida 0 9fo maul and sims 2007 was used this stochastic process created annual temperatures that increase or decrease from year to year while simultaneously a gradual steady increase in average temperature occurs over a 100 year period according to the minimal mid or maximum warming scenarios after that a stabilized mean temperature was assumed and total of 10 000 years were simulated 3 results 3 1 minimal climate warming scenario three different relationship scenarios for the dependence of the inheritance parameter on cold temperature exposure were assessed particularly 1 2 5 and 5 decrease in the melanic inheritance per 1 f increase in mean surface temperature was assumed fig 2 illustrates the result when 1 decrease in inheritance parameter of the melanic morphs per 1 f temperature change was assumed the change in the inheritance parameter for the melanic morph varied according to fig 2 c correlated to the mean temperature variation given in fig 2 d all simulations were initiated with the 0 06 melanic morph frequency which was the equilibrium value for this color morph as it can be seen in fig 2 a melanic frequency decreased significantly to a level slightly higher than 0 05 over the first 100 years when the mean temperature increased to about 46 f silver fish populations were not affected by the increasing temperatures as it was mentioned by heino et al 2009 the effects of climate warming are species specified with cold water organisms being generally negatively affected and warm water organisms positively affected our simulations support that statement even though the mosquitofish is a warm water organism melanic morph needs certain cold exposure for the expression of the melanism and hence it is negatively affected by the general temperature increase as fig 3 shows when 2 5 decrease in the inheritance parameter was assumed per each degree change in temperature the melanic frequency stabilized at an even lower level of about 0 04 see fig 3 b while with a 5 decrease melanic morph became extinct for about 100 years see fig 3 c any further decrease in the inheritance parameter resulted in extinction of the melanic morph for a shorter period of time 3 2 mid range climate warming scenario to simulate a mid range climate warming scenario it was assumed that temperature will increase on average with 8 degrees fahrenheit over the next 100 years raising the low average temperature from 42 f to 50 f as depicted in fig 4 a if there is 1 decrease in melanic inheritance per every degree of temperature increase melanic morph stabilized at a significantly lower frequency of about 0 043 any further decrease in the inheritance parameter resulted in extinction of the rare color morph see fig 4 b and c 3 3 maximum climate warming scenario to simulate a maximum climate warming scenario it was assumed that temperature will increase on average with 10 degrees fahrenheit over the next 100 years raising the low average temperature from 42 f to 52 f in this case scenario simulations show that even a slight decrease in the melanic inheritance will have a significant impact on the rare melanic morph as we can see in fig 5 a melanic morph frequency stabilized at 0 033 the lowest frequency that this morph occurs at in nature when an 1 decrease in the inheritance parameter was assumed any further decrease in the inheritance parameter resulted in the extinction of the melanic fish population fig 5 b and c 4 conclusions and discussions heat resistance which is important for adapting to temperature change is known to be especially high in gambusia al habbib and yacoob 1993 however numerical simulations performed in this study show that silver and melanic morphs will be affected very differently by the increasing temperatures as a result of climate change even the most conservative estimates for climate warming scenarios will have a significant impact on the melanic population who may even go extinct despite this our simulations also suggest that if temperature stabilizes before melanic mosquitofish go extinct their population may recover to some degree in contrast the model shows that the silver mosquitofish population steadily increases and reaches the carrying capacity natural selection acts differentially on silver and melanic eastern male mosquitofish melanic mosquitofish are subjected to a lower predation rate and higher recapture rate in nature than silver males horth 2004 and negative frequency dependent survival is also associated with melanism in this species horth and travis 2002 however when concerning heat resistance melanism appears to be disadvantageous in addition melanic males have reduced survival and reproduction rates compared to the silver morph the consequence of loss of melanism is the loss of fitness for the black male phenotype genotype while the primary focus of this study was mosquitofish many fish insects mice and other vertebrates have temperature sensitive enzymes basau et al 2002 king et al 1991 an enormous array of insects and vertebrates have dark coloration as a result of melanin expression and temperature often plays a key role in this expression true et al 1999 in siamese and burmese cats temperature sensitive alleles result in a face mask and dark pigmentation on extremities lyons et al 2005 temperature sensitive alleles also affect melanic expression in fruit flies o grady and desalle 2000 and mice kwon et al 1989 different colored grasshoppers choose different habitats relating to heating of the body ahnesjo and forsman 2006 temperature also affects melanic expression in zebrafish kulkeaw et al 2011 and crickets fedorka et al 2013 our study provides an insight about the possible long term effects of increasing temperatures on the melanic mosquitofish population but this study can also be applied to other organisms that display similar phenotypes that depend upon temperature sensitive enzymes our simulations suggest that continued climate change resulting in further mean temperature increase will be devastating to populations dependent on temperature sensitive enzymes for phenotypic expression patterns which in turn will seriously impact ecological systems and global biodiversity studies aiming at furthering our knowledge about predicting the responses of freshwater species to climate variables are particularly important as such information is needed to accommodate freshwater biodiversity in the changing climate and associated environmental changes 
25183,species are typically comprised of a large number of genotypes some of which are rare rare genotypes that are temperature sensitive will predictably be impacted by climate change more profoundly than common genotypes for which gene expression does not depend on temperature computer simulations were used in this study to analyze the impact of changing temperatures on a very rare melanic morph that expresses a temperature sensitive phenotype and is found in an abundant fish species gambusia holbrooki this numerical model assesses the frequency of the two natural color morphs silver and black spotted over time and iterates in each generation incorporating survival estimates for different life stages based upon data collected during empirical experiments using the current projections for mean surface temperature increase which are 2 5 f to 10 4 f by the year 2100 the impact of warming environment on the mosquitofish population was analyzed three different climate warming scenarios were used to address annual temperature fluctuations and incorporate predicted temperature rise at correspondingly minimal mid and maximum levels our results indicate that increasing temperatures will seriously affect the rare color morph and in some cases will result in extinction the minimal climate warming scenario produced lower extinction risks for the rare morph however it still decreased the frequency of the rare genotype to minimal values the mid range warming scenario produced a higher risk of extinction while the maximum warming scenario resulted in the extinction of the rare color morph the results of this study shed light on the possibility that the effects of climate change may have important ramifications for rare genotypes in nature and will likely drive some rare species genotypes to extinction keywords temperature sensitive genotypes natural selection computer simulations mosquitofish melanic morph 1 introduction the earth s climate has changed since the preindustrial era and is projected to continue to change throughout the 21 st century global mean surface temperature is projected to increase over the next 100 years by up to 10 4 f and it has already warmed by 1 3 f over the 20th century ipcc 2007 correlations between observed changes in climate and many factors such as survival population size and distribution reproduction time and migration have been documented thomas et al 2004 studies using mid range climate warming scenarios and sample regions covering about 20 of earth s terrestrial surface indicate that an estimated 15 37 of species and taxa in the studied regions may go extinct by 2050 this impact is anticipated to be greater if changes in climate are more extreme thomas et al 2004 recently the thermal sensitivity of 2960 ray finned fishes to future climatic exposure was investigated to find that fish will either migrate adapt or die off as temperatures continue to warm this demonstrates that global patterns of vulnerability differ substantially between freshwater and marine realms comte and olden 2017 despite a voluminous literature on the impact of climate change freshwater ecosystems have been relatively poorly studied heino et al 2009 have shown that freshwater biodiversity is highly vulnerable to climate change with extinction rates and extirpations of freshwater species matching or exceeding those suggested for better known terrestrial taxa some evidence shows that freshwater species have exhibited range shifts in response to climate change in the last millennia centuries and decades the proportion of potential losers taxa becoming extinct ranged from zero species for snails to 33 of the regional species pool for dragonflies the set of potential winners taxa becoming colonizers was much larger ranging from 53 for amphibians to 61 for dragonflies rosset and oertly 2011 however these effects are typically species specific with cold water organisms being generally negatively affected and warm water organisms positively affected heino et al 2009 recent studies of freshwater invertebrates experimentally assessed the impact of altered temperature regimes on the emerging adults in aquatic insect communities experiments showed that mean body size decreased under warming conditions however the degree to which an organism s size was affected by temperature varied within and between taxa sardiña et al 2017 these changes show the potential for changed temperature regimes to impact ecological systems at individual population and community levels which in turn will affect the global biodiversity long term preservation of biodiversity requires an understanding of the resistance of different species to environmental stress and particularly the impact of changing temperatures on ecological systems the long time periods required to study the maintenance of rare genotypes in natural populations make numerical simulations an alluring option to field study when assessing long term changes in biological systems here we use numerical simulations to assess the impact of climate change on persistently rare genotypes in nature as well as the populations that harbor them we focus this study on eastern mosquitofish gambusia holbrooki which have a natural body color polymorphism wherein the rare morph is black spotted and the common one is silver mosquitofish are small live bearing freshwater fish that were commonly and widely introduced in us in early 1900s by the former u s public health service in large part because they were thought of as an effective and inexpensive way to control mosquitoes krumholz 1948 more recent studies on mosquito control have not supported the view that gambusia are particularly effective in reducing mosquito populations or in reducing the incidence of mosquito borne diseases courtenay and meffe 1989 arthington and lloyd 1989 nevertheless mosquitofish are widely spread in atlantic and gulf slope drainages as far west as southern alabama and as far north as pennsylvania and new jersey eastern mosquitofish gambusia holbrooki is native to the southeastern united states and shares a hybrid zone with gambusia affinis western mosquitofish around mobile bay al the wild type coloration of both species is silver but small percentage of eastern mosquitofish express a rare but heritable melanic black spotted pattern that is not found in western mosquitofish the melanistic phenotype is almost entirely restricted to males and is inherited as a y chromosome linked single gene trait angus 1989 has shown that the y linked melanism allele m is temperature sensitive it is dominant with high penetrance when fish are raised at 22 c penetrance is much reduced to about 42 when fish are raised under warmer conditions 26 c 29 c angus 1989 later horth 2006 has shown that in some populations 80 of males born to melanic sires turn melanic after at least 12 weeks of cold exposure this expression pattern may result from the activation of a temperature sensitive enzyme e g tyrosine hydroxylase king et al 1991 however as horth stated melanic inheritance is more complex than can be entirely resolved from the experimental design of this work some populations have inducible melanism others constitutive therefore more than one genotype produces the melanic phenotype horth 2006 in the short term genetic variability is often less critical than other determinants of population persistence lande 1988 but over time it can play the decisive role in allowing a population to persist and adapt in a changing environment lande and shannon 1996 as phenotypic expression of melanism in majority populations is directly affected by temperature and the consequence of loss of expression of melanism is the loss of fitness for the black male phenotype genotype the increasing temperatures as a result of climate change will directly affect melanic population horth and panayotova 2012 have shown that the persistence of the rare melanic morph is maintained through negative frequency dependent selection negative frequency dependent selection occurs when there is an advantage to being rare in a population but this advantage decreases when the rare genotype increases in frequency cain and sheppard 1954 ford 1975 sinervo and lively 1996 although negative frequency dependence contributes to the persistence of melanic mosquitofish as well as rare color morphs in other live bearing fish a rise in temperature will probably change the dynamics of this stable polymorphism rodd et al 2002 the goal of this work is to use numerical simulations to study the long term effects of temperature changes predicted for the southeastern u s on the rare melanic morph and the mosquitofish population three different climate change scenarios were modeled minimal 4 f mid range 8 f and maximum climate warming scenarios 10 f all relative fitness parameters for the two color morphs used in the simulations were obtained from empirical studies addressing natural selection horth and travis 2002 horth et al 2010 2 methods and materials 2 1 algorithm the algorithm used in the simulations schematically illustrated in fig 1 models the life cycle of mosquitofish and was originally introduced in horth and panayotova 2012 simulations are initiated in august of year 1 when the largest pulse of young are born all fish are born silver but eighty percent of f1 males born to melanic sires turn melanic after at least 12 weeks of cold exposure horth 2006 this is incorporated in the model in december since that is about the time when fish born during the warmer months would express cold induced melanism differential survival of the two morphs which is contingent upon the frequency of melanic individuals in the population is invoked in april horth and travis 2002 differential survival related to predation is incorporated into the model in july when the abundance of predators is high in nature a differential birth rate is incorporated in the model in august when the largest pulse of young is born in nature the simulated population is then culled if it exceeded a carrying capacity and color morphs are culled proportionately in september the end of life mortality is invoked as adults die off after reproduction this completes the life cycle of the fish and thus one generation of selection all remaining individuals juveniles maturing into adults would then undergo differential selection regimes contingent upon their color as the next iteration of the model ensues to investigate the impact of climate change on the rare melanic morph and the mosquitofish population the original model was modified as follows simulations were initiated in august with 10 000 individuals an initial frequency of 0 06 was used for the population frequency of the melanic morph since this was the equilibrium value at which the melanic morph stabilized in previous simulations horth and panayotova 2012 next the melanic inheritance rate applied in december was considered as a parameter meaning that it was varied in different simulation runs to simulate different case scenarios that may result from the exposure of the rare morph to different environmental temperatures relative winter mortality was applied in april and relative effects of predation was applied in july in august the relative birth rates were applied for new f1 juveniles the carrying capacity of 100 000 individuals was checked and proportionate culling of the color morphs was applied if necessary in september annual mortality for adults alive for one year was applied approximating a natural age structure by the subsequent april f1 juvenile fish matured and expressed their final body color in july these f1 fish experienced differential predation the model iterated for 10 000 total generations the initial population size of 10 000 individuals was selected because this allowed for population growth and seasonal fluctuation in population size reflective of real world dynamics the maximum population size 100 000 individuals was based upon field observations and population size estimates for some lakes studied horth and travis 2002 stewart and miura 1985 to incorporate novel autosomal mutation one in 106 fish born to silver parents mutates to melanic and one in 107 fish born to a melanic mutates to silver however this may be conservative as most novel mutations are recessive schlager and dickie 1967 one iteration of the model was equivalent to one calendar year which reflects one generation for these fish simulations were run for 10 000 generations the model was written in matlab mathworks ver 7 10 0 499 r2010a and all figures were created in matlab 2 2 parameters equations and their derivations from empirical studies as the equilibrium frequency for the melanic morph population was found to be 0 06 the parameter for the initial frequency of population level melanism was set to 0 06 horth and panayotova 2012 the birth rate was set to 2 3 percent which was acquired from empirical work horth 2006 survivorship for melanic males was 0 81 when the population level frequency of melanism was 0 033 and survivorship was 0 47 when population level melanism was 0 083 horth and travis 2002 based upon these data and additional lab studies we assumed linear functional dependence between the two color morphs survival rates horth et al 2010 therefore to represent survival mathematically in our model we assumed the two linear equations that best fit our data silver survival rate 0 05 frequency of melanic males 0 01452 0 033 freq mel males 0 0 033 0 04 frequency of melanic males 0 02582 0 05 freq mel males 0 033 0 083 melanic survival rate 0 81 freq mel males 0 0 033 0 05172 0 34 frequency of melanic males 0 05 freq mel males 0 033 0 083 mathematically the effect of predation on the above equations would be to alter the frequency of surviving silver and melanic fish relative differences in survival during predation for the two color morphs were taken from empirical trials with three different predators horth 2004 for this work we used the empirical data and determined a relative predation ratio of 17 melanic 83 silver males all fish are born silver but about 80 of f1 males born to melanic sires would express melanic color after about 12 weeks of cold exposure as this fish lives generally in tropical climate areas increasing mean surface temperatures as a result of climate change will shorten the length of cold water exposure and cause melanic response to vary to explore the sensitivity of the melanic morph population to the increasing temperatures melanic inheritance was considered as a parameter called latter inheritance parameter and assumed to vary inversely with respect to temperature meaning that as mean temperature increases the percentage of fish turning melanic decreases this assumption is based on the study by angus 1989 who observed that the percentage of melanic expression in the black patterned rate morph decreased when the fish were raised in warmer environmental temperatures based on the 2007 ipcc fourth assessment report three different climate change scenarios were explored minimal mid range and maximum climate warming scenario ipcc 2007 for the minimal climate warming scenario it was assumed that the mean temperature will rise by 4 f over the next 100 year for the mid range an 8 f increase was assumed and for the maximum range scenario a 10 f average increase was assumed in addition for each climate warming scenario four different relationships between inheritance parameter and increasing temperatures were considered particularly 1 2 5 and 5 change in melanic inheritance parameter per each degree fahrenheit change in temperature year one of the model was initiated with the average low winter temperature of 42 f derived as the mean low winter temperature for northern florida for the last 10 years national oceanic and athmospheric administration noaa 2015 to model natural fluctuations in temperature from year to year matlab s random number function was utilized and the standard deviation for the temperature in florida 0 9fo maul and sims 2007 was used this stochastic process created annual temperatures that increase or decrease from year to year while simultaneously a gradual steady increase in average temperature occurs over a 100 year period according to the minimal mid or maximum warming scenarios after that a stabilized mean temperature was assumed and total of 10 000 years were simulated 3 results 3 1 minimal climate warming scenario three different relationship scenarios for the dependence of the inheritance parameter on cold temperature exposure were assessed particularly 1 2 5 and 5 decrease in the melanic inheritance per 1 f increase in mean surface temperature was assumed fig 2 illustrates the result when 1 decrease in inheritance parameter of the melanic morphs per 1 f temperature change was assumed the change in the inheritance parameter for the melanic morph varied according to fig 2 c correlated to the mean temperature variation given in fig 2 d all simulations were initiated with the 0 06 melanic morph frequency which was the equilibrium value for this color morph as it can be seen in fig 2 a melanic frequency decreased significantly to a level slightly higher than 0 05 over the first 100 years when the mean temperature increased to about 46 f silver fish populations were not affected by the increasing temperatures as it was mentioned by heino et al 2009 the effects of climate warming are species specified with cold water organisms being generally negatively affected and warm water organisms positively affected our simulations support that statement even though the mosquitofish is a warm water organism melanic morph needs certain cold exposure for the expression of the melanism and hence it is negatively affected by the general temperature increase as fig 3 shows when 2 5 decrease in the inheritance parameter was assumed per each degree change in temperature the melanic frequency stabilized at an even lower level of about 0 04 see fig 3 b while with a 5 decrease melanic morph became extinct for about 100 years see fig 3 c any further decrease in the inheritance parameter resulted in extinction of the melanic morph for a shorter period of time 3 2 mid range climate warming scenario to simulate a mid range climate warming scenario it was assumed that temperature will increase on average with 8 degrees fahrenheit over the next 100 years raising the low average temperature from 42 f to 50 f as depicted in fig 4 a if there is 1 decrease in melanic inheritance per every degree of temperature increase melanic morph stabilized at a significantly lower frequency of about 0 043 any further decrease in the inheritance parameter resulted in extinction of the rare color morph see fig 4 b and c 3 3 maximum climate warming scenario to simulate a maximum climate warming scenario it was assumed that temperature will increase on average with 10 degrees fahrenheit over the next 100 years raising the low average temperature from 42 f to 52 f in this case scenario simulations show that even a slight decrease in the melanic inheritance will have a significant impact on the rare melanic morph as we can see in fig 5 a melanic morph frequency stabilized at 0 033 the lowest frequency that this morph occurs at in nature when an 1 decrease in the inheritance parameter was assumed any further decrease in the inheritance parameter resulted in the extinction of the melanic fish population fig 5 b and c 4 conclusions and discussions heat resistance which is important for adapting to temperature change is known to be especially high in gambusia al habbib and yacoob 1993 however numerical simulations performed in this study show that silver and melanic morphs will be affected very differently by the increasing temperatures as a result of climate change even the most conservative estimates for climate warming scenarios will have a significant impact on the melanic population who may even go extinct despite this our simulations also suggest that if temperature stabilizes before melanic mosquitofish go extinct their population may recover to some degree in contrast the model shows that the silver mosquitofish population steadily increases and reaches the carrying capacity natural selection acts differentially on silver and melanic eastern male mosquitofish melanic mosquitofish are subjected to a lower predation rate and higher recapture rate in nature than silver males horth 2004 and negative frequency dependent survival is also associated with melanism in this species horth and travis 2002 however when concerning heat resistance melanism appears to be disadvantageous in addition melanic males have reduced survival and reproduction rates compared to the silver morph the consequence of loss of melanism is the loss of fitness for the black male phenotype genotype while the primary focus of this study was mosquitofish many fish insects mice and other vertebrates have temperature sensitive enzymes basau et al 2002 king et al 1991 an enormous array of insects and vertebrates have dark coloration as a result of melanin expression and temperature often plays a key role in this expression true et al 1999 in siamese and burmese cats temperature sensitive alleles result in a face mask and dark pigmentation on extremities lyons et al 2005 temperature sensitive alleles also affect melanic expression in fruit flies o grady and desalle 2000 and mice kwon et al 1989 different colored grasshoppers choose different habitats relating to heating of the body ahnesjo and forsman 2006 temperature also affects melanic expression in zebrafish kulkeaw et al 2011 and crickets fedorka et al 2013 our study provides an insight about the possible long term effects of increasing temperatures on the melanic mosquitofish population but this study can also be applied to other organisms that display similar phenotypes that depend upon temperature sensitive enzymes our simulations suggest that continued climate change resulting in further mean temperature increase will be devastating to populations dependent on temperature sensitive enzymes for phenotypic expression patterns which in turn will seriously impact ecological systems and global biodiversity studies aiming at furthering our knowledge about predicting the responses of freshwater species to climate variables are particularly important as such information is needed to accommodate freshwater biodiversity in the changing climate and associated environmental changes 
25184,the mosquito aedes albopictus is a competent vector for more than 25 arboviruses including dengue and zika and the sole vector for the 2014 unprecedented dengue outbreak in southern china due to the lack of a deep understanding of how its seasonal abundance is tied to environments current methods have failed to control its prevalence and expansion on a large scale in this paper we develop a comprehensive model of difference equations that incorporates mosquito age at the four developmental stages egg diapause larval density competition and the meteorological data for temperature precipitation and humidity to predict the mosquito abundance over time in southern china the generated temporal profile is robust against the variation of initial inputs and matches well with the measurements in a northeast district in guangzhou in 2013 and 2014 with a correlation coefficient r 2 0 9511 we find that chemical interventions have only a temporary effect once the intervention is terminated mosquito population bounces back quickly moreover improper adulticide applications facilitate a fast spread of insecticide resistance the resistance spread is quantified and the optimal intensity and frequency of chemical interventions are simulated these findings remain to be tested by more real data and our methods can be adapted to other geographic areas and or mosquito species for designing better mosquito control strategies keywords aedes albopictus population dynamics age stage structure insecticide resistance 1 introduction the asian tiger mosquito aedes albopictus is notoriously the most invasive insect with a global distribution estrada franco and craig 1995 it is a competent vector for more than 25 arboviruses including dengue and zika baldacchino et al 2015 the 2014 unprecedented dengue outbreak in guangdong province china with 45 171 reported cases has put ae albopictus under the spotlight cheng et al 2016 meng et al 2015 wang et al 2017 due to the lack of commercially available vaccines for either dengue or zika current disease control methods focus on suppressing the prevalence of vectors and their capacity to transmit viruses baldacchino et al 2015 faraji and unlu 2016 source reduction appears to be the most prioritized approach for ae albopictus control estrada franco and craig 1995 meng et al 2015 but the continual creation of ubiquitous larval sources due to the warm and humid weather has made this approach very challenging in southern china applying insecticides has remained a primary strategy in china with more than 250 million kg of insecticides being sprayed annually since 1997 in the campaign to combat the 2014 dengue outbreak more than 27 000 kg of pyrethroids were used for ultra low volume spraying in over 3291 km2 of land in guangzhou along with massive human resources and funds 30 million us dollars wang et al 2017 chemical interventions provide a rapid but not sustainable suppression of mosquito populations due to the evolutionary plasticity and ecological adaptability insecticide application has facilitated ae albopictus to develop insecticide resistance baldacchino et al 2015 although the knowledge of its biology has been greatly enhanced and many control methods have been developed the prevalence and expansion of ae albopictus have not been effectively controlled on a large scale faraji and unlu 2016 the population dynamics of the invasive species is tightly tied to climatic conditions temperature and rainfalls in particular in southern china the population of ae albopictus follows essentially the same yearly growth pattern liu et al 1992 yan et al 2010 when the rainy and warm season starts in the middle of march the adult population emerges due to the hatching of diapausing eggs and grows rapidly until reaching a peak in late may or early june it then decreases for one to two months mainly due to the density induced larval death in hot summer the moderate temperature in the fall helps the population bounce back and reach the second peak in september or october after which the abundance decays sharply and eventually vanishes in dry winter it remains unclear and highly non trivial to understand how the climatic conditions interplay with ae albopictus to regulate its population dynamics monaghan et al 2018 petrić et al 2017 wang et al 2016 a deep understanding is essential to help integrate current knowledge and translate it into more effective control approaches and recognize the correlation between mosquito borne diseases and the growth or decline of vector populations cailly et al 2012 cheng et al 2016 jia et al 2016 juliano 2007 tran et al 2013 in this work we develop a mathematical model of difference equations that tracks the daily mosquito abundances of eggs larvae pupae and adults with the age specified in each stage the basic idea underlying our model is rather simple the number of eggs of age n 1 is increased by oviposition the numbers of mosquitoes of age n 1 in other stages are increased by stage transitions and the numbers of mosquitoes of age n 1 are decreased due to mortality the inclusion of ages and the four life stages presents a novel feature of our model comparing to the difference equation models of mosquito populations in the literature see li 2013 li and li 2018 and the references therein in addition the delicate effect of weather conditions on the survival and transition rates egg diapause and the density restriction in the larval stage are integrated into equations in our model both the time variable t and the age variable n have day as their unit it provides a convenient and transparent incorporation of the meteorological data for temperature and precipitation and the experimental data that are often recorded on a daily basis it also allows us to define explicitly the time period for egg diapause and specify precisely the developmental stage durations that were often overlooked in most mathematical models based on an extensive review of current knowledge on mosquito biology we estimate the seasonal oviposition rate and daily transition and survival rates that change with the environmental conditions egg diapause is treated by dividing each year into unfavorable and favorable seasons during which eggs are discriminated by different daily survival and hatching rates the density restriction on larval growth is elaborated by analyzing the nonlinear dependence of the threshold larval density on temperature and precipitation and its linear dependence on larval resources the simulated temporal profile of adult abundances is robust against the variation of the initial input and matches well with the experimental data collected in a northeast district in guangzhou in 2013 and 2014 it captures critical features commonly observed in previous surveillance in guangzhou we find that chemical interventions can only temporarily suppress the mosquito population a significant but not perfect suppression of mosquito population by chemical interventions within one year brings on almost negligible impact in subsequent years by incorporating a resistance gene with a recessive trait at a single locus of two alleles in our model we show that the control efficacy does not always increase in the intensity or the frequency of adulticide application we further identify the optimal intensity and frequency of chemical interventions to maximize the control efficacy our model can be extended to other geographic areas and or different mosquito species by modifying the system parameter values for designing better mosquito control strategies 2 the model 2 1 basic framework in their life cycle aedes mosquitoes undergo four developmental stages egg e larva l pupa p and adult a eggs hatch to larvae which after four sub stages grow into pupae and adults emerge from the mature pupae the first three stages are largely aquatic and the adults are terrestrial in our model we use difference equations to track daily cohorts of mosquitoes in all stages with age included in each stage to account for their different responses to environments the survival pressure due to population density is the severest for larvae among all stages lord 1998 and the temperature is crucial for egg hatching but is not essential for egg survival khatchikian et al 2010 let s denote a generic stage s e l p a the experimental data in the past two decades suggest that eggs larvae pupae and adults are almost evenly distributed in sex this motivates us to assume the 1 1 sex ratio in all stages and count only female individuals the number of mosquitoes on stage s of age n on a given day t is denoted by s n t where n 1 and t 0 are integers the number in the next day s n 1 t 1 is reduced from s n t due to death or stage transitions let s 1 denote the preceding stage of s meaning that e 1 a l 1 e p 1 l and a 1 p the newborn mosquitoes on the next day counted by s 1 t 1 are accumulated from transition of mosquitoes in the stage s 1 of various ages on day t these considerations set the basic framework of our model in the following equations 2 1 s n 1 t 1 daily survival rate 1 daily stage transition rate s n t 2 2 s 1 t 1 n 1 daily stage transition rate s 1 n t when s a the term daily stage transition rate or oviposition rate needs to be removed in 2 1 because oviposition does not cause the death of the mother for mathematical convenience we introduce a characteristic function as follows let a b be two non negative real numbers we define 2 3 1 a b x 1 x a b 0 x a b 2 2 eggs we begin with the equation of e 1 t 1 for newborn eggs it was observed that ae albopictus females took their first blood meals two days after emergence and the first gonotrophic cycle after a blood meal lasted three to five days at a warm temperature estrada franco and craig 1995 let m t denote the average daily oviposition rate for adult females in their oviposition period then 2 2 gives 2 4 e 1 t 1 n 5 30 m t a n t to set the equation of e n 1 t 1 by 2 1 we include egg diapause as a major factor determining the survival and hatch rates egg diapause is a stable state of hatching arrest that occurs when embryonic development has been completed but the fully formed first instar larva remains within the chorion of the egg vinogradova 2007 it is mainly induced by photoperiod and low temperature and the arrest will not be terminated until the reactivation of development by favorable climate conditions as in the temperate zones in europe and north america ae albopictus in guangzhou experiences high larval and almost complete adult mortality during winter and survives winter as diapausing eggs liu et al 1992 yan et al 2010 we divide each year into unfavorable and favorable seasons depending on whether or not the eggs laid within the season are diapausing unfavorable or non diapausing favorable in guangzhou few adults are found in january and february and most eggs produced from mid october to december diapause due to short photoperiod and low temperature liu et al 1992 yan et al 2010 we define the period from mid october to the end of february as the unfavorable season and the rest as the favorable season to incorporate this division in our model we let t 1 correspond to january 1st of the first year of our consideration and assume that the first unfavorable season begins at t 0 0 in the previous year and continues until day t 1 0 365 the favorable season starts from t 1 1 and ends at t 2 365 t 0 and t 2 365 is in the unfavorable season again we set the average daily survival rate at 0 96 for regular eggs as measured in erickson et al 2010 liu et al 1992 tran et al 2013 and denote by h 1 t their hatching rates depending on temperature we increase the daily survival rates of diapausing eggs within the unfavorable season to 0 99 the difference between 0 96 and 0 99 does not show much apparent statistical significance by themselves however given that an unfavorable season lasts at least 3 months our calculation shows that diapausing eggs are at least 15 times more likely to survive a whole unfavorable season we enumerate eggs older than one day in the first year by 2 5 e n 1 t 1 0 99 e n t t 0 t 1 and n t t 0 or t t 2 365 and n t t 2 0 96 1 h 1 t e n t otherwise this applies to subsequent years provided that t 1 and t 2 are replaced with corresponding starting and ending dates of the favorable season when t 0 t 1 and n t t 0 the season is unfavorable and the egg is laid within the time interval t 0 t and therefore diapausing a similar conclusion can be made when t t 2 365 and n t t 2 overall the first case in 2 5 covers all surviving diapausing eggs in the unfavorable season the second case in 2 5 covers non diapausing eggs in the whole year and diapausing eggs within the favorable season they share the same survival rates 0 96 and their hatching is mainly driven by temperature and precipitation 2 3 larvae by using 2 2 we derive the equation for newborn larvae in the first year 2 6 l 1 t 1 n t t 0 1 h 1 t e n t t 0 t 1 n 1 h 1 t e n t t t 1 t 2 n t t 2 1 h 1 t e n t t t 2 365 note carefully that the three summations differ only at the starting date in accordance with the assumption that diapausing eggs do not hatch during the unfavorable season specified in the first and third cases to count the number of larvae of age n 2 we need to determine the dependence of the daily larval survival and pupation rates on age temperature precipitation and more importantly the larval density the density restriction on survival and pupation which presents a major technical obstacle in our study is of our special consideration in contrast to eggs and pupae larvae are not sustainable and their survival is sensitive to its population size for ae albopictus in guangzhou the major factors causing the death of the 1st and 2nd instar larvae are density dependent liu et al 1992 it has been commonly observed that larvae pupation starts only after 5 days and lasts for about 17 to 23 days delatte et al 2009 lee 1994 hence we count larvae of age n 23 only and let 2 7 l t n 1 23 l n t record the total number of larvae on day t we let f d l denote the density dependent daily pupation rate at optimal temperature and let f 1 t be the factor quantifying the impact of temperature on pupation by averaging the pupation rate over n 6 23 we formulate the daily pupation rate as 2 8 f n l t 1 6 23 n f 1 t f d l at low density survival of aedes larvae is mostly affected by temperature and foods at high density larvae become vulnerable to die from overcrowding effect in breeding sites we assume that temperature and density affect larvae survival independently and let μ l t and μ d l denote the separate effects on the daily survival rate by applying 2 1 and including the combined effect of temperature and density we obtain 2 9 l n 1 t 1 μ l t μ d l 1 f n l t l n t the density dependent daily survival rate μ d l and daily pupation rate f d l our formulation is motivated by several key properties of various experimental observations and further elaborated by testifying the accuracy of data fitting it has been observed that when other environmental conditions are stable there is a critical larval density over which the larval mortality rate increases dramatically and the pupation is delayed significantly lee 1994 liu et al 1992 maciá 2009 we introduce a threshold value κ for larval survival and pupation the survival and pupation rates are density independent when l κ but are reduced when l κ we insert κ into the continuous density dependent functions 2 10 μ d l min 1 κ l α f d l min 1 κ l β where α and β are two positive constants measuring the respective intensity of density restriction on larval survival and pupation the two functions in 2 10 differ only in the powers α and β the larger the intensities α and β are the more severely the survival and pupation rates are reduced at higher density l κ 2 4 pupae substituting the pupation rate defined in 2 8 into 2 2 gives the number of newly developed pupae 2 11 p 1 t 1 n 6 23 f 1 t f d l l n t inside their cocoons pupae take 1 to 10 days to emerge into adult mosquito form as the effect of precipitation and the larval density on the pupation rate has been incorporated in 2 10 we include temperature as the only factor besides the age of pupae controlling the emergence rate let μ p be the daily survival rate constant of pupae and g 1 t be the temperature dependent emergence rate then 2 1 gives 2 12 p n 1 t 1 μ p 1 1 2 10 n g 1 t p n t 2 5 adults an adult emerges from a mature pupa as it floats on the water surface from the definition of g 1 t and 2 12 we count the number of the newly emerged adults as 2 13 a 1 t 1 n 2 10 g 1 t p n t let μ a be the daily survival rate constant of adults then the whole set of equations in our model ends with the simplest one 2 14 a n 1 t 1 μ a a n t 3 estimation of daily transition rates and parameters let γ γ t be the daily transition rate including hatching pupation and eclosion when the temperature is kept at constant t and other environmental conditions remain optimal let γ k be the observed accumulated transition rate in k days we first present a short protocol for estimating γ from γ k for 1 i k let γ i denote the fraction of transformed individuals within the original population on the ith day and ψ i the fraction of surviving and untransformed individuals after i days with a daily survival rate constant μ γ1 μγ and ψ 1 μ 1 γ by applying the same transition and survival rates on ψ 1 on the second day we obtain ψ 2 μ 1 γ ψ 1 ψ 2 1 and γ 2 μ γ ψ 1 γ 1 ψ 1 on the ith day we have by induction ψ i μ 1 γ ψ i 1 ψ i 1 and γ i γ 1 ψ i 1 γ 1 ψ i 1 1 the accumulated transition rate γ k γ1 γ2 γ k is given by γ k γ 1 1 ψ 1 ψ k 1 1 γ 1 1 ψ k 1 1 ψ 1 by substituting γ1 μγ and ψ 1 μ 1 γ into these expressions we derive 3 1 ψ k μ k 1 γ k and γ k μ γ 1 μ k 1 γ k 1 μ 1 γ for a given daily survival rate μ 0 1 as γ increases from 0 to 1 the expression on the right side of 3 1 increases from 0 to μ conversely if γ k 0 μ is known for some k 1 then 3 1 determines implicitly a unique transition rate γ 0 1 3 1 the daily egg hatching rates our estimation of the daily hatching rate γ t h 1 t is mainly based on the data from lee 1994 for a laboratory ae albopictus strain in taiwan supplemented by the data in delatte et al 2009 in the indian ocean and our observations in guangzhou in lee 1994 various hatching percentages at different ages were measured at six temperatures 15 c 20 c 24 c 28 c 32 c and 36 c we include the temperature dependent accumulated hatching rates in the 2nd row of table 1 and the corresponding durations of observation in the 3rd row the hatching activity at 10 c was not tested in lee 1994 we take the data from delatte et al 2009 and list γ k 4 4 with k 90 in table 1 when using these data to estimate h 1 t by the fundamental relation 3 1 we take μ 0 96 as suggested by erickson et al 2010 tran et al 2013 the temperatures below 10 c are excluded in our calculation because of the extremely lower rates of egg hatching and larva survival delatte et al 2009 the estimated daily egg hatching rates are listed in row 4 in table 1 by substituting these rates into 3 1 we obtain ψ 15 the proportions of surviving and unhatched eggs on day 15 and list them in row 5 by polynomial fitting h 1 t is well approximated by 3 2 h 1 t 1 10 03 38 5 0 002341 t 4 0 1967 t 3 5 771 t 2 72 58 t 322 2 with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 9882 3 2 the rates of larval survival pupation and adult emergence we take μ l t 0 for t 10 4 c or t 40 c as immatures are usually not able to survive further than the first instar below 10 4 c or above 40 c to estimate μ l t for t 10 4 40 we first compute μ l t at several temperatures by multiplying the survival rates within the four instar stages l1 l2 l2 l3 and l3 l4 from delatte et al 2009 and then use quadratic interpolation to derive the approximation 3 3 μ l t 1 10 4 40 0 4043 t 2 20 008 t 151 88 with r 2 0 94948 we again use the experimental data of lee 1994 and list in rows 2 and 3 of table 2 the accumulated pupation rates γ l and the corresponding days of observation at 15 c 20 c 24 c 28 c 32 c and 36 c because the effect of temperature on larva survival is characterized by μ l t we fix μ 1 in 3 1 for the estimation of γ t f 1 t a polynomial fitting gives with r 2 0 99297 the good approximation 3 4 f 1 t 1 13 96 37 20 0 02054 t 3 1 269 t 2 21 9 t 114 3 the estimation of g 1 t follows the same procedure as for f 1 t described above we again fix μ 1 in 3 1 because all pupae are changed into adults within two days at the optimal temperature 28 c see rows 5 and 6 in table 2 a polynomial fitting against the daily emergence rates listed in the 7th row yields with r 2 0 9673 3 5 g 1 t 1 14 52 38 65 0 6916 t 2 36 77 t 388 3 3 the remaining rates that are geographically specific our model is formulated by 2 4 2 14 and the rate functions 3 2 3 5 for its broader application we have left several geographical parameters undetermined to simulate the annual abundance of mosquitoes in local areas in guangzhou we now fix these parameters in the order of their introduction the oviposition rate m t introduced in 2 4 is strongly seasonal influenced the measurements in guangzhou by liu et al 1992 showed that the average number of eggs laid by one female adult was about 224 5 in spring march to may 113 35 in summer june to august 28 36 in autumn september to november and almost none in winter december to february by distributing these numbers evenly in the days within each month we set m t 8 4 1 0 from spring to winter the threshold value κ defined in 2 10 for larval survival and pupation changes with temperature and increases in the number of breeding sites and the volume of filled water in these sites the creation of new breeding sites in wild areas is largely contributed by rainfall the monthly distribution of breeding sites for ae albopictus in several suburban areas of guangzhou was surveyed by yan et al 2010 over the years 2004 2009 they quantified their extensive survey by the combined larval density index which characterizes the likelihood of finding a breeding site with living larvae within a unit studying area the mean value d i of the indices for the ith month in the six years was reported table 1 in yan et al 2010 the monthly average of the indices over the six years is d 1 d 2 d 12 12 5 96 it was found that d i 5 96 for 4 i 9 april to september d i 5 96 in other months and d i took the maximum 8 56 in august in our simulation we will use the total number of eggs in the area at t 1 denoted by e 0 as the main initial condition which increases and decreases with the size of the studying area at the same rate we assign κ a single value in each month and assume it to be proportional to both e 0 and d i it was observed in liu et al 1992 that the egg number is about 150 per bowl in january while the average number of larvae in a year is about 30 per bowl the yearly average number of larvae in the whole area is therefore approximately e 0 5 taking these considerations together we assume 3 6 κ 12 d i e 0 5 d 1 d 2 d 12 1 i 12 by analyzing the laboratory data in lee 1994 and the field data in liu et al 1992 we set α β 0 18 for the density restriction intensities on larval survival and pupation when larvae were overcrowded both studies lee 1994 and liu et al 1992 showed that the survival and pupation rates were severely reduced however as α and β quantify the change on a daily basis while the waiting time for pupation in higher densities can be more than 20 days large magnitude intensities for α and β are less consistent with our analysis we take μ p 0 97 for the daily survival rate constant of pupae in 2 9 and μ a 0 92 for the daily survival rate of adults in 2 14 these rate constants are stable and similar values have been observed worldwide erickson et al 2010 liu et al 1992 tran et al 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 the simulation setup and the robustness against perturbations of initial data we use our model via matlab to simulate the abundance of ae albopictus in local areas in guangzhou we set t 1 on january 1 2013 and let t run through daily temperatures in guangzhou from 2013 to the end of 2016 china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc nmic cn we set a uniform age limit n 365 for all mosquito stages which causes at most a minor error in the number of eggs in 2014 2016 since almost no adult mosquitoes and few larvae and pupae are observed in non residential areas in winter liu et al 1992 yan et al 2010 we let l n 1 p n 1 a n 1 0 it is rather challenging to determine e n 1 as mentioned in the introduction of 3 6 we let e 0 0 denote the total number of eggs in the studying area on january 1 2013 its value changes with the size of the area at the same rate and is therefore undetermined if the area size is unknown even if e 0 could be well estimated the initial age distribution of eggs can hardly be determined hopefully our analysis below shows that the population dynamics generated by our model is largely invariant under the perturbation of e n 1 which allows us to take e n 1 with a considerable arbitrariness let e 0 106 and distribute the ages evenly in 365 days with e n 1 e 0 365 1 n 365 then the number of mosquitoes s n t of age 1 n min t 365 can be obtained from our model at each stage s e l p a on any day from 2013 to 2016 the total number of adults on day t defined by 4 1 a t n 1 min t 365 a n t is shown in fig 1 a for 1 t 1460 in fig 1b we change the age structure of the eggs on day 1 from e n 1 106 365 1 n 365 blue curve to e 1 1 106 and e n 1 0 2 n 365 red curve despite the huge variation in the age structure the change in the adult abundances is nearly negligible in the first six months in 2013 and the temporal profiles after june 2013 are virtually identical the same was observed in our simulations with various other variations of the age structure showing that the population dynamics generated by our model is robust against perturbations of initial data 4 2 the population dynamics scales with the inhabiting area to examine how the mosquito abundance changes with the size of the studying areas we compare the mosquito numbers in two regions ω1 and ω2 with the same environmental conditions but different areas ω1 and ω2 let c ω2 ω1 let e 0 be the total number of eggs on day 1 in ω1 then the initial egg number in the other region ω2 is ce 0 denote by s n t e 0 and s n t ce 0 the respective mosquito numbers in ω1 and ω2 with the same distribution of egg ages on day 1 in the two regions we have e n 1 ce 0 ce n 1 e 0 and s n 1 e 0 s n 1 ce 0 0 for s l p a and our numerical simulations show that the proportionality is maintained for all n and t 4 2 s n t ce 0 cs n t e 0 1 n 365 1 t 1460 indeed we can prove this equality by mathematical induction which follows essentially from the proportionality of κ and e 0 given in 3 6 clearly the equality in 4 2 holds for t 1 assume that it holds for t 1 then the larvae numbers defined in 2 7 satisfy l t ce 0 n 1 23 l n t ce 0 c n 1 23 l n t e 0 c l t e 0 as shown by 3 6 the threshold value κ is proportional to the initial egg number it then follows that κ l t takes the same value in ω1 and ω2 in turn the nonlinear functions μ d l t and f d l t defined in 2 10 are invariant in the two regions consequently the equality in 4 2 is lifted from t to t 1 for s l by 2 9 for s p by 2 11 and 2 12 for s a by 2 13 and 2 14 and finally for s e by 2 4 and 2 5 the proof of 4 2 is thus completed on two different days t 1 t 2 1 4 2 also implies 4 3 s n t 1 ce 0 s n t 2 ce 0 s n t 1 e 0 s n t 2 e 0 provided that the denominators are positive the two equalities in 4 2 and 4 3 show that the mosquito abundance changes with the size of the studying area proportionally but the population dynamics remains the same this invariance is essential a major criterion indeed for the usefulness of our mathematical modelling approach 4 3 the precision of data fitting and typical features of the wild ae albopictus annual abundance in guangzhou the invariance shown in 4 3 remains valid if the daily mosquito numbers on two different days are replaced by the total numbers in two different time periods for instance for the twelve months in a given year and a t defined in 4 1 a i t the i th month a t t the year a t i 1 2 12 are invariant in different local regions and determine the monthly distribution of the adult mosquitoes in the year these numbers are graphed in fig 2 blue bars for 2013 and 2014 interestingly the output of our model matches well with the experimental data collected in conghua district in northeast guangzhou in the two years yellow bars in fig 2 data were courteously provided by our collaborators ziqiang yan and xiaoying zheng with a correlation coefficient 0 9511 two sample t test it shows that our model predicts rather precisely the population dynamics of wild ae albopictus in guangzhou in response to climate change from year to year the annual abundances in fig 1a display some recognizable differences from 2013 to 2016 however they follow essentially the same growth pattern and capture several critical features commonly observed in the surveillance of wild a albopictus population in guangzhou liu et al 1992 yan et al 2010 during the winter and early spring few adults are observed in the field or by our simulation when the rainy and humid season starts in the middle of march while the temperature is also rising the adult population emerges and grows rapidly due to the outbreak of diapausing egg hatching the sharp increase persists until late may or early june when the adult population reaches a peak it is then followed by a long period of decrease from one to two months in the summer likely due to hot temperature and density induced larval death after the decay ends the population bounces back and continues to grow until reaching the second peak in september or october after which the abundance decays sharply and eventually vanishes in winter 4 4 robustness of the population dynamics the discussion above shows that the population dynamics generated by our model is robust against the perturbation on the age structure of eggs in the winter we now use further simulations to demonstrate the robustness under larger magnitude perturbations we first manipulate the dynamics in the first half of a year and test how the manipulation affects the dynamics in the second half of the same year as shown in fig 3 a and b the original abundance of adult mosquitoes without intervention the curve in black in 2014 is pulled down severely by three separate manipulation strategies to the red blue and magenta curves up to the end of june the original peak abundance is reduced separately by more than 60 80 and 90 in the three colored curves in fig 3a and by more than 35 60 and 80 in fig 3b the abundance reduction in fig 3a is made in our simulation by mimicking the application of adulticides and decreasing the adult survival rate μ a in 2 14 by 10 20 and 30 respectively from april 1 to june 30 for three months the abundance reduction in fig 3b is achieved similarly in our simulation by mimicking the application of larvicides and decreasing the larval survival rate μ l in 2 9 by 10 20 and 30 respectively in the same time period surprisingly in spite of the various effective mosquito controls in april may and june the adult abundance starts growing as long as the intervention is stopped and restores very quickly to reach the same peak within a month after which the abundance is virtually invariant we move forward to explore what could be expected in the future if the mosquito density is reduced significantly within a whole year for this purpose we reduce the adult survival rate μ a fig 3c or the larval survival rate μ l fig 3d by 10 20 and 30 respectively during the mosquito active season from april 1 to september 31 in 2013 as shown in fig 3c and d the adult abundances in 2013 are suppressed significantly in particular the magenta curve in fig 3d indicates that decreasing the larval survival rate μ l by 30 results in 80 decrease of the adult density again it is surprising to see that the extensive intervention in 2013 makes merely a negligible difference in fig 3c or nearly no difference in fig 3d for 2014 it suggests a rather pessimistic finding that a significant but not perfect suppression of adult or larval mosquito population within one year does not bring on much impact on the abundance of mosquitoes in subsequent years 4 5 an extension of the model with chemical interventions environmental management commonly known as source reduction appears to be the single most effective approach for controlling ae albopictus thus far available estrada franco and craig 1995 meng et al 2015 it involves the elimination or reduction of vector breeding sources to disrupt the immature mosquito life cycle unlike ae aegypti that may spend their lifetime in or around the houses ae albopictus has become adapted to a wider range of habitats including rural suburban and urban environments whose control becomes more challenging and requires coverage of larger areas including the forest faraji and unlu 2016 yan et al 2010 in guangzhou the warm and humid weather helps create a vast number of mosquito breeding sites in artificial and natural containers such as leaf litter and tree holes that are often cryptic and hardly accessible the creation of ubiquitous larval sources increasing and decreasing on a continual basis makes source reduction a very difficult approach for mosquito control yan et al 2010 while source reduction should be prioritized the use of insecticides has remained a primary strategy for mosquito control in china with more than 250 million kg of insecticides being sprayed annually since 1997 meng et al 2015 during outbreaks of mosquito borne disease extensive application of chemicals has provided a rapid and effective intervention to interrupt disease transmission pyrethroids are the most commonly used adulticides because of their high insecticidal potency at low dosages their rapid knockdown effects and their low mammalian toxicity in the campaign to combat the 2014 dengue outbreak in guangzhou more than 27 000 kg of pyrethroids were used for ultra low volume spraying in over 3291 km2 of land along with massive human resources and funds 30 million us dollars invested by the local government meng et al 2015 wang et al 2017 spraying insecticides as a primary mosquito control strategy is facing more and more challenges pyrethroids the only adulticides allowed in europe and extensively used worldwide are toxic to non target insects and aquatic invertebrates which inevitably causes ecological imbalance baldacchino et al 2015 the efficacy of chemicals in ae albopictus control can be largely reduced due to the wide range of hidden breeding sites that neither ground nor aerial application can cover completely more devastatingly the use of insecticides is jeopardized by increasing insecticide resistances among ae albopictus populations owing to the imposed selection pressure resistance to pyrethroids and larvacides have been documented in asia china malaysia and thailand africa cameroon central and south america brazil and caribbean islands and europe italy greece la reunion vontas et al 2012 an insecticide resistance gene rdl allele was detected in ae albopictus collected in la reunion back to 2008 tantely et al 2010 recently wang et al 2017 tested the susceptibility of ae albopictus specimens collected from four districts in guangzhou to various insecticides among the pyrethroids they found that the mortality rates after exposure of the four populations to deltamethrin 0 1 for one hour were ranging from 40 to 80 in accordance with the guidance on interpreting the who bioassay test results these low rates are sufficient to confirm existence of resistant genes in these populations we extend our model to evaluate how a recurrent intervention by a single type of adulticides helps spread a resistant gene in a mosquito population and how the spreading of the resistance obstructs mosquito control our purpose is not to design the best strategy of insecticide application should it exist at all but rather to sketch the devastating consequence when insecticides are applied improperly we assume that the resistance is conferred by a recessive trait at a single gene with two alleles each allele has an initial probability p 0 p 0 0 1 to have the trait that confers resistance to the adulticide and a complementary probability 1 p 0 to have the trait that confers susceptibility the mosquito population in each stage consists of two homozygous groups s rr and s ss and one heterozygous group s rs where r stands for resistant and s for susceptible among adults only homozygous individuals with two resistant alleles confer resistance while the resistance in heterozygous individuals is masked by the dominant susceptible trait in our simulation we assume that a single type of adulticide is sprayed at ultra low volume from april 1 to october 31 within the active season of ae albopictus in guangzhou once in 15 days spraying pyrethroids at ultra low volume has been the most common strategy for ae albopictus control in guangzhou which kills susceptible adults rapidly in the affected areas but the effect usually decays to zero within the same day luz et al 2009 wang et al 2017 we assume that carrying the resistance trait in one or two alleles of the gene brings only negligible fitness cost mccart and buckling 2005 so the reproduction and stage transition rates remain the same for all three groups s rr s rs and s ss to integrate the elimination of adults by adulticides in our model we introduce the coverage rate c r 0 1 of chemical spraying as the probability that a susceptible adult which would otherwise survive under normal condition is killed on the day of insecticide application the rate c r 0 1 depends mostly on the coverage range of chemical application within the area of our study and also on other factors such as the type dosage droplet size of chemicals and air temperature humidity and wind we set t 1 on january 1 2013 and assume l n 1 p n 1 a n 1 0 as above it gives l rr n 1 l rs n 1 l ss n 1 0 and the same equalities for p and a as each allele in the genetic locus has a probability p 0 to have the resistance trait we use the hardy weinberg equilibrium to differentiate the initial egg number e n 1 into 4 4 e rr n 1 p 0 2 e n 1 e rs n 1 2 p 0 q 0 e n 1 e ss n 1 q 0 2 e n 1 where q 0 1 p 0 and 1 n 365 for t 1 we need to extend the equations from 2 4 to 2 14 to cover the three different genetic groups we discuss the extension of 2 5 2 14 first before presenting the hardest extension of 2 4 for oviposition of eggs in summary eqs 2 5 2 6 2 9 and 2 11 2 13 are extended simply by replacing s e l p a with s rr s rs and s ss respectively when we count the total number l t of larvae the summation in 2 7 needs to include l rr l rs and l ss the same pupation rate function in 2 8 and the larval density dependent competition function in 2 10 will be used so that larvae with different genetic forms in the two alleles compete together let t k 1 be the day from april 1 to october 31 on which the insecticide is applied the kth time when t t k the spraying of adulticides at ultra low volume has no impact on the death of adults and eq 2 14 is again extended by replacing a with a rr a rs and a ss the same is also true for resistant adults on the day of adulticide application and this simple extension for a rr remains valid even when t t k to reduce the number of susceptible adults that are eliminated by adulticides we integrate the coverage rate c r 0 into 2 14 and derive 4 5 a rs n 1 t k 1 μ a 1 c r a rs n t k a ss n 1 t k 1 μ a 1 c r a ss n t k in order to expand 2 4 to count the newborn eggs e rr 1 t 1 e rs 1 t 1 and e ss 1 t 1 we need to trace the genetic traits from the crossing male and female adults an egg inherits independently one trait with an equal probability 1 2 from the two alleles of the mother and one trait from the mating male denote by f the crossing female and m the crossing male there are nine different types of crossings between f rr f rs and f ss with m rr m rs and m ss the crossings between two homozygous adults produce only a single type of eggs as summarized by 4 6 f rr m rr e rr f rr m ss or f ss m rr e rs f ss m ss e ss the crossings between a homozygous adult and a heterozygous adult produce two types of eggs each with a probability 1 2 as shown by 4 7 f rr m rs or f rs m rr 12 e rr 12 e rs f ss m rs or f rs m ss 12 e rs 12 e ss finally the crossing between two heterozygous adults can produce all three types of eggs 4 8 f rs m rs 14 e rr 12 e rs 14 e ss analogous to 2 4 the egg number e rr 1 t 1 is increased by the production of f rr and f rs on day t if they mated with m rr and m rs before taking their first blood meal as some ae albopictus have been observed to take blood meals during their first day post emergence estrada franco and craig 1995 we assume that adults mate at age 1 therefore when counting the contribution of f rr n t and f rs n t on day t to the increase of e rr 1 t 1 we need to calculate the probabilities that they mated with m rr or m rs on day t n 1 one day after their emergence for a given f rr a female adult with two resistant alleles the probability that she mates with m rr on day t n 1 is calculated as the percentage of m rr among all male adults if all male adults up to age 30 are counted then the probability equals 4 9 p rr t n 1 k 1 30 m rr k t n 1 k 1 30 m k t n 1 m m rr m rs m ss by an obvious extension we can also define p rs t n 1 and p ss t n 1 when applying 4 9 we set m rr k t n 1 0 for t n 1 0 also if k 1 30 m k t n 1 0 then 4 9 is undefined in which case there are no adults for mating and we simply define p rr t n 1 0 as the numbers of males and females are assumed to be the same we may replace m with a when computing these probabilities by using 4 6 4 8 we extend 2 4 to for t 1 e rr 1 t 1 n 5 30 m t a rr n t p rr t n 1 p rs t n 1 2 n 5 30 m t a rs n t p rr t n 1 2 p rs t n 1 4 or by regrouping terms in the form 4 10 e rr 1 t 1 n 5 30 m t a rr

discussion above it is assumed that the resistant trait at the genetic locus brings no fitness cost or benefit to the hosting mosquitoes and no additional resistant loci are created by gene mutations therefore in the absence of chemical intervention c r 0 it is expected that the resistance frequency remains at the hardy weinberg equilibrium luz et al 2009 a rr t p 0 0 p 0 2 this equality is supported by our model mathematically and is manifested in fig 4 a for each of p 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 when the mosquito population is intervened by insecticides it is easy to envisage an increase of the resistance frequency but how it rises dynamically is unclear in fig 4 b the temporal profiles of a rr t p 0 c r are shown as a single type of adulticide is sprayed at ultra low volume at a moderate rate c r 0 6 from april 1 to october 31 once in 15 days corresponding to the four initial frequencies of homozygous resistant eggs p 0 2 0 01 0 04 0 09 0 16 a rr t p 0 0 6 exhibits a similar dynamics that spikes up on each day of adulticide application due to the elimination of susceptible adults it then decays in the following days to a level higher than the level preceding the last adulticide application overall the frequency is lifted respectively to a stabilized level 5 65 48 17 80 71 and 91 67 in november and december the lifting is apparently nonlinear and the magnitude is moderate if the initial frequency is small however when the initial resistance frequency exceeds 4 the 15 consecutive adulticide applications 15 days apart from april 1 to october 31 could induce a rather devastating consequence that about half or even more surviving adults have a resistant phenotype the catastrophic consequence of insecticide resistance when coupled with a recurrent application of the corresponding adulticides is further evidenced by its obstruction of mosquito control initiated from a resistance frequency 4 or p 0 0 2 our simulations indicate that the efficacy of mosquito control does not always increase in the intensity of adulticide application the best efficacy is attained around a medium coverage rate c r 0 5 and on average only about half of the adult abundance could be reduced during the mosquito active season the abundances a t 0 2 0 5 and a t 0 2 0 9 along with the abundance without chemical intervention the dashed black curve with c r 0 are shown in fig 4 c comparing with the lower rate c r 0 5 the high rate c r 0 9 drags down the abundance more effectively before august however by provoking a fast accumulation of resistant mosquitoes as shown more clearly in fig 4 d it pulls up the abundance back to a higher level after september 4 7 the control efficacy in the face of insecticide resistance we show further that the mosquito control efficacy by insecticide spraying does not always increase in the application frequency either in the face of insecticide resistance for this purpose we compute the efficacy defined by 1 the total number of surviving adults from april to october with control the total number of surviving adults from april to october without control for given initial resistance frequency p 0 2 the coverage rate c r and the constant time interval between two consecutive adulticide applications the efficacy values are shown in fig 5 a b for p 0 2 0 01 0 04 0 09 0 16 as in fig 4 a b c r 0 5 in fig 5 a c r 0 6 in fig 5 b and the adulticides are applied once in 1 3 5 31 days by analyzing the data in fig 5 we can make the following interesting and delicate observations i in the presence of insecticide resistance a more frequent application of the corresponding adulticides may not provide a better mosquito control than a less frequent application in all cases shown in fig 5 it is surprising to see that spraying the adulticides every day is not even as good as spraying it once in a month ii for each given p 0 2 and c r there exists an optimal control frequency by which the control efficacy is maximized these numbers are labeled in the figure for instance when p 0 2 0 04 and c r 0 5 the red curve in fig 5 a shows that it is optimal to apply the chemicals once in 9 days to reach the maximum efficacy 0 4590 that a 45 90 of adult populations is eliminated from april 1 to october 31 iii the maximum efficacy as we expect decreases in p 0 2 whereas the corresponding waiting days between two consecutive applications counter intuitively increases in p 0 2 it is subtle to predict from the data in fig 5 which coverage rate between c r 0 5 and c r 0 6 should be applied for p 0 2 0 04 0 09 0 16 the maximum control efficacy in fig 5a for c r 0 5 is slightly higher than that in fig 5b for c r 0 6 but needs more frequent chemical applications a practical option should take account of other factors such as the costs of labor and chemicals and the available human resources 5 conclusion the population dynamics of ae albopictus in southern china is modeled by a system of difference equations that track the daily abundances of mosquitoes of all ages in the four developmental stages the model elaborates the delicate impact of environmental conditions such as temperature and precipitation on the stage transition and survival egg diapause is embedded into the model by dividing each year into unfavorable and favorable seasons during which eggs are discriminated by different daily survival and temperature dependent hatching rates the density induced competition among larvae has been observed ubiquitously manifested by the existence of a threshold larval density over which the larval mortality rate increases dramatically and the pupation is delayed significantly lee 1994 liu et al 1992 maciá 2009 the density restriction is carefully elaborated by analyzing the nonlinear dependence of the threshold larval density on temperature and precipitation and its linear increase in the size and the number of breeding sites we proved that the mosquito abundance generated by our model in each stage scales with the size of the mosquito inhabiting area the simulated adult abundances are robust against the variation of the initial input and match extremely well with the experimental data collected in a northeast district in guangzhou in 2013 and 2014 the adult abundances display a growth pattern that captures several critical features commonly observed in previous surveillance in guangzhou including two apparent peaks one in late june and the other in late summer liu et al 1992 yan et al 2010 surprisingly we found that chemical interventions in spite of their prompt impact on mosquito control bring on only a temporary disturbance in the robust mosquito population dynamics the interventions before june may eliminate the first peak effectively but the adult abundance starts growing once the intervention is stopped and the second peak develops at the same magnitude also a significant but not perfect suppression of adult or larval mosquito population within one year brings on almost negligible impact on the adult abundance in subsequent years spraying insecticides has remained a primary strategy for mosquito control in china however the use of insecticides is jeopardized by increasing insecticide resistance owing to the imposed selection pressure wang et al 2017 by incorporating a resistance gene with a recessive trait at a single locus of two alleles we tested how adulticide applications facilitate the resistance spreading to the mosquito population our simulation shows that if more than 4 of eggs carry homozygous resistant trait in january then applying the corresponding adulticide alone from april 1 to october 31 15 days apart would lead to a devastating consequence that about half or even more surviving adults confer resistance in november we found that the efficacy of mosquito control does not always increase in the intensity or the frequency of adulticide application and estimated the optimal intensity and frequency of chemical interventions to maximize the control efficacy our analysis can be extended further by integrating other control methods such as source reduction ovitraps and spraying larvicides and adulticides with different modes of action in rotation or combination however due to the transient effect of insecticides and the widespread occurrence of insecticide resistance it is of an emergent need to seek more sustainable approaches to protect the global community from mosquito borne diseases there has been an increasing interest in using the endosymbiotic bacterium wolbachia to infect and suppress the wild population of aedes mosquitoes when a wild female mosquito crosses with a wolbachia infected male the infection can induce zygotic death and female sterility xi et al 2005 2006 since march 2015 massive wolbachia infected males have been released in both natural and residential areas in guangzhou where more than 95 of ae albopictus have been suppressed in our recent studies huang et al 2018 zheng et al 2014 2018 we have modelled population replacement and suppression of mosquitoes driven by wolbachia infection through differential equations by merging the methods developed in huang et al 2018 zheng et al 2014 2018 and the current study with our field trial data we plan to develop a protocol to search for the best strategy to limit insecticide resistance and suppress mosquito growth

25184,the mosquito aedes albopictus is a competent vector for more than 25 arboviruses including dengue and zika and the sole vector for the 2014 unprecedented dengue outbreak in southern china due to the lack of a deep understanding of how its seasonal abundance is tied to environments current methods have failed to control its prevalence and expansion on a large scale in this paper we develop a comprehensive model of difference equations that incorporates mosquito age at the four developmental stages egg diapause larval density competition and the meteorological data for temperature precipitation and humidity to predict the mosquito abundance over time in southern china the generated temporal profile is robust against the variation of initial inputs and matches well with the measurements in a northeast district in guangzhou in 2013 and 2014 with a correlation coefficient r 2 0 9511 we find that chemical interventions have only a temporary effect once the intervention is terminated mosquito population bounces back quickly moreover improper adulticide applications facilitate a fast spread of insecticide resistance the resistance spread is quantified and the optimal intensity and frequency of chemical interventions are simulated these findings remain to be tested by more real data and our methods can be adapted to other geographic areas and or mosquito species for designing better mosquito control strategies keywords aedes albopictus population dynamics age stage structure insecticide resistance 1 introduction the asian tiger mosquito aedes albopictus is notoriously the most invasive insect with a global distribution estrada franco and craig 1995 it is a competent vector for more than 25 arboviruses including dengue and zika baldacchino et al 2015 the 2014 unprecedented dengue outbreak in guangdong province china with 45 171 reported cases has put ae albopictus under the spotlight cheng et al 2016 meng et al 2015 wang et al 2017 due to the lack of commercially available vaccines for either dengue or zika current disease control methods focus on suppressing the prevalence of vectors and their capacity to transmit viruses baldacchino et al 2015 faraji and unlu 2016 source reduction appears to be the most prioritized approach for ae albopictus control estrada franco and craig 1995 meng et al 2015 but the continual creation of ubiquitous larval sources due to the warm and humid weather has made this approach very challenging in southern china applying insecticides has remained a primary strategy in china with more than 250 million kg of insecticides being sprayed annually since 1997 in the campaign to combat the 2014 dengue outbreak more than 27 000 kg of pyrethroids were used for ultra low volume spraying in over 3291 km2 of land in guangzhou along with massive human resources and funds 30 million us dollars wang et al 2017 chemical interventions provide a rapid but not sustainable suppression of mosquito populations due to the evolutionary plasticity and ecological adaptability insecticide application has facilitated ae albopictus to develop insecticide resistance baldacchino et al 2015 although the knowledge of its biology has been greatly enhanced and many control methods have been developed the prevalence and expansion of ae albopictus have not been effectively controlled on a large scale faraji and unlu 2016 the population dynamics of the invasive species is tightly tied to climatic conditions temperature and rainfalls in particular in southern china the population of ae albopictus follows essentially the same yearly growth pattern liu et al 1992 yan et al 2010 when the rainy and warm season starts in the middle of march the adult population emerges due to the hatching of diapausing eggs and grows rapidly until reaching a peak in late may or early june it then decreases for one to two months mainly due to the density induced larval death in hot summer the moderate temperature in the fall helps the population bounce back and reach the second peak in september or october after which the abundance decays sharply and eventually vanishes in dry winter it remains unclear and highly non trivial to understand how the climatic conditions interplay with ae albopictus to regulate its population dynamics monaghan et al 2018 petrić et al 2017 wang et al 2016 a deep understanding is essential to help integrate current knowledge and translate it into more effective control approaches and recognize the correlation between mosquito borne diseases and the growth or decline of vector populations cailly et al 2012 cheng et al 2016 jia et al 2016 juliano 2007 tran et al 2013 in this work we develop a mathematical model of difference equations that tracks the daily mosquito abundances of eggs larvae pupae and adults with the age specified in each stage the basic idea underlying our model is rather simple the number of eggs of age n 1 is increased by oviposition the numbers of mosquitoes of age n 1 in other stages are increased by stage transitions and the numbers of mosquitoes of age n 1 are decreased due to mortality the inclusion of ages and the four life stages presents a novel feature of our model comparing to the difference equation models of mosquito populations in the literature see li 2013 li and li 2018 and the references therein in addition the delicate effect of weather conditions on the survival and transition rates egg diapause and the density restriction in the larval stage are integrated into equations in our model both the time variable t and the age variable n have day as their unit it provides a convenient and transparent incorporation of the meteorological data for temperature and precipitation and the experimental data that are often recorded on a daily basis it also allows us to define explicitly the time period for egg diapause and specify precisely the developmental stage durations that were often overlooked in most mathematical models based on an extensive review of current knowledge on mosquito biology we estimate the seasonal oviposition rate and daily transition and survival rates that change with the environmental conditions egg diapause is treated by dividing each year into unfavorable and favorable seasons during which eggs are discriminated by different daily survival and hatching rates the density restriction on larval growth is elaborated by analyzing the nonlinear dependence of the threshold larval density on temperature and precipitation and its linear dependence on larval resources the simulated temporal profile of adult abundances is robust against the variation of the initial input and matches well with the experimental data collected in a northeast district in guangzhou in 2013 and 2014 it captures critical features commonly observed in previous surveillance in guangzhou we find that chemical interventions can only temporarily suppress the mosquito population a significant but not perfect suppression of mosquito population by chemical interventions within one year brings on almost negligible impact in subsequent years by incorporating a resistance gene with a recessive trait at a single locus of two alleles in our model we show that the control efficacy does not always increase in the intensity or the frequency of adulticide application we further identify the optimal intensity and frequency of chemical interventions to maximize the control efficacy our model can be extended to other geographic areas and or different mosquito species by modifying the system parameter values for designing better mosquito control strategies 2 the model 2 1 basic framework in their life cycle aedes mosquitoes undergo four developmental stages egg e larva l pupa p and adult a eggs hatch to larvae which after four sub stages grow into pupae and adults emerge from the mature pupae the first three stages are largely aquatic and the adults are terrestrial in our model we use difference equations to track daily cohorts of mosquitoes in all stages with age included in each stage to account for their different responses to environments the survival pressure due to population density is the severest for larvae among all stages lord 1998 and the temperature is crucial for egg hatching but is not essential for egg survival khatchikian et al 2010 let s denote a generic stage s e l p a the experimental data in the past two decades suggest that eggs larvae pupae and adults are almost evenly distributed in sex this motivates us to assume the 1 1 sex ratio in all stages and count only female individuals the number of mosquitoes on stage s of age n on a given day t is denoted by s n t where n 1 and t 0 are integers the number in the next day s n 1 t 1 is reduced from s n t due to death or stage transitions let s 1 denote the preceding stage of s meaning that e 1 a l 1 e p 1 l and a 1 p the newborn mosquitoes on the next day counted by s 1 t 1 are accumulated from transition of mosquitoes in the stage s 1 of various ages on day t these considerations set the basic framework of our model in the following equations 2 1 s n 1 t 1 daily survival rate 1 daily stage transition rate s n t 2 2 s 1 t 1 n 1 daily stage transition rate s 1 n t when s a the term daily stage transition rate or oviposition rate needs to be removed in 2 1 because oviposition does not cause the death of the mother for mathematical convenience we introduce a characteristic function as follows let a b be two non negative real numbers we define 2 3 1 a b x 1 x a b 0 x a b 2 2 eggs we begin with the equation of e 1 t 1 for newborn eggs it was observed that ae albopictus females took their first blood meals two days after emergence and the first gonotrophic cycle after a blood meal lasted three to five days at a warm temperature estrada franco and craig 1995 let m t denote the average daily oviposition rate for adult females in their oviposition period then 2 2 gives 2 4 e 1 t 1 n 5 30 m t a n t to set the equation of e n 1 t 1 by 2 1 we include egg diapause as a major factor determining the survival and hatch rates egg diapause is a stable state of hatching arrest that occurs when embryonic development has been completed but the fully formed first instar larva remains within the chorion of the egg vinogradova 2007 it is mainly induced by photoperiod and low temperature and the arrest will not be terminated until the reactivation of development by favorable climate conditions as in the temperate zones in europe and north america ae albopictus in guangzhou experiences high larval and almost complete adult mortality during winter and survives winter as diapausing eggs liu et al 1992 yan et al 2010 we divide each year into unfavorable and favorable seasons depending on whether or not the eggs laid within the season are diapausing unfavorable or non diapausing favorable in guangzhou few adults are found in january and february and most eggs produced from mid october to december diapause due to short photoperiod and low temperature liu et al 1992 yan et al 2010 we define the period from mid october to the end of february as the unfavorable season and the rest as the favorable season to incorporate this division in our model we let t 1 correspond to january 1st of the first year of our consideration and assume that the first unfavorable season begins at t 0 0 in the previous year and continues until day t 1 0 365 the favorable season starts from t 1 1 and ends at t 2 365 t 0 and t 2 365 is in the unfavorable season again we set the average daily survival rate at 0 96 for regular eggs as measured in erickson et al 2010 liu et al 1992 tran et al 2013 and denote by h 1 t their hatching rates depending on temperature we increase the daily survival rates of diapausing eggs within the unfavorable season to 0 99 the difference between 0 96 and 0 99 does not show much apparent statistical significance by themselves however given that an unfavorable season lasts at least 3 months our calculation shows that diapausing eggs are at least 15 times more likely to survive a whole unfavorable season we enumerate eggs older than one day in the first year by 2 5 e n 1 t 1 0 99 e n t t 0 t 1 and n t t 0 or t t 2 365 and n t t 2 0 96 1 h 1 t e n t otherwise this applies to subsequent years provided that t 1 and t 2 are replaced with corresponding starting and ending dates of the favorable season when t 0 t 1 and n t t 0 the season is unfavorable and the egg is laid within the time interval t 0 t and therefore diapausing a similar conclusion can be made when t t 2 365 and n t t 2 overall the first case in 2 5 covers all surviving diapausing eggs in the unfavorable season the second case in 2 5 covers non diapausing eggs in the whole year and diapausing eggs within the favorable season they share the same survival rates 0 96 and their hatching is mainly driven by temperature and precipitation 2 3 larvae by using 2 2 we derive the equation for newborn larvae in the first year 2 6 l 1 t 1 n t t 0 1 h 1 t e n t t 0 t 1 n 1 h 1 t e n t t t 1 t 2 n t t 2 1 h 1 t e n t t t 2 365 note carefully that the three summations differ only at the starting date in accordance with the assumption that diapausing eggs do not hatch during the unfavorable season specified in the first and third cases to count the number of larvae of age n 2 we need to determine the dependence of the daily larval survival and pupation rates on age temperature precipitation and more importantly the larval density the density restriction on survival and pupation which presents a major technical obstacle in our study is of our special consideration in contrast to eggs and pupae larvae are not sustainable and their survival is sensitive to its population size for ae albopictus in guangzhou the major factors causing the death of the 1st and 2nd instar larvae are density dependent liu et al 1992 it has been commonly observed that larvae pupation starts only after 5 days and lasts for about 17 to 23 days delatte et al 2009 lee 1994 hence we count larvae of age n 23 only and let 2 7 l t n 1 23 l n t record the total number of larvae on day t we let f d l denote the density dependent daily pupation rate at optimal temperature and let f 1 t be the factor quantifying the impact of temperature on pupation by averaging the pupation rate over n 6 23 we formulate the daily pupation rate as 2 8 f n l t 1 6 23 n f 1 t f d l at low density survival of aedes larvae is mostly affected by temperature and foods at high density larvae become vulnerable to die from overcrowding effect in breeding sites we assume that temperature and density affect larvae survival independently and let μ l t and μ d l denote the separate effects on the daily survival rate by applying 2 1 and including the combined effect of temperature and density we obtain 2 9 l n 1 t 1 μ l t μ d l 1 f n l t l n t the density dependent daily survival rate μ d l and daily pupation rate f d l our formulation is motivated by several key properties of various experimental observations and further elaborated by testifying the accuracy of data fitting it has been observed that when other environmental conditions are stable there is a critical larval density over which the larval mortality rate increases dramatically and the pupation is delayed significantly lee 1994 liu et al 1992 maciá 2009 we introduce a threshold value κ for larval survival and pupation the survival and pupation rates are density independent when l κ but are reduced when l κ we insert κ into the continuous density dependent functions 2 10 μ d l min 1 κ l α f d l min 1 κ l β where α and β are two positive constants measuring the respective intensity of density restriction on larval survival and pupation the two functions in 2 10 differ only in the powers α and β the larger the intensities α and β are the more severely the survival and pupation rates are reduced at higher density l κ 2 4 pupae substituting the pupation rate defined in 2 8 into 2 2 gives the number of newly developed pupae 2 11 p 1 t 1 n 6 23 f 1 t f d l l n t inside their cocoons pupae take 1 to 10 days to emerge into adult mosquito form as the effect of precipitation and the larval density on the pupation rate has been incorporated in 2 10 we include temperature as the only factor besides the age of pupae controlling the emergence rate let μ p be the daily survival rate constant of pupae and g 1 t be the temperature dependent emergence rate then 2 1 gives 2 12 p n 1 t 1 μ p 1 1 2 10 n g 1 t p n t 2 5 adults an adult emerges from a mature pupa as it floats on the water surface from the definition of g 1 t and 2 12 we count the number of the newly emerged adults as 2 13 a 1 t 1 n 2 10 g 1 t p n t let μ a be the daily survival rate constant of adults then the whole set of equations in our model ends with the simplest one 2 14 a n 1 t 1 μ a a n t 3 estimation of daily transition rates and parameters let γ γ t be the daily transition rate including hatching pupation and eclosion when the temperature is kept at constant t and other environmental conditions remain optimal let γ k be the observed accumulated transition rate in k days we first present a short protocol for estimating γ from γ k for 1 i k let γ i denote the fraction of transformed individuals within the original population on the ith day and ψ i the fraction of surviving and untransformed individuals after i days with a daily survival rate constant μ γ1 μγ and ψ 1 μ 1 γ by applying the same transition and survival rates on ψ 1 on the second day we obtain ψ 2 μ 1 γ ψ 1 ψ 2 1 and γ 2 μ γ ψ 1 γ 1 ψ 1 on the ith day we have by induction ψ i μ 1 γ ψ i 1 ψ i 1 and γ i γ 1 ψ i 1 γ 1 ψ i 1 1 the accumulated transition rate γ k γ1 γ2 γ k is given by γ k γ 1 1 ψ 1 ψ k 1 1 γ 1 1 ψ k 1 1 ψ 1 by substituting γ1 μγ and ψ 1 μ 1 γ into these expressions we derive 3 1 ψ k μ k 1 γ k and γ k μ γ 1 μ k 1 γ k 1 μ 1 γ for a given daily survival rate μ 0 1 as γ increases from 0 to 1 the expression on the right side of 3 1 increases from 0 to μ conversely if γ k 0 μ is known for some k 1 then 3 1 determines implicitly a unique transition rate γ 0 1 3 1 the daily egg hatching rates our estimation of the daily hatching rate γ t h 1 t is mainly based on the data from lee 1994 for a laboratory ae albopictus strain in taiwan supplemented by the data in delatte et al 2009 in the indian ocean and our observations in guangzhou in lee 1994 various hatching percentages at different ages were measured at six temperatures 15 c 20 c 24 c 28 c 32 c and 36 c we include the temperature dependent accumulated hatching rates in the 2nd row of table 1 and the corresponding durations of observation in the 3rd row the hatching activity at 10 c was not tested in lee 1994 we take the data from delatte et al 2009 and list γ k 4 4 with k 90 in table 1 when using these data to estimate h 1 t by the fundamental relation 3 1 we take μ 0 96 as suggested by erickson et al 2010 tran et al 2013 the temperatures below 10 c are excluded in our calculation because of the extremely lower rates of egg hatching and larva survival delatte et al 2009 the estimated daily egg hatching rates are listed in row 4 in table 1 by substituting these rates into 3 1 we obtain ψ 15 the proportions of surviving and unhatched eggs on day 15 and list them in row 5 by polynomial fitting h 1 t is well approximated by 3 2 h 1 t 1 10 03 38 5 0 002341 t 4 0 1967 t 3 5 771 t 2 72 58 t 322 2 with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 9882 3 2 the rates of larval survival pupation and adult emergence we take μ l t 0 for t 10 4 c or t 40 c as immatures are usually not able to survive further than the first instar below 10 4 c or above 40 c to estimate μ l t for t 10 4 40 we first compute μ l t at several temperatures by multiplying the survival rates within the four instar stages l1 l2 l2 l3 and l3 l4 from delatte et al 2009 and then use quadratic interpolation to derive the approximation 3 3 μ l t 1 10 4 40 0 4043 t 2 20 008 t 151 88 with r 2 0 94948 we again use the experimental data of lee 1994 and list in rows 2 and 3 of table 2 the accumulated pupation rates γ l and the corresponding days of observation at 15 c 20 c 24 c 28 c 32 c and 36 c because the effect of temperature on larva survival is characterized by μ l t we fix μ 1 in 3 1 for the estimation of γ t f 1 t a polynomial fitting gives with r 2 0 99297 the good approximation 3 4 f 1 t 1 13 96 37 20 0 02054 t 3 1 269 t 2 21 9 t 114 3 the estimation of g 1 t follows the same procedure as for f 1 t described above we again fix μ 1 in 3 1 because all pupae are changed into adults within two days at the optimal temperature 28 c see rows 5 and 6 in table 2 a polynomial fitting against the daily emergence rates listed in the 7th row yields with r 2 0 9673 3 5 g 1 t 1 14 52 38 65 0 6916 t 2 36 77 t 388 3 3 the remaining rates that are geographically specific our model is formulated by 2 4 2 14 and the rate functions 3 2 3 5 for its broader application we have left several geographical parameters undetermined to simulate the annual abundance of mosquitoes in local areas in guangzhou we now fix these parameters in the order of their introduction the oviposition rate m t introduced in 2 4 is strongly seasonal influenced the measurements in guangzhou by liu et al 1992 showed that the average number of eggs laid by one female adult was about 224 5 in spring march to may 113 35 in summer june to august 28 36 in autumn september to november and almost none in winter december to february by distributing these numbers evenly in the days within each month we set m t 8 4 1 0 from spring to winter the threshold value κ defined in 2 10 for larval survival and pupation changes with temperature and increases in the number of breeding sites and the volume of filled water in these sites the creation of new breeding sites in wild areas is largely contributed by rainfall the monthly distribution of breeding sites for ae albopictus in several suburban areas of guangzhou was surveyed by yan et al 2010 over the years 2004 2009 they quantified their extensive survey by the combined larval density index which characterizes the likelihood of finding a breeding site with living larvae within a unit studying area the mean value d i of the indices for the ith month in the six years was reported table 1 in yan et al 2010 the monthly average of the indices over the six years is d 1 d 2 d 12 12 5 96 it was found that d i 5 96 for 4 i 9 april to september d i 5 96 in other months and d i took the maximum 8 56 in august in our simulation we will use the total number of eggs in the area at t 1 denoted by e 0 as the main initial condition which increases and decreases with the size of the studying area at the same rate we assign κ a single value in each month and assume it to be proportional to both e 0 and d i it was observed in liu et al 1992 that the egg number is about 150 per bowl in january while the average number of larvae in a year is about 30 per bowl the yearly average number of larvae in the whole area is therefore approximately e 0 5 taking these considerations together we assume 3 6 κ 12 d i e 0 5 d 1 d 2 d 12 1 i 12 by analyzing the laboratory data in lee 1994 and the field data in liu et al 1992 we set α β 0 18 for the density restriction intensities on larval survival and pupation when larvae were overcrowded both studies lee 1994 and liu et al 1992 showed that the survival and pupation rates were severely reduced however as α and β quantify the change on a daily basis while the waiting time for pupation in higher densities can be more than 20 days large magnitude intensities for α and β are less consistent with our analysis we take μ p 0 97 for the daily survival rate constant of pupae in 2 9 and μ a 0 92 for the daily survival rate of adults in 2 14 these rate constants are stable and similar values have been observed worldwide erickson et al 2010 liu et al 1992 tran et al 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 the simulation setup and the robustness against perturbations of initial data we use our model via matlab to simulate the abundance of ae albopictus in local areas in guangzhou we set t 1 on january 1 2013 and let t run through daily temperatures in guangzhou from 2013 to the end of 2016 china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc nmic cn we set a uniform age limit n 365 for all mosquito stages which causes at most a minor error in the number of eggs in 2014 2016 since almost no adult mosquitoes and few larvae and pupae are observed in non residential areas in winter liu et al 1992 yan et al 2010 we let l n 1 p n 1 a n 1 0 it is rather challenging to determine e n 1 as mentioned in the introduction of 3 6 we let e 0 0 denote the total number of eggs in the studying area on january 1 2013 its value changes with the size of the area at the same rate and is therefore undetermined if the area size is unknown even if e 0 could be well estimated the initial age distribution of eggs can hardly be determined hopefully our analysis below shows that the population dynamics generated by our model is largely invariant under the perturbation of e n 1 which allows us to take e n 1 with a considerable arbitrariness let e 0 106 and distribute the ages evenly in 365 days with e n 1 e 0 365 1 n 365 then the number of mosquitoes s n t of age 1 n min t 365 can be obtained from our model at each stage s e l p a on any day from 2013 to 2016 the total number of adults on day t defined by 4 1 a t n 1 min t 365 a n t is shown in fig 1 a for 1 t 1460 in fig 1b we change the age structure of the eggs on day 1 from e n 1 106 365 1 n 365 blue curve to e 1 1 106 and e n 1 0 2 n 365 red curve despite the huge variation in the age structure the change in the adult abundances is nearly negligible in the first six months in 2013 and the temporal profiles after june 2013 are virtually identical the same was observed in our simulations with various other variations of the age structure showing that the population dynamics generated by our model is robust against perturbations of initial data 4 2 the population dynamics scales with the inhabiting area to examine how the mosquito abundance changes with the size of the studying areas we compare the mosquito numbers in two regions ω1 and ω2 with the same environmental conditions but different areas ω1 and ω2 let c ω2 ω1 let e 0 be the total number of eggs on day 1 in ω1 then the initial egg number in the other region ω2 is ce 0 denote by s n t e 0 and s n t ce 0 the respective mosquito numbers in ω1 and ω2 with the same distribution of egg ages on day 1 in the two regions we have e n 1 ce 0 ce n 1 e 0 and s n 1 e 0 s n 1 ce 0 0 for s l p a and our numerical simulations show that the proportionality is maintained for all n and t 4 2 s n t ce 0 cs n t e 0 1 n 365 1 t 1460 indeed we can prove this equality by mathematical induction which follows essentially from the proportionality of κ and e 0 given in 3 6 clearly the equality in 4 2 holds for t 1 assume that it holds for t 1 then the larvae numbers defined in 2 7 satisfy l t ce 0 n 1 23 l n t ce 0 c n 1 23 l n t e 0 c l t e 0 as shown by 3 6 the threshold value κ is proportional to the initial egg number it then follows that κ l t takes the same value in ω1 and ω2 in turn the nonlinear functions μ d l t and f d l t defined in 2 10 are invariant in the two regions consequently the equality in 4 2 is lifted from t to t 1 for s l by 2 9 for s p by 2 11 and 2 12 for s a by 2 13 and 2 14 and finally for s e by 2 4 and 2 5 the proof of 4 2 is thus completed on two different days t 1 t 2 1 4 2 also implies 4 3 s n t 1 ce 0 s n t 2 ce 0 s n t 1 e 0 s n t 2 e 0 provided that the denominators are positive the two equalities in 4 2 and 4 3 show that the mosquito abundance changes with the size of the studying area proportionally but the population dynamics remains the same this invariance is essential a major criterion indeed for the usefulness of our mathematical modelling approach 4 3 the precision of data fitting and typical features of the wild ae albopictus annual abundance in guangzhou the invariance shown in 4 3 remains valid if the daily mosquito numbers on two different days are replaced by the total numbers in two different time periods for instance for the twelve months in a given year and a t defined in 4 1 a i t the i th month a t t the year a t i 1 2 12 are invariant in different local regions and determine the monthly distribution of the adult mosquitoes in the year these numbers are graphed in fig 2 blue bars for 2013 and 2014 interestingly the output of our model matches well with the experimental data collected in conghua district in northeast guangzhou in the two years yellow bars in fig 2 data were courteously provided by our collaborators ziqiang yan and xiaoying zheng with a correlation coefficient 0 9511 two sample t test it shows that our model predicts rather precisely the population dynamics of wild ae albopictus in guangzhou in response to climate change from year to year the annual abundances in fig 1a display some recognizable differences from 2013 to 2016 however they follow essentially the same growth pattern and capture several critical features commonly observed in the surveillance of wild a albopictus population in guangzhou liu et al 1992 yan et al 2010 during the winter and early spring few adults are observed in the field or by our simulation when the rainy and humid season starts in the middle of march while the temperature is also rising the adult population emerges and grows rapidly due to the outbreak of diapausing egg hatching the sharp increase persists until late may or early june when the adult population reaches a peak it is then followed by a long period of decrease from one to two months in the summer likely due to hot temperature and density induced larval death after the decay ends the population bounces back and continues to grow until reaching the second peak in september or october after which the abundance decays sharply and eventually vanishes in winter 4 4 robustness of the population dynamics the discussion above shows that the population dynamics generated by our model is robust against the perturbation on the age structure of eggs in the winter we now use further simulations to demonstrate the robustness under larger magnitude perturbations we first manipulate the dynamics in the first half of a year and test how the manipulation affects the dynamics in the second half of the same year as shown in fig 3 a and b the original abundance of adult mosquitoes without intervention the curve in black in 2014 is pulled down severely by three separate manipulation strategies to the red blue and magenta curves up to the end of june the original peak abundance is reduced separately by more than 60 80 and 90 in the three colored curves in fig 3a and by more than 35 60 and 80 in fig 3b the abundance reduction in fig 3a is made in our simulation by mimicking the application of adulticides and decreasing the adult survival rate μ a in 2 14 by 10 20 and 30 respectively from april 1 to june 30 for three months the abundance reduction in fig 3b is achieved similarly in our simulation by mimicking the application of larvicides and decreasing the larval survival rate μ l in 2 9 by 10 20 and 30 respectively in the same time period surprisingly in spite of the various effective mosquito controls in april may and june the adult abundance starts growing as long as the intervention is stopped and restores very quickly to reach the same peak within a month after which the abundance is virtually invariant we move forward to explore what could be expected in the future if the mosquito density is reduced significantly within a whole year for this purpose we reduce the adult survival rate μ a fig 3c or the larval survival rate μ l fig 3d by 10 20 and 30 respectively during the mosquito active season from april 1 to september 31 in 2013 as shown in fig 3c and d the adult abundances in 2013 are suppressed significantly in particular the magenta curve in fig 3d indicates that decreasing the larval survival rate μ l by 30 results in 80 decrease of the adult density again it is surprising to see that the extensive intervention in 2013 makes merely a negligible difference in fig 3c or nearly no difference in fig 3d for 2014 it suggests a rather pessimistic finding that a significant but not perfect suppression of adult or larval mosquito population within one year does not bring on much impact on the abundance of mosquitoes in subsequent years 4 5 an extension of the model with chemical interventions environmental management commonly known as source reduction appears to be the single most effective approach for controlling ae albopictus thus far available estrada franco and craig 1995 meng et al 2015 it involves the elimination or reduction of vector breeding sources to disrupt the immature mosquito life cycle unlike ae aegypti that may spend their lifetime in or around the houses ae albopictus has become adapted to a wider range of habitats including rural suburban and urban environments whose control becomes more challenging and requires coverage of larger areas including the forest faraji and unlu 2016 yan et al 2010 in guangzhou the warm and humid weather helps create a vast number of mosquito breeding sites in artificial and natural containers such as leaf litter and tree holes that are often cryptic and hardly accessible the creation of ubiquitous larval sources increasing and decreasing on a continual basis makes source reduction a very difficult approach for mosquito control yan et al 2010 while source reduction should be prioritized the use of insecticides has remained a primary strategy for mosquito control in china with more than 250 million kg of insecticides being sprayed annually since 1997 meng et al 2015 during outbreaks of mosquito borne disease extensive application of chemicals has provided a rapid and effective intervention to interrupt disease transmission pyrethroids are the most commonly used adulticides because of their high insecticidal potency at low dosages their rapid knockdown effects and their low mammalian toxicity in the campaign to combat the 2014 dengue outbreak in guangzhou more than 27 000 kg of pyrethroids were used for ultra low volume spraying in over 3291 km2 of land along with massive human resources and funds 30 million us dollars invested by the local government meng et al 2015 wang et al 2017 spraying insecticides as a primary mosquito control strategy is facing more and more challenges pyrethroids the only adulticides allowed in europe and extensively used worldwide are toxic to non target insects and aquatic invertebrates which inevitably causes ecological imbalance baldacchino et al 2015 the efficacy of chemicals in ae albopictus control can be largely reduced due to the wide range of hidden breeding sites that neither ground nor aerial application can cover completely more devastatingly the use of insecticides is jeopardized by increasing insecticide resistances among ae albopictus populations owing to the imposed selection pressure resistance to pyrethroids and larvacides have been documented in asia china malaysia and thailand africa cameroon central and south america brazil and caribbean islands and europe italy greece la reunion vontas et al 2012 an insecticide resistance gene rdl allele was detected in ae albopictus collected in la reunion back to 2008 tantely et al 2010 recently wang et al 2017 tested the susceptibility of ae albopictus specimens collected from four districts in guangzhou to various insecticides among the pyrethroids they found that the mortality rates after exposure of the four populations to deltamethrin 0 1 for one hour were ranging from 40 to 80 in accordance with the guidance on interpreting the who bioassay test results these low rates are sufficient to confirm existence of resistant genes in these populations we extend our model to evaluate how a recurrent intervention by a single type of adulticides helps spread a resistant gene in a mosquito population and how the spreading of the resistance obstructs mosquito control our purpose is not to design the best strategy of insecticide application should it exist at all but rather to sketch the devastating consequence when insecticides are applied improperly we assume that the resistance is conferred by a recessive trait at a single gene with two alleles each allele has an initial probability p 0 p 0 0 1 to have the trait that confers resistance to the adulticide and a complementary probability 1 p 0 to have the trait that confers susceptibility the mosquito population in each stage consists of two homozygous groups s rr and s ss and one heterozygous group s rs where r stands for resistant and s for susceptible among adults only homozygous individuals with two resistant alleles confer resistance while the resistance in heterozygous individuals is masked by the dominant susceptible trait in our simulation we assume that a single type of adulticide is sprayed at ultra low volume from april 1 to october 31 within the active season of ae albopictus in guangzhou once in 15 days spraying pyrethroids at ultra low volume has been the most common strategy for ae albopictus control in guangzhou which kills susceptible adults rapidly in the affected areas but the effect usually decays to zero within the same day luz et al 2009 wang et al 2017 we assume that carrying the resistance trait in one or two alleles of the gene brings only negligible fitness cost mccart and buckling 2005 so the reproduction and stage transition rates remain the same for all three groups s rr s rs and s ss to integrate the elimination of adults by adulticides in our model we introduce the coverage rate c r 0 1 of chemical spraying as the probability that a susceptible adult which would otherwise survive under normal condition is killed on the day of insecticide application the rate c r 0 1 depends mostly on the coverage range of chemical application within the area of our study and also on other factors such as the type dosage droplet size of chemicals and air temperature humidity and wind we set t 1 on january 1 2013 and assume l n 1 p n 1 a n 1 0 as above it gives l rr n 1 l rs n 1 l ss n 1 0 and the same equalities for p and a as each allele in the genetic locus has a probability p 0 to have the resistance trait we use the hardy weinberg equilibrium to differentiate the initial egg number e n 1 into 4 4 e rr n 1 p 0 2 e n 1 e rs n 1 2 p 0 q 0 e n 1 e ss n 1 q 0 2 e n 1 where q 0 1 p 0 and 1 n 365 for t 1 we need to extend the equations from 2 4 to 2 14 to cover the three different genetic groups we discuss the extension of 2 5 2 14 first before presenting the hardest extension of 2 4 for oviposition of eggs in summary eqs 2 5 2 6 2 9 and 2 11 2 13 are extended simply by replacing s e l p a with s rr s rs and s ss respectively when we count the total number l t of larvae the summation in 2 7 needs to include l rr l rs and l ss the same pupation rate function in 2 8 and the larval density dependent competition function in 2 10 will be used so that larvae with different genetic forms in the two alleles compete together let t k 1 be the day from april 1 to october 31 on which the insecticide is applied the kth time when t t k the spraying of adulticides at ultra low volume has no impact on the death of adults and eq 2 14 is again extended by replacing a with a rr a rs and a ss the same is also true for resistant adults on the day of adulticide application and this simple extension for a rr remains valid even when t t k to reduce the number of susceptible adults that are eliminated by adulticides we integrate the coverage rate c r 0 into 2 14 and derive 4 5 a rs n 1 t k 1 μ a 1 c r a rs n t k a ss n 1 t k 1 μ a 1 c r a ss n t k in order to expand 2 4 to count the newborn eggs e rr 1 t 1 e rs 1 t 1 and e ss 1 t 1 we need to trace the genetic traits from the crossing male and female adults an egg inherits independently one trait with an equal probability 1 2 from the two alleles of the mother and one trait from the mating male denote by f the crossing female and m the crossing male there are nine different types of crossings between f rr f rs and f ss with m rr m rs and m ss the crossings between two homozygous adults produce only a single type of eggs as summarized by 4 6 f rr m rr e rr f rr m ss or f ss m rr e rs f ss m ss e ss the crossings between a homozygous adult and a heterozygous adult produce two types of eggs each with a probability 1 2 as shown by 4 7 f rr m rs or f rs m rr 12 e rr 12 e rs f ss m rs or f rs m ss 12 e rs 12 e ss finally the crossing between two heterozygous adults can produce all three types of eggs 4 8 f rs m rs 14 e rr 12 e rs 14 e ss analogous to 2 4 the egg number e rr 1 t 1 is increased by the production of f rr and f rs on day t if they mated with m rr and m rs before taking their first blood meal as some ae albopictus have been observed to take blood meals during their first day post emergence estrada franco and craig 1995 we assume that adults mate at age 1 therefore when counting the contribution of f rr n t and f rs n t on day t to the increase of e rr 1 t 1 we need to calculate the probabilities that they mated with m rr or m rs on day t n 1 one day after their emergence for a given f rr a female adult with two resistant alleles the probability that she mates with m rr on day t n 1 is calculated as the percentage of m rr among all male adults if all male adults up to age 30 are counted then the probability equals 4 9 p rr t n 1 k 1 30 m rr k t n 1 k 1 30 m k t n 1 m m rr m rs m ss by an obvious extension we can also define p rs t n 1 and p ss t n 1 when applying 4 9 we set m rr k t n 1 0 for t n 1 0 also if k 1 30 m k t n 1 0 then 4 9 is undefined in which case there are no adults for mating and we simply define p rr t n 1 0 as the numbers of males and females are assumed to be the same we may replace m with a when computing these probabilities by using 4 6 4 8 we extend 2 4 to for t 1 e rr 1 t 1 n 5 30 m t a rr n t p rr t n 1 p rs t n 1 2 n 5 30 m t a rs n t p rr t n 1 2 p rs t n 1 4 or by regrouping terms in the form 4 10 e rr 1 t 1 n 5 30 m t a rr n t a rs n t 2 p rr t n 1 p rs t n 1 2 by symmetry we have 4 11 e ss 1 t 1 n 5 30 m t a ss n t a rs n t 2 p ss t n 1 p rs t n 1 2 as shown in 4 6 4 8 there are seven types of crossings that can produce e rs by summarizing these terms and noticing that p rr p rs p ss 1 we extend 2 4 to 4 12 e rs 1 t 1 n 5 30 m t a rr n t p ss t n 1 p rs t n 1 2 n 5 30 m t 2 a rs n t n 5 30 m t a ss n t p rr t n 1 p rs t n 1 2 4 6 improper adulticide applications facilitate insecticide resistance our discussion above completes the algorithm for computing the absolute numbers of the three genetic groups s rr n t s rs n t and s ss n t in all stages e l p and a for a given adulticide coverage rate c r 0 1 and the initial frequency p 0 0 1 of resistant alleles for given p 0 and c r the number of resistant adults and the number of all adults living on day t are determined by respectively 4 13 a rr t p 0 c r n 1 t a rr n t a t p 0 c r n 1 t a rr n t a rs n t a ss n t we are particularly interested in the dynamics of the resistance frequency 4 14 a rr t p 0 c r a rr t p 0 c r a t p 0 c r when a t p 0 c r 0 which determines the likelihood that a surviving adult has a resistant phenotype in the discussion above it is assumed that the resistant trait at the genetic locus brings no fitness cost or benefit to the hosting mosquitoes and no additional resistant loci are created by gene mutations therefore in the absence of chemical intervention c r 0 it is expected that the resistance frequency remains at the hardy weinberg equilibrium luz et al 2009 a rr t p 0 0 p 0 2 this equality is supported by our model mathematically and is manifested in fig 4 a for each of p 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 when the mosquito population is intervened by insecticides it is easy to envisage an increase of the resistance frequency but how it rises dynamically is unclear in fig 4 b the temporal profiles of a rr t p 0 c r are shown as a single type of adulticide is sprayed at ultra low volume at a moderate rate c r 0 6 from april 1 to october 31 once in 15 days corresponding to the four initial frequencies of homozygous resistant eggs p 0 2 0 01 0 04 0 09 0 16 a rr t p 0 0 6 exhibits a similar dynamics that spikes up on each day of adulticide application due to the elimination of susceptible adults it then decays in the following days to a level higher than the level preceding the last adulticide application overall the frequency is lifted respectively to a stabilized level 5 65 48 17 80 71 and 91 67 in november and december the lifting is apparently nonlinear and the magnitude is moderate if the initial frequency is small however when the initial resistance frequency exceeds 4 the 15 consecutive adulticide applications 15 days apart from april 1 to october 31 could induce a rather devastating consequence that about half or even more surviving adults have a resistant phenotype the catastrophic consequence of insecticide resistance when coupled with a recurrent application of the corresponding adulticides is further evidenced by its obstruction of mosquito control initiated from a resistance frequency 4 or p 0 0 2 our simulations indicate that the efficacy of mosquito control does not always increase in the intensity of adulticide application the best efficacy is attained around a medium coverage rate c r 0 5 and on average only about half of the adult abundance could be reduced during the mosquito active season the abundances a t 0 2 0 5 and a t 0 2 0 9 along with the abundance without chemical intervention the dashed black curve with c r 0 are shown in fig 4 c comparing with the lower rate c r 0 5 the high rate c r 0 9 drags down the abundance more effectively before august however by provoking a fast accumulation of resistant mosquitoes as shown more clearly in fig 4 d it pulls up the abundance back to a higher level after september 4 7 the control efficacy in the face of insecticide resistance we show further that the mosquito control efficacy by insecticide spraying does not always increase in the application frequency either in the face of insecticide resistance for this purpose we compute the efficacy defined by 1 the total number of surviving adults from april to october with control the total number of surviving adults from april to october without control for given initial resistance frequency p 0 2 the coverage rate c r and the constant time interval between two consecutive adulticide applications the efficacy values are shown in fig 5 a b for p 0 2 0 01 0 04 0 09 0 16 as in fig 4 a b c r 0 5 in fig 5 a c r 0 6 in fig 5 b and the adulticides are applied once in 1 3 5 31 days by analyzing the data in fig 5 we can make the following interesting and delicate observations i in the presence of insecticide resistance a more frequent application of the corresponding adulticides may not provide a better mosquito control than a less frequent application in all cases shown in fig 5 it is surprising to see that spraying the adulticides every day is not even as good as spraying it once in a month ii for each given p 0 2 and c r there exists an optimal control frequency by which the control efficacy is maximized these numbers are labeled in the figure for instance when p 0 2 0 04 and c r 0 5 the red curve in fig 5 a shows that it is optimal to apply the chemicals once in 9 days to reach the maximum efficacy 0 4590 that a 45 90 of adult populations is eliminated from april 1 to october 31 iii the maximum efficacy as we expect decreases in p 0 2 whereas the corresponding waiting days between two consecutive applications counter intuitively increases in p 0 2 it is subtle to predict from the data in fig 5 which coverage rate between c r 0 5 and c r 0 6 should be applied for p 0 2 0 04 0 09 0 16 the maximum control efficacy in fig 5a for c r 0 5 is slightly higher than that in fig 5b for c r 0 6 but needs more frequent chemical applications a practical option should take account of other factors such as the costs of labor and chemicals and the available human resources 5 conclusion the population dynamics of ae albopictus in southern china is modeled by a system of difference equations that track the daily abundances of mosquitoes of all ages in the four developmental stages the model elaborates the delicate impact of environmental conditions such as temperature and precipitation on the stage transition and survival egg diapause is embedded into the model by dividing each year into unfavorable and favorable seasons during which eggs are discriminated by different daily survival and temperature dependent hatching rates the density induced competition among larvae has been observed ubiquitously manifested by the existence of a threshold larval density over which the larval mortality rate increases dramatically and the pupation is delayed significantly lee 1994 liu et al 1992 maciá 2009 the density restriction is carefully elaborated by analyzing the nonlinear dependence of the threshold larval density on temperature and precipitation and its linear increase in the size and the number of breeding sites we proved that the mosquito abundance generated by our model in each stage scales with the size of the mosquito inhabiting area the simulated adult abundances are robust against the variation of the initial input and match extremely well with the experimental data collected in a northeast district in guangzhou in 2013 and 2014 the adult abundances display a growth pattern that captures several critical features commonly observed in previous surveillance in guangzhou including two apparent peaks one in late june and the other in late summer liu et al 1992 yan et al 2010 surprisingly we found that chemical interventions in spite of their prompt impact on mosquito control bring on only a temporary disturbance in the robust mosquito population dynamics the interventions before june may eliminate the first peak effectively but the adult abundance starts growing once the intervention is stopped and the second peak develops at the same magnitude also a significant but not perfect suppression of adult or larval mosquito population within one year brings on almost negligible impact on the adult abundance in subsequent years spraying insecticides has remained a primary strategy for mosquito control in china however the use of insecticides is jeopardized by increasing insecticide resistance owing to the imposed selection pressure wang et al 2017 by incorporating a resistance gene with a recessive trait at a single locus of two alleles we tested how adulticide applications facilitate the resistance spreading to the mosquito population our simulation shows that if more than 4 of eggs carry homozygous resistant trait in january then applying the corresponding adulticide alone from april 1 to october 31 15 days apart would lead to a devastating consequence that about half or even more surviving adults confer resistance in november we found that the efficacy of mosquito control does not always increase in the intensity or the frequency of adulticide application and estimated the optimal intensity and frequency of chemical interventions to maximize the control efficacy our analysis can be extended further by integrating other control methods such as source reduction ovitraps and spraying larvicides and adulticides with different modes of action in rotation or combination however due to the transient effect of insecticides and the widespread occurrence of insecticide resistance it is of an emergent need to seek more sustainable approaches to protect the global community from mosquito borne diseases there has been an increasing interest in using the endosymbiotic bacterium wolbachia to infect and suppress the wild population of aedes mosquitoes when a wild female mosquito crosses with a wolbachia infected male the infection can induce zygotic death and female sterility xi et al 2005 2006 since march 2015 massive wolbachia infected males have been released in both natural and residential areas in guangzhou where more than 95 of ae albopictus have been suppressed in our recent studies huang et al 2018 zheng et al 2014 2018 we have modelled population replacement and suppression of mosquitoes driven by wolbachia infection through differential equations by merging the methods developed in huang et al 2018 zheng et al 2014 2018 and the current study with our field trial data we plan to develop a protocol to search for the best strategy to limit insecticide resistance and suppress mosquito growth
