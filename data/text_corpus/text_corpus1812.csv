9060,a thorough understanding of crop canopy interception is crucial for understanding the relationship between water management and agriculture in water limited regions the factors that influence the interception process such as meteorological conditions and plant traits are diverse and uncertain we divided meteorological factors and plant traits into three groups precipitation related meteorological factors including precipitation event factors and raindrop factors non precipitation related meteorological factors air temperature relative humidity wind speed etc and plant traits leaf area index lai and mean leaf inclination angle the contributions of groups and each variable were then quantified with respect to canopy interception this study was based on data from 80 events over four years 2017 2020 measurements were taken under maize zea mays l cropland located on the southern loess plateau the canopy interception i c was calculated as the difference between precipitation and the sum of throughfall and stemflow and all of i c was assumed to be lost to evaporation in the study results showed that the cumulative i c of the 80 events was 395 9 mm accounting for 39 7 of the contemporaneous total precipitation but the mean proportion of canopy interception during each precipitation event i c percentage was greater at 57 6 because of the high interception percentage during light precipitation events 0 5 mm totaling 37 events pearson correlations analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between i c and precipitation related meteorological factors including precipitation amount duration raindrop diameter d50 terminal raindrop velocity u v p 0 01 and intensity average downward force f 0 p 0 05 whereas there was a significant negative correlation between i c percentage and precipitation related meteorological factors p 0 01 because precipitation amount was more affected by precipitation related meteorological factors when the results of different groups were compared precipitation event factors amount duration and intensity and raindrop factors d50 u v f 0 made the highest contribution to explaining i c 56 4 and i c percentage 28 3 respectively both the unique effect and individual importance of plant traits to i c and i c percentage increased when considering the precipitation events which occurred close to the lai measurement date it is essential that short term assessments are used if considering lai in relation to i c precipitation amount had the largest individual importance on i c 30 2 p 0 01 whereas d50 was the analogous variable for i c percentage 9 5 p 0 05 our results confirmed that interception by the maize canopy accounts for an important portion of the total field water input the data and information on the interception process presented in this study should contribute to the understanding of the overall water balance in agroecosystem environments and improve knowledge of the interplay

introduction although there is a lot of water on the earth only about 2 5 of it is fresh oki and kanae 2006 these fresh waters support billions of individuals however human water use climate change and other activities have caused a water crisis for many ecosystems across the world abbott et al 2019 dryland delimited by a precipitation potential evapotranspiration ratio 0 65 covers about 40 of the global landmass sustaining 38 of the world s population white and nackoney 2003 huang et al 2017 magliano et al 2019 sustainable and efficient management of dryland ecosystems requires an in depth understanding of the water cycle and especially of precipitation partitioning processes which govern fresh water input into dryland ecosystems huang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 magliano et al 2019 precipitation is a major component of the hydrological cycle in dryland ecosystems zhang et al 2018 as it moves towards the ground incident gross precipitation is intercepted by the plant canopy and partitioned into three components throughfall stemflow and canopy interception i c zhang et al 2021b throughfall and stemflow replenish soil water and maintain the water supply essential for plant survival zheng et al 2018a interception however is the portion of precipitation retained by the plant canopy and eventually returned to the atmosphere interception plays an important role in ecohydrological processes by increasing evaporation and reducing the amount of water available for infiltration brasil et al 2018 studies on canopy interception processes have been conducted on various plants all of which clearly indicated that it cannot be ignored as an important component of water balance the amount and percentage of canopy interception varies greatly 6 9 27 2 between climatic regions zheng et al 2018b brasil et al 2018 as it depends on factors such as vegetation characteristics wang et al 2018 yan et al 2021 meteorological conditions kozak et al 2007 and precipitation characteristics zhang et al 2016 grunicke et al 2020 some studies have examined different plant growth stages to explore the effect of precipitation factors on canopy interception zheng et al 2018a however the importance of estimating the individual predictor from all response variables has generally been neglected in previous studies frasson and krajewski 2013 indicated that the interaction between raindrops and the canopy changes the microphysical characteristics of precipitation brasil et al 2018 pointed out that interception should not be assessed on an annual scale only because the differences in i c percentage between years are small but the i c percentage per event fluctuates substantially studies of interception carried out per event can better express the correlation between canopy interception and the factors that affect it zhang et al 2016 the majority of studies have focused on interception by plantation vegetation or natural forest stands wang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 grunicke et al 2020 where annual interception commonly amounts to a quarter or more of total precipitation as determined by field measurements or modeling muzylo et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 grunicke et al 2020 as sadeghi et al 2020 pointed out the majority of studies in the literature address canopy interception by trees and shrubs so crop canopy interception requires further investigation kozak et al 2007 nazari et al 2019 some studies have quantified various redistribution processes under crop canopies however these studies reveal inconsistent results with respect to canopy interception with variations across the globe among crops maize which has a high yield and wide adaptability is important in dryland systems maize can be grown under both irrigated and arid conditions from the tropics to temperate regions liu et al 2015 nazari et al 2019 in the last 30 years for example the growing area of maize croplands has increased from 78 6 to 2323 5 km2 in iran nazari et al 2019 the area of winter wheat croplands has decreased by 5730 7 km2 over the last 20 years in shaanxi province china while that of spring maize croplands one of the other main crops has increased slightly zheng et al 2018a found that canopy interception accounted for 12 5 of cumulative gross precipitation during the whole growing season of maize in northwestern china nazari et al 2019 reported that interception by the maize canopy can significantly reduce total water input to the surface in tehran iran 19 9 of natural precipitation maximizing utilization of limited rainwater resources in rainfed agricultural areas is critical to increasing agricultural productivity zheng et al 2018b maize canopies have an impact on the regional water cycle by modifying the distribution of water applied during precipitation nazari et al 2019 as a result the canopy interception of maize should be given more consideration particularly in rainfed agricultural areas we searched the web of science www webofscience com for peer reviewed articles published in english from 1995 to 2022 using the phrases maize interception and corn interception appendix b for inclusion in our study primary studies had to meet the following criteria 1 data were obtained from maize at the individual or ecosystem level 2 for studies only reporting throughfall and stemflow interception was calculated as the difference between the total amount of precipitation and the sum of throughfall and stemflow a dataset of 27 articles was compiled from the 1486 bibliographic references based on these criteria the systematic literature search revealed that there is a gap in the field in relation to quantifying the relative importance of factors affecting maize canopy interception so maize canopy interception requires further study to improve our current understanding of the consequences of the interaction between precipitation and maize canopies and inspired by the newly reported ability to estimate the individual predictors across all response variables lai et al 2022 we aimed to 1 determine canopy interception and the ratio of interception to precipitation in maize cropland from a series of 80 precipitation events in a rainfed agricultural area 2 quantify the individual contributions of different groups of factors and individual variables including meteorological factors and plant traits on canopy interception in maize cropland 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description to better understand the canopy interception process detailed measurements were undertaken in the wangdonggou watershed changwu tableland on the southern loess plateau in northwestern china 35 12 n 107 40 e 1219 0 m a s l fig 1 the watershed is flat with an unsaturated soil depth of more than 50 m on average the climate is temperate continental with rainy summers and dry winters and droughts occur frequently the mean annual precipitation is 519 6 mm period 2000 2018 the precipitation from june to september accounts for about 55 78 of the annual total there is no irrigation water in this region so precipitation is the only water resource for vegetation growth the mean annual temperature is 9 1 c the mean annual hours of sunshine over 2230 h and the frost free period approximately 171 days the maize was planted at an intermediate density of 66 660 plants ha with a row spacing of 50 cm and plant spacing of 30 cm the field management schedule i e application of fertilizer and weed control was based on the local standard management 2 2 meteorological variables meteorological variables were measured from 2017 to 2020 each precipitation event was measured continuously by an automatic meteorological station with 0 1 mm resolution located approximately 300 0 m away from the experimental plots in the present study an individual precipitation event is considered to be one separated by at least 4 0 h from the next the air temperature at c relative humidity rh at a height of 2 m and wind speed ws m s at a height of 10 m were also monitored by the meteorological station m520 vaisala company finland to understand the synergistic effect of at and rh the vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated campbell and norman 1979 the evaporation coefficient e unitless was calculated to present the evaporation intensity based on the aerodynamics approaches carlyle moses

in each category were shown in table 1 effective precipitation peff is the fraction of the total precipitation that is available to meet crop water needs with deep percolation surface runoff and interception loss excluded the soil is deep more than 50 m and flat the soils have a high infiltration capacity with a steady infiltration rate of 1 35 mm min therefore the effects of surface runoff subsurface runoff and deep seepage can be ignored the simplified equation for peff estimation was p eff p i c measurement of i c canopy interception will be described later 2 3 plant traits the mean growth period of maize is about 150 days from mid april to mid september in this study the sowing dates were 16 april 20 april 16 april and 19 april in 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively maize has an upright stalk and is usually unbranched the leaf blades are flat and broad with a linear lanceolate shape the leaves are covered with pubescent hairs the midribs are thick and the leaf edges are slightly rough the specific characteristics of normally growing maize are presented in table 2 both the leaf area index lai and the mean leaf inclination angle mta were obtained by photographing the canopy with an optical fisheye digital camera nikon d7200 nikon af dx 10 5 mm f 2 8 g ed each week to avoid the influence of rapid changes in the light environment and low color contrast between the blue sky and green plants on measurement results canopy photographs were taken on cloudy and sunny days before sunrise or after sunset the sampling was randomly repeated three times in each plot located at the center or 1 4 of the way along the diagonal of the plot the camera was kept horizontally on a tripod when shooting and the shooting direction was determined by the height of the maize the lens field of view should not cover the parts outside the sample site and the operator s body parts should not be included in the photograph lai and mta data were processed and the values calculated by can eye software v6 47 eight clear photographs were selected for processing the illumination effect could be ignored because the photographs were taken in conditions of uniform light and no direct light latitude longitude slope and terrain are all entered based on the actual situation at the measuring point calibration experiments for the optical center and projection function were required for a given camera fish eye system according to the user manual https www6 paca inrae fr can eye 2 4 canopy interception measurement the amount of canopy interception i c was obtained indirectly by measuring the amount of throughfall and stemflow all of i c was assumed to be lost to evaporation in the study the periods during which maize canopy interception was measured were from 5 july to 11 september 2017 9 july to 5 september 2018 28 june to 17 september 2019 and 27 june to 10 september 2020 the maize cropland is 49 5 m long and 20 0 m wide with a total area of 990 m2 each experimental maize plot was 16 5 m long and 10 0 m wide with six plot replicates throughfall was measured at one point in each plot using horizontal iron troughs 90 0 cm long and 50 0 cm wide the iron trough was positioned between rows at the center of each plot two maize plants in the center of each plot were used to obtain the stemflow stemflow was collected using a breathable but dense sponge funnel affixed to the stem of each sample maize plant at a height of 30 cm to ensure the normal growth of maize and the funnel was sealed by neutral silicone caulking the funnel was tightly connected to the stalk and sealed with neutral silicone the simulated water flow was used to determine if there was any leakage after the silicone solidified the diameter of funnel was controlled to the minimum to avoid overestimating stemflow by collecting throughfall a pipe with a diameter of 1 2 cm was used to connect the collection device and the storage container and channeled stemflow from the funnel to container with minimum travel time the amounts of throughfall stored in the iron troughs and stemflow in the containers were manually weighed if the precipitation events ended during the daytime the collection of throughfall and stemflow was usually completed within two hours after the end of events to minimize evaporation if the precipitation events ended at night the collection of throughfall and stemflow was completed as soon as possible in the next morning these apparatuses were periodically checked against leakages or blockages caused by insects and fallen leaves throughfall and stemflow volumes were converted to equivalent water depth using the iron trough bottom area and maize canopy area respectively therefore the canopy interception i c was obtained and calculated as follows i c p tf sf where p is the precipitation mm tf is the throughfall mm and sf is the stemflow mm 2 5 statistical analyses to determine the relative importance of each group pmfs npmfs and plant traits independently or in combination variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning based on canopy interception were used yang et al 2019 lai et al 2022 canopy interception as the response variable was applied to partitioning of variation and the separate contributions obtained were variation explained by pmfs independent of npmfs and plant traits variation explained by npmfs independent of pmfs and plant traits variation explained by plant traits lai mta independent of pmfs and npmfs the pmfs were then subdivided into two groups in order to explore the effect of precipitation characteristics and raindrop characteristics on i c 1 precipitation event factors factors related to precipitation event i e precipitation amount duration and intensity 2 raindrop factors factors related to raindrops i e d50 u v and f 0 these analyses were carried out in r software using the rdacca hp library lai et al 2022 spss 24 0 statistical software was used for the statistical analyses spss inc chicago usa origin 2018 originlab corporation usa for windows and r software were used to create all of the figures 3 results 3 1 characteristics of the precipitation and non precipitation related meteorological factors the probability density and cumulative distribution of pmfs and npmfs are presented in fig 2 the precipitation amount ranged from 0 1 to 67 7 mm for the 80 events with a total of 1055 5 mm and an average of 13 2 mm the most likely precipitation event had 2 8 mm of precipitation the duration varied from 1 0 to 84 0 h the most likely precipitation event duration was 3 h there were 50 events with light precipitation 0 5 2 5 mm h over the whole experimental period the most likely precipitation event had an intensity of 0 4 mm h the d50 ranged from 1 3 to 1 9 mm with a mean of 1 5 mm the u v ranged from 4 6 to 5 1 mm s the most likely precipitation event had a velocity of 4 9 mm s the mean f 0 was 10 1 mg m s the mean e was 0 3 the mean at was 20 0 c with the highest probability density approximately 18 7 c the mean rh was 88 2 over the experimental period the ws ranged from 0 1 to 2 2 m s with an average of 1 2 m s and the highest probability density approximately 0 9 m s the vpd was 0 3 kpa on average 3 2 characteristics of the plant traits fig 3 shows the lai and mta dynamics of maize cropland over the whole experimental period leaf area index represents the density of leaves in the canopy lai exhibited an increasing trend to a maximum value which then gradually decreased the mean lai was 3 3 during the observation period the mta is the angle formed by the intersection of the surfaces of leaves and flat ground the mta ranged from 21 3 to 66 0 with a mean of 51 1 3 3 canopy interception characteristics over the measurement period a total of 80 precipitation events were recorded and measured for i c analysis fig 4 the i c of the precipitation events ranged from 0 1 mm to 29 1 mm with an average of 4 9 mm the cumulative i c of the 80 events was 395 9 mm accounting for 39 7 of the cumulative precipitation amount 996 3 mm there were 23 events where the precipitation was completely intercepted accounting for 1 5 of the total precipitation amount on average i c accounted for 57 6 of precipitation during the events after excluding the precipitation events less than 5 mm i c accounted for 37 3 of precipitation during the events the i c percentage was highest in the light precipitation events 0 5 mm and then decreased when the precipitation was less than 2 0 mm the i c percentage was at its maximum 85 6 while when it was greater than 15 0 mm the i c percentage was at its minimum 36 8 the frequency distributions of interception amount show that light and heavy precipitation events 2 0 mm and 15 mm were far more common than moderate events the relationship between calculated effective precipitation and precipitation for the maize cropland for all 80 precipitation events is shown in fig 5 significant linear relationships were found between effective precipitation amount and precipitation amount 3 4 correlations between canopy interception and the measured variables the i c showed significant positive correlations with all pmfs while i c percentage showed significant negative correlations with all these factors according to pearson correlations analysis p 0 01 fig 6 the i c and i c percentage showed significant correlations with rh and vpd from the npmfs factors at a significance of 0 01 furthermore i c was significantly negatively correlated with at p 0 05 and e p 0 01 other factors besides precipitation amount were found to have no significant partial correlation with i c there was no partial correlation between i c percentage and any of the factors studied there was no significant correlation between i c or i c percentage and lai or mta whether using pearson correlation analysis or partial correlation analysis 3 5 influence of grouping characteristics on interception the variables were divided into three groups pmfs npmfs and plant traits when npmfs and plant traits were excluded the results of variation partitioning showed that the unique effect of pmfs on i c and i c percentage was 47 3 and 35 9 respectively fig 7a c the unique effect of npmfs or plant traits on i c and i c percentage was small the common effects of pmfs and npmfs accounted for 30 1 of variation in i c and 8 6 in i c percentage the common effects of pmfs and plant traits or npmfs and plant traits was less than 1 0 both for i c and i c percentage the common effect of the three groups on i c percentage 2 9 was greater than on i c pmfs had the greatest individual importance on i c and i c percentage respectively p 0 01 table 3 however the individual importance percentage of pmfs on i c percentage was greater than on i c the individual importance of plant traits was less than 0 3 both on i c and i c percentage the residual portion of the three groups on i c was 24 9 whereas the common effects of the three groups was only 43 0 on i c percentage when the variables were divided into four groups precipitation event factors raindrop factors npmfs and plant traits precipitation event factors had the highest unique effect 42 3 and the highest average shared importance 14 1 on i c while raindrop factors had the second highest unique effect 1 0 on i c fig 7b raindrop factors had the highest unique effect 18 9 and the second highest average shared importance 9 3 on i c percentage fig 7d the highest common effect of two groups was precipitation event factors and npmfs for which the effect was 15 0 on i c however the highest common effect of two groups for i c percentage was precipitation event factors and raindrop factors 14 6 the common effect of precipitation event factors and raindrop factors on i c was 4 0 and the other common effects of any two groups were all less than 1 0 for i c or i c percentage precipitation event factors had the highest individual importance 56 4 p 0 001 on i c followed by npmfs table 3 raindrop factors had the highest individual importance 28 3 p 0 001 on i c percentage followed by precipitation event factors the 38 precipitation events close to the date when the lai and mta were measured were chosen to examine variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning to further confirm the effect of plant traits on i c fig 8 when the results for all 80 precipitation events were compared the unique effect of plant traits on i c and i c percentage increased for these 38 events with an increase of more than 5 0 and 19 0 respectively pmfs however still had the greater unique effect and individual importance compared to npmfs and plant traits fig 8 table 3 the residual portion was 27 8 and 51 6 for i c and i c percentage respectively 3 6 influence of variables on interception the adjusted r2 of variation partitioning with all 14 factors was 0 751 on i c table 4 although the total variation was relatively high 75 1 adjusted most of this variation was shared among predictors 0 692 or 69 2 and the unique contributions of factors were generally small the total was 75 1 i e 69 2 5 9 75 1 the adjusted r2 of variation partitioning with all 14 predictors was 0 433 on i c percentage the total contribution was 43 3 i e 44 7 1 4 43 3 in this study precipitation amount had the highest individual importance on i c 30 2 or 40 3 of the total r2 p 0 01 this is the result of precipitation amount having the highest unique effect 5 4 and the highest average shared importance 24 8 duration had the second highest individual importance 22 9 p 0 001 and average shared importance 23 2 but its unique contribution was quite low the unique and individual contributions of lai and mta were both negative on i c percentage d50 had the highest individual importance 9 5 p 0 05 followed by u v 9 4 p 0 001 and f 0 8 4 p 0 001 this is the result of d50 u v and f 0 having a high average shared importance 9 8 9 5 9 1 the individual importance of these factors was primarily from average shared importance and varied slightly as we determined that the amount and duration of precipitation contributed greatly to i c and lai was enhanced in its contribution to canopy interception when only the 38 precipitation events near the measurement date of lai were used we obtained an equation for predicting i c by multiple linear regression as follows i c 0 0675 dur 0 1271 lai p the equation can predict interception amount from precipitation amount p duration dur and lai where r2 0 779 and p 0 001 fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 interception in relation to correlation variables some significant changes in recorded precipitation in this region have occurred as a result of climate change zhang et al 2021a the amount and intensity of precipitation ranged from 0 1 to 67 7 mm and 0 1 4 8 mm h respectively indicating high temporal variability of precipitation events precipitation events that occurred in this region were characterized by being of relatively short duration mean 3 h in this study most of the raindrops had a diameter ranging from 1 6 mm and 1 7 mm and were classified as moderate sized 1 3 mm liu et al 2018 raindrop characteristics tended to be related to intensity with higher intensity associated with increased d50 and u v f 0 was not only related to d50 but also to u v when raindrops reached the canopy li et al 2019 these precipitation event properties meant that rainwater was more likely to be lost while wetting the canopy surface and less likely to pass through the maize crown these findings reflect the uncertainty of the hydrological regime that is common in water limited regions as verified by andrade et al 2016 in this study the mean i c and i c percentage per event were 4 9 mm and 57 6 for maize cropland respectively these results were within the range of 1 7 63 4 for maize reported by frasson and krajewski 2013 and nazari et al 2019 the values were however slightly higher than the results obtained by zheng et al 2018a and wang et al 2016 rainfall intensity in our study mean 1 0 mm h was generally lower than in the above studies meaning that a large amount of precipitation was intercepted and evaporated during yan et al 2019 these results also indicated that a greater variation in i c occurs between different precipitation events therefore analyzing i c on an event basis is preferable to analyzing i c over a growing season or whole year indeed brasil et al 2018 demonstrated that the i c percentage was the same in different years but the amount varied greatly ignoring the canopy intercepted loss by maize or lumping it with evapotranspiration may have a noticeable effect on the results of water balance estimates in addition the i c for maize cropland differs from figures reported in studies of shrubs and forests conducted in similar climatic regions for example zhang et al 2017 found that the i c of a hippophae rhamnoides stand ranged from 0 40 to 4 39 mm per event with an upper limit of about 21 of the total precipitation on the loess plateau wang et al 2005 found that the average interception of a shrub community during the growing season was 6 9 for artemisia ordosica krasch and 11 7 for caragana korshinskii kom according to wang et al 2018 the total i c of an apple orchard was 26 8 39 9 mm from may to september measurements of interception performed in california with pear and cork oak trees revealed that these species intercepted 15 and 27 of precipitation respectively xiao et al 2000 the difference in interception loss between maize and shrubs or forests highlights species specific differences the amount and proportions of i c for maize were statistically significantly correlated with pmfs in general including amount duration intensity and raindrop factors these results are consistent with those of zhang et al 2016 and zheng et al 2018a a negative correlation between percentage interception and amount of precipitation demonstrated that the vegetation becomes saturated as precipitation persists as reported by brasil et al 2018 rainfall intensity determined the amount of interception per unit time which also reflects the dynamic energy on the leaf surface zheng et al 2018a higher intensity rainfall increased the possibility of a raindrop falling from leaves and passing through canopy gaps resulting in a decrease in i c percentage our results showed that there were correlations between rh vpd and i c which is consistent with zheng et al 2018a zhang et al 2015 and grunicke et al 2020 staelens et al 2008 found that ws increased intercepted precipitation zabret and sraj 2019 reported that the different response of i c to ws could be attributed to the different vegetation characteristics of the observed trees as well as their location because the ws in our study area was generally around 1 0 m s the effect on i c was minimal some studies of trees and shrubs have found positive correlations between i c and lai liu et al 2018 brasil et al 2018 yan et al 2021 which is slightly different from our results this could be a species related difference there was no significant relationship between mta and i c or i c percentage because the maximum change in mta after raindrop impact is a function of species and d50 yan et al 2020 ginebra et al 2020 the leaf hairs of maize may enhance the stability of mta against raindrop impact i e the leaf biomechanical properties have an effect holder et al 2020 holder et al 2020 indicated that increasing d50 from 2 7 mm to 3 9 mm resulted in an increased maximum change in mta the leaf inclination angle for quercus gambelii nutt barely changed after each 2 7 mm raindrop drop impact in our study d50 was generally less than 2 0 mm however the variation in mta changes upon raindrop impact between species should be considered and this may be helpful in understanding the dynamic precipitation interception process 4 2 selection of groups and indicators for the interception process there is still no consensus about the relative importance of precipitation event factors raindrop factors npmfs and plant traits in studies quantifying plant interception using variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning analysis precipitation properties were found that have more unique effects and individual contributions than npmfs and plant traits on maize i c which agrees with previous findings staelens et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 grunicke et al 2020 we separated out the raindrop factors within the pmfs and found that the individual contribution of the raindrop factors only explained 8 2 of the i c the results convinced us that precipitation event factors had a greater impact on i c than raindrop factors the effects of different groupings differed between i c and i c percentage for example when the factors were divided into three groups the unique effects of plant traits on i c percentage were greater than on i c the difference in i c and i c percentage could be explained by the fact that the plant canopy has an impact on precipitation redistribution zheng et al 2018a the individual importance percentage of pmfs on i c percentage was greater than i c because the i c percentage included i c and precipitation and the pmfs have more effect on precipitation when the variables were divided into four groups it was found that the relative importance of raindrop factors on the i c percentage increase compared with that on i c regardless of unique contributions or individual importance one explanation could be that the characteristics of raindrops such as diameter and kinetic energy played an important role in raindrops passing through the canopy zhang et al 2016 when the results of different groups were compared the highest contributions to explaining i c and i c percentage were precipitation event factors and raindrop factors respectively precipitation amount and duration the two most important factors worked against each other to drive precipitation partitioning into canopy interception this result is consistent with previous studies brasil et al 2018 nazari et al 2019 earlier studies have found that factors such as at rh and ws have a significant impact on the canopy s water storage capacity zhang et al 2015 concluded that npmfs were not significantly correlated with precipitation partitioning in the 0 30 mm precipitation range moreover only certain individual contributions of rh and vpd were found on i c and there was no individual contribution of rh and vpd to the i c percentage the effects of npmfs may be offset by the interaction of other significant factors leading to a non significant contribution to explaining i c raindrop factors explained a total of about 28 3 of the individual contribution which indicated the non negligible role of raindrop factors in determining i c percentage the d50 effect was the result of the raindrops constantly hitting the leaf surfaces and the water droplets dispersing which affected the ratio of i c and effective precipitation in precipitation partitioning the effect of u v and f 0 on i c percentage was similar to d50 the reduction in canopy wetting with increased u v and f 0 could be attributed to splashing caused by the greater kinetic energy of the larger drops yan et al 2021 therefore the higher i c percentage for rainfed maize cropland was mostly attributed to two causes namely the frequency and duration of light precipitation events as well as the relatively smaller raindrop diameter and downward force by examining the precipitation events close to the date when maize lai was measured we found that the contribution of plant traits to explaining i c particularly i c percentage was increased the results highlight the importance of maize s large crown volume and water absorbing leaves i e leaves covered by dense hairs in canopy interception as well as the significant influence of plant traits on raindrop characteristics in addition because of the obvious changes in maize leaf growth correlations between lai and i c must be based on measurements taken close together rather than a single lai collected once in relation to interception determined over weeks or a long stage as a result frequent measurement of lai is critical for studying the effects of changes in plant traits on interception in general the i c can be predicted with a relatively high accuracy using precipitation amount duration and lai data r2 0 779 4 3 implications for agroecosystem environments understanding the influence of an actively growing crop on canopy interception per event is important for agroecosystem and water management on the loess plateau and other similar water limited regions our results confirmed that interception by the maize canopy accounts for an important portion of the total field water input and should not be ignored when determining water demand or irrigation schedules the equation developed for estimating i c achieved high accuracy using three parameters precipitation amount intensity and lai combined with the peff equation the amount of water available for maize growth and the amount of water that needs to be supplemented can be determined because the numerical values of influencing factors presented in this study are fully quantified and we were able to separate the effects of groups and individual variables on i c they are useful for the modular development of hydrological models 5 conclusions the analysis of this study was based on data from 80 events collected over a four year period 2017 2020 measurements were taken in maize cropland located on the southern loess plateau the cumulative i c of the 80 events accounted for 39 7 of the total precipitation canopy interception accounted for 57 6 of precipitation per event on average the i c percentage was highest during the light precipitation events 0 5 mm all precipitation factors were found to have significantly positive correlations with i c while i c percentage showed significantly negative correlations with all precipitation factors p 0 01 by comparing the variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning results of different groups of factors we found that precipitation event factors precipitation amount duration intensity contribute most to explaining i c and raindrop factors d50 u v f 0 contribute most to explaining i c percentage the common effect of precipitation event factors and non precipitation related factors on i c was highest when we considered only precipitation events close to the date of lai measurement the contribution of plant traits to i c percentage increased and was much greater than for i c it is essential that short term assessments are used if considering lai in relation to i c longer term extrapolations will be inaccurate as a result frequent lai measurement of maize is required the amount of precipitation best explained i c 30 2 and the d50 best explained i c percentage 9 5 according to variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning analysis in relation to meteorological variables and plant traits most of this variation was shared by factors and the unique contributions of factors were generally low our findings highlight the importance of i c in water limited areas and demonstrate the

9060,a thorough understanding of crop canopy interception is crucial for understanding the relationship between water management and agriculture in water limited regions the factors that influence the interception process such as meteorological conditions and plant traits are diverse and uncertain we divided meteorological factors and plant traits into three groups precipitation related meteorological factors including precipitation event factors and raindrop factors non precipitation related meteorological factors air temperature relative humidity wind speed etc and plant traits leaf area index lai and mean leaf inclination angle the contributions of groups and each variable were then quantified with respect to canopy interception this study was based on data from 80 events over four years 2017 2020 measurements were taken under maize zea mays l cropland located on the southern loess plateau the canopy interception i c was calculated as the difference between precipitation and the sum of throughfall and stemflow and all of i c was assumed to be lost to evaporation in the study results showed that the cumulative i c of the 80 events was 395 9 mm accounting for 39 7 of the contemporaneous total precipitation but the mean proportion of canopy interception during each precipitation event i c percentage was greater at 57 6 because of the high interception percentage during light precipitation events 0 5 mm totaling 37 events pearson correlations analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between i c and precipitation related meteorological factors including precipitation amount duration raindrop diameter d50 terminal raindrop velocity u v p 0 01 and intensity average downward force f 0 p 0 05 whereas there was a significant negative correlation between i c percentage and precipitation related meteorological factors p 0 01 because precipitation amount was more affected by precipitation related meteorological factors when the results of different groups were compared precipitation event factors amount duration and intensity and raindrop factors d50 u v f 0 made the highest contribution to explaining i c 56 4 and i c percentage 28 3 respectively both the unique effect and individual importance of plant traits to i c and i c percentage increased when considering the precipitation events which occurred close to the lai measurement date it is essential that short term assessments are used if considering lai in relation to i c precipitation amount had the largest individual importance on i c 30 2 p 0 01 whereas d50 was the analogous variable for i c percentage 9 5 p 0 05 our results confirmed that interception by the maize canopy accounts for an important portion of the total field water input the data and information on the interception process presented in this study should contribute to the understanding of the overall water balance in agroecosystem environments and improve knowledge of the interplay

introduction although there is a lot of water on the earth only about 2 5 of it is fresh oki and kanae 2006 these fresh waters support billions of individuals however human water use climate change and other activities have caused a water crisis for many ecosystems across the world abbott et al 2019 dryland delimited by a precipitation potential evapotranspiration ratio 0 65 covers about 40 of the global landmass sustaining 38 of the world s population white and nackoney 2003 huang et al 2017 magliano et al 2019 sustainable and efficient management of dryland ecosystems requires an in depth understanding of the water cycle and especially of precipitation partitioning processes which govern fresh water input into dryland ecosystems huang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 magliano et al 2019 precipitation is a major component of the hydrological cycle in dryland ecosystems zhang et al 2018 as it moves towards the ground incident gross precipitation is intercepted by the plant canopy and partitioned into three components throughfall stemflow and canopy interception i c zhang et al 2021b throughfall and stemflow replenish soil water and maintain the water supply essential for plant survival zheng et al 2018a interception however is the portion of precipitation retained by the plant canopy and eventually returned to the atmosphere interception plays an important role in ecohydrological processes by increasing evaporation and reducing the amount of water available for infiltration brasil et al 2018 studies on canopy interception processes have been conducted on various plants all of which clearly indicated that it cannot be ignored as an important component of water balance the amount and percentage of canopy interception varies greatly 6 9 27 2 between climatic regions zheng et al 2018b brasil et al 2018 as it depends on factors such as vegetation characteristics wang et al 2018 yan et al 2021 meteorological conditions kozak et al 2007 and precipitation characteristics zhang et al 2016 grunicke et al 2020 some studies have examined different plant growth stages to explore the effect of precipitation factors on canopy interception zheng et al 2018a however the importance of estimating the individual predictor from all response variables has generally been neglected in previous studies frasson and krajewski 2013 indicated that the interaction between raindrops and the canopy changes the microphysical characteristics of precipitation brasil et al 2018 pointed out that interception should not be assessed on an annual scale only because the differences in i c percentage between years are small but the i c percentage per event fluctuates substantially studies of interception carried out per event can better express the correlation between canopy interception and the factors that affect it zhang et al 2016 the majority of studies have focused on interception by plantation vegetation or natural forest stands wang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 grunicke et al 2020 where annual interception commonly amounts to a quarter or more of total precipitation as determined by field measurements or modeling muzylo et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 grunicke et al 2020 as sadeghi et al 2020 pointed out the majority of studies in the literature address canopy interception by trees and shrubs so crop canopy interception requires further investigation kozak et al 2007 nazari et al 2019 some studies have quantified various redistribution processes under crop canopies however these studies reveal inconsistent results with respect to canopy interception with variations across the globe among crops maize which has a high yield and wide adaptability is important in dryland systems maize can be grown under both irrigated and arid conditions from the tropics to temperate regions liu et al 2015 nazari et al 2019 in the last 30 years for example the growing area of maize croplands has increased from 78 6 to 2323 5 km2 in iran nazari et al 2019 the area of winter wheat croplands has decreased by 5730 7 km2 over the last 20 years in shaanxi province china while that of spring maize croplands one of the other main crops has increased slightly zheng et al 2018a found that canopy interception accounted for 12 5 of cumulative gross precipitation during the whole growing season of maize in northwestern china nazari et al 2019 reported that interception by the maize canopy can significantly reduce total water input to the surface in tehran iran 19 9 of natural precipitation maximizing utilization of limited rainwater resources in rainfed agricultural areas is critical to increasing agricultural productivity zheng et al 2018b maize canopies have an impact on the regional water cycle by modifying the distribution of water applied during precipitation nazari et al 2019 as a result the canopy interception of maize should be given more consideration particularly in rainfed agricultural areas we searched the web of science www webofscience com for peer reviewed articles published in english from 1995 to 2022 using the phrases maize interception and corn interception appendix b for inclusion in our study primary studies had to meet the following criteria 1 data were obtained from maize at the individual or ecosystem level 2 for studies only reporting throughfall and stemflow interception was calculated as the difference between the total amount of precipitation and the sum of throughfall and stemflow a dataset of 27 articles was compiled from the 1486 bibliographic references based on these criteria the systematic literature search revealed that there is a gap in the field in relation to quantifying the relative importance of factors affecting maize canopy interception so maize canopy interception requires further study to improve our current understanding of the consequences of the interaction between precipitation and maize canopies and inspired by the newly reported ability to estimate the individual predictors across all response variables lai et al 2022 we aimed to 1 determine canopy interception and the ratio of interception to precipitation in maize cropland from a series of 80 precipitation events in a rainfed agricultural area 2 quantify the individual contributions of different groups of factors and individual variables including meteorological factors and plant traits on canopy interception in maize cropland 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description to better understand the canopy interception process detailed measurements were undertaken in the wangdonggou watershed changwu tableland on the southern loess plateau in northwestern china 35 12 n 107 40 e 1219 0 m a s l fig 1 the watershed is flat with an unsaturated soil depth of more than 50 m on average the climate is temperate continental with rainy summers and dry winters and droughts occur frequently the mean annual precipitation is 519 6 mm period 2000 2018 the precipitation from june to september accounts for about 55 78 of the annual total there is no irrigation water in this region so precipitation is the only water resource for vegetation growth the mean annual temperature is 9 1 c the mean annual hours of sunshine over 2230 h and the frost free period approximately 171 days the maize was planted at an intermediate density of 66 660 plants ha with a row spacing of 50 cm and plant spacing of 30 cm the field management schedule i e application of fertilizer and weed control was based on the local standard management 2 2 meteorological variables meteorological variables were measured from 2017 to 2020 each precipitation event was measured continuously by an automatic meteorological station with 0 1 mm resolution located approximately 300 0 m away from the experimental plots in the present study an individual precipitation event is considered to be one separated by at least 4 0 h from the next the air temperature at c relative humidity rh at a height of 2 m and wind speed ws m s at a height of 10 m were also monitored by the meteorological station m520 vaisala company finland to understand the synergistic effect of at and rh the vapor pressure

in each category were shown in table 1 effective precipitation peff is the fraction of the total precipitation that is available to meet crop water needs with deep percolation surface runoff and interception loss excluded the soil is deep more than 50 m and flat the soils have a high infiltration capacity with a steady infiltration rate of 1 35 mm min therefore the effects of surface runoff subsurface runoff and deep seepage can be ignored the simplified equation for peff estimation was p eff p i c measurement of i c canopy interception will be described later 2 3 plant traits the mean growth period of maize is about 150 days from mid april to mid september in this study the sowing dates were 16 april 20 april 16 april and 19 april in 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively maize has an upright stalk and is usually unbranched the leaf blades are flat and broad with a linear lanceolate shape the leaves are covered with pubescent hairs the midribs are thick and the leaf edges are slightly rough the specific characteristics of normally growing maize are presented in table 2 both the leaf area index lai and the mean leaf inclination angle mta were obtained by photographing the canopy with an optical fisheye digital camera nikon d7200 nikon af dx 10 5 mm f 2 8 g ed each week to avoid the influence of rapid changes in the light environment and low color contrast between the blue sky and green plants on measurement results canopy photographs were taken on cloudy and sunny days before sunrise or after sunset the sampling was randomly repeated three times in each plot located at the center or 1 4 of the way along the diagonal of the plot the camera was kept horizontally on a tripod when shooting and the shooting direction was determined by the height of the maize the lens field of view should not cover the parts outside the sample site and the operator s body parts should not be included in the photograph lai and mta data were processed and the values calculated by can eye software v6 47 eight clear photographs were selected for processing the illumination effect could be ignored because the photographs were taken in conditions of uniform light and no direct light latitude longitude slope and terrain are all entered based on the actual situation at the measuring point calibration experiments for the optical center and projection function were required for a given camera fish eye system according to the user manual https www6 paca inrae fr can eye 2 4 canopy interception measurement the amount of canopy interception i c was obtained indirectly by measuring the amount of throughfall and stemflow all of i c was assumed to be lost to evaporation in the study the periods during which maize canopy interception was measured were from 5 july to 11 september 2017 9 july to 5 september 2018 28 june to 17 september 2019 and 27 june to 10 september 2020 the maize cropland is 49 5 m long and 20 0 m wide with a total area of 990 m2 each experimental maize plot was 16 5 m long and 10 0 m wide with six plot replicates throughfall was measured at one point in each plot using horizontal iron troughs 90 0 cm long and 50 0 cm wide the iron trough was positioned between rows at the center of each plot two maize plants in the center of each plot were used to obtain the stemflow stemflow was collected using a breathable but dense sponge funnel affixed to the stem of each sample maize plant at a height of 30 cm to ensure the normal growth of maize and the funnel was sealed by neutral silicone caulking the funnel was tightly connected to the stalk and sealed with neutral silicone the simulated water flow was used to determine if there was any leakage after the silicone solidified the diameter of funnel was controlled to the minimum to avoid overestimating stemflow by collecting throughfall a pipe with a diameter of 1 2 cm was used to connect the collection device and the storage container and channeled stemflow from the funnel to container with minimum travel time the amounts of throughfall stored in the iron troughs and stemflow in the containers were manually weighed if the precipitation events ended during the daytime the collection of throughfall and stemflow was usually completed within two hours after the end of events to minimize evaporation if the precipitation events ended at night the collection of throughfall and stemflow was completed as soon as possible in the next morning these apparatuses were periodically checked against leakages or blockages caused by insects and fallen leaves throughfall and stemflow volumes were converted to equivalent water depth using the iron trough bottom area and maize canopy area respectively therefore the canopy interception i c was obtained and calculated as follows i c p tf sf where p is the precipitation mm tf is the throughfall mm and sf is the stemflow mm 2 5 statistical analyses to determine the relative importance of each group pmfs npmfs and plant traits independently or in combination variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning based on canopy interception were used yang et al 2019 lai et al 2022 canopy interception as the response variable was applied to partitioning of variation and the separate contributions obtained were variation explained by pmfs independent of npmfs and plant traits variation explained by npmfs independent of pmfs and plant traits variation explained by plant traits lai mta independent of pmfs and npmfs the pmfs were then subdivided into two groups in order to explore the effect of precipitation characteristics and raindrop characteristics on i c 1 precipitation event factors factors related to precipitation event i e precipitation amount duration and intensity 2 raindrop factors factors related to raindrops i e d50 u v and f 0 these analyses were carried out in r software using the rdacca hp library lai et al 2022 spss 24 0 statistical software was used for the statistical analyses spss inc chicago usa origin 2018 originlab corporation usa for windows and r software were used to create all of the figures 3 results 3 1 characteristics of the precipitation and non precipitation related meteorological factors the probability density and cumulative distribution of pmfs and npmfs are presented in fig 2 the precipitation amount ranged from 0 1 to 67 7 mm for the 80 events with a total of 1055 5 mm and an average of 13 2 mm the most likely precipitation event had 2 8 mm of precipitation the duration varied from 1 0 to 84 0 h the most likely precipitation event duration was 3 h there were 50 events with light precipitation 0 5 2 5 mm h over the whole experimental period the most likely precipitation event had an intensity of 0 4 mm h the d50 ranged from 1 3 to 1 9 mm with a mean of 1 5 mm the u v ranged from 4 6 to 5 1 mm s the most likely precipitation event had a velocity of 4 9 mm s the mean f 0 was 10 1 mg m s the mean e was 0 3 the mean at was 20 0 c with the highest probability density approximately 18 7 c the mean rh was 88 2 over the experimental period the ws ranged from 0 1 to 2 2 m s with an average of 1 2 m s and the highest probability density approximately 0 9 m s the vpd was 0 3 kpa on average 3 2 characteristics of the plant traits fig 3 shows the lai and mta dynamics of maize cropland over the whole experimental period leaf area index represents the density of leaves in the canopy lai exhibited an increasing trend to a maximum value which then gradually decreased the mean lai was 3 3 during the observation period the mta is the angle formed by the intersection of the surfaces of leaves and flat ground the mta ranged from 21 3 to 66 0 with a mean of 51 1 3 3 canopy interception characteristics over the measurement period a total of 80 precipitation events were recorded and measured for i c analysis fig 4 the i c of the precipitation events ranged from 0 1 mm to 29 1 mm with an average of 4 9 mm the cumulative i c of the 80 events was 395 9 mm accounting for 39 7 of the cumulative precipitation amount 996 3 mm there were 23 events where the precipitation was completely intercepted accounting for 1 5 of the total precipitation amount on average i c accounted for 57 6 of precipitation during the events after excluding the precipitation events less than 5 mm i c accounted for 37 3 of precipitation during the events the i c percentage was highest in the light precipitation events 0 5 mm and then decreased when the precipitation was less than 2 0 mm the i c percentage was at its maximum 85 6 while when it was greater than 15 0 mm the i c percentage was at its minimum 36 8 the frequency distributions of interception amount show that light and heavy precipitation events 2 0 mm and 15 mm were far more common than moderate events the relationship between calculated effective precipitation and precipitation for the maize cropland for all 80 precipitation events is shown in fig 5 significant linear relationships were found between effective precipitation amount and precipitation amount 3 4 correlations between canopy interception and the measured variables the i c showed significant positive correlations with all pmfs while i c percentage showed significant negative correlations with all these factors according to pearson correlations analysis p 0 01 fig 6 the i c and i c percentage showed significant correlations with rh and vpd from the npmfs factors at a significance of 0 01 furthermore i c was significantly negatively correlated with at p 0 05 and e p 0 01 other factors besides precipitation amount were found to have no significant partial correlation with i c there was no partial correlation between i c percentage and any of the factors studied there was no significant correlation between i c or i c percentage and lai or mta whether using pearson correlation analysis or partial correlation analysis 3 5 influence of grouping characteristics on interception the variables were divided into three groups pmfs npmfs and plant traits when npmfs and plant traits were excluded the results of variation partitioning showed that the unique effect of pmfs on i c and i c percentage was 47 3 and 35 9 respectively fig 7a c the unique effect of npmfs or plant traits on i c and i c percentage was small the common effects of pmfs and npmfs accounted for 30 1 of variation in i c and 8 6 in i c percentage the common effects of pmfs and plant traits or npmfs and plant traits was less than 1 0 both for i c and i c percentage the common effect of the three groups on i c percentage 2 9 was greater than on i c pmfs had the greatest individual importance on i c and i c percentage respectively p 0 01 table 3 however the individual importance percentage of pmfs on i c percentage was greater than on i c the individual importance of plant traits was less than 0 3 both on i c and i c percentage the residual portion of the three groups on i c was 24 9 whereas the common effects of the three groups was only 43 0 on i c percentage when the variables were divided into four groups precipitation event factors raindrop factors npmfs and plant traits precipitation event factors had the highest unique effect 42 3 and the highest average shared importance 14 1 on i c while raindrop factors had the second highest unique effect 1 0 on i c fig 7b raindrop factors had the highest unique effect 18 9 and the second highest average shared importance 9 3 on i c percentage fig 7d the highest common effect of two groups was precipitation event factors and npmfs for which the effect was 15 0 on i c however the highest common effect of two groups for i c percentage was precipitation event factors and raindrop factors 14 6 the common effect of precipitation event factors and raindrop factors on i c was 4 0 and the other common effects of any two groups were all less than 1 0 for i c or i c percentage precipitation event factors had the highest individual importance 56 4 p 0 001 on i c followed by npmfs table 3 raindrop factors had the highest individual importance 28 3 p 0 001 on i c percentage followed by precipitation event factors the 38 precipitation events close to the date when the lai and mta were measured were chosen to examine variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning to further confirm the effect of plant traits on i c fig 8 when the results for all 80 precipitation events were compared the unique effect of plant traits on i c and i c percentage increased for these 38 events with an increase of more than 5 0 and 19 0 respectively pmfs however still had the greater unique effect and individual importance compared to npmfs and plant traits fig 8 table 3 the residual portion was 27 8 and 51 6 for i c and i c percentage respectively 3 6 influence of variables on interception the adjusted r2 of variation partitioning with all 14 factors was 0 751 on i c table 4 although the total variation was relatively high 75 1 adjusted most of this variation was shared among predictors 0 692 or 69 2 and the unique contributions of factors were generally small the total was 75 1 i e 69 2 5 9 75 1 the adjusted r2 of variation partitioning with all 14 predictors was 0 433 on i c percentage the total contribution was 43 3 i e 44 7 1 4 43 3 in this study precipitation amount had the highest individual importance on i c 30 2 or 40 3 of the total r2 p 0 01 this is the result of precipitation amount having the highest unique effect 5 4 and the highest average shared importance 24 8 duration had the second highest individual importance 22 9 p 0 001 and average shared importance 23 2 but its unique contribution was quite low the unique and individual contributions of lai and mta were both negative on i c percentage d50 had the highest individual importance 9 5 p 0 05 followed by u v 9 4 p 0 001 and f 0 8 4 p 0 001 this is the result of d50 u v and f 0 having a high average shared importance 9 8 9 5 9 1 the individual importance of these factors was primarily from average shared importance and varied slightly as we determined that the amount and duration of precipitation contributed greatly to i c and lai was enhanced in its contribution to canopy interception when only the 38 precipitation events near the measurement date of lai were used we obtained an equation for predicting i c by multiple linear regression as follows i c 0 0675 dur 0 1271 lai p the equation can predict interception amount from precipitation amount p duration dur and lai where r2 0 779 and p 0 001 fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 interception in relation to correlation variables some significant changes in recorded precipitation in this region have occurred as a result of climate change zhang et al 2021a the amount and intensity of precipitation ranged from 0 1 to 67 7 mm and 0 1 4 8 mm h respectively indicating high temporal variability of precipitation events precipitation events that occurred in this region were characterized by being of relatively short duration mean 3 h in this study most of the raindrops had a diameter ranging from 1 6 mm and 1 7 mm and were classified as moderate sized 1 3 mm liu et al 2018 raindrop characteristics tended to be related to intensity with higher intensity associated with increased d50 and u v f 0 was not only related to d50 but also to u v when raindrops reached the canopy li et al 2019 these precipitation event properties meant that rainwater was more likely to be lost while wetting the canopy surface and less likely to pass through the maize crown these findings reflect the uncertainty of the hydrological regime that is common in water limited regions as verified by andrade et al 2016 in this study the mean i c and i c percentage per event were 4 9 mm and 57 6 for maize cropland respectively these results were within the range of 1 7 63 4 for maize reported by frasson and krajewski 2013 and nazari et al 2019 the values were however slightly higher than the results obtained by zheng et al 2018a and wang et al 2016 rainfall intensity in our study mean 1 0 mm h was generally lower than in the above studies meaning that a large amount of precipitation was intercepted and evaporated during yan et al 2019 these results also indicated that a greater variation in i c occurs between different precipitation events therefore analyzing i c on an event basis is preferable to analyzing i c over a growing season or whole year indeed brasil et al 2018 demonstrated that the i c percentage was the same in different years but the amount varied greatly ignoring the canopy intercepted loss by maize or lumping it with evapotranspiration may have a noticeable effect on the results of water balance estimates in addition the i c for maize cropland differs from figures reported in studies of shrubs and forests conducted in similar climatic regions for example zhang et al 2017 found that the i c of a hippophae rhamnoides stand ranged from 0 40 to 4 39 mm per event with an upper limit of about 21 of the total precipitation on the loess plateau wang et al 2005 found that the average interception of a shrub community during the growing season was 6 9 for artemisia ordosica krasch and 11 7 for caragana korshinskii kom according to wang et al 2018 the total i c of an apple orchard was 26 8 39 9 mm from may to september measurements of interception performed in california with pear and cork oak trees revealed that these species intercepted 15 and 27 of precipitation respectively xiao et al 2000 the difference in interception loss between maize and shrubs or forests highlights species specific differences the amount and proportions of i c for maize were statistically significantly correlated with pmfs in general including amount duration intensity and raindrop factors these results are consistent with those of zhang et al 2016 and zheng et al 2018a a negative correlation between percentage interception and amount of precipitation demonstrated that the vegetation becomes saturated as precipitation persists as reported by brasil et al 2018 rainfall intensity determined the amount of interception per unit time which also reflects the dynamic energy on the leaf surface zheng et al 2018a higher intensity rainfall increased the possibility of a raindrop falling from leaves and passing through canopy gaps resulting in a decrease in i c percentage our results showed that there were correlations between rh vpd and i c which is consistent with zheng et al 2018a zhang et al 2015 and grunicke et al 2020 staelens et al 2008 found that ws increased intercepted precipitation zabret and sraj 2019 reported that the different response of i c to ws could be attributed to the different vegetation characteristics of the observed trees as well as their location because the ws in our study area was generally around 1 0 m s the effect on i c was minimal some studies of trees and shrubs have found positive correlations between i c and lai liu et al 2018 brasil et al 2018 yan et al 2021 which is slightly different from our results this could be a species related difference there was no significant relationship between mta and i c or i c percentage because the maximum change in mta after raindrop impact is a function of species and d50 yan et al 2020 ginebra et al 2020 the leaf hairs of maize may enhance the stability of mta against raindrop impact i e the leaf biomechanical properties have an effect holder et al 2020 holder et al 2020 indicated that increasing d50 from 2 7 mm to 3 9 mm resulted in an increased maximum change in mta the leaf inclination angle for quercus gambelii nutt barely changed after each 2 7 mm raindrop drop impact in our study d50 was generally less than 2 0 mm however the variation in mta changes upon raindrop impact between species should be considered and this may be helpful in understanding the dynamic precipitation interception process 4 2 selection of groups and indicators for the interception process there is still no consensus about the relative importance of precipitation event factors raindrop factors npmfs and plant traits in studies quantifying plant interception using variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning analysis precipitation properties were found that have more unique effects and individual contributions than npmfs and plant traits on maize i c which agrees with previous findings staelens et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 grunicke et al 2020 we separated out the raindrop factors within the pmfs and found that the individual contribution of the raindrop factors only explained 8 2 of the i c the results convinced us that precipitation event factors had a greater impact on i c than raindrop factors the effects of different groupings differed between i c and i c percentage for example when the factors were divided into three groups the unique effects of plant traits on i c percentage were greater than on i c the difference in i c and i c percentage could be explained by the fact that the plant canopy has an impact on precipitation redistribution zheng et al 2018a the individual importance percentage of pmfs on i c percentage was greater than i c because the i c percentage included i c and precipitation and the pmfs have more effect on precipitation when the variables were divided into four groups it was found that the relative importance of raindrop factors on the i c percentage increase compared with that on i c regardless of unique contributions or individual importance one explanation could be that the characteristics of raindrops such as diameter and kinetic energy played an important role in raindrops passing through the canopy zhang et al 2016 when the results of different groups were compared the highest contributions to explaining i c and i c percentage were precipitation event factors and raindrop factors respectively precipitation amount and duration the two most important factors worked against each other to drive precipitation partitioning into canopy interception this result is consistent with previous studies brasil et al 2018 nazari et al 2019 earlier studies have found that factors such as at rh and ws have a significant impact on the canopy s water storage capacity zhang et al 2015 concluded that npmfs were not significantly correlated with precipitation partitioning in the 0 30 mm precipitation range moreover only certain individual contributions of rh and vpd were found on i c and there was no individual contribution of rh and vpd to the i c percentage the effects of npmfs may be offset by the interaction of other significant factors leading to a non significant contribution to explaining i c raindrop factors explained a total of about 28 3 of the individual contribution which indicated the non negligible role of raindrop factors in determining i c percentage the d50 effect was the result of the raindrops constantly hitting the leaf surfaces and the water droplets dispersing which affected the ratio of i c and effective precipitation in precipitation partitioning the effect of u v and f 0 on i c percentage was similar to d50 the reduction in canopy wetting with increased u v and f 0 could be attributed to splashing caused by the greater kinetic energy of the larger drops yan et al 2021 therefore the higher i c percentage for rainfed maize cropland was mostly attributed to two causes namely the frequency and duration of light precipitation events as well as the relatively smaller raindrop diameter and downward force by examining the precipitation events close to the date when maize lai was measured we found that the contribution of plant traits to explaining i c particularly i c percentage was increased the results highlight the importance of maize s large crown volume and water absorbing leaves i e leaves covered by dense hairs in canopy interception as well as the significant influence of plant traits on raindrop characteristics in addition because of the obvious changes in maize leaf growth correlations between lai and i c must be based on measurements taken close together rather than a single lai collected once in relation to interception determined over weeks or a long stage as a result frequent measurement of lai is critical for studying the effects of changes in plant traits on interception in general the i c can be predicted with a relatively high accuracy using precipitation amount duration and lai data r2 0 779 4 3 implications for agroecosystem environments understanding the influence of an actively growing crop on canopy interception per event is important for agroecosystem and water management on the loess plateau and other similar water limited regions our results confirmed that interception by the maize canopy accounts for an important portion of the total field water input and should not be ignored when determining water demand or irrigation schedules the equation developed for estimating i c achieved high accuracy using three parameters precipitation amount intensity and lai combined with the peff equation the amount of water available for maize growth and the amount of water that needs to be supplemented can be determined because the numerical values of influencing factors presented in this study are fully quantified and we were able to separate the effects of groups and individual variables on i c they are useful for the modular development of hydrological models 5 conclusions the analysis of this study was based on data from 80 events collected over a four year period 2017 2020 measurements were taken in maize cropland located on the southern loess plateau the cumulative i c of the 80 events accounted for 39 7 of the total precipitation canopy interception accounted for 57 6 of precipitation per event on average the i c percentage was highest during the light precipitation events 0 5 mm all precipitation factors were found to have significantly positive correlations with i c while i c percentage showed significantly negative correlations with all precipitation factors p 0 01 by comparing the variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning results of different groups of factors we found that precipitation event factors precipitation amount duration intensity contribute most to explaining i c and raindrop factors d50 u v f 0 contribute most to explaining i c percentage the common effect of precipitation event factors and non precipitation related factors on i c was highest when we considered only precipitation events close to the date of lai measurement the contribution of plant traits to i c percentage increased and was much greater than for i c it is essential that short term assessments are used if considering lai in relation to i c longer term extrapolations will be inaccurate as a result frequent lai measurement of maize is required the amount of precipitation best explained i c 30 2 and the d50 best explained i c percentage 9 5 according to variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning analysis in relation to meteorological variables and plant traits most of this variation was shared by factors and the unique contributions of factors were generally low our findings highlight the importance of i c in water limited areas and demonstrate the

9061,clarifying the relationship between salt affected soils and their adjacent river systems is critical to address the challenges posed by soil salinization on agricultural production among the various biophysical and land management factors linked to soil salinization few studies have investigated the importance of the distance along the river based on the hetao irrigation district of the yellow river basin we collected 5314 soil samples and analyzed 17 soil parameters to explore the relationship between salt affected soils and their distance along the river soil salinization was reinforced by the distance along the river as a trade off between soil ion accumulation and nutrient regulation soil total water soluble salt content increased by 16 4 mg kg 1 every kilometer likely due to ions leaching from the soils upstream and partially accumulating in the soils downstream especially for cl so4 2 and na greater input and less solubility of ca2 based soil amendments phosphorus fertilizers and organic materials on the less salt affected soils upstream may explain the declines in soil ca2 available phosphorus and soil organic matter with distance along the river with every kilometer along the river soil exchangeable sodium and cation exchange capacity increased by 8 89 10 4 and 1 26 10 2 cmol kg 1 respectively which led to an increase in soil exchangeable sodium percentage by 9 59 10 5 the increase in soil exchangeable sodium along the river was mainly due to na accumulation while soil cation exchange capacity was regulated by soil organic matter and total nitrogen soil ph increased by 1 21 10 3 per kilometer along the river associated with the decrease of soil organic matter future saline soil amelioration and reutilization initiatives at regional scales may be improved by accounting for the changes in soil physicochemical properties resulting from the distance along the river graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil salinization cation exchange capacity exchangeable sodium percentage soil ph structural equation model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally soil salinization has been recognized as a pressing issue that threatens agricultural production ecosystem health and food security hopmans et al 2021 approximately one billion hectares of arid and semi arid areas remain barren due to salinity or water scarcity and nearly 20 of irrigated land is affected by secondary salinization sahab et al 2021 china for instance has 34 million hectares of saline soil 36 of which can be potentially used for agricultural production after amelioration wang et al 2017 soil salinization is not just a function of the properties of the soil itself but also the water related conditions of the surrounding land hayat et al 2019 hence salt affected soils frequently occur in alluvial plains intensively irrigated districts and river valleys such as the indo gangetic basin in india the indus basin in pakistan and the yellow river basin in china the level of soil salinity in these regions is closely related to the spatial distribution of their river systems shahid et al 2018 therefore to promote amelioration of saline soils and their subsequent reutilization in salt affected regions the spatial relationships between local river systems and salt affected soils must first be understood the distance along the river dar is a crucial parameter for characterizing the relationship between river systems and their adjacent soils it is defined as the curve length from the entrance point of the river into the study area to the projection point of the specific sampling site as illustrated in fig 1 for the yellow river it may also be an important factor influencing soil salinization throughout the stream network kaushal et al 2017 generally the groundwater table becomes shallower with increasing dar leading to an upward movement and accumulation of salt in surface soils mao et al 2020 indeed human dominated land and water use accelerates weathering and increases anthropogenic salts and available and total nutrients jin et al 2021 and yet it is the physical processes such as salt transport pathways irrigation and drainage practices that modulate the relationship between dar and soil salinization a previous study demonstrated that the accumulation of ions and water extractable organic matter in streams increase from upstream to downstream zhang et al 2021 but whether it contributed greatly to soil salinization in the irrigated agriculutral district remains to be determined clarifying the nature of this relationship will provide much needed scientific support for sustainable soil and water use saline soil amelioration and soil health maintenance in salt affected regions although several studies have focused on the drivers of primary and secondary salinities daliakopoulos et al 2016 hayat et al 2019 hopmans et al 2021 few have isolated the role of dar in relation to soil salinization severe soil salinization is characterized by high values for total water soluble salt content ph and exchangeable sodium percentage esp which is determined by the ratio of exchangeable sodium to the cation exchange capacity cec sahab et al 2021 both soil total water soluble salt and ph are usually affected by the soil ions where major cations of saline soil are sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 and major anions are chloride cl sulphate so4 2 bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 qadir et al 2000 in addition soil exchangeable sodium and cec are mainly influenced by soil ions and soil nutrients hopmans et al 2021 and soil nutrients have been correlated with soil organic matter som total nitrogen tn alkaline hydrolyzed nitrogen available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium here we have explored the relationship between dar and the extent of soil salinization in the hetao irrigation district china by sampling and analyzing 5314 soil samples the main objective of this work is to define the relationship between dar and soil cations na k ca2 and mg2 anions cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 nutrients som tn alkaline hydrolyzed nitrogen available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium and salinization indexes total water soluble salt soil ph exchangeable sodium cec and esp we will determine whether dar relates to soil salinization and if so the nature and intensity of this relationship i e direct or indirect we hypothesize that soil salinization is reinforced by dar directly and indirectly related to soil ions and nutrients 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district 40 19 41 18 n 106 20 109 19 e is located in the northern section of the yellow river the second longest river in china it is an alluvial flood plain and represents a typical salt affected region of the river system the average elevation is 1007 1050 m nie et al 2021 it is tilted from southwest to northeast with a 0 2 slope and bordered by the langshan mountain to the north and the yellow river to the south fig 1 it is one of the largest irrigation districts and most important agricultural production regions in china with 5 7 105 ha of irrigated land and 1 12 106 ha of total area the salt concentration of the irrigation water taken from the yellow river is 0 6 g l 1 chang et al 2019 zhai et al 2021 which was higher downstream than upstream the average annual rainfall ranges from 130 to 200 mm characterizing its arid to semi arid continental climate li et al 2020a this region suffers from water shortages due to the large discrepancy between rainfall and evaporation zhang et al 2020b and so irrigation primarily coming from the yellow river is essential for crop production in addition soil salinization is another limiting factor for agricultural development in this region with 45 of its arable land susceptible to soil salinization li et al 2020b the soils are formed by lake and alluvial sediments deposits which led to finer soil textures following directional patterns in other words soil textures are sandy loam to silt loam in the southern and western parts while they are silt to clay in the northern and eastern parts ren et al 2016 more detailed information can be found in guo et al 2008 2 2 soil sampling and measurement soil samples were collected from 7 2 104 ha of arable land before irrigation in november and december 2017 using a grid sampling strategy fig 1 first the borders of 5399 sampling sites with an area of 13 3 3 3 ha per site were outlined next a subsampling site of 3 3 ha was selected randomly from each sampling site and finally ten representative soil subsamples were collected from the subsampling site to produce one composite sample fig s1 all sampling positions were located using a global positioning system device overall a total of 5399 composite samples were collected from the 0 20 cm soil depth by an electric soil auger in the field of which 5314 samples were ultimately measured and 85 samples rejected due to unclear labelling or poor preservation only active arable lands were sampled and the regions that were not sampled were mostly barren due to salinity or water scarcity in other words similar land use type cropping system irrigation regime and so on were ensured at a regional scale a total of 17 soil parameters were analyzed four types of

determined using a continuous flow analyzer skalar analytical breda netherlands and flame photometry bwb technologies newbury uk respectively the total water soluble salt was measured using the residual drying method and its threshold values for non slightly moderately and highly saline soil are 2 4 6 and 10 g kg 1 in the hetao irrigation district respectively table s1 the soil ph was assessed with a ph meter in a 1 2 5 soil to water suspension with similar readings and following a linear relationship with the 1 5 soil to water suspension international standard huang et al 2021 the exchangeable sodium was extracted with 1 m nh4oac deionized water and detected using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa 7000 shimadzu inc japan the cec was measured by the sodium acetate

with dar the fact that the concentrations of most water extractable ions showed an increasing trend with dar could be the result of irrigation and drainage in the arable lands with these ions being dissolved from soils upstream and subsequently transported along the river to be accumulated in soils downstream paudyal et al 2016 conversely water extractable ca2 is known to be converted into insoluble salts such as caco3 and release soluble cations such as na ca2 based soil amendments such as commercial calcium sulfate and flue gas desulfurization gypsum have been regularly applied during saline land amelioration in this region wang et al 2017 notably the lands upstream generally had lower salt contents than downstream implying a positive feedback loop where land managers preferentially select these less saline lands to ameliorate for cultivation over more saline lands downstream li et al 2020b these processes could explain the decreases in soil ca2 content and the ratio of ca2 to mg2 fig s3 and the increase in soil na content upstream to downstream this region is notably distributed with sulfate chloride and chloride sulfate saline soils as indicated by the much higher contents of cl 1 83 3 68 g kg 1 means standard deviations so4 2 1 60 2 70 g kg 1 and na 0 93 2 17 g kg 1 compared to the other ions fig 2 the fact that the rates of increase for cl na and so4 2 were more than ten times the rates of mg2 hco3 co3 2 and k calls for special attention to be put on these three ions in soils with greater dar zhou et al 2021 4 2 total and available nutrient relationships with dar the accumulation of water extractable organic matter is known to increase from upstream to downstream in river systems dong et al 2020 stutter and cains 2017 ye et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 leading to this study s hypothesis that the som content would increase in soils upstream to downstream however the response of som to dar was more influenced by carbon inputs from organic materials e g crop residues than those from irrigation water the retention of organic materials in the fields is indeed one of the main strategies for saline soil amelioration in this region which directly increases som contents huo et al 2017 as discussed before land managers preferentially select these less saline lands upstream to ameliorate for cultivation over more saline lands downstream li et al 2020b crop performance and distribution also contributed to the variation of som content with dar crops grew better in upstream areas compared to downstream areas partly due to a higher ratio of ca2 to mg2 karimov et al 2009 this ratio decreased remarkably with dar fig s3 and played a negative role in regulating crop growth in addition the percentage of wheat and maize planting area decreased while that of sunflower and saline tolerant forage increased with dar associated with soil salinity content in upstream and downstream areas gao et al 2021 the residues of wheat and maize were partly returned to the soil while the residues of sunflower and forage were usually removed from the farmland in this region therefore som decreased with dar due to both increases in below and aboveground organic material inputs in the land upstream than downstream conversely tn increased with dar due to higher chemical n fertilizer input in the downstream area lower productivity in the downstream areas usually resulted in farmers applying more n fertilizer to boost crop growth more n application but less crop absorption led to more n accumulation in the soils downstream than soils upstream zhang et al 2016 therefore a relatively lower ratio of som to tn was detected in the soil downstream compared to upstream fig 3a and b overall these results would suggest that more organic material inputs and less chemical n fertilizer inputs are a possible recommendation for this region especially for the soils downstream this study found no significant linear correlation between alkaline hydrolyzed n and dar only surface soils 0 20 cm were collected after crop harvest in this study in other words potential factors like soil sampling depth sampling period seepage losses and study area may weaken or alter the relationship of dar on soil alkaline hydrolyzed n content the soils in this region were poor in available phosphorus 21 4 19 7 mg kg 1 means standard deviations fig 3d therefore phosphorus fertilizer has been typically applied annually in this region e g 124 5 kg p2o5 ha 1 for maize zhang et al 2013 phosphorus is easily fixed in soils through adsorption and chemical reaction an et al 2013 as mentioned before less saline lands upstream were earlier cultivated than more saline lands downstream which led to more phosphorus accumulation in the lands upstream these factors help explain why the available phosphorus content decreased with dar in contrast the soil in this region is rich in exchangeable potassium 250 154 mg kg 1 fig 3e promoting dissolution from the soils upstream transportation along the river and accumulation in the soils downstream these processes are intensified as a result of irrigation and drainage in the saline lands therefore the exchangeable potassium content increased with dar these results would suggest the need for more phosphorus application and less potassium fertilizers in downstream areas 4 3 soil salinization relationship with dar the cec was mainly associated with the total nutrients including tn and som in this study kang et al 2021 supported by the comparatively higher path coefficients fig 5a even though the cec was closely related with som beldin et al 2007 oorts et al 2003 the cec was more associated with tn fig s2c these results indicate that the cec of the saline soil with low som content 11 4 4 4 g kg 1 means standard deviations depended more on mineral surfaces indexed with tn than organic surfaces indexed with som zhang et al 2020a and the cec increase with dar is mainly associated with the increases in soil tn field practices aimed at increasing som and or tn therefore have the potential to also increase soil cec this supports the hypothesis that n fertilization promotes plant growth under salt stress conditions through reducing ion accumulation pang et al 2005 demonstrated here due to the simultaneous increase in soil cec and tn this also explains why such high amounts of n fertilizer are commonly applied in this region the exchangeable sodium was mainly associated with cations especially na sidi et al 2015 with high path coefficients between exchangeable sodium and cations na fig 5a and s2a therefore the increase of exchangeable sodium with dar was likely due to na accumulation from the soils upstream to downstream this result also indicates that bad drainage systems may increase esp for the soils downstream the ratio of exchangeable sodium to cec i e esp was more determined by exchangeable sodium compared to cec confirmed by the higher path coefficient from exchangeable sodium to esp than that from cec to esp fig 5a these results indicate that the increase of esp with dar was mainly caused by the greater contribution of na to total cations in the soils downstream than that upstream field management strategies aiming to decreasing soil na content such as underground pipe drainage zhou et al 2021 therefore has the potential to decrease esp in this region especially with increasing dar soil total water soluble salt was mainly influenced by anions and cations fig 5a especially for cl so4 2 and na fig s2a and b and most ions increased with dar furthermore saline land amelioration in this region usually combines with irrigation and drainage which reduce the natural salt contents upstream and further encouraging preferential cultivation therefore total water soluble salt likely increased due to ions leaching from the soils upstream and accumulating in the soils downstream a high path coefficient was found from dar to soil ph which was attributed to other factors associated with dar influencing soil ph such as terrain landform climate conditions and vegetation distribution hopmans et al 2021 soil ph was negatively correlated with total nutrients fig 5a specifically soil ph was mainly affected by som fig s2c indicating that field management practices for increasing som also have the potential to decrease soil ph these results suggest that soil ph increased due to the decrease in som with dar notably soil ph was also positively associated with available nutrients fig 5a especially available phosphorus fig s2d some studies have demonstrated that saline soil amelioration and utilization increased soil ph li et al 2015 sun et al 2013 2012 simultaneously with the increases of available nutrient contents due to fertilization and irrigation overall dar is an important factor for soil salinization as it determines the dynamics of several key soil parameters for sustainable agricultural production in salt affected regions 4 4 uncertainties and implications the increase of soil salinity content with dar can be attributed to the progressively slower flow of the river system the higher salt concentration of the irrigation water and the shallower groundwater table therefore there will be less leaching and more upward movement and accumulation of salt in surface soils downstream than upstream mao et al 2020 it is important to note that the studied soil is predominantly loess in the hetao irrigation district where soil salts are more likely dissolved and run off during waterlogged conditions overall the dar is a fundamental parameter linked to soil salinization in the yellow river basin fig 7 but further research is needed to test whether this concept applies for other river systems the increase of soil salinity with dar may be overestimated due to more salt leaching in soil upstream areas than downstream areas for example saline lands upstream have longer utilization history than those downstream and the salinity in the surface soils is decreased through salt leaching during saline soil utilization chang et al 2019 in addition the percentage of wheat and maize planting area decreases and that of sunflower and forage area increases with dar gao et al 2021 it has been reported that greater salt leaching is associated with more irrigation per unit of wheat and maize area compared to sunflower and forage area li et al 2020a therefore the longer time period of saline soil utilization and more fresh water consumption per unit of area in upstream areas compared to downstream areas will likely cause an overestimation of the increase of soil salinity with dar other uncertainties may result from the soil sampling depth and sampling period in this study as secondary salinization is often coupled with saline soil utilization in the irrigated regions and salt accumulation in surface soils typically occurs after crop harvest in this region zhang et al 2020b overall the relationship between dar and soil salinization is closely integrated to intrinsic soil characteristics and anthropogenic activities such as soil fertility and salinity crop performance and distribution as well as field management it is noteworthy that more studies on the relationship of soil salinity and dar are needed which considering various new aspects of saline soil utilization history cropping systems and soil sampling strategies e g different depths 5 conclusion to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the relationship between dar and soil salinization in the yellow river basin which is one of the main irrigated agricultural regions in the world facing severe salt stress dar was positively correlated with soil na k mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 tn and exchangeable potassium but it was negatively associated with ca2 som and available phosphorus no significant relationship was detected between dar and alkaline hydrolyzed nitrogen the increase of exchangeable sodium with dar was largely due to na accumulation from upstream to downstream while for the cation exchange capacity it was mainly a trade off between tn and som therefore soil exchangeable sodium cation exchange capacity and exchangeable sodium percentage were increased with dar soil total water soluble salt content increased with dar likely due to ions leaching from the soils upstream and partially accumulating in soils downstream through irrigation and drainage especially for cl so4 2 and na soil ph increased with dar associated with the decrease in som overall the degree of soil salinization increased with dar this work suggests that dar is a fundamental parameter linked to soil salinization in the yellow river basin but whether this concept holds for other river systems remains uncertain and requires further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9061,clarifying the relationship between salt affected soils and their adjacent river systems is critical to address the challenges posed by soil salinization on agricultural production among the various biophysical and land management factors linked to soil salinization few studies have investigated the importance of the distance along the river based on the hetao irrigation district of the yellow river basin we collected 5314 soil samples and analyzed 17 soil parameters to explore the relationship between salt affected soils and their distance along the river soil salinization was reinforced by the distance along the river as a trade off between soil ion accumulation and nutrient regulation soil total water soluble salt content increased by 16 4 mg kg 1 every kilometer likely due to ions leaching from the soils upstream and partially accumulating in the soils downstream especially for cl so4 2 and na greater input and less solubility of ca2 based soil amendments phosphorus fertilizers and organic materials on the less salt affected soils upstream may explain the declines in soil ca2 available phosphorus and soil organic matter with distance along the river with every kilometer along the river soil exchangeable sodium and cation exchange capacity increased by 8 89 10 4 and 1 26 10 2 cmol kg 1 respectively which led to an increase in soil exchangeable sodium percentage by 9 59 10 5 the increase in soil exchangeable sodium along the river was mainly due to na accumulation while soil cation exchange capacity was regulated by soil organic matter and total nitrogen soil ph increased by 1 21 10 3 per kilometer along the river associated with the decrease of soil organic matter future saline soil amelioration and reutilization initiatives at regional scales may be improved by accounting for the changes in soil physicochemical properties resulting from the distance along the river graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil salinization cation exchange capacity exchangeable sodium percentage soil ph structural equation model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally soil salinization has been recognized as a pressing issue that threatens agricultural production ecosystem health and food security hopmans et al 2021 approximately one billion hectares of arid and semi arid areas remain barren due to salinity or water scarcity and nearly 20 of irrigated land is affected by secondary salinization sahab et al 2021 china for instance has 34 million hectares of saline soil 36 of which can be potentially used for agricultural production after amelioration wang et al 2017 soil salinization is not just a function of the properties of the soil itself but also the water related conditions of the surrounding land hayat et al 2019 hence salt affected soils frequently occur in alluvial plains intensively irrigated districts and river valleys such as the indo gangetic basin in india the indus basin in pakistan and the yellow river basin in china the level of soil salinity in these regions is closely related to the spatial distribution of their river systems shahid et al 2018 therefore to promote amelioration of saline soils and their subsequent reutilization in salt affected regions the spatial relationships between local river systems and salt affected soils must first be understood the distance along the river dar is a crucial parameter for characterizing the relationship between river systems and their adjacent soils it is defined as the curve length from the entrance point of the river into the study area to the projection point of the specific sampling site as illustrated in fig 1 for the yellow river it may also be an important factor influencing soil salinization throughout the stream network kaushal et al 2017 generally the groundwater table becomes shallower with increasing dar leading to an upward movement and accumulation of salt in surface soils mao et al 2020 indeed human dominated land and water use accelerates weathering and increases anthropogenic salts and available and total nutrients jin et al 2021 and yet it is the physical processes such as salt transport pathways irrigation and drainage practices that modulate the relationship between dar and soil salinization a previous study demonstrated that the accumulation of ions and water extractable organic matter in streams increase from upstream to downstream zhang et al 2021 but whether it contributed greatly to soil salinization in the irrigated agriculutral district remains to be determined clarifying the nature of this relationship will provide much needed scientific support for sustainable soil and water use saline soil amelioration and soil health maintenance in salt affected regions although several studies have focused on the drivers of primary and secondary salinities daliakopoulos et al 2016 hayat et al 2019 hopmans et al 2021 few have isolated the role of dar in relation to soil salinization severe soil salinization is characterized by high values for total water soluble salt content ph and exchangeable sodium percentage esp which is determined by the ratio of exchangeable sodium to the cation exchange capacity cec sahab et al 2021 both soil total water soluble salt and ph are usually affected by the soil ions where major cations of saline soil are sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 and major anions are chloride cl sulphate so4 2 bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 qadir et al 2000 in addition soil exchangeable sodium and cec are mainly influenced by soil ions and soil nutrients hopmans et al 2021 and soil nutrients have been correlated with soil organic matter som total nitrogen tn alkaline hydrolyzed nitrogen available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium here we have explored the relationship between dar and the extent of soil salinization in the hetao irrigation district china by sampling and analyzing 5314 soil samples the main objective of this work is to define the relationship between dar and soil cations na k ca2 and mg2 anions cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 nutrients som tn alkaline hydrolyzed nitrogen available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium and salinization indexes total water soluble salt soil ph exchangeable sodium cec and esp we will determine whether dar relates to soil salinization and if so the nature and intensity of this relationship i e direct or indirect we hypothesize that soil salinization is reinforced by dar directly and indirectly related to soil ions and nutrients 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district 40 19 41 18 n 106 20 109 19 e is located in the northern section of the yellow river the second longest river in china it is an alluvial flood plain and represents a typical salt affected region of the river system the average elevation is 1007 1050 m nie et al 2021 it is tilted from southwest to northeast with a 0 2 slope and bordered by the langshan mountain to the north and the yellow river to the south fig 1 it is one of the largest irrigation districts and most important agricultural production regions in china with 5 7 105 ha of irrigated land and 1 12 106 ha of total area the salt concentration of the irrigation water taken from the yellow river is 0 6 g l 1 chang et al 2019 zhai et al 2021 which was higher downstream than upstream the average annual rainfall ranges from 130 to 200 mm characterizing its arid to semi arid continental climate li et al 2020a this region suffers from water shortages due to the large discrepancy between rainfall and evaporation zhang et al 2020b and so irrigation primarily coming from the yellow river is essential for crop production in addition soil salinization is another limiting factor for agricultural development in this region with 45 of its arable land susceptible to soil salinization li et al 2020b the soils are formed by lake and alluvial sediments deposits which led to finer soil textures following directional patterns in other words soil textures are sandy loam to silt loam in the southern and western parts while they are silt to clay in the northern and eastern parts ren et al 2016 more detailed information can be found in guo et al 2008 2 2 soil sampling and measurement soil samples were collected from 7 2 104 ha of arable land before irrigation in november and december 2017 using a grid sampling strategy fig 1 first the borders of 5399 sampling sites with an area of 13 3 3 3 ha per site were outlined next a subsampling site of 3 3 ha was selected randomly from each sampling site and finally ten representative soil subsamples were collected from the subsampling site to produce one composite sample fig s1 all sampling positions were located using a global positioning system device overall a total of 5399 composite samples were collected from the 0 20 cm soil depth by an electric soil auger in the field of which 5314 samples were ultimately measured and 85 samples rejected due to unclear labelling or poor preservation only active arable lands were sampled and the regions that were not sampled were mostly barren due to salinity or water scarcity in other words similar land use type cropping system irrigation regime and so on were ensured at a regional scale a total of 17 soil parameters were analyzed four types of

with dar the fact that the concentrations of most water extractable ions showed an increasing trend with dar could be the result of irrigation and drainage in the arable lands with these ions being dissolved from soils upstream and subsequently transported along the river to be accumulated in soils downstream paudyal et al 2016 conversely water extractable ca2 is known to be converted into

preferentially select these less saline lands to ameliorate for cultivation over more saline lands downstream li et al 2020b these processes could explain the decreases in soil ca2 content and the

relationships with dar the accumulation of water extractable organic matter is known to increase from upstream to downstream in river systems dong et al 2020 stutter and cains 2017 ye et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 leading to this study s hypothesis that the som content would increase in soils upstream to downstream however the response of som to dar was more influenced by carbon inputs from organic materials e g crop residues than those from irrigation water the retention of organic materials in the fields is indeed one of the main strategies for saline soil amelioration in this region which directly increases som contents huo et al 2017 as discussed before land managers preferentially select these less saline lands upstream to ameliorate for cultivation over more saline lands downstream li et al 2020b crop performance and distribution also contributed to the variation of som content with dar crops grew better in upstream areas compared to downstream areas partly due to a higher ratio of ca2 to mg2 karimov et al 2009 this ratio decreased remarkably with dar fig s3 and played a negative role in regulating crop growth in addition the percentage of wheat and maize planting area decreased while that of sunflower and saline tolerant forage increased with dar associated with soil salinity content in upstream and downstream areas gao et al 2021 the residues of wheat and maize were partly returned to the soil while the residues of sunflower and forage were usually removed from the farmland in this region therefore som decreased with dar due to both increases in below and aboveground organic material inputs in the land upstream than downstream conversely tn increased with dar due to higher chemical n fertilizer input in the downstream area lower productivity in the downstream areas usually resulted in farmers applying more n fertilizer to boost crop growth more n application but less crop absorption led to more n accumulation in the soils downstream than soils upstream zhang et al 2016 therefore a relatively lower ratio of som to tn was detected in the soil downstream compared to upstream fig 3a and b overall these results would suggest that more organic material inputs and less chemical n fertilizer inputs are a possible recommendation for this region especially for the soils downstream this study found no significant linear correlation between alkaline hydrolyzed n and dar only surface soils 0 20 cm were collected after crop harvest in this study in other words potential factors like soil sampling depth sampling period seepage losses and

chemical reaction an et al 2013 as mentioned before less saline lands upstream were earlier cultivated than more saline lands downstream which led to more phosphorus accumulation in the lands upstream these factors help explain why the available phosphorus content decreased with dar in contrast the soil in this region is rich in exchangeable potassium 250 154 mg kg 1 fig 3e promoting dissolution from the soils upstream transportation along the river and accumulation in the soils downstream these processes are intensified as a result of irrigation and drainage in the saline lands therefore the exchangeable potassium content increased with dar these results would suggest the need for more phosphorus application and less potassium fertilizers in downstream areas 4 3 soil salinization relationship with dar the cec was mainly associated with the total nutrients including tn and som in this study kang et al 2021 supported by the comparatively higher path coefficients fig 5a even though the cec was closely related with som beldin et al 2007 oorts et al 2003 the cec was more associated with tn fig s2c these results indicate that the cec of the saline soil with low som content 11 4 4 4 g kg 1 means standard deviations depended more on mineral surfaces indexed with tn than organic surfaces indexed with som zhang et al 2020a and the cec increase with dar is mainly associated with the increases in soil tn field practices aimed at increasing som and or tn therefore have the potential to also increase soil cec this supports the hypothesis that n fertilization promotes plant growth under salt stress conditions through reducing ion accumulation pang et al 2005 demonstrated here due to the simultaneous increase in soil cec and tn this also explains why such high amounts of n fertilizer are commonly applied in this region the exchangeable sodium was mainly associated with cations especially na sidi et al 2015 with high path coefficients between exchangeable sodium and cations na fig 5a and s2a therefore the increase of exchangeable sodium with dar was likely due to na accumulation from the soils upstream to downstream this result also indicates that bad drainage systems may increase esp for the soils downstream the ratio of exchangeable sodium to cec i e esp was more determined by exchangeable sodium compared to cec confirmed by the higher path coefficient from exchangeable sodium to esp than that from cec to esp fig 5a these results indicate that the increase of esp with dar was mainly caused by the greater contribution of na to total cations in the soils downstream than that upstream field management strategies aiming to decreasing soil na content such as underground pipe drainage zhou et al 2021 therefore has the potential to decrease esp in this region especially with increasing dar soil total water soluble salt was mainly influenced by anions and cations fig 5a especially for cl so4 2 and na fig s2a and b and most ions increased with dar furthermore saline land amelioration in this region usually combines with irrigation and drainage which reduce the natural salt contents upstream and further encouraging preferential cultivation therefore total water soluble salt likely increased due to ions leaching from the soils upstream and accumulating in the soils downstream a high path coefficient was found from dar to soil ph which was attributed to other factors associated with dar influencing soil ph such as terrain landform climate conditions and vegetation distribution hopmans et al 2021 soil ph was negatively correlated with total nutrients fig 5a specifically soil ph was mainly affected by som fig s2c indicating that field management practices for increasing som also have the potential to decrease soil ph these results suggest that soil ph increased due to the decrease in som with dar notably soil ph was also positively associated with available nutrients fig 5a especially available phosphorus fig s2d some studies have demonstrated that saline soil amelioration and utilization increased soil ph li et al 2015 sun et al 2013 2012 simultaneously with the increases of available nutrient contents due to fertilization and irrigation overall dar is an important factor for soil salinization as it determines the dynamics of several key soil parameters for sustainable agricultural production in salt affected regions 4 4 uncertainties and implications the increase of soil salinity content with dar can be attributed to the progressively slower flow of the river system the higher salt concentration of the irrigation water and the shallower groundwater table therefore there will be less leaching and more upward movement and accumulation of salt in surface soils downstream than upstream mao et al 2020 it is important to note that the studied soil is predominantly loess in the hetao irrigation district where soil salts are more likely dissolved and run off during waterlogged conditions overall the dar is a fundamental parameter linked to soil salinization in the yellow river basin fig 7 but further research is needed to test whether this concept applies for other river systems the increase of soil salinity with dar may be overestimated due to more salt leaching in soil upstream areas than downstream areas for example saline lands upstream have longer utilization history than those downstream and the salinity in the surface soils is decreased through salt leaching during saline soil utilization chang et al 2019 in addition the percentage of wheat and maize planting area decreases and that of sunflower and forage area increases with dar gao et al 2021 it has been reported that greater salt leaching is associated with more irrigation per unit of wheat and maize area compared to sunflower and forage area li et al 2020a therefore the longer time period of saline soil utilization and more fresh water consumption per unit of area in upstream areas compared to downstream areas will likely cause an overestimation of the increase of soil salinity with dar other uncertainties may result from the soil sampling depth and sampling period in this study as secondary salinization is often coupled with saline soil utilization in the irrigated regions and salt accumulation in surface soils typically occurs after crop harvest in this region zhang et al 2020b overall the relationship between dar and soil salinization is closely integrated to intrinsic soil characteristics and anthropogenic activities such as soil fertility and salinity crop performance and distribution as well as field management it is noteworthy that more studies on the relationship of soil salinity and dar are needed which considering various new aspects of saline soil utilization history cropping systems and soil sampling strategies e g different depths 5 conclusion to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the relationship between dar and soil salinization in the yellow river basin which is one of the main irrigated agricultural regions in the world facing severe salt stress dar was positively correlated with soil na k mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 tn and exchangeable potassium but it was negatively associated with ca2 som and available phosphorus no significant relationship was detected between dar and alkaline hydrolyzed nitrogen the increase of exchangeable sodium with dar was largely due to na accumulation from upstream to downstream while for the cation exchange capacity it was mainly a trade off between tn and som therefore soil exchangeable sodium cation exchange capacity and exchangeable sodium percentage were increased with dar soil total water soluble salt content increased with dar likely due to ions leaching from the soils upstream and partially accumulating in soils downstream through irrigation and drainage especially for cl so4 2 and na soil ph increased with dar associated with the decrease in som overall the degree of soil salinization increased with dar this work suggests that dar is a fundamental parameter linked to soil salinization in the yellow river basin but whether this concept holds for other river systems remains uncertain and requires further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9062,extensive variability in current climatic conditions necessitates the need for optimal planning of water resources to manage socio economic and environmental requirements efficiently the optimal allocation of surface water and groundwater is essential to maximize crop net return due to uncertainty in seasonal rainfall groundwater and surface water availability in each region this study demonstrated a multi objective model to maximize the crop net return and efficient management of water resources the multi objective model comprised three objective functions maximizing the crop net return minimizing the water deficit and maximizing the aquifer recharge the model s practicability was analyzed through the case study of the pennar palar cauvery link canal command in india three meta heuristic approaches particle swarm optimization pso genetic algorithm ga and marine predators algorithm mpa were employed to solve the presented model and their performance was evaluated using hypervolume and coverage metrics indicating mpa s superiority in obtaining well distributed pareto optimal solutions thus decision makers can choose the best feasible solution based on current resource availability and preferences the model was executed considering different cropping area deviations 5 25 in the existing cropping pattern and allowance of groundwater mining from 0 to 70 the obtained cropping pattern utilizing mpa at 25 cropping deviation achieved an increased net return of 1327 05 million inr keywords marine predators algorithm water resource planning conjunctive use cropping pattern irrigation planning sustainability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the continuing population growth water demand has increased drastically in the domestic industrial and agricultural sectors among these an extensive part of water resources nearly 70 wwap 2017 is utilized in the agriculture sector further the uncertainty in current climatic conditions makes the water resource more vulnerable wu et al 2008 india is a vast country with diverse agro climatic conditions in different areas where some areas are affected by floods while the nearly one third area is drought prone nwda 2021 the water supply problem will worsen in the future due to the increasing population industrialization urbanization and other development activities hence efficient and scientific management of water resources is needed to combat such challenges the integrated use of surface and groundwater resources is beneficial to meet the increasing water demand and achieve sustainability harmancioglu et al 2013 but excessive use of groundwater leads to a drastic drop in groundwater level and quality on the other hand more water in the soil creates a waterlogging problem and affects plant growth thus optimal planning of integrated application of groundwater and surface water is required in arid and semi arid areas yates et al 2005 to ensure the sustainable water supply in all sectors that eventually minimize the economic social and environmental losses kundzewicz 1997 the benefits of conjunctive surface and groundwater management are two folds 1 it increases the crop yield and provides a reliable water supply to meet the sustainable water demand and 2 it avoids the problems of salinity waterlogging and groundwater depletion optimization models are proven efficient in managing various resources thus utilized extensively in many domains an optimization model based on linear programming lp was presented in singh and panda 2012 to maximize crop net return by conjunctive application of water resources similarly an lp based optimization model was introduced in khare et al 2007 to identify the potential of conjunctive application of water resources for the krishna pennar link canal in india raju and kumar 2000 presented an irrigation planning model for the shree ram sagar project in india that maximize the crop net return by considering different inflow dependability levels in das et al 2015 user friendly software had been designed for season wise optimal allocation of cropping area and water for the hirakund canal command in india this software combines a model base database and knowledge base subsystem for efficient decision making an lp based conjunctive model was developed in jha et al 2020b for the eastern india upper damodar river basin by considering dynamic groundwater reserve along with spatial and climatic variation in the water supply similarly a simulation optimization based model presented in mohanty et al 2013 rejani et al 2009 through optimal crop planning and pumpage scheduling considering normal and dry years in eastern india in jha et al 2020a a groundwater flow simulation model was combined with an lp model to prevent seawater intrusion maximize crop net return and provide an optimal allocation of conjunctive water use for the kushabhadra bhargavi river delta of eastern india in reality the problem of conjunctive allocation of water resources is complex non linear vedula et al 2005 and comprised of multiple objectives several multi objective optimization models were presented in the literature using multiple criteria decision making mcdm techniques such as goal programming and multi scale optimization modeling hajkowicz and higgins 2008 a multi scale optimization model was presented in li et al 2021 for optimal allocation of water and cropping area by considering uncertainties in the demand supply of water similarly a goal programming model developed in mosleh et al 2017 for sustainable allocation of cropping patterns and water resources in the iran region srivastava and singh 2017 introduced a fuzzy based goal programming model considering goals such as maximization of crop yield and net return coupled with minimizing water use fertilizers and investment the model had implemented for the command area in the allahabad district of india in naghdi et al 2021 a simulation optimization model combined with nash bargaining theory for optimal allocation of water resources in the industrial agriculture and environmental sector recently many meta heuristic optimization approaches have been utilized in the literature due to their advantages in solving complex design problems also solving multi objective optimization problems using a meta heuristic method is simplistic and easy to implement ye et al 2018 the genetic algorithm ga and particle swarm optimization pso has practiced in several works of literature for managing water resources a multi objective optimization model to study the dynamic interaction between groundwater and surface water for low flow areas was presented in zeinali et al 2020 the model was implemented in western iran using non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii similarly a multi objective optimization model introduced in sepahvand et al 2019 utilizes a ga to optimize the conjunctive water allocation for wet normal and dry periods the ga had also been used to simulate the variation in groundwater levels a conjunctive model utilizing pso was presented in yousefi et al 2018 which used treated wastewater and groundwater simultaneously to maximize the net return and groundwater level and to minimize the nitrogen leaching in soil and water a fuzzy based multi objective pso was proposed by rezaei et al 2017 as a long term 10 year multi crop planning method that optimizes three objectives of maximizing the crop net return and groundwater sustainability and minimizing the shortage in fulfilling irrigation demand davijani et al 2016 introduced a socio economic optimization model to allocate water resources in agriculture industry and municipal sectors the model was solved using weighted pso and ga a new tool named all water gw was developed in nouiri et al 2015 using a multi objective ga for groundwater management to satisfy multiple objectives like demand satisfaction water cost and drawdown minimization in this work a multi objective optimization model was formulated for the conjunctive application of groundwater and surface water resources optimally most previous studies about water resource allocation were implemented as single objective optimization and consider only the economic aspect of maximizing crop net return however we proposed a socio economic approach for maximizing the net return minimizing the water deficit and maximizing the sustainability of the groundwater level the pennar palar cauvery link canal project has been chosen as a case study to implement the proposed optimization model for the conjunctive use of water resources the conjunctive allocation of groundwater and surface water is considered in this project though optimal allocation has not been practiced hence using an optimization algorithm is essential to allocate land and water resources optimally meta heuristic methods are more advantageous for solving the multi objective problem due to their easy implementation and suitability for high dimensional non linear non convex optimization functions by this time most of the research work in conjunctive water management utilized pso and ga algorithms the pso algorithm has a disadvantage regarding local optima stagnation in high dimensional search space at the same time the ga is time consuming and provides very slow convergence with the increase in the variable s dimension hence selecting the suitable optimization approach for the multi objective problem is necessary to get well distributed pareto optimal solutions in the search space this study showed the superiority of the mpa algorithm in solving the proposed water resource optimization model compared to pso and ga mpa utilizes the levy and brownian strategy together for searching which provides a more systematic explorer exploitation framework and thus leads to faster convergence moreover the fads effect in the mpa algorithm prevents stagnation from local optima 2 methodology 2 1 study area this study investigated the feasibility of optimal allocation of groundwater and surface water resource for the pennar somasila palar cauvery grand anicut link canal command this link canal has been proposed as part of the peninsular river development component under the npp national perspective plan fig 1 shows the location map of the study area the command area of the proposed link canal covers over chittoor and nellore districts in andra pradesh vellore kancheepuram villupuram tiruvannamalai and cuddalore districts in tamil nadu and puducherry the command area has a tropical climate with a maximum temperature that varies from 29 3 c to 37 5 c the minimum temperature varies from 20 6 c to 26 5 c and the annual rainfall ranges from 635 to 1019 mm the length of the total area covered by the link canal is 529 190 km a total quantity of 8565 mm3 water diverts annually from the somasila dam with an entire supply of 95 42 m the total cultivable command area available for irrigation is 599010 ha and the remaining irrigable area is 491200 ha after being irrigated by tank canal and other sources thus a total cultivable command area of 491200 ha is considered in the study to provide en route irrigation using 3048 mm3 of surface water nwda 2021 2 1 1 existing irrigation facilities a 55 of the total land area has been irrigated by existing irrigation facilities such as tanks and wells the agriculture in this area is equally dependent on rain and irrigation the whole command area of the link canal has been divided into six direct sluices and 16 branch canals grouped into seven zones based on district the types of soil found in command areas are red loamy soils coastal sands red sandy clay loam soils black clayey soils alluvial soils and forest soils 2 1 2 existing cropping pattern in the command area there are mainly two cropping seasons in the command area kharif and rabi the kharif season runs from july to november and from november to april runs the rabi season the principal food crops grown in the command area are maize jowar pulses vegetables cotton and chilies in the kharif season and oilseeds paddy and ragi in the rabi season a 65 of the net sown area is dedicated to cotton paddy and oilseeds crop in this study the cropping pattern specified in the water balance study report of the basins between pennar and cauvery rivers nwda 2021 was adopted as the existing cropping pattern this cropping pattern is recommended by considering soil type and prevailing agriculture or irrigation practices in the command area the irrigation amount is regarded as 100 table 1 lists the suggested cropping pattern for the command area irrigation en route to the link canal 2 1 3 groundwater the study area contains a total of 22000 dug wells and 105000 tube wells the groundwater potential in the command area has been estimated based on district wise groundwater resources published by cgwb central groundwater board in 2003 the district wise groundwater potential and utilization in different sectors are shown in table 2 the district wise area is divided into seven zones according to a pilot study carried out by cgwb 20 of the surface water transmission losses and 40 of the applied irrigation water will be added to the groundwater regime of the command area through canal seepage infiltration and return flow from irrigation also the groundwater estimation methodology suggests a recharge of 50 for the paddy area and 30 for the non paddy area the transmission losses are estimated to be 557 mm3 on 3048 mm3 for the study area en route irrigation however the current link recharge from transmission and irrigation losses is considered 20 due to the difference in areas used for the pilot study 2 1 4 crop water requirement the crop net irrigation requirement or water requirement is the amount of water needed for a crop along with rainfall to fulfill the crop s evapotranspiration et c needs without compromising its yield the crop evapotranspiration is computed using the following equation 1 e t c k c e t o here k c is the crop coefficient and et o represents crop reference evapotranspiration mm day this et o determines evapotranspiration by considering a hypothetical grass reference surface there are several methods to calculate reference evapotranspiration we used an fao penman monteith method to compute reference evapotranspiration et o by using respective crop coefficients k c allen et al 1998 the crop water requirement is defined as 2 n i r e t c e r here er is effective rainfall mm month calculated using a method given by food and agriculture organization fao dastane 1974 and nir represents net irrigation requirement mm month the various parameters in the equations were computed using standard meteorological data such as sunshine hours maximum and minimum temperature wind speed and humidity the cultivable command area and the annual crop water requirement for each zone concerning the existing cropping pattern are demonstrated in table 3 2 1 5 cost and benefit parameters the existing command area of various crops with their yield cost of cultivation minimum support price msp and net return is demonstrated in table 4 the surface water and groundwater costs have been estimated as 973 inr 1 1 1 usd 82 7 inr as of 6 january 2023 ha and 200 inr ha respectively the source websites of these data are listed in table 5 2 2 optimization algorithm the problem of water resource optimization has been evaluated recently as a multi objective optimization and solved using popular meta heuristic approaches such as pso and ga however the performance of different optimization algorithms varies according to the nature of the optimization problem the number of decision variables and constraints in this work we evaluated the performance of pso ga and mpa for water resource optimization tasks a brief description of each algorithm is presented below 2 2 1 particle swarm optimization pso the pso algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 is inspired by the social behavior of bird flocks their behavior for food searching is simulated to find the best location in the search space for the optimization algorithm the pso algorithm consists of two steps in the first step the particles are initialized randomly within the search space in the second step of evaluation the fitness value is computed and particle positions are updated concerning their own experience and the collective experience of all the particles to solve the optimization problem using the pso firstly the population of birds b b 1 b 2 b 3 b n is initialized randomly in the search space then the particle positions are updated based on the velocity parameter v defining the movement speed the velocity parameter computed after each iteration such as 3 v i w v i c 1 r 1 p i b i c 2 r 2 g b i 4 b i b i v i here w is the inertia parameter c 1 and c 2 represent the cognitive and social parameters that control the exploration and exploitation of particles v i denote the velocity of i th particle r 1 and r 2 are random values in range 0 1 g denotes the global best position and p i denotes the i th particle s best position 2 2 2 genetic algorithm ga the genetic algorithm is inspired by charles darwin s theory of evolution golberg 1989 it works well on combinatorial continuous and discrete problems and is less susceptible to local optima stagnation samuel and jha 2003 it is based upon the natural selection process where the fittest individuals are selected to produce offspring for the next generation using operators such as selection crossover and mutation initially the population of individuals is defined randomly and each individual in the population is treated as a gene of encoded binary values 0 s and 1 s in the selection phase the fittest pairs of individuals are selected to produce offspring while less fit solutions have a low probability of being selected hence will eventually die in the next generation further a crossover operation is performed by choosing a crossover point and exchanging the genes between parents a crossover probability is defined to decide the percentage of the population chosen during the crossover operation after this the mutation operation is applied to introduce new genetic characteristics in the population it facilitates random search in the search space to prevent local optima stagnation the mutation probability decides the frequency of mutation operation thus affecting the overall performance of ga nsga ii is a variant of ga to obtain pareto optimal solutions for multi objective problems deb et al 2002 it employs a fast non dominated sorting approach to find solutions near to pareto optimal front a crowding distance metric has been computed among the obtained solutions to obtain diverse solutions in the search space moreover elitism behavior has been introduced to retain the fittest solution in the next generation and improve the algorithm s convergence 2 2 3 marine predators algorithm mpa marine predators algorithm is a population based algorithm given by faramarzi et al 2020 this method is inspired by the foraging strategy of predators in the ocean they follow a random walk strategy which can be either levy or brownian the levy motion can search deep in local areas by taking small steps at a time and occasionally jump to explore other areas while the brownian motion trace in every possible direction in distant neighborhood areas by taking long steps and can explore all over search space hence combining these two strategies allows the deep local search as well as global search the strategy followed by a predator at any moment depends upon the velocity ratio between prey to predator and prey distribution in search space this trade off between levy and brownian motion allows finding an optimal solution the flow diagram of mpa is depicted in fig 2 to implement marine predator behavior for optimization a population of prey prey p 1 p 2 p 3 p n is considered each search agent is treated both as a prey and a predator the top predator is talented in foraging thus assigned a search agent location that obtains the fittest solution the top predator is named elite by observing the behavior of marine predators the optimization process of mpa is classified into three phases 1 phase 1 a high velocity ratio scenario when the prey s velocity is higher than the predator s is considered at the initial one third of iteration in the optimization process the best approach for predators in the high velocity ratio is not to move while prey moves in brownian motion to promote exploration this rule is mathematically specified as follows s t e p s i z e i r b e l i t e r b p i p i p i p r s t e p s i z e i here r b is the random number generated using brownian motion r is a random number drawn from a uniform distribution 0 1 p represents a constant assigned with a value of 0 5 2 phase 2 the prey and predator move at the same unit velocity ratio v 1 this scenario is considered for the intermediate one third of iterations of the optimization process in this phase the transition from exploration to exploitation takes place thus half of the population is considered prey and the remaining half is assumed to be predators so if the prey moves in levy the best approach for the predator is to move in brownian motion the prey movement can be defined as s t e p s i z e i r l e l i t e r l p i p i p i p r s t e p s i z e i here r l is a random number generated using the levy distribution similarly the movement of a predator is defined as s t e p s i z e i r b r b e l i t e p i p i e l i t e p c f s t e p s i z e i c f 1 i t e r m a x i t e r 2 i t e r m a x i t e r here cf parameter controls the predator s step size 3 phase 3 this phase simulates the scenario when a predator has a higher velocity than the prey this scenario is adopted for the last one third of the optimization process in this scenario the best approach for the predator is levy which promotes exploitation here the predator movement is defined as s t e p s i z e i r l r l e l i t e p i p i e l i t e p c f s t e p s i z e i 4 eddy formation and fads effect the eddy formation and fads effects trigger the behavior change in a marine predator these effects represent a situation of stagnation in local minima and predators take the long jump to escape from these effects these effects are mathematically modeled as follows p i p i c f p m i n r p m a x p m i n if r f a d s p i f a d s 1 r r p r 1 p r 2 if r f a d s here fads 0 2 denotes the probability of fads effects in the optimization process r is a random number in the range 0 1 r1 and r2 are random indexes of the prey population p min and p max denote the lower and upper bound of search space the disadvantages of the pso algorithm are it is easy to fall into local optimum in high dimensional space and has a low convergence rate in the iterative process li et al 2014 in contrast ga is computationally expensive and converges slowly due to the utilization of evaluation operators such as selection crossover and mutation hence the mpa algorithm which provides a more systematic explorer exploitation framework and prevents local optima stagnation was considered more suitable for water resource optimization tasks in this study these algorithms were implemented for a multi objective optimization task and a set of non dominated solutions were computed using pareto archive evaluation strategy knowles and corne 2000 2 3 formulation of the optimization model the flowchart of the proposed optimization model is shown in fig 3 the implementation of the multi objective model needed meteorological data crop related data and geographical and irrigation data of the study area further the constraints and decision variables were decided based on expert knowledge the problem of optimal allocation of cropping area and water resources in a link canal command was modeled as three objective functions to maximize the crop net return improve aquifer recharge and minimize the water deficit in crops the objective function to maximize crop net return was formulated in the following manner 5 m a x z 1 i 1 7 j 1 2 k 1 c a i j k y k p k c c l k i 1 7 j 1 2 c s i s w i j i 1 7 j 1 2 c g i g w i j where i depicts the zones in the command area j is the index of crop growing time 1 for kharif and 2 for rabi season c is the total number of crops in the command area a ijk is the area assigned to crop k in zone i in season j y k and p k show the yield and price of crop k respectively ccl k is the cultivation cost for crop k excluding irrigation cost cs i and cg i represent the unit cost of groundwater and surface water for zone i inr mm3 sw ij and gw ij represent surface water and groundwater allocation in season j for zone i mm3 the second objective function was to minimize the water deficit for crops is given as follows 6 m i n z 2 i 1 7 j 1 2 d e m a n d i j s u p p l y i j d e m a n d i j 2 7 d e m a n d i j k 1 c n i r i j k a i j k 8 s u p p l y i j α β s w i j g w i j 100 here demand ij is the total water requirement in season j for zone i given by the net irrigation requirement of all crops in that area see eq 7 supply ij is the total water allocated by a conjunctive model in season j for zone i the total allocated water is given by eq 8 in which nir ijk is the net irrigation requirement in j season for k crop for i zone m α represents the application efficiency of field water 0 60 and β represents the conveyance efficiency of surface water 0 65 the third objective was to improve the aquifer recharge rate to maintain groundwater sustainability it is defined as follows 9 m a x z 3 i 1 7 j 1 2 1 β s w i θ β s w i g w i γ r f i j a i j g w i j here rf ij is the rainfall in season j for zone i mm θ and γ is the recharge factor from irrigation loss 0 3 and rainfall respectively 0 14 z 3 is the rate of aquifer recharge in mm3 1 β represents the conveyance loss from surface water 0 35 these objective functions were subjected to the following constraints land area constraint the total cultivable command area cca for each zone must not exceed the sum of the area allocated for each crop in the zone during the rabi and kharif seasons the land area constraint is specified as follows 10 j 1 2 k 1 c a i j k t a i i here ta i is the total cultivable command area of zone i water availability constraint the groundwater and surface water allocation in zone i season j must be less than or equal to the total available surface and groundwater in zone i season j 11 g w i j t g w i j i j 12 s w i j t s w i j i j here tgw ij and tsw ij is the total available groundwater and surface water in season j zone i mm3 minimum maximum allowable area based on each crop demand and prevailing crop practices a lower and upper bound was considered for each crop as a model constraint depending upon the existing area allocated for a crop 13 μ i j k m i n t a i j k a i j k μ i j k m a x t a i j k here μ i j k m a x and μ i j k m i j represent the factors by which the area of crops can be increased and decreased respectively ta ijk is the total allocated area for crop k in zone i season j non negativity constraints the allocated area for each crop groundwater and surface water must be greater than 0 14 a i j k 0 g w i j 0 s w i j 0 i j k the description of variables used in the water resource optimization model is shown in table 6 3 results and discussion the optimization algorithms used to solve the water resource optimization model had been implemented in python version 3 7 3 on a pc with specification 11th gen intel r core tm i5 1135g7 2 40 ghz and 8 gb ram as shown in table 6 the decision variables of the optimization algorithm represent the cropping area allocated to crops in each zone there are 13 cropping areas for the rabi and kharif seasons and seven zones hence the total number of decision variables is 91 in the optimization algorithm each point p in the population is defined by a vector of size n thus the population of points is represented as a matrix of s rows and n columns such as 15 p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 2 n p s 1 p s 2 p s n here s denotes the number of points in the population and n represents the number of decision variables the implementation steps of the water resource optimization model using a meta heuristic optimization algorithm are given as follows 1 initialize the hyper parameters of the optimization algorithm as defined in table 7 2 initialize the required input parameters and coefficient value of the model as defined in table 6 3 randomly initialize the points in the population against the minimum μ min and maximum allowable cropping area μ max for each crop in different zones as shown in eq 13 4 calculate the fitness value of each point using objective functions defined in eq 5 6 and 9 and apply the constraints specified in section 2 3 5 save the fittest solutions in the repository using the pareto archive evaluation strategy 6 update the position of each point as defined by the optimization algorithm 7 repeat steps 4 6 for a specified number of iterations after completing iterations a repository containing pareto optimal solutions is obtained as output to the optimization algorithm the optimization model was executed by considering deviations in the existing cropping area such as 5 10 15 20 and 25 these deviations were considered around the existing cropping pattern to create a more practical model that fulfills the local food demand see eq 13 also the allowable mining for groundwater resources varied from 0 to 70 in the optimization process to obtain a diverse range of solutions and to consider the maximum crop net return scenario on a different allocation of groundwater and surface water resources such consideration will help to decide the optimal ratio of groundwater and surface water that could be exploited to maximize the crop net return and the sustainability of groundwater level the crop water requirement in each zone had been fulfilled initially with allowable mining of the available groundwater in the zone and the rest was fulfilled with the surface water the objective functions described in sub section 2 3 were optimized using multi objective mpa faramarzi et al 2020 multi objective pso kennedy and eberhart 1995 and nsga ii deb et al 2002 for each of the specified deviations in cropping area table 7 presents the selected parameter value of these algorithms these parameters were chosen as recommended by the developers of these algorithms to have the best performance these algorithms executed over thirty independent trials and their performance was compared using hypervolume and coverage metrics zitzler et al 2000 the hypervolume metric measures the distribution of results over a search space by computing a volume concerning a reference point in the search space a higher value of hypervolume describes well distributed results the coverage metric compares the solution achieved by two different algorithms for any two algorithms a and b the coverage of b with respect to a is given by the number of solutions in b n2 dominated by solutions obtained by algorithm a n1 the formula to calculate coverage of algorithm b denoted as c n1 n2 is given by 16 c n 1 n 2 x 2 ϵ n 2 x 1 ϵ n 1 x 1 x 2 n 2 the mean hypervolume value obtained by each algorithm for different cropping area deviations is shown in fig 4 it indicates the hypervolume value increases with an increase in area deviation the mpa obtained a higher value for the hypervolume metric thus achieving well distributed solutions table 8 presents the mean coverage value where the coverage metric obtained by mpa with respect to pso and nsga ii is given by c 1 c 2 and the coverage of pso and nsga ii with respect to mpa is specified as c the coverage value c 2 is zero for all cropping area deviations and c 1 is near zero for three cropping area deviations depicting that mpa achieved a higher number of non dominated solutions than pso and nsga ii the superiority of results obtained by mpa is due to its systematic exploitation and exploration strategy using levy and brownian motion thus leading to faster convergence also fad s effects prevent stuck in local optima and thus drive towards optimal global solutions the maximum net return achieved using mpa pso and nsga ii for different cropping deviations is shown in fig 5 the crop net return increases drastically using mpa with the increasing deviation in the cropping area as more cropping area was assigned to crops with a high net return however more deviation in the existing cropping pattern can affect the local demand ratio of crops hence it should be considered within a predefined limit the surface water and groundwater resources utilized for different cropping area deviations to achieve maximum net return are shown in fig 6 suggesting 34 of groundwater usage at 25 cropping area deviation further results are analyzed considering 25 deviations from the existing cropping area fig 7 depicts the variation in mean hypervolume value with the number of iterations in the optimization algorithm it indicates the hypervolume value obtained using pso and nsga ii showed a very slight increase after 200 iterations while mpa showed a continuous improvement in hypervolume several non dominated solutions pareto optimal solutions achieved at 25 cropping area deviation by mpa are depicted in fig 8 showing a well distributed pareto front around the search space the maximum net return gained using obtained optimal cropping pattern and the net return achieved using the existing cropping pattern presented by table 9 the table shows the significant variations in the cropping area of paddy cotton and pulses the proposed model suggests reducing the cropping area for paddy and cotton crops in the kharif season reducing the fodder crop area in rabi and increasing the fodder crop in the kharif season an increase in the area for groundnut crops and a reduction in the jowar crop area is suggested for the rabi season additionally the obtained cropping pattern allocated more cultivation area for pulses in the rabi season the net return achieved using the existing and obtained cropping pattern is 13751 05 million inr and 15079 25 million inr respectively which shows an increase in 1327 05 million inr net return using the obtained cropping pattern the zone wise surface water and groundwater utilization is shown in fig 9 and fig 10 shows the cropping pattern allocated for each zone at 25 area deviations this section depicts the implementation of the proposed model for the pennar palar cauvery link canal command in india the conjunctive allocation of water resources is considered during the planning of this link canal project however optimal allocation of these resources is required to maintain the groundwater balance and avoid the problem of water logging and salinity moreover the cropping pattern needs to be selected based on the current availability of water resources to fulfill the crop water requirement and maximize net profit hence a multi objective optimization problem was formulated in this work consisting of maximizing the crop net return minimizing the water deficit and maintaining the aquifer recharge the multi objective model was solved using meta heuristic approaches which generate a set of pareto optimal solutions as output thus allowing the decision maker to select the best cropping pattern based on the current availability of water resources and preferences however due to the high dimensionality and complex nature of the water resources optimization problem an appropriate algorithm must be selected to solve the multi objective optimization problem efficiently pso and ga are state of the art optimization algorithms for solving multi objective problems but pso has the disadvantage of being stuck in local optima in high dimensional space on the other hand ga provides slow convergence and has high computational complexity due to mutation crossover and selection operation thus in this work an mpa algorithm that shows higher values of performance metrics is utilized for solving multi objective optimization we executed the model for different cropping area deviations ranging from 5 to 25 showing that increasing deviation in the existing cropping area drastically increases the crop net return moreover the variation in groundwater utilization has been 0 70 tried to find the optimal use of groundwater and surface water resources the model suggests 34 of groundwater utilization in obtaining the maximum net profit of 1327 05 million inr further the model also provides a range of well distributed pareto optimal solutions 4 conclusions a multi objective model for water resource optimization is formulated to increase the crop net return maintain the aquifer recharge and reduce the water deficit the problem of water resource optimization is multi objective complex non linear and subjected to various constraints hence utilizing an efficient meta heuristic approach allows for obtaining a well distributed pareto optimal solution for the problem this study evaluated three meta heuristic optimization approaches pso ga mpa for the conjunctive allocation of water resources it provides insight into the efficiency of the mpa for water resource optimization higher values of performance metrics hypervolume coverage achieved using mpa show its capability to achieve more diverse and well distributed solutions for the problem hence a suitable optimization approach must be chosen by water managers based on the nature of the problem to get optimal solutions the proposed multi objective model was optimized considering cropping area deviation of 5 10 15 20 and 25 and the allowance of groundwater mining was varied randomly between 0 and 70 during the optimization process the experimental results show that increasing the area deviations also increases the crop net return this study suggests significant area deviation in paddy cotton and pulses to increase the crop net return along with sustainable use of groundwater resources further the deviation parameters in cropping area and groundwater should be carefully chosen by experts considering the current crop demand and groundwater and surface water availability the development of such an optimization model allows for managing socio economic requirements efficiently and ensures the sustainable supply of water the proposed model applies to different areas with similar problems by changing the input parameters however in the present study certain parameters used in the algorithm such as uncertainty in rainfall groundwater recharge and interaction between surface water and groundwater have not been considered hence the future direction is to develop or use the appropriate estimation models to compute the groundwater recharge rainfall and crop water requirement declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

9062,extensive variability in current climatic conditions necessitates the need for optimal planning of water resources to manage socio economic and environmental requirements efficiently the optimal allocation of surface water and groundwater is essential to maximize crop net return due to uncertainty in seasonal rainfall groundwater and surface water availability in each region this study demonstrated a multi objective model to maximize the crop net return and efficient management of water resources the multi objective model comprised three objective functions maximizing the crop net return minimizing the water deficit and maximizing the aquifer recharge the model s practicability was analyzed through the case study of the pennar palar cauvery link canal command in india three meta heuristic approaches particle swarm optimization pso genetic algorithm ga and marine predators algorithm mpa were employed to solve the presented model and their performance was evaluated using hypervolume and coverage metrics indicating mpa s superiority in obtaining well distributed pareto optimal solutions thus decision makers can choose the best feasible solution based on current resource availability and preferences the model was executed considering different cropping area deviations 5 25 in the existing cropping pattern and allowance of groundwater mining from 0 to 70 the obtained cropping pattern utilizing mpa at 25 cropping deviation achieved an increased net return of 1327 05 million inr keywords marine predators algorithm water resource planning conjunctive use cropping pattern irrigation planning sustainability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the continuing population growth water demand has increased drastically in the domestic industrial and agricultural sectors among these an extensive part of water resources nearly 70 wwap 2017 is utilized in the agriculture sector further the uncertainty in current climatic conditions makes the water resource more vulnerable wu et al 2008 india is a vast country with diverse agro climatic conditions in different areas where some areas are affected by floods while the nearly one third area is drought prone nwda 2021 the water supply problem will worsen in the future due to the increasing population industrialization urbanization and other development activities hence efficient and scientific management of water resources is needed to combat such challenges the integrated use of surface and groundwater resources is beneficial to meet the increasing water demand and achieve sustainability harmancioglu et al 2013 but excessive use of groundwater leads to a drastic drop in groundwater level and quality on the other hand more water in the soil creates a waterlogging problem and affects plant growth thus optimal planning of integrated application of groundwater and surface water is required in arid and semi arid areas yates et al 2005 to ensure the sustainable water supply in all sectors that eventually minimize the economic social and environmental losses kundzewicz 1997 the benefits of conjunctive surface and groundwater management are two folds 1 it increases the crop yield and provides a reliable water supply to meet the sustainable water demand and 2 it avoids the problems of salinity waterlogging and groundwater depletion optimization models are proven efficient in managing various resources thus utilized extensively in many domains an optimization model based on linear programming lp was presented in singh and panda 2012 to maximize crop net return by conjunctive application of water resources similarly an lp based optimization model was introduced in khare et al 2007 to identify the potential of conjunctive application of water resources for the krishna pennar link canal in india raju and kumar 2000 presented an irrigation planning model for the shree ram sagar project in india that maximize the crop net return by considering different inflow dependability levels in das et al 2015 user friendly software had been designed for season wise optimal allocation of cropping area and water for the hirakund canal command in india this software combines a model base database and knowledge base subsystem for efficient decision making an lp based conjunctive model was developed in jha et al 2020b for the eastern india upper damodar river basin by considering dynamic groundwater reserve along with spatial and climatic variation in the water supply similarly a simulation optimization based model presented in mohanty et al 2013 rejani et al 2009 through optimal crop planning and pumpage scheduling considering normal and dry years in eastern india in jha et al 2020a a groundwater flow simulation model was combined with an lp model to prevent seawater intrusion maximize crop net return and provide an optimal allocation of conjunctive water use for the kushabhadra bhargavi river delta of eastern india in reality the problem of conjunctive allocation of water resources is complex non linear vedula et al 2005 and comprised of multiple objectives several multi objective optimization models were presented in the literature using multiple criteria decision making mcdm techniques such as goal programming and multi scale optimization modeling hajkowicz and higgins 2008 a multi scale optimization model was presented in li et al 2021 for optimal allocation of water and cropping area by considering uncertainties in the demand supply of water similarly a goal programming model developed in mosleh et al 2017 for sustainable allocation of cropping patterns and water resources in the iran region srivastava and singh 2017 introduced a fuzzy based goal programming model considering goals such as maximization of crop yield and net return coupled with minimizing water use fertilizers and investment the model had implemented for the command area in the allahabad district of india in naghdi et al 2021 a simulation optimization model combined with nash bargaining theory for optimal allocation of water resources in the industrial agriculture and environmental sector recently many meta heuristic optimization approaches have been utilized in the literature due to their advantages in solving complex design problems also solving multi objective optimization problems using a meta heuristic method is simplistic and easy to implement ye et al 2018 the genetic algorithm ga and particle swarm optimization pso has practiced in several works of literature for managing water resources a multi objective optimization model to study the dynamic interaction between groundwater and surface water for low flow areas was presented in zeinali et al 2020 the model was implemented in western iran using non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii similarly a multi objective optimization model introduced in sepahvand et al 2019 utilizes a ga to optimize the conjunctive water allocation for wet normal and dry periods the ga had also been used to simulate the variation in groundwater levels a conjunctive model utilizing pso was presented in yousefi et al 2018 which used treated wastewater and groundwater simultaneously to maximize the net return and groundwater level and to minimize the nitrogen leaching in soil and water a fuzzy based multi objective pso was proposed by rezaei et al 2017 as a long term 10 year multi crop planning method that optimizes three objectives of maximizing the crop net return and groundwater sustainability and minimizing the shortage in fulfilling irrigation demand davijani et al 2016 introduced a socio economic optimization model to allocate water resources in agriculture industry and municipal sectors the model was solved using weighted pso and ga a new tool named all water gw was developed in nouiri et al 2015 using a multi objective ga for groundwater management to satisfy multiple objectives like demand satisfaction water cost and drawdown minimization in this work a multi objective optimization model was formulated for the conjunctive application of groundwater and surface water resources optimally most previous studies about water resource allocation were implemented as single objective optimization and consider only the economic aspect of maximizing crop net return however we proposed a socio economic approach for maximizing the net return minimizing the water deficit and maximizing the sustainability of the groundwater level the pennar palar cauvery link canal project has been chosen as a case study to implement the proposed optimization model for the conjunctive use of water resources the conjunctive allocation of groundwater and surface water is considered in this project though optimal allocation has not been practiced hence using an optimization algorithm is essential to allocate land and water resources optimally meta heuristic methods are more advantageous for solving the multi objective problem due to their easy implementation and suitability for high dimensional non linear non convex optimization functions by this time most of the research work in conjunctive water management utilized pso and ga algorithms the pso algorithm has a disadvantage regarding local optima stagnation in high dimensional search space at the same time the ga is time consuming and provides very slow convergence with the increase in the variable s dimension hence selecting the suitable optimization approach for the multi objective problem is necessary to get well distributed pareto optimal solutions in the search space this study showed the superiority of the mpa algorithm in solving the proposed water resource optimization model compared to pso and ga mpa utilizes the levy and brownian strategy together for searching which provides a more systematic explorer exploitation framework and thus leads to faster convergence moreover the fads effect in the mpa algorithm prevents stagnation from local optima 2 methodology 2 1 study area this study investigated the feasibility of optimal allocation of groundwater and surface water resource for the pennar somasila palar cauvery grand anicut link canal command this link canal has been proposed as part of the peninsular river development component under the npp national perspective plan fig 1 shows the location map of the study area the command area of the proposed link canal covers over chittoor and nellore districts in andra pradesh vellore kancheepuram villupuram tiruvannamalai and cuddalore districts in tamil nadu and puducherry the command area has a tropical climate with a maximum temperature that varies from 29 3 c to 37 5 c the minimum temperature varies from 20 6 c to 26 5 c and the annual rainfall ranges from 635 to 1019 mm the length of the total area covered by the link canal is 529 190 km a total quantity of 8565 mm3 water diverts annually from the somasila dam with an entire supply of 95 42 m the total cultivable command area available for irrigation is 599010 ha and the remaining irrigable area is 491200 ha after being irrigated by tank canal and other sources thus a total cultivable command area of 491200 ha is considered in the study to provide en route irrigation using 3048 mm3 of surface water nwda 2021 2 1 1 existing irrigation facilities a 55 of the total land area has been irrigated by existing irrigation facilities such as tanks and wells the agriculture in this area is equally dependent on rain and irrigation the whole command area of the link canal has been divided into six direct sluices and 16 branch canals grouped into seven zones based on district the types of soil found in command areas are red loamy soils coastal sands red sandy clay loam soils black clayey soils alluvial soils and forest soils 2 1 2 existing cropping pattern in the command area there are mainly two cropping seasons in the command area kharif and rabi the kharif season runs from july to november and from november to april runs the rabi season the principal food crops grown in the command area are maize jowar pulses vegetables cotton and chilies in the kharif season and oilseeds paddy and ragi in the rabi season a 65 of the net sown area is dedicated to cotton paddy and oilseeds crop in this study the cropping pattern specified in the water balance study report of the basins between pennar and cauvery rivers nwda 2021 was adopted as the existing cropping pattern this cropping pattern is recommended by considering soil type and prevailing agriculture or irrigation practices in the command area the irrigation amount is regarded as 100 table 1 lists the suggested cropping pattern for the command area irrigation en route to the link canal 2 1 3 groundwater the study area contains a total of 22000 dug wells and 105000 tube wells the groundwater potential in the command area has been estimated based on district wise groundwater resources published by cgwb central groundwater board in 2003 the district wise groundwater potential and utilization in different sectors are shown in table 2 the district wise area is divided into seven zones according to a pilot study carried out by cgwb 20 of the surface water transmission losses and 40 of the applied irrigation water will be added to the groundwater regime of the command area through canal seepage infiltration and return flow from irrigation also the groundwater estimation methodology suggests a recharge of 50 for the paddy area and 30 for the non paddy area the transmission losses are estimated to be 557 mm3 on 3048 mm3 for the study area en route irrigation however the current link recharge from transmission and irrigation losses is considered 20 due to the difference in areas used for the pilot study 2 1 4 crop water requirement the crop net irrigation requirement or water requirement is the amount of water needed for a crop along with rainfall to fulfill the crop s evapotranspiration et c needs without compromising its yield the crop evapotranspiration is computed using the following equation 1 e t c k c e t o here k c is the crop coefficient and et o represents crop reference evapotranspiration mm day this et o determines evapotranspiration by considering a hypothetical grass reference surface there are several methods to calculate reference evapotranspiration we used an fao penman monteith method to compute reference evapotranspiration et o by using respective crop coefficients k c allen et al 1998 the crop water requirement is defined as 2 n i r e t c e r here er is effective rainfall mm month calculated using a method given by food and agriculture organization fao dastane 1974 and nir represents net irrigation requirement mm month the various parameters in the equations were computed using standard meteorological data such as sunshine hours maximum and minimum temperature wind speed and humidity the cultivable command area and the annual crop water requirement for each zone concerning the existing cropping pattern are demonstrated in table 3 2 1 5 cost and benefit parameters the existing command area of various crops with their yield cost of cultivation minimum support price msp and net return is demonstrated in table 4 the surface water and groundwater costs have been estimated as 973 inr 1 1 1 usd 82 7 inr as of 6 january 2023 ha and 200 inr ha respectively the source websites of these data are listed in table 5 2 2 optimization algorithm the problem of water resource optimization has been evaluated recently as a multi objective optimization and solved using popular meta heuristic approaches such as pso and ga however the performance of different optimization algorithms varies according to the nature of the optimization problem the number of decision variables and constraints in this work we evaluated the performance of pso ga and mpa for water resource optimization tasks a brief description of each algorithm is presented below 2 2 1 particle swarm optimization pso the pso algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 is inspired by the social behavior of bird flocks their behavior for food searching is simulated to find the best location in the search space for the optimization algorithm the pso algorithm consists of two steps in the first step the particles are initialized randomly within the search space in the second step of evaluation the fitness value is computed and particle positions are updated concerning their own experience and the collective experience of all the particles to solve the optimization problem using the pso firstly the population of birds b b 1 b 2 b 3 b n is initialized randomly in the search space then the particle positions are updated based on the velocity parameter v defining the movement speed the velocity parameter computed after each iteration such as 3 v i w v i c 1 r 1 p i b i c 2 r 2 g b i 4 b i b i v i here w is the inertia parameter c 1 and c 2 represent the cognitive and social parameters that control the exploration and exploitation of particles v i denote the velocity of i th particle r 1 and r 2 are random values in range 0 1 g denotes the global best position and p i denotes the i th particle s best position 2 2 2 genetic algorithm ga the genetic algorithm is inspired by charles darwin s theory of evolution golberg 1989 it works well on combinatorial continuous and discrete problems and is less susceptible to local optima stagnation samuel and jha 2003 it is based upon the natural selection process where the fittest individuals are selected to produce offspring for the next generation using operators such as selection crossover and mutation initially the population of individuals is defined randomly and each individual in the population is treated as a gene of encoded binary values 0 s and 1 s in the selection phase the fittest pairs of individuals are selected to produce offspring while less fit solutions have a low probability of being selected hence will eventually die in the next generation further a crossover operation is performed by choosing a crossover point and exchanging the genes between parents a crossover probability is defined to decide the percentage of the population chosen during the crossover operation after this the mutation operation is applied to introduce new genetic characteristics in the population it facilitates random search in the search space to prevent local optima stagnation the mutation probability decides the frequency of mutation operation thus affecting the overall performance of ga nsga ii is a variant of ga to obtain pareto optimal solutions for multi objective problems deb et al 2002 it employs a fast non dominated sorting approach to find solutions near to pareto optimal front a crowding distance metric has been computed among the obtained solutions to obtain diverse solutions in the search space moreover elitism behavior has been introduced to retain the fittest solution in the next generation and improve the algorithm s convergence 2 2 3 marine predators algorithm mpa marine predators algorithm is a population based algorithm given by faramarzi et al 2020 this method is inspired by the foraging strategy of predators in the ocean they follow a random walk strategy which can be either levy or brownian the levy motion can search deep in local areas by taking small steps at a time and occasionally jump to explore other areas while the brownian motion trace in every possible direction in distant neighborhood areas by taking long steps and can explore all over search space hence combining these two strategies allows the deep local search as well as global search the strategy followed by a predator at any moment depends upon the velocity ratio between prey to predator and prey distribution in search space this trade off between levy and brownian motion allows finding an optimal solution the flow diagram of mpa is depicted in fig 2 to implement marine predator behavior for optimization a population of prey prey p 1 p 2 p 3 p n is considered each search agent is treated both as a prey and a predator the top predator is talented in foraging thus assigned a search agent location that obtains the fittest solution the top predator is named elite by observing the behavior of marine predators the optimization process of mpa is classified into three phases 1 phase 1 a high velocity ratio scenario when the prey s velocity is higher than the predator s is considered at the initial one third of iteration in the optimization process the best approach for predators in the high velocity ratio is not to move while prey moves in brownian motion to promote exploration this rule is mathematically specified as follows s t e p s i z e i r b e l i t e r b p i p i p i p r s t e p s i z e i here r b is the random number generated using brownian motion r is a random number drawn from a uniform distribution 0 1 p represents a constant assigned with a value of 0 5 2 phase 2 the prey and predator move at the same unit velocity ratio v 1 this scenario is considered for the intermediate one third of iterations of the optimization process in this phase the transition from exploration to exploitation takes place thus half of the population is considered prey and the remaining half is assumed to be predators so if the prey moves in levy the best approach for the predator is to move in brownian motion the prey movement can be defined as s t e p s i z e i r l e l i t e r l p i p i p i p r s t e p s i z e i here r l is a random number generated using the levy distribution similarly the movement of a predator is defined as s t e p s i z e i r b r b e l i t e p i p i e l i t e p c f s t e p s i z e i c f 1 i t e r m a x i t e r 2 i t e r m a x i t e r here cf parameter controls the predator s step size 3 phase 3 this phase simulates the scenario when a predator has a higher velocity than the prey this scenario is adopted for the last one third of the optimization process in this scenario the best approach for the predator is levy which promotes exploitation here the predator movement is defined as s t e p s i z e i r l r l e l i t e p i p i e l i t e p c f s t e p s i z e i 4 eddy formation and fads effect the eddy formation and fads effects trigger the behavior change in a marine predator these effects represent a situation of stagnation in local minima and predators take the long jump to escape from these effects these effects are mathematically modeled as follows p i p i c f p m i n r p m a x p m i n if r f a d s p i f a d s 1 r r p r 1 p r 2 if r f a d s here fads 0 2 denotes the probability of fads effects in the optimization process r is a random number in the range 0 1 r1 and r2 are random indexes of the prey population p min and p max denote the lower and upper bound of search space the disadvantages of the pso algorithm are it is easy to fall into local optimum in high dimensional space and has a low convergence rate in the iterative process li et al 2014 in contrast ga is computationally expensive and converges slowly due to the utilization of evaluation operators such as selection crossover and mutation hence the mpa algorithm which provides a more systematic explorer exploitation framework and prevents local optima stagnation was considered more suitable for water resource optimization tasks in this study these algorithms were implemented for a multi objective optimization task and a set of non dominated solutions were computed using pareto archive evaluation strategy knowles and corne 2000 2 3 formulation of the optimization model the flowchart of the proposed optimization model is shown in fig 3 the implementation of the multi objective model needed meteorological data crop related data and geographical and irrigation data of the study area further the constraints and decision variables were decided based on expert knowledge the problem of optimal allocation of cropping area and water resources in a link canal command was modeled as three objective functions to maximize the crop net return improve aquifer recharge and minimize the water deficit in crops the objective function to maximize crop net return was formulated in the following manner 5 m a x z 1 i 1 7 j 1 2 k 1 c a i j k y k p k c c l k i 1 7 j 1 2 c s i s w i j i 1 7 j 1 2 c g i g w i j where i depicts the zones in the command area j is the index of crop growing time 1 for kharif and 2 for rabi season c is the total number of crops in the command area a ijk is the area assigned to crop k in zone i in season j y k and p k show the yield and price of crop k respectively ccl k is the cultivation cost for crop k excluding irrigation cost cs i and cg i represent the unit cost of groundwater and surface water for zone i inr mm3 sw ij and gw ij represent surface water and groundwater allocation in season j for zone i mm3 the second objective function was to minimize the water deficit for crops is given as follows 6 m i n z 2 i 1 7 j 1 2 d e m a n d i j s u p p l y i j d e m a n d i j 2 7 d e m a n d i j k 1 c n i r i j k a i j k 8 s u p p l y i j α β s w i j g w i j 100 here demand ij is the total water requirement in season j for zone i given by the net irrigation requirement of all crops in that area see eq 7 supply ij is the total water allocated by a conjunctive model in season j for zone i the total allocated water is given by eq 8 in which nir ijk is the net irrigation requirement in j season for k crop for i zone m α represents the application efficiency of field water 0 60 and β represents the conveyance efficiency of surface water 0 65 the third objective was to improve the aquifer recharge rate to maintain groundwater sustainability it is defined as follows 9 m a x z 3 i 1 7 j 1 2 1 β s w i θ β s w i g w i γ r f i j a i j g w i j here rf ij is the rainfall in season j for zone i mm θ and γ is the recharge factor from irrigation loss 0 3 and rainfall respectively 0 14 z 3 is the rate of aquifer recharge in mm3 1 β represents the conveyance loss from surface water 0 35 these objective functions were subjected to the following constraints land area constraint the total cultivable command area cca for each zone must not exceed the sum of the area allocated for each crop in the zone during the rabi and kharif seasons the land area constraint is specified as follows 10 j 1 2 k 1 c a i j k t a i i here ta i is the total cultivable command area of zone i water availability constraint the groundwater and surface water allocation in zone i season j must be less than or equal to the total available surface and groundwater in zone i season j 11 g w i j t g w i j i j 12 s w

practices a lower and upper bound was considered for each crop as a model constraint depending upon the existing area allocated for a crop 13 μ i j k m i n t a i j k a i j k μ i j k m a x t a i j k here μ i j k m a x and μ i j k m i j represent the factors by which the area of crops can be increased and decreased respectively ta ijk is the total allocated area for crop k in zone i season j non negativity constraints the allocated area for each crop groundwater and surface water must be greater than 0 14 a i j k 0 g w i j 0 s w i j 0 i j k the description of variables used in the water resource optimization model is shown in table 6 3 results and discussion the optimization algorithms used to solve the water resource optimization model had been implemented in python version 3 7 3 on a pc with specification 11th gen intel r core tm i5 1135g7 2 40 ghz and 8 gb ram as shown in table 6 the decision variables of the optimization algorithm represent the cropping area allocated to crops in each zone there are 13 cropping areas for the rabi and kharif seasons and seven zones hence the total number of decision variables is 91 in the optimization algorithm each point p in the population is defined by a vector of size n thus the population of points is represented as a matrix of s rows and n columns such as 15 p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 2 n p s 1 p s 2 p s n here s denotes the number of points in the population and n represents the number of decision variables the implementation steps of the water resource optimization model using a meta heuristic optimization algorithm are given as follows 1 initialize the hyper parameters of the optimization algorithm as defined in table 7 2 initialize the required input parameters and coefficient value of the model as defined in table 6 3 randomly initialize the points in the population against the minimum μ min and maximum allowable cropping area μ max for each crop in different zones as shown in eq 13 4 calculate the fitness value of each point using objective functions defined in eq 5 6 and 9 and apply the constraints specified in section 2 3 5 save the fittest solutions in the repository using the pareto archive evaluation strategy 6 update the position of each point as defined by the optimization algorithm 7 repeat steps 4 6 for a specified number of iterations after completing iterations a repository containing pareto optimal solutions is obtained as output to the optimization algorithm the optimization model was executed by considering deviations in the existing cropping area such as 5 10 15 20 and 25 these deviations were considered around the existing cropping pattern to create a more practical model that fulfills the local food demand see eq 13 also the allowable mining for groundwater resources varied from 0 to 70 in the optimization process to obtain a diverse range of solutions and to consider the maximum crop net return scenario on a different allocation of groundwater and surface water resources such consideration will help to decide the optimal ratio of groundwater and surface water that could be exploited to maximize the crop net return and the sustainability of groundwater level the crop water requirement in each zone had been fulfilled initially with allowable mining of the available groundwater in the zone and the rest was fulfilled with the surface water the objective functions described in sub section 2 3 were optimized using multi objective mpa faramarzi et al 2020 multi objective pso kennedy and eberhart 1995 and nsga ii deb et al 2002 for each of the specified deviations in cropping area table 7 presents the selected parameter value of these algorithms these parameters were chosen as recommended by the developers of these algorithms to have the best performance these algorithms executed over thirty independent trials and their performance was compared using hypervolume and coverage metrics zitzler et al 2000 the hypervolume metric measures the distribution of results over a search space by computing a volume concerning a reference point in the search space a higher value of hypervolume describes well distributed results the coverage metric compares the solution achieved by two different algorithms for any two algorithms a and b the coverage of b with respect to a is given by the number of solutions in b n2 dominated by solutions obtained by algorithm a n1 the formula to calculate coverage of algorithm b denoted as c n1 n2 is given by 16 c n 1 n 2 x 2 ϵ n 2 x 1 ϵ n 1 x 1 x 2 n 2 the mean hypervolume value obtained by each algorithm for different cropping area deviations is shown in fig 4 it indicates the hypervolume value increases with an increase in area deviation the mpa obtained a higher value for the hypervolume metric thus achieving well distributed solutions table 8 presents the mean coverage value where the coverage metric obtained by mpa with respect to pso and nsga ii is given by c 1 c 2 and the coverage of pso and nsga ii with respect to mpa is specified as c the coverage value c 2 is zero for all cropping area deviations and c 1 is near zero for three cropping area deviations depicting that mpa achieved a higher number of non dominated solutions than pso and nsga ii the superiority of results obtained by mpa is due to its systematic exploitation and exploration strategy using levy and brownian motion thus leading to faster convergence also fad s effects prevent stuck in local optima and thus drive towards optimal global solutions the maximum net return achieved using mpa pso and nsga ii for different cropping deviations is shown in fig 5 the crop net return increases drastically using mpa with the increasing deviation in the cropping area as more cropping area was assigned to crops with a high net return however more deviation in the existing cropping pattern can affect the local demand ratio of crops hence it should be considered within a predefined limit the surface water and groundwater resources utilized for different cropping area deviations to achieve maximum net return are shown in fig 6 suggesting 34 of groundwater usage at 25 cropping area deviation further results are analyzed considering 25 deviations from the existing cropping area fig 7 depicts the variation in mean hypervolume value with the number of iterations in the optimization algorithm it indicates the hypervolume value obtained using pso and nsga ii showed a very slight increase after 200 iterations while mpa showed a continuous improvement in hypervolume several non dominated solutions pareto optimal solutions achieved at 25 cropping area deviation by mpa are depicted in fig 8 showing a well distributed pareto front around the search space the maximum net return gained using obtained optimal cropping pattern and the net return achieved using the existing cropping pattern presented by table 9 the table shows the significant variations in the cropping area of paddy cotton and pulses the proposed model suggests reducing the cropping area for paddy and cotton crops in the kharif season reducing the fodder crop area in rabi and increasing the fodder crop in the kharif season an increase in the area for groundnut crops and a reduction in the jowar crop area is suggested for the rabi season additionally the obtained cropping pattern allocated more cultivation area for pulses in the rabi season the net return achieved using the existing and obtained cropping pattern is 13751 05 million inr and 15079 25 million inr respectively which shows an increase in 1327 05 million inr net return using the obtained cropping pattern the zone wise surface water and groundwater utilization is shown in fig 9 and fig 10 shows the cropping pattern allocated for each zone at 25 area deviations this section depicts the implementation of the proposed model for the pennar palar cauvery link canal command in india the conjunctive allocation of water resources is considered during the planning of this link canal project however optimal allocation of these resources is required to maintain the groundwater balance and avoid the problem of water logging and salinity moreover the cropping pattern needs to be selected based on the current availability of water resources to fulfill the crop water requirement and maximize net profit hence a multi objective optimization problem was formulated in this work consisting of maximizing the crop net return minimizing the water deficit and maintaining the aquifer recharge the multi objective model was solved using meta heuristic approaches which generate a set of pareto optimal solutions as output thus allowing the decision maker to select the best cropping pattern based on the current availability of water resources and preferences however due to the high dimensionality and complex nature of the water resources optimization problem an appropriate algorithm must be selected to solve the multi objective optimization problem efficiently pso and ga are state of the art optimization algorithms for solving multi objective problems but pso has the disadvantage of being stuck in local optima in high dimensional space on the other hand ga provides slow convergence and has high computational complexity due to mutation crossover and selection operation thus in this work an mpa algorithm that shows higher values of performance metrics is utilized for solving multi objective optimization we executed the model for different cropping area deviations ranging from 5 to 25 showing that increasing deviation in the existing cropping area drastically increases the crop net return moreover the variation in groundwater utilization has been 0 70 tried to find the optimal use of groundwater and surface water resources the model suggests 34 of groundwater utilization in obtaining the maximum net profit of 1327 05 million inr further the model also provides a range of well distributed pareto optimal solutions 4 conclusions a multi objective model for water resource optimization is formulated to increase the crop net return maintain the aquifer recharge and reduce the water deficit the problem of water resource optimization is multi objective complex non linear and subjected to various constraints hence utilizing an efficient meta heuristic approach allows for obtaining a well distributed pareto optimal solution for the problem this study evaluated three meta heuristic optimization approaches pso ga mpa for the conjunctive allocation of water resources it provides insight into the efficiency of the mpa for water resource optimization higher values of performance metrics hypervolume coverage achieved using mpa show its capability to achieve more diverse and well distributed solutions for the problem hence a suitable optimization approach must be chosen by water managers based on the nature of the problem to get optimal solutions the proposed multi objective model was optimized considering cropping area deviation of 5 10 15 20 and 25 and the allowance of groundwater mining was varied randomly between 0 and 70 during the optimization process the experimental results show that increasing the area deviations also increases the crop net return this study suggests significant area deviation in paddy cotton and pulses to increase the crop net return along with sustainable use of groundwater resources further the deviation parameters in cropping area and groundwater should be carefully chosen by experts considering the current crop demand and groundwater and surface water availability the development of such an optimization model allows for managing socio economic requirements efficiently and ensures the sustainable supply of water the proposed model applies to different areas with similar problems by changing the input parameters however in the present study certain parameters used in the algorithm such as uncertainty in rainfall groundwater recharge and interaction between surface water and groundwater have not been considered hence the future direction is to develop or use the appropriate estimation models to compute the groundwater recharge rainfall and crop water requirement declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

9063,agroforestry has been widely used for the ecological restoration construction of semi arid regions of the chinese loess plateau investigating plant water sources is crucial for understanding the key ecohydrological processes of plant root water uptake and the water relations between coexisting plants clarifying the plant water use strategies can help to assess the sustainability of the vegetation restoration in agroforestry systems and provide references for the vegetation management thus we investigated the water use characteristics of plants in an agroforestry system consisting of platycladus orientalis prunus davidiana and medicago sativa the δd and δ18o of plant stem water and soil water in the 0 300 cm layer were measured the mixsiar model and proportional similarity ps were used to quantify the proportion of soil water absorbed by the plants in each layer and the hydrological niche overlap of plants the results showed that the combined effects of rainfall recharge and evapotranspiration et loss resulted in a decrease in soil water content swc for the agroforestry system with increasing soil depth and the swc of the deep layer 80 300 cm had minor variability 6 1 7 1 throughout the study period during the study period due to the deep soil desiccation p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa mainly utilized water from shallow 0 80 cm soil layers with a contribution rate of 65 4 8 3 64 9 7 7 and 73 0 0 2 respectively the three coexisting plants relied on the unstable shallow soil water recharged by rainfall while the water use proportion of the deep soil layer was consistently low this implies that the three plants were less resistant to drought stress thus posing a threat to the stability and sustainability of the agroforestry system moreover even in july and september with the high swc in agroforestry the partitioning of soil water among the three coexisting plants did not increase with increased et loss the three coexisting plants showed strong competition for soil water use as indicated by the high values 0 69 0 97 of ps overall the hydrological niche overlap of the coexisting plants in the agroforestry system resulted in low ecosystem stability density reduction or selection of suitable species is required to achieve sustainable vegetation restoration keywords plant water uptake stable isotopes coexisting plants agroforestry semi arid loess plateau data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction agroforestry is one of the most important vegetation restoration measures in the grain for green vegetation restoration project implemented on the loess plateau of china since 1999 jia et al 2015 fu et al 2016 gao et al 2018a 2018b agroforestry has ecological social and economic benefits by protecting the environment ensuring food security and increasing income via climate change mitigation peng et al 2009 meyer et al 2015 kamau et al 2017 muchane et al 2020 raihan et al 2021 however the agroforestry system can significantly affect the original hydrologic cycles and ecological processes muñoz villers et al 2020 importantly the water relationship between species in agroforestry systems significantly affects ecosystem stability yang et al 2021a therefore it is of great significance to study the water sources of coexisting plants in agroforestry systems agroforestry is often based on the theory of niche complementarity whereby coexisting species have complementary water use strategies and thus avoid excessive competition loreau et al 2001 fernández et al 2007 the use of different water sources by different plants is of great importance to the coexistence of plant species wu et al 2016 brinkmann et al 2019 yang et al 2011 reported that there was complementarity of the water niche among coexisting species of shrubs and grasses in semi arid ecosystems similarly shrubs and trees have been found to absorb deep soil water while herbaceous species use shallow soil water as their main water source ludwig et al 2004 darrouzet nardi et al 2006 wu et al 2014 however some studies have found that coexisting plants in agroforestry systems compete for water resources ling et al 2017 cardinael et al 2020 for example yang et al 2021b found that the decrease in alfalfa yields in a silvopastoral system was caused by competition between poplar trees and alfalfa for resources such as water water availability and competition for limited water resources among coexisting plants will greatly affect the stability and sustainability of plant communities therefore there is an urgent need to explore the water use patterns of different plants in agroforestry systems in order to provide references for vegetation management the traditional method of determining plant water use is to measure the root distribution of plants or the vertical distribution of soil water van kanten et al 2005 bello et al 2019 however the spatial distribution of roots does not always reflect the absorption of water resources by plants in the soil profile lehmann 2003 measurements of soil water are limited by the inability to determine which plant or plants among all coexisting plants are responsible for the loss of water padovan et al 2015 stable isotope δ18o and δd technology provides an effective method for determining the water use pattern of plants which can overcome the abovementioned limitations zhang et al 2019 previous studies have shown that seasonal variations in the isotopic characteristics of precipitation lead to different natural compositions of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in different water sources dai et al 2020 in addition except for a few plants isotopic fractionation did not occur in the process of water absorption by plant roots dawson and ehleringer 1991 thus the isotopic composition of plant xylem water represents a mixture of different water sources consequently the proportion of each water source absorbed by plants can be calculated using some mixing models phillips and gregg 2003 evaristo et al 2017 this technology has been widely used to study water competition or complementarity among species in agroforestry systems for example liu et al 2020a showed that compound planting leads to water competition between apple trees and corn but improves their water use efficiency in the loess hilly region of china using the stable isotope technology wu et al 2017 found that rubber trees and tea trees have complementary water use patterns during the dry season in tropical southwestern china the groundwater in the loess plateau is too deep for plants to use and soil water is the most important water source for plants in the region yang et al 2014 wei et al 2019 moreover due to the large consumption of soil water resources by introduced vegetation jia et al 2017 water availability affects the sustainability of vegetation on the semiarid loess plateau yu et al 2020 2021b as climatic warming and drying progress on the loess plateau piao et al 2010 the shortage of water resources will seriously affect the stability of the agroforestry system in the region however to date few studies have used hydrogen and oxygen isotope techniques to elucidate the water use patterns of coexisting plants in agroforestry systems on the chinese loess plateau and quantify the water relationships among them in order to preserve the limited water resources and improve the ecological environment plants such as platycladus orientalis prunus davidiana and medicago sativa were introduced in the loess plateau under the government s promotion wei et al 2019 they formed an arbor shrub herbage community consisting of p orientalis p davidiana m sativa which was widely adopted by local farmers in afforestation cai et al 2008 recent studies have mainly focused on the effects of climatic factors on the arbor shrub herbage community dymond and johnson 2002 the influence of the arbor shrub herbage community on the formation of dried soil layers wang et al 2008 and soil erosion processes feng et al 2018 in monocultures p orientalis depended on surface soil water deng et al 2021 while m sativa mainly used deep soil water in the dry season and absorbed surface soil water in the rainy season zhu et al 2016 the water use pattern of p davidiana has not been reported however the seasonal plant water uptake and the interspecific water use relationships in arbor shrub herbage ecosystems are still unclear this information is crucial for revealing the stability maintenance mechanism and the sustainability of vegetation in agroforestry systems from the perspective of water use thus we used stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope technology to examine the patterns of water uptake by three species in an agroforestry system and quantify the water relationships among them the objectives of this study were to a investigate the seasonal variation in water use patterns of p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa in an agroforestry system and b explore whether there exists water competition occurred among the three coexisting plants during the study period to predict the sustainability of this ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site was located in the longtan catchment of dingxi city 35 43 35 46 n 104 27 104 31 e on the western loess plateau gansu province china fig 1 the

60 m yang et al 2014 the dominant plant species include the native grass species stipa bungeana trin leymus secalinus georgi tzvel heteropappus altaicus willd novopokr and crops such as potatoes solanum tuberosum soybeans vigna angularis and maize zea mays to alleviate soil and water loess and protect the environment a large number of introduced plants such as alfalfa medicago sativa l

farmland tang et al 2016 yu et al 2019 the study was conducted in an agroforestry system containing the evergreen coniferous tree platycladus orientalis the deciduous shrub prunus davidiana and the fodder crop medicago sativa platycladus orientalis p davidiana and m sativa are widely used in the revegetation practices of the grain for green project on the loess plateau zhang and chen 2007 yuan et al 2016 cui et al 2017 bai et al 2020 a p orientalis p davidiana m sativa agroforestry system was established in 2002 on northeast aspect arable croplands with a slope of 28 the system was composed of p orientalis and p davidiana 1 2 ratio of the two plant species in the row and m sativa between the rows tree rows were spaced 400 cm apart with 200 cm between the trees in the same row fig 1c the heights and crown diameters of p orientalis and p davidiana are shown in table 1 the total area of the research site is approximately 150 ha farmers typically mow m sativa once at the end of july and no irrigation or other management measures are practiced in the entire agroforestry system all meteorological variables in 2018 were automatically recorded by a standard weather station rr 9100 rainroot china near the study site the monthly average precipitation and air temperature of long term 1971 2015 were recorded by dingxi meteorological station 2 2 sample collection plant samples and soil samples of the three coexisting plants were collected simultaneously at the beginning dry season june 6 middle rainy season july 26 and september 17 and end dry season november 10 of the growing season m sativa was not sampled in november because it had wilted on each sampling date four replicated samples were sampled from the selected plants plant stem samples were obtained at 8 00 9 00 a m the stem samples of p orientalis and p davidiana were obtained by cutting suberized twigs approximately 5 cm in length and removing the outer epidermis and phloem tissue deng et al 2021 the stem samples of m sativa were obtained by cutting the stem at a height of 5 cm from the ground zhu et al 2016 and the sampling position was about 200 cm from the tree row i e the center of the m sativa row for soil sampling the central point between p orientalis and p davidiana and the adjacent m sativa base about 200 cm from the tree row were determined as sampling points simultaneously with the sampling of the plant stem a soil core with a depth of 300 cm was sampled using a hand auger with a diameter of 4 cm the soil cores were collected at 20 cm intervals within the 0 120 cm depth range and at 40 cm intervals within the 80 300 cm depth range all plant stem samples and soil samples were immediately placed in parafilm wrapped screw top glass vials and subsequently stored in a freezer 20 c moreover one part of the soil samples was brought back to the laboratory to determine the gravimetric soil water content swc by the oven drying method rainwater samples were taken immediately after each precipitation event and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c groundwater was not sampled because the groundwater table 40 m at the study site was far beyond the maximum rooting depth of plants chen et al 2021 2 3 analysis of hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition water in soil and plant stem was extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2000 los gatos research mountain view usa and the extracted water samples were placed in glass vials sealed with paraﬁlm and stored at 4 c the δd and δ18o of the extracted soil water and rainwater were measured using a liquid water isotope analyser picarro l2130i usa with analytical accuracies of 0 1 and 0 025 for δd and δ18o respectively the δd and δ18o of stem water were determined by isotopic ratio infrared spectrometry dlt 100 lgr usa with analytical accuracies of 0 3 and 0 1 for δd and δ18o respectively the stable isotopic composition can be expressed as 1 δd or δ 18 o r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the d h and 18o 16o molar ratios of the samples and the standard water standard mean ocean water smow respectively 2 4 measurement of soil moisture a time domain reflectometry tdr moisture measurement system trime imko micromodultechnik germany was used for soil moisture measurement one tdr tube was installed at 30 cm from the stems of p orientalis and p davidiana respectively in addition one tdr tube was installed at the center of the adjacent m sativa sample plot soil moisture in the 0 180 cm depth layer was measured at the beginning of each month from april to december during the period june 2018 and december 2020 three replicates were conducted for this measurement and the temporal evolution of soil moisture is shown in fig s1 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 determination and quantification of water sources based on the distributions of the isotope values and swc the entire soil profile 0 300 cm was divided into three potential water sources surface 0 20 cm middle 20 80 cm and deep 80 300 cm soil water mixsiar version 3 1 12 a bayesian mixing model was adopted to estimate the relative proportional contributions of the different water sources further details about the criteria used to categorise the soil depths can be found in a previous study chen et al 2021 first the raw δd and δ18o values of stem water were used as the mixture data input to the mixsiar model second the means and corresponding standard deviations of the δd and δ18o values of the soil water were used as the source data input to the mixsiar model third the discrimination data were set to 0 for both δd and δ18o last the run length of the markov chain monte carlo mcmc was set to long further information on mixsiar was described by zhou et al 2021 2 5 2 evaluation of water competition to assess the competition for soil water resources between any two of the three species we calculated the proportional similarity ps among the three species hoekstra et al 2014 ps is an indicator of niche overlap between species colwell and futuyma 1971 ps ranges from 0 to 1 the higher the ps value is the greater the overlap degree of the main water absorbing soil layers between the two species and the greater the competition for soil water resources 2 ps 1 0 5 i 1 n p 1 i p 2 i where p1i and p2i are the proportions of soil water absorbed by species 1 and 2 in the i layer of the three soil layers respectively 2 5 3 estimation of evapotranspiration soil water storage sws mm was calculated as follows 3 sws i 1 9 w i h i 10 100 where w is the soil water content and h cm is the soil layer depth the monthly evapotranspiration et of the three sample plots was estimated by calculating the water balance of the 0 180 cm soil layer allen et al 1998 2021b 4 et p e s cr p r where pe is the precipitation mm δs the change in sws mm in the 0 180 cm soil layer from the beginning to the end of the month and cr capillary rise mm was neglected because the groundwater table of the sample plots was greater than 40 m according to our 0 180 cm soil moisture data rainfall rarely infiltrated to a depth of 180 cm at our sample plots so p deep percolation mm at 180 cm depth was neglected r runoff mm was set at 0 because of the low slope of the sample plots 2 5 4 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to analyse swc differences in different months and soil layers and ps differences in different months and different species ordinary least squares regression was performed to evaluate the relationship between the δd and δ18o values in soil water and rainwater and the relationship between the proportion of root water uptake and swc all statistical analyses were performed using spss 26 0 spss inc chicago il usa the location graph was generated by arcgis 10 5 https www esri com en us arcgis about arcgis overview diagrams were generated using origin 9 5 software origin software inc fairview tx usa 3 results 3 1 meteorological parameters swc and et the total precipitation in 2018 amounted to 423 8 mm which was a wet year compared to the average precipitation in 1971 2015 385 3 mm fig 2 more than 78 0 of the precipitation in 2018 occurred between july and september which was higher than that in 1971 2015 54 0 in addition the highest monthly and daily precipitation were 152 6 mm and 68 2 mm respectively and both occurred in july the average air temperature in 2018 was 7 9 c which was higher than that in 1971 2015 7 2 c the monthly average temperature in march june 2018 showed a trend of being higher than that in the corresponding months in 1971 2015 in summary 2018 had showed a drier dry season and wetter wet season than 1971 2015 the swc varied with month and soil depth for p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa during the study period fig 3 the swc decreased with soil depth for both plots that is the swc showed a trend of being larger in the surface soil layer than in the middle and deep soil layers table 2 the swc for p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa showed strong monthly variation in the surface and middle soil layers while it fluctuated slightly in deep soil layer fig 3a b c fig 4 shows that the et of the three plants varied with the month in general et showed an increasing trend first and then decreased in all three years which has a similar trend with rainfall all the three plants had greater et in the rainy season july and september than in the dry season june and november in 2018 3 2 isotopic characteristics of rainwater soil water and stem water in all sampling months the isotopic composition of the soil water for different species showed a consistent pattern and varied with soil depth and month fig 5 the highest variation range of isotopes in soil water for p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa was observed in june 60 31 28 51 and 66 96 24 62 for hydrogen isotopes respectively 7 47 1 41 and 8 16 1 20 for oxygen isotopes respectively and the lowest was observed in july 60 80 44 56 and 71 53 46 36 for hydrogen isotopes respectively 8 25 5 94 and 9 11 5 81 for oxygen isotopes respectively in the surface soil layer the variation in isotopes for p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa was the largest while that of the deep soil layer was relatively stable there was no difference in soil water isotopes between p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa except in june the isotopes in stem water of the three species were all significantly higher in june than in other months except in september there were significant differences in stem water isotopes between m sativa and the other two species however stem water isotopes did not differ between p orientalis and p davidiana during the study period the ranges of δd and δ18o in precipitation were 70 28 to 6 73 and 10 76 2 08 respectively fig 6 the local meteoric water line lmwl was fitted based on the isotopic composition of precipitation similarly the soil water line swl was fitted based on the isotopic composition of soil water the slope and intercept of the two swls were smaller than those of the lmwl the two swls were both positioned on the lower right of the lmwl compared with p orientalis p davidiana the swl of m sativa had a higher slope the isotopic composition of stem water was distributed near the swl indicating that soil water was the main water source for these three plants 3 3 root water uptake and its relationship with swc the direct contrast approach revealed that layer of soil water mainly used by p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa in june was 0 20 cm fig 5a e i however when there were multiple isotope intersection points between the stem water vertical line and the soil water line this approach cannot determine the soil layer where the three plants absorb water in the other three months in addition this method cannot determine the specific proportions of water absorbed by plants from different soil layers the proportional contributions of soil water to plants in each soil profile layer calculated by the mixsiar model are shown in fig 7 the proportional contributions of soil water in each soil layer to the three plants varied with the month in june the primary water source of p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa was surface soil water and its contribution rate was 64 1 57 9 and 40 3 respectively in july the water absorbing soil layer of the three plants deepened and m sativa mainly used middle soil water while the highest proportional contributions of soil water to p orientalis and p davidiana came from the deep soil layer compared with that in july the mainly water absorbing soil layers of all the three plants shifted to the surface soil layer then p orientalis and p davidiana switched their water source to deep soil water in november and the contribution rates were 56 0 and 54 3 respectively fig 8 shows the relationship between the proportion of root water uptake of all soil layers at all sampling dates and the corresponding swc there was no significant relationship between the proportion of root water uptake and swc of p orientalis or p davidiana however there was a positive linear relationship between the proportion of root water uptake and swc of m sativa 3 4 water use relationships among coexisting plants the ps results showed that there were different degrees of competition among the three plants in different months fig 9 platycladus orientalis and p davidiana competed fiercely for soil water over the four studied months with the ps exceeding 0 86 the ps of p davidiana m sativa and p orientalis m sativa both increased with month and the lowest value was 0 69 4 discussion 4 1 variations in soil water content and isotopic composition of plant water use sources soil water content is affected by rainfall recharge and evapotranspiration loss hsieh et al 1998 during the dry season june and november due to scarce rainfall evapotranspiration resulted in significantly lower swc in june and november than in other months fig 3 in the rainy season july and september the replenishment by heavy rainfall effectively increased the swc of the shallow soil layer however even during the rainy season the swc of the deep layer does not change over time because it can hardly be effectively replenished these results indicated that soil desiccation occurred in deep soil layers in this agroforestry system and the deep soil water depletion caused by deep rooted plants could not be effectively restored in a short period of time wu et al 2021 wang et al 2011 the isotopic composition of precipitation is influenced by temperature precipitation amount and precipitation seasonality araguás araguás et al 1998 the slope 7 55 and intercept 9 17 of the lmwl were lower than those of the gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 indicating that precipitation had undergone weak evaporative enrichment fig 7 this result is consistent with the study of wang et al 2020 in the central region of the loess plateau the isotopic composition of soil water varied significantly with month and soil layer fig 5 revealing those factors such as precipitation infiltration and evaporation had a comprehensive impact on the isotopic fractionation of soil water brooks et al 2015 for p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa the slope and intercept of the swl were both significantly lower than those of the lmwl fig 6 which suggests that the soil water at both sites was affected by evaporation evaristo et al 2015 beyer et al 2018 in the dry season june the isotopic composition of the surface soil water at both sites was more positive than that of the deep soil water which was due to the dominant effect of evaporation on soil water isotopes these results are consistent with liu et al 2020b and wen et al 2010 who described that the effect of evaporation on the isotopic composition of soil water weakened as the soil layer deepened however in the rainy season july and september the isotopic composition of the surface and middle soil water showed clear negative changes which was attributed to the large amount of rainfall infiltration into these soil layers in november under the condition of weak soil evaporation caused by low temperature rainfall with negative isotopic values dominated the isotopic value of shallow soil water these results are consistent with the results of relevant studies that is after rainfall events the mixing of infiltration water and original soil water makes the isotopic values of new soil water strongly influenced by the isotopic values of rainfall gazis and feng 2004 interestingly we found significant depletion of soil water isotopes in the 240 300 cm layer e g m sativa in september suggesting that this may be the result of rainfall infiltration in the form of preferred flow notably in june and july the soil water isotope values in the deep soil layer of p orientalis p davidiana were significantly higher than those of m sativa fig 5 the possible reason is that rainfall infiltration under the different plants was totally different pan et al 2020 also found that variations in soil water isotopes were caused by different artificial sand fixation vegetation due to different influences on rainfall infiltration in the tengger desert 4 2 seasonal variation in plant water use patterns the three coexisting plants all had flexible water use patterns that is they switched their main water sources from different soil water layers in different seasons fig 7 the ability to adjust water use strategies according to environmental conditions is critical to plant survival in arid and semi arid ecosystems wu et al 2016 grossiord et al 2017 the water use patterns of these three coexisting plants are closely related to et and swc to be exact to water requirement and swc the et of all three plants was lower in june than in july and september fig 4 and the swc of the surface layer in june was significantly higher than that of the other soil layers fig 3 under the condition of low water content deeper soil layers are disconnected from the evaporation fluxes and et only occurs in the shallow layer resulting in a larger contribution ratio of the surface soil water to the water use by p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa fig 7 this is similar to the results of huo et al 2020 who found that jujube trees in intercropping systems absorbed a higher proportion of water from layers with higher water content in july and september the swc in the shallow layers was significantly higher than that in the deep layers due to rainfall supply however the water sources for all three plants gradually shifted from the surface layers to the deeper layers fig 7 this is related to the high et in july and september in july and september the water requirement of the three plants was high and the soil water in the shallow and middle layers was insufficient to sustain the high transpiration demand resulting in an increased proportion of water uptake from the deep soil layers this switch in plant water sources may also be due to changes in root distribution that is infiltrated rainfall promotes the growth of new roots in the soil profile which in turn improves the use of middle soil water by plants sun et al 2011 in addition plant water competition leads to the greater dependence of p orientalis and p davidiana on deeper soil water yang et al 2020 had found a similar phenomenon in agroforestry systems where water competition between rubber trees and intercrops have led to a greater reliance of rubber trees on deep soil water in september we found that the soil layer with the maximum water absorption ratio of the three plants moved up and the soil layer with the maximum water absorption ratio of m sativa was still higher than that of p orientalis and p davidiana the most likely reason is the combination of the recharge of 0 80 cm soil water by rainfall in september and m sativa was more sensitive to soil water changes than p orientalis and p davidiana figs 3 and 8 et was lower in november than in july fig 4 but p orientalis and p davidiana still absorbed a larger proportion of water from the deep soil layer in november which could be attributed to the low swc caused by the long drought in this month figs 2 and 3 similarly song et al 2022 found that plants increased their uptake of deep soil water after drought 4 3 interspecific water use relationships and implications for vegetation management during the study period p orientalis and p davidiana mainly absorbed shallow and deep soil water while m sativa mainly absorbed surface and middle soil water in june the ps between m sativa and the other two coexisting plants was not high less than 0 70 fig 9 these results indicate that the soil water resources used by these three plants were complementary during the early growing season this may be due to the low water requirement of the three plants during the early growing season fig 4 in semi arid regions the availability of water is a major limiting factor for plant growth yang et al 2012 jia et al 2013 and the clear hydrological niche segregation of these three plant species in agroforestry systems is a positive indication of their adaptation to arid environments zhang et al 2020b this complementary water use relationship apparently contributes to the survival of coexisting plants however in most of the growing period the water resources used by the three plants especially those used by p orientalis and p davidiana almost coincided and the ps was always high not less than 0 80 fig 9 which indicated that the water competition among them was fierce however it is worth noting that the degree of water competition between m sativa and the other two plants was lower than that between p orientalis and p davidiana we also found that in the studied ecosystem the swc of deep soil layers was always lower than 7 1 and remained unchanged among the month figs 3 and s1 indicating that even in wet years fig 2 the effective replenishment of soil water by rainfall rarely exceeded 80 cm in addition the groundwater level in the loess plateau is too deep to recharge the deep soil water therefore the deep soil water of the agroforestry ecosystem is severely depleted and will become difficult to recover due to the intensified plant consumption under the future drier and warmer climate regime of the loess plateau huang et al 2017 and the shortage of soil water resources may become more serious these results demonstrate the existence of water competition among arbor shrub and herbage in a semi arid agroforestry system and that the deep soil water resources are exhausted due to the large amount of transpiration consumption by the coexisting plants therefore agroforestry systems in semi arid and arid regions should be established with rational species selection and plant density to maintain the sustainability of agroforestry systems and avoid the overuse of limited water resources 5 conclusions in this study based on the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope technique and the mixsiar model we studied the seasonal characteristics of plant water uptake in an agroforestry system consisting of p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa in the semi arid region of the loess plateau our results indicated that the soil water content and stable isotope values of the soil water showed larger variation in the shallow layer 0 80 cm than in the deep layer 80 300 cm in june surface soil water 0 20 cm was the main water source for both p davidiana and p orientalis contribution rate 64 1 while in other months soil water was absorbed evenly from each layer in june july and september the main water sources of m sativa were surface middle 20 80 cm and surface soil water with the contribution rates of 40 3 45 6 and 37 1 respectively in contrast the main soil water layers absorbed by m sativa were shallower than those absorbed by p orientalis and p davidiana all three plants had flexible water use patterns that is they absorbed water from different soil layers in different seasons it is worth noting that the three coexisting plants had strong water competition ps ranged from 0 69 to 0 97 due to similar water sources and the water competition between p orientalis and p davidiana was stronger than that between them and m sativa this study elucidated the water use relationships among coexisting plants in an agroforestry system and inferred from the perspective of plant water use and soil water resources that the unsustainability of this agroforestry ecosystem under future extreme climate conditions future studies should combine high frequency isotope data with the monitoring of plant sap flow data to more accurately elucidate the dynamic process

9063,agroforestry has been widely used for the ecological restoration construction of semi arid regions of the chinese loess plateau investigating plant water sources is crucial for understanding the key ecohydrological processes of plant root water uptake and the water relations between coexisting plants clarifying the plant water use strategies can help to assess the sustainability of the vegetation restoration in agroforestry systems and provide references for the vegetation management thus we investigated the water use characteristics of plants in an agroforestry system consisting of platycladus orientalis prunus davidiana and medicago sativa the δd and δ18o of plant stem water and soil water in the 0 300 cm layer were measured the mixsiar model and proportional similarity ps were used to quantify the proportion of soil water absorbed by the plants in each layer and the hydrological niche overlap of plants the results showed that the combined effects of rainfall recharge and evapotranspiration et loss resulted in a decrease in soil water content swc for the agroforestry system with increasing soil depth and the swc of the deep layer 80 300 cm had minor variability 6 1 7 1 throughout the study period during the study period due to the deep soil desiccation p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa mainly utilized water from shallow 0 80 cm soil layers with a contribution rate of 65 4 8 3 64 9 7 7 and 73 0 0 2 respectively the three coexisting plants relied on the unstable shallow soil water recharged by rainfall while the water use proportion of the deep soil layer was consistently low this implies that the three plants were less resistant to drought stress thus posing a threat to the stability and sustainability of the agroforestry system moreover even in july and september with the high swc in agroforestry the partitioning of soil water among the three coexisting plants did not increase with increased et loss the three coexisting plants showed strong competition for soil water use as indicated by the high values 0 69 0 97 of ps overall the hydrological niche overlap of the coexisting plants in the agroforestry system resulted in low ecosystem

arid loess plateau data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction agroforestry is one of the most important vegetation restoration measures in the grain for green vegetation restoration project implemented on the loess plateau of china since 1999 jia et al 2015 fu et al 2016 gao et al 2018a 2018b agroforestry has ecological social and economic benefits by protecting the environment ensuring food security and increasing income via climate change mitigation peng et al 2009 meyer et al 2015 kamau et al 2017 muchane et al 2020 raihan et al 2021 however the agroforestry system can significantly affect the original hydrologic cycles and ecological processes muñoz villers et al 2020 importantly the water relationship between species in agroforestry systems significantly affects ecosystem stability yang et al 2021a therefore it is of great significance to study the water sources of coexisting plants in agroforestry systems agroforestry is often based on the theory of niche complementarity whereby coexisting species have complementary water use strategies and thus avoid excessive competition loreau et al 2001 fernández et al 2007 the use of different water sources by different plants is of great importance to the coexistence of plant species wu et al 2016 brinkmann et al 2019 yang et al 2011 reported that there was complementarity of the water niche among coexisting species of shrubs and grasses in semi arid ecosystems similarly shrubs and trees have been found to absorb deep soil water while herbaceous species use shallow soil water as their main water source ludwig et al 2004 darrouzet nardi et al 2006 wu et al 2014 however some studies have found that coexisting plants in agroforestry systems compete for water resources ling et al 2017 cardinael et al 2020 for example yang et al 2021b found that the decrease in alfalfa yields in a silvopastoral system was caused by competition between poplar trees and alfalfa for resources such as water water availability and competition for limited water resources among coexisting plants will greatly affect the stability and sustainability of plant communities therefore there is an urgent need to explore the water use patterns of different plants in agroforestry systems in order to provide references for vegetation management the traditional method of determining plant water use is to measure the root distribution of plants or the vertical distribution of soil water van kanten et al 2005 bello et al 2019 however the spatial distribution of roots does not always reflect the absorption of water resources by plants in the soil profile lehmann 2003 measurements of soil water are limited by the inability to determine which plant or plants among all coexisting plants are responsible for the loss of water padovan et al 2015 stable isotope δ18o and δd technology provides an effective method for determining the water use pattern of plants which can overcome the abovementioned limitations zhang et al 2019 previous studies have shown that seasonal variations in the isotopic characteristics of precipitation lead to different natural compositions of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in different water sources dai et al 2020 in addition except for a few plants isotopic fractionation did not occur in the process of water absorption by plant roots dawson and ehleringer 1991 thus the isotopic composition of plant xylem water represents a mixture of different water sources consequently the proportion of each water source absorbed by plants can be calculated using some mixing models phillips and gregg 2003 evaristo et al 2017 this technology has been widely used to study water competition or complementarity among species in agroforestry systems for example liu et al 2020a showed that compound planting leads to water competition between apple trees and corn but improves their water use efficiency in the loess hilly region of china using the stable isotope technology wu et al 2017 found that rubber trees and tea trees have complementary water use patterns during the dry season in tropical southwestern china the groundwater in the loess plateau is too deep for plants to use and soil water is the most important water source for plants in the region yang et al 2014 wei et al 2019 moreover due to the large consumption of soil water resources by introduced vegetation jia et al 2017 water availability affects the sustainability of vegetation on the semiarid loess plateau yu et al 2020 2021b as climatic warming and drying progress on the loess plateau piao et al 2010 the shortage of water resources will seriously affect the stability of the agroforestry system in the region however to date few studies have used hydrogen and oxygen isotope techniques to elucidate the water use patterns of coexisting plants in agroforestry systems on the chinese loess plateau and quantify the water relationships among them in order to preserve the limited water resources and improve the ecological environment plants such as platycladus orientalis prunus davidiana and medicago sativa were introduced in the loess plateau under the government s promotion wei et al 2019 they formed an arbor shrub herbage community consisting of p orientalis p davidiana m sativa which was widely adopted by local farmers in afforestation cai et al 2008 recent studies have mainly focused on the effects of climatic factors on the arbor shrub herbage community dymond and johnson 2002 the influence of the arbor shrub herbage community on the formation of dried soil layers wang et al 2008 and soil erosion processes feng et al 2018 in monocultures p orientalis depended on surface soil water deng et al 2021 while m sativa mainly used deep soil water in the dry season and absorbed surface soil water in the rainy season zhu et al 2016 the water use pattern of p davidiana has not been reported however the seasonal plant water uptake and the interspecific water use relationships in arbor shrub herbage ecosystems are still unclear this information is crucial for revealing the stability maintenance mechanism and the sustainability of vegetation in agroforestry systems from the perspective of water use thus we used stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope technology to examine the patterns of water uptake by three species in an agroforestry system and quantify the water relationships among them the objectives of this study were to a investigate the seasonal variation in water use patterns of p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa in an agroforestry system and b explore whether there exists water competition occurred among the three coexisting plants during the study period to predict the sustainability of this ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site was located in the longtan catchment of dingxi city 35 43 35 46 n 104 27 104 31 e on the western loess plateau gansu province china fig 1 the

precipitation is 385 3 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 7 2 c zhang et al 2020a the soil types in the study area are mainly loess soil and the thickness of the soil layer varies from 40 m to 60 m yang et al 2014 the dominant plant species include the native grass species stipa bungeana trin leymus secalinus georgi tzvel heteropappus altaicus willd novopokr and crops such as potatoes solanum tuberosum soybeans vigna angularis and maize zea mays to alleviate soil and water loess and protect the environment a large number of introduced plants such as alfalfa medicago sativa l

carr have been planted in this catchment yang et al 2014 wei et al 2019 therefore the types of vegetation cover in the catchment include agroforestry land woodland shrubland native grassland and farmland tang et al 2016 yu et al 2019 the study was conducted in an agroforestry system containing the evergreen coniferous tree platycladus orientalis the deciduous shrub prunus davidiana and the fodder crop medicago sativa platycladus orientalis p davidiana and m sativa are widely used in the revegetation practices of the grain for green project on the loess plateau zhang and chen 2007 yuan et al 2016 cui et al 2017 bai et al 2020 a p orientalis p davidiana m sativa agroforestry system was established in 2002 on northeast aspect arable croplands with a slope of 28 the system was composed of p orientalis and p davidiana 1 2 ratio of the two plant species in the row and m sativa between the rows tree rows were spaced 400 cm apart with 200 cm between the trees in the same row fig 1c the heights and crown diameters of p orientalis and p davidiana are shown in table 1 the total area of the research site is approximately 150 ha farmers typically mow m sativa once at the end of july and no irrigation or other management measures are practiced in the entire agroforestry system all meteorological variables in 2018 were automatically recorded by a standard weather station rr 9100 rainroot china near the study site the monthly average precipitation and air temperature of long term 1971 2015 were recorded by dingxi meteorological station 2 2 sample collection plant samples and soil samples of the three coexisting plants were collected simultaneously at the beginning dry season june 6 middle rainy season july 26 and september 17 and end dry season november 10 of the growing season m sativa was not sampled in november because it had wilted on each sampling date four replicated samples were sampled from the selected plants plant stem samples were obtained at 8 00 9 00 a m the stem samples of p orientalis and p davidiana were obtained by cutting suberized twigs approximately 5 cm in length and removing the outer epidermis and phloem tissue deng et al 2021 the stem samples of m sativa were obtained by cutting the stem at a height of 5 cm from the ground zhu et al 2016 and the sampling position was about 200 cm from the tree row i e the center of the m sativa row for soil sampling the central point between p orientalis and p davidiana and the adjacent m sativa base about 200 cm from the tree row were determined as sampling points simultaneously with the sampling of the plant stem a soil core with a depth of 300 cm was sampled using a hand auger with a diameter of 4 cm the soil cores were collected at 20 cm intervals within the 0 120 cm depth range and at 40 cm intervals within the 80 300 cm depth range all plant stem samples and soil samples were immediately placed in parafilm wrapped screw top glass vials and subsequently stored in a freezer 20 c moreover one part of the soil samples was brought back to the laboratory to determine the gravimetric soil water content swc by the oven drying method rainwater samples were taken immediately after each precipitation event and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c groundwater was not sampled because the groundwater table 40 m at the study site was far beyond the maximum rooting depth of plants chen et al 2021 2 3 analysis of hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition water in soil and plant stem was extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2000 los gatos research mountain view usa and the extracted water samples were placed in glass vials sealed with paraﬁlm and stored at 4 c the δd and δ18o of the extracted soil water and rainwater were measured using a liquid water isotope analyser picarro l2130i usa with analytical accuracies of 0 1 and 0 025 for δd and δ18o respectively the δd and δ18o of stem water were determined by isotopic ratio infrared spectrometry dlt 100 lgr usa with analytical accuracies of 0 3 and 0 1 for δd and δ18o respectively the stable isotopic composition can be expressed as 1 δd or δ 18 o r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the d h and 18o 16o molar ratios of the samples and the standard water standard mean ocean water smow respectively 2 4 measurement of soil moisture a time domain reflectometry tdr moisture measurement system trime imko micromodultechnik germany was used for soil moisture measurement one tdr tube was installed at 30 cm from the stems of p orientalis and p davidiana respectively in addition one tdr tube was installed at the center of the adjacent m sativa sample plot soil moisture in the 0 180 cm depth layer was measured at the beginning of each month from april to december during the period june 2018 and december 2020 three replicates were conducted for this measurement and the temporal evolution of soil moisture is shown in fig s1 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 determination and quantification of water sources based on the distributions of the isotope values and swc the entire soil profile 0 300 cm was divided into three potential water sources surface 0 20 cm middle 20 80 cm and deep 80 300 cm soil water mixsiar version 3 1 12 a bayesian mixing model was adopted to estimate the relative proportional contributions of the different water sources further details about the criteria used to categorise the soil depths can be found in a previous study chen et al 2021 first the raw δd and δ18o values of stem water were used as the mixture data input to the mixsiar model second the means and corresponding standard deviations of the δd and δ18o values of the soil water were used as the source data input to the mixsiar model third the discrimination data were set to 0 for both δd and δ18o last the run length of the markov chain monte carlo mcmc was set to long further information on mixsiar was described by zhou et al 2021 2 5 2 evaluation of water competition to assess the competition for soil water resources between any two of the three species we calculated the proportional similarity ps among the three species hoekstra et al 2014 ps is an indicator of niche overlap between species colwell and futuyma 1971 ps ranges from 0 to 1 the higher the ps value is the greater the overlap degree of the main water absorbing soil layers between the two species and the greater the competition for soil water resources 2 ps 1 0 5 i 1 n p 1 i p 2 i where p1i and p2i are the proportions of soil water absorbed by species 1 and 2 in the i layer of the three soil layers respectively 2 5 3 estimation of evapotranspiration soil water storage sws mm was calculated as follows 3 sws i 1 9 w i h i 10 100 where w is the soil water content and h cm is the soil layer depth the monthly evapotranspiration et of the three sample plots was estimated by calculating the water balance of the 0 180 cm soil layer allen et al 1998 2021b 4 et p e s cr p r where pe is the precipitation mm δs the change in sws mm in the 0 180 cm soil layer from the beginning to the end of the month and cr capillary rise mm was neglected because the groundwater table of the sample plots was greater than 40 m according to our 0 180 cm soil moisture data rainfall rarely infiltrated to a depth of 180 cm at our sample plots so p deep percolation mm at 180 cm depth was neglected r runoff mm was set at 0 because of the low slope of the sample plots 2 5 4 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to analyse swc differences in different months and soil layers and ps differences in different months and different species ordinary least squares regression was performed to evaluate the relationship between the δd and δ18o values in soil water and rainwater and the relationship between the proportion of root water uptake and swc all statistical analyses were performed using spss 26 0 spss inc chicago il usa the location graph was generated by arcgis 10 5 https

precipitation in 2018 amounted to 423 8 mm which was a wet year compared to the average precipitation in 1971 2015 385 3 mm fig 2 more than 78 0 of the precipitation in 2018 occurred between july and september which was higher than that in 1971 2015 54 0 in addition the highest monthly and daily precipitation were 152 6 mm and 68 2 mm respectively and both occurred in july the average air temperature in 2018 was 7 9 c which was higher than that in 1971 2015 7 2 c the monthly average temperature in march june 2018 showed a trend of being higher than that in the corresponding months in 1971 2015 in summary 2018 had showed a drier dry season and wetter wet season than 1971 2015 the swc varied with month and soil depth for p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa during the study period fig 3 the swc decreased with soil depth for both plots that is the swc showed a trend of being larger in the surface soil layer than in the middle and deep soil layers table 2 the swc for p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa showed strong monthly variation in the surface and middle soil layers while it fluctuated slightly in deep soil layer fig 3a b c fig 4 shows that the et of the three plants varied with the month in general et showed an increasing trend first and then decreased in all three years which has a similar trend with rainfall all the three plants had greater et in the rainy season july and september than in the dry season june and november in 2018 3 2 isotopic characteristics of rainwater soil water and stem water in all sampling months the isotopic composition of the soil water for different species showed a consistent pattern and varied with soil depth and month fig 5 the highest variation range of isotopes in soil water for p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa was observed in june 60 31 28 51 and 66 96 24 62 for hydrogen isotopes respectively 7 47 1 41 and 8 16 1 20 for oxygen isotopes respectively and the lowest was observed in july 60 80 44 56 and 71 53 46 36 for hydrogen isotopes respectively 8 25 5 94 and 9 11 5 81 for oxygen isotopes respectively in the surface soil layer the variation in isotopes for p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa was the largest while that of the deep soil layer was relatively stable there was no difference in soil water isotopes between p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa except in june the isotopes in stem water of the three species were all significantly higher in june than in other months except in september there were significant differences in stem water isotopes between m sativa and the other two species however stem water isotopes did not differ between p orientalis and p davidiana during the study period the ranges of δd and δ18o in precipitation were 70 28 to 6 73 and 10 76 2 08 respectively fig 6 the local meteoric water line lmwl was fitted based on the isotopic composition of precipitation similarly the soil water line swl was fitted based on the isotopic composition of soil water the slope and intercept of the two swls were smaller than those of the lmwl the two swls were both positioned on the lower right of the lmwl compared with p orientalis p davidiana the swl of m sativa had a higher slope the isotopic composition of stem water was distributed near the swl indicating that soil water was the main water source for these three plants 3 3 root water uptake and its relationship with swc the direct contrast approach revealed that layer of soil water mainly used by p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa in june was 0 20 cm fig 5a e i however when there were multiple isotope intersection points between the stem water vertical line and the soil water line this approach cannot determine the soil layer where the three plants absorb water in the other three months in addition this method cannot determine the specific proportions of water absorbed by plants from different soil layers the proportional contributions of soil water to plants in each soil profile layer calculated by the mixsiar model are shown in fig 7 the proportional contributions of soil water in each soil layer to the three plants varied with the month in june the primary water source of p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa was surface soil water and its contribution rate was 64 1 57 9 and 40 3 respectively in july the water absorbing soil layer of the three plants deepened and m sativa mainly used middle soil water while the highest proportional contributions of soil water to p orientalis and p davidiana came from the deep soil layer compared with that in july the mainly water absorbing soil layers of all the three plants shifted to the surface soil layer then p orientalis and p davidiana switched their water source to deep soil water in november and the contribution rates were 56 0 and 54 3 respectively fig 8 shows the relationship between the proportion of root water uptake of all soil layers at all sampling dates and the corresponding swc there was no significant relationship between the proportion of root water uptake and swc of p orientalis or p davidiana however there was a positive linear relationship between the proportion of root water uptake and swc of m sativa 3 4 water use relationships among coexisting plants the ps results showed that there were different degrees of competition among the three plants in different months fig 9 platycladus orientalis and p davidiana competed fiercely for soil water over the four studied months with the ps exceeding 0 86 the ps of p davidiana m sativa and p orientalis m sativa both increased with month and the lowest value was 0 69 4 discussion 4 1 variations in soil water content and isotopic composition of plant water use sources soil water content is affected by rainfall recharge and evapotranspiration loss hsieh et al 1998 during the dry season june and november due to scarce rainfall evapotranspiration resulted in significantly lower swc in june and november than in other months fig 3 in the rainy season july and september the replenishment by heavy rainfall effectively increased the swc of the shallow soil layer however even during the rainy season the swc of the deep layer does not change over time because it can hardly be effectively replenished these results indicated that soil desiccation occurred in deep soil layers in this agroforestry system and the deep soil water depletion caused by deep rooted plants could not be effectively restored in a short period of time wu et al 2021 wang et al 2011 the isotopic composition of precipitation is influenced by temperature precipitation amount and precipitation seasonality araguás araguás et al 1998 the slope 7 55 and intercept 9 17 of the lmwl were lower than those of the gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 indicating that precipitation had undergone weak evaporative enrichment fig 7 this result is consistent with the study of wang et al 2020 in the central region of the loess plateau the isotopic composition of soil water varied significantly with month and soil layer fig 5 revealing those factors such as precipitation infiltration and evaporation had a comprehensive impact on the isotopic fractionation of soil water brooks et al 2015 for p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa the slope and intercept of the swl were both significantly lower than those of the lmwl fig 6 which suggests that the soil water at both sites was affected by evaporation evaristo et al 2015 beyer et al 2018 in the dry season june the isotopic composition of the surface soil water at both sites was more positive than that of the deep soil water which was due to the dominant effect of evaporation on soil water isotopes these results are consistent with liu et al 2020b and wen et al 2010 who described that the effect of evaporation on the isotopic composition of soil water weakened as the soil layer deepened however in the rainy season july and september the isotopic composition of the surface and middle soil water showed clear negative changes which was attributed to the large amount of rainfall infiltration into these soil layers in november under the condition of weak soil evaporation caused by low temperature rainfall with negative isotopic values dominated the isotopic value of shallow soil water these results are consistent with the results of relevant studies that is after rainfall events the mixing of infiltration water and original soil water makes the isotopic values of new soil water strongly influenced by the isotopic values of rainfall gazis and feng 2004 interestingly we found significant depletion of soil water isotopes in the 240 300 cm layer e g m sativa in september suggesting that this may be the result of rainfall infiltration in the form of preferred flow notably in june and july the soil water isotope values in the deep soil layer of p orientalis p davidiana were significantly higher than those of m sativa fig 5 the possible reason is that rainfall infiltration under the different plants was totally different pan et al 2020 also found that variations in soil water isotopes were caused by different artificial sand fixation vegetation due to different influences on rainfall infiltration in the tengger desert 4 2 seasonal variation in plant water use patterns the three coexisting plants all had flexible water use patterns that is they switched their main water sources from different soil water layers in different seasons fig 7 the ability to adjust water use strategies according to environmental conditions is critical to plant survival in arid and semi arid ecosystems wu et al 2016 grossiord et al 2017 the water use patterns of these three coexisting plants are closely related to et and swc to be exact to water requirement and swc the et of all three plants was lower in june than in july and september fig 4 and the swc of the surface layer in june was significantly higher than that of the other soil layers fig 3 under the condition of low water content deeper soil layers are disconnected from the evaporation fluxes and et only occurs in the shallow layer resulting in a larger contribution ratio of the surface soil water to the water use by p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa fig 7 this is similar to the results of huo et al 2020 who found that jujube trees in intercropping systems absorbed a higher proportion of water from layers with higher water content in july and september the swc in the shallow layers was significantly higher than that in the deep layers due to rainfall supply however the water sources for all three plants gradually shifted from the surface layers to the deeper layers fig 7 this is related to the high et in july and september in july and september the water requirement of the three plants was high and the soil water in the shallow and middle layers was insufficient to sustain the high transpiration demand resulting in an increased proportion of water uptake from the deep soil layers this switch in plant water sources may also be due to changes in root distribution that is infiltrated rainfall promotes the growth of new roots in the soil profile which in turn improves the use of middle soil water by plants sun et al 2011 in addition plant water competition leads to the greater dependence of p orientalis and p davidiana on deeper soil water yang et al 2020 had found a similar phenomenon in agroforestry systems where water competition between rubber trees and intercrops have led to a greater reliance of rubber trees on deep soil water in september we found that the soil layer with the maximum water absorption ratio of the three plants moved up and the soil layer with the maximum water absorption ratio of m sativa was still higher than that of p orientalis and p davidiana the most likely reason is the combination of the recharge of 0 80 cm soil water by rainfall in september and m sativa was more sensitive to soil water changes than p orientalis and p davidiana figs 3 and 8 et was lower in november than in july fig 4 but p orientalis and p davidiana still absorbed a larger proportion of water from the deep soil layer in november which could be attributed to the low swc caused by the long drought in this month figs 2 and 3 similarly song et al 2022 found that plants increased their uptake of deep soil water after drought 4 3 interspecific water use relationships and implications for vegetation management during the study period p orientalis and p davidiana mainly absorbed shallow and deep soil water while m sativa mainly absorbed surface and middle soil water in june the ps between m sativa and the other two coexisting plants was not high less than 0 70 fig 9 these results indicate that the soil water resources used by these three plants were complementary during the early growing season this may be due to the low water requirement of the three plants during the early growing season fig 4 in semi arid regions the availability of water is a major limiting factor for plant growth yang et al 2012 jia et al 2013 and the clear hydrological niche segregation of these three plant species in agroforestry systems is a positive indication of their adaptation to arid environments zhang et al 2020b this complementary water use relationship apparently contributes to the survival of coexisting plants however in most of the growing period the water resources used by the three plants especially those used by p orientalis and p davidiana almost coincided and the ps was always high not less than 0 80 fig 9 which indicated that the water competition among them was fierce however it is worth noting that the degree of water competition between m sativa and the other two plants was lower than that between p orientalis and p davidiana we also found that in the studied ecosystem the swc of deep soil layers was always lower than 7 1 and remained unchanged among the month figs 3 and s1 indicating that even in wet years fig 2 the effective replenishment of soil water by rainfall rarely exceeded 80 cm in addition the groundwater level in the loess plateau is too deep to recharge the deep soil water therefore the deep soil water of the agroforestry ecosystem is severely depleted and will become difficult to recover due to the intensified plant consumption under the future drier and warmer climate regime of the loess plateau huang et al 2017 and the shortage of soil water resources may become more serious these results demonstrate the existence of water competition among arbor shrub and herbage in a semi arid agroforestry system and that the deep soil water resources are exhausted due to the large amount of transpiration consumption by the coexisting plants therefore agroforestry systems in semi arid and arid regions should be established with rational species selection and plant density to maintain the sustainability of agroforestry systems and avoid the overuse of limited water resources 5 conclusions in this study based on the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope technique and the mixsiar model we studied the seasonal characteristics of plant water uptake in an agroforestry system consisting of p orientalis p davidiana and m sativa in the semi arid region of the loess plateau our results indicated that the soil water content and stable isotope values of the soil water showed larger variation in the shallow layer 0 80 cm than in the deep layer 80 300 cm in june surface soil water 0 20 cm was the main water source for both p davidiana and p orientalis contribution rate 64 1 while in other months soil water was absorbed evenly from each layer in june july and september the main water sources of m sativa were surface middle 20 80 cm and surface soil water with the contribution rates of 40 3 45 6 and 37 1 respectively in contrast the main soil water layers absorbed by m sativa were shallower than those absorbed by p orientalis and p davidiana all three plants had flexible water use patterns that is they absorbed water from different soil layers in different seasons it is worth noting that the three coexisting plants had strong water competition ps ranged from 0 69 to 0 97 due to similar water sources and the water competition between p orientalis and p davidiana was stronger than that between them and m sativa this study elucidated the water use relationships among coexisting plants in an agroforestry system and inferred from the perspective of plant water use and soil water resources that the unsustainability of this agroforestry ecosystem under future extreme climate conditions future studies should combine high frequency isotope data with the monitoring of plant sap flow data to more accurately elucidate the dynamic process

to maintain the sustainable development of the agricultural ecosystem in order to explore the effects of alfalfa and two locally adapted forage legumes i e bush clover and milk vetch on subsequent crop yield and soil water restoration after long term legume pasture plantation a manipulative experiment was conducted in a rainfed agricultural area on the loess plateau the objectives of this study were to determine 1 the characteristics of soil water at 0 500 cm and 2 the performances of the crop yield and wue after these three long term leguminous pastures were converted into cropland we hypothesized 1 the soil water would be restored in shallow soil but not in deep soil due to low precipitation and high evapotranspiration coupled without groundwater recharge after long term alfalfa pasture was converted into cropland 2 crop yield and wue would be increased due to fertilizer effect of long term legume forage plantation but their increase would be lower in alfalfa crop rotation system compared to the two local forage legumes crop rotation systems due to soil water deficit induced by long term alfalfa plantation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the changwu agroecological experiment station on the loess plateau 35 12 n 107 40 e 1220 m above sea level from 2013 to 2014 the area has a subhumid climate characterized by a mean annual precipitation of 579 mm 1979 2003 with rainfall concentrated from july to september the mean annual temperature is 9 1 oc precipitation and temperature data were recorded at the changwu meteorological station 20 m from the experiment site the groundwater table is 50 80 m below the soil surface making it unavailable for plant growth the soils were classified as loess series the texture in the top 5 m soil layer is a uniform silty clay loam haplic greyxems fao unesco 1988 with a mean sand silt and clay content of 3 5 65 6 and 30 9 respectively the mean soil bulk density in the upper 2 m soil layer is 1 3 g cm 3 the soil organic carbon total nitrogen and available phosphorus concentrations in the top soil 0 3 m soil depth were 15 5 g kg 1 1 06 g kg 1 and 6 91 mg kg 1 respectively in 2004 before sowing the legumes table 1 more details about the study site can be found in guan et al 2016 2 2 experimental design this pasture crop rotation experiment was conducted with a completely randomized design with four treatments i e 1 fallow italian ryegrass winter wheat rotation system fallow 2 bush clover italian ryegrass winter wheat rotation system bc 3 milk vetch italian ryegrass winter wheat rotation system mv and 4 alfalfa italian ryegrass winter wheat rotation system l before conducting crop rotation legumes were grown for 9 years in early may 2004 a field was divided into twelve experiment plots each 4 m by 3 m with a space of 0 5 m the twelve plots were randomly allocated to one of three forage legume species viz milk vetch astragalus adsurgens pall alfalfa medicago sativa l and bush clover lespedeza davurica s and unplanted control each treatment contained three replicates each legume species was seeded with an evenly spaced monoculture at a density of 25 plants m 2 no irrigation and fertilization were applied and three cuts were made in the growing period every year from 2004 to 2012 then this field was plowed in march 2013 italian ryegrass was sown in drill with 22 kg hm 2 in march 2013 and winter wheat was sown in drill with 200 kg hm 2 in october 2013 no fertilizer was applied during italian ryegrass growth period but manure and n 100 kg hm 2 and p 21 83 kg hm 2 fertilizers were applied in early october 2013 in the winter wheat phase 2 3 measurement protocols 2 3 1 aboveground biomass and yields of ryegrass and wheat italian ryegrass and winter wheat were harvest in early july 2013 and early july 2014 respectively the yield of italian ryegrass was determined from a 1 1 m2 area in the center of the plots at the flowering stage all winter wheat was harvested at maturity firstly counting the total number of spikes in all two rows of wheat to calculate the spike number per unit area then 20 wheat plants were randomly selected the stalks and ears were cut and oven dried to constant to measure stem weight and spike head weight the grains per spike were counted the 1000 grain weight of the remaining wheat samples was measured by random sampling after threshing the aboveground biomass per unit area was calculated with total stem and spike head weight per spike multiplying the spike number per unit area the harvest index hi was calculated as hi yield biomass 2 3 2 soil water content soil moisture was measured with a 20 cm increment to a depth of 5 m in the center of each plot by the neutron scattering technique cnc503 cpn international inc concord ca usa at sowing and harvest in march and october 2013 and july 2014 the neutron moisture meter was calibrated using soil water content determined gravimetrically in a wet and dry profile at the experimental site and read after 64 s 2 3 3 water use and water use efficiency accumulated evapotranspiration et was calculated as et mm p i c r d δ s where p is the precipitation mm during one cultivar growth period i is the irrigation mm c is upward flux into root zone mm r is surface runoff mm d is the downward drainage out of the root zone mm and δs is the change of total soil water between harvest and plowed time in the soil profile mm runoff never happened because the experiment field was flat due to the deep groundwater table c was assumed to be negligible during the experimental period no heavy rain or waterlogging events happened thus deep drainage was assumed to be negligible and no irrigation was conducted at the experimental field therefore et can be translated to et p δ s finally water use efficiency wue for cultivar yield was calculated as wue g hm 2 mm 1 yield et 2 3 4 soil water restoration index a previous study in a farmland following alfalfa growth reported that the maximum depth of soil water restoration was 3 m in the third year and 4 8 m in the twelfth years wang et al 2008 therefore the water content was measured at soil depth of 5 m in this study two soil water restoration indexes were used in our study in order to decrease the experimental error caused by the differences in soil water content between legume treatments and fallow in march 2013 the soil water relative restoration index was determined using the equation wr dw t dw f dw f 100 dw t 0 dw f 0 dw f 0 100 where wr is soil water restoration index dwt is the amount of soil water stored in the legume treatment mm and dwf is the amount of soil water stored in the control treatment mm in october 2013 or july 2014 dwt0 and dwf0 are the amount of soil water stored in the legume treatment and control treatment mm in march 2013 respectively the soil water absolute restoration index indicated the variety of soil moisture in each plot itself and is determined using the equation wa dw i dw 0 dw 0 100 where wa was soil water restoration index dwi is the amount of soil water storage in october 2013 and july 2014 and dw0 is the amount of soil water storage in march 2013 2 4 statistical analysis considering a completely randomized design with four treatments used in this study one way analysis of variance anova was adopted to examine the effects of legumes on the aboveground biomass and wue of italian ryegrass and winter wheat crop yield and harvest index of winter wheat and soil water storage and recovery at different soil profile multiple comparisons were conducted with least significant difference lsd at the 5 level of significance paired t test was used to determine the difference in soil water storage and recovery between different dates significant difference was at p 0 05arithmetic mean values are reported in tables and figures all statistical analyses were performed using spss 19 0 spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 subsequent cultivar yield and water use efficiency the yield and wue of italian ryegrass in the fallow treatment were not significantly different from that in legume treatments table 2 the harvest index of winter wheat also did not differ between fallow treatment and legume treatments the yield aboveground biomass and wue of winter wheat were significantly higher in legume treatments than in fallow treatment except aboveground biomass between alfalfa and fallow treatments in addition there were no significant differences among legume treatments in all these variables for both italian ryegrass and winter wheat 3 2 soil water storage and dynamics there were no significant differences in soil water in the upper 1 m of soil profile among the four treatments fig 1 the average soil water content in the 5 m soil profile was highest in fallow and lowest in alfalfa treatment fig 1 this difference in soil moisture content between alfalfa and fallow treatments diminished gradually with time and soil depth until becoming non significant in the upper 3 m soil fig 1 this was also the case between the other two legume treatments and fallow treatment a higher soil water storage was observed in the fallow treatment in april 2013 table 3 from april 2013 to july 2014 there were no significant differences for the total soil water storage in the upper 1 m among all treatments the total soil water storage was highest in fallow and lowest in alfalfa at a depth of 1 5 m the initial significant difference in the total soil water storage between alfalfa and other treatments that was observed in 0 5 m and 1 5 m soil depths became non significant by the end of the experiment table 3 3 3 soil water restoration degree and dynamics there were no significant differences in the average soil water recovery level among the three legume treatments in the upper 1 m soil depth table 4 the average soil water recovery level increased over time at the depths of 0 5 m and 1 5 m table 4 the average soil water recovery level was significantly lower in alfalfa than in the other two legume treatments and there was no significant difference between bush clover and milk vetch treatments table 4 the water absolute and relative recovery rates were significantly higher in alfalfa than in the other two legume treatments in the depth of 1 5 m however there was no significant difference between alfalfa and the other two legumes in the upper 1 m soil depth figs 2 and 3 4 discussion in the alfalfa crop rotation system soil water was restored regularly from up to down in the crop phase which is consistent with other study zhang et al 2020 long term cultivation with legume pasture could induce soil desiccation and consequently decrease grain yield harris 1995 wheat has a shallower root system and thus can consume less soil water than legume pasture therefore cultivation of wheat crop after long term legume pasture might recover soil desiccation wang et al 2012 wang et al 2008 reported that the soil water from four alfalfa crop rotation systems was restored to 92 3 of natural condition in a semi arid environment in our study the soil water was restored to 95 6 of natural condition on average after two years following 9 year cultivation of legume pasture this result indicates that the soil desiccation may be alleviated if the long term legume pasture system is converted into pasture crop system the fastest soil water restoration rate was observed after alfalfa pasture was converted in to cropland compared to fallow bc and mv treatments one possible explanation is that alfalfa pasture depleted more soil water in pasture phase which induced dryer soil profile contributing to water storage fig 1 second explanation is that alfalfa has a deeper root system and consequently deposited more roots in the deeper soil profile compared to bush clover and milk vetch which subsequently induced stronger capillary action smaller bulk density in cultivation phase zhang et al 2018 last explanation is that our previous study showed the highest deep soil organic carbon was observed in alfalfa treatment guan et al 2016 implying higher water holding capacity minasny and mcbratney 2017 wood et al 2016 therefore dryer soil stronger capillary action and higher water holding capacity jointly induced faster restoration of soil water in the cultivation phase under alfalfa treatment the soil water relative recovery is considered a reasonable water restoration indicator of dry soil wang et al 2008 when the equation developed by wang et al 2008 was applied to calculate the soil water relative recovery an inverse pattern was observed compared to the result in this study fig 2 and a a possible explanation is that the initial differences among treatments in the cultivation phase after long term legume pasture i e march 2013 could not be eliminated in the equation of wang et al 2008 on the contrary the relative recovery index used in our study could eliminate the initial differences among treatments in the cultivation phase therefore the relative recovery index could demonstrate the more realistic soil water restoration condition after long term legume pasture in our study aboveground biomass and wue in the italian ryegrass phase were not changed table 2 after long term legume pastures plantation as compared with fallow treatment which might be due to the balance between negative effect of lower soil water storage and a positive effect of stronger soil capillary action fig 1 zhang et al 2018 however aboveground biomass was enhanced by 54 40 and 24 and yield was increased by 64 49 and 36 under bush clover milk vetch and alfalfa treatments respectively compared to fallow in the winter wheat phase previous studies have also reported that the legume pasture introduction in a cropping sequence has long been perceived as an effective means of improving the yield of subsequent crops garcı a préchac et al 2004 pala et al 2007 wang et al 2008 jefferson et al 2013 franzluebbers et al 2014 water represents a primary limitation of crop growth in the rainfed area of loess plateau li et al 2013 in the winter wheat phase stronger soil capillary action could promote water absorption by the crop roots under legume treatments compared to fallow thus higher wues were observed under legume treatments inducing the increases of wheat aboveground biomass and yield these results indicated that the responses of aboveground in cultivation phase to long term legume pasture were delayed pala et al 2007 reported that differences in grain yield in the wheat phase were likely attributed to the enhanced soil n supply from legumes when there was no carryover effect in contrast there was carryover effect from legume pasture in term of aboveground variables e g yield and wue table 4 and no enhanced soil n supply in our study table a in addition there were no significant differences in aboveground traits among legume pasture treatments table 4 these results further indicate that the locally adapted forage legumes may be as productive as alfalfa as a source of fodder in the cultivation phase in a mixed cropping livestock system 5 conclusion with a field manipulative experiment this study investigated the soil water characteristic and wheat yield in a subsequent cultivation system succeeding three 9 year old leguminous pastures in a rainfed agricultural area the decreased soil water storage induced by the former legume pasture cultivations could be restored regularly from up to down in the cultivation phase in the pasture crop rotation system wheat grain yield increase was achieved after long term legume pasture plantation was converted into cropland these results suggested that legume

pasture was converted into cropland 2 crop yield and wue would be increased due to fertilizer effect of long term legume forage plantation but their increase would be lower in alfalfa crop rotation system compared to the two local forage legumes crop rotation systems due to soil water deficit induced by long term alfalfa plantation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the changwu agroecological experiment station on the loess plateau 35 12 n 107 40 e 1220 m above sea level from 2013 to 2014 the area has a subhumid climate characterized by a mean annual precipitation of 579 mm 1979 2003 with rainfall concentrated from july to september the mean annual temperature is 9 1 oc precipitation and temperature data were recorded at the changwu meteorological station 20 m from the experiment site the groundwater table is 50 80 m below the soil surface making it unavailable for plant growth the soils were classified as loess series the texture in the top 5 m soil layer is a uniform silty clay loam haplic greyxems fao unesco 1988 with a mean sand silt and clay content of 3 5 65 6 and 30 9 respectively the mean soil bulk density in the upper 2 m soil layer is 1 3 g cm 3 the soil organic carbon total nitrogen and available phosphorus concentrations in the top soil 0 3 m soil depth were 15 5 g kg 1 1 06 g kg 1 and 6 91 mg kg 1 respectively in 2004 before sowing the legumes table 1 more details about the study site can be found in guan et al 2016 2 2 experimental design this pasture crop rotation experiment was conducted with a completely randomized design with four treatments i e 1 fallow italian ryegrass winter wheat rotation system fallow 2 bush clover italian ryegrass winter wheat rotation system bc 3 milk vetch italian ryegrass winter wheat rotation system mv and 4 alfalfa italian ryegrass winter wheat rotation system l before conducting crop rotation legumes were grown for 9 years in early may 2004 a field was divided into twelve experiment plots each 4 m by 3 m with a space of 0 5 m the twelve plots were randomly allocated to one of three forage legume species viz milk vetch astragalus adsurgens pall alfalfa medicago sativa l and bush clover lespedeza davurica s and unplanted control each treatment contained three replicates each legume species was seeded with an evenly spaced monoculture at a density of 25 plants m 2 no irrigation and fertilization were applied and three cuts were made in the growing period every year from 2004 to 2012 then this field was plowed in march 2013 italian ryegrass was sown in drill with 22 kg hm 2 in march 2013 and winter wheat was sown in drill with 200 kg hm 2 in october 2013 no fertilizer was applied during italian ryegrass growth period but manure and n 100 kg hm 2 and p 21 83 kg hm 2 fertilizers were applied in early october 2013 in the winter wheat phase 2 3 measurement protocols 2 3 1 aboveground biomass and yields of ryegrass and wheat italian ryegrass and winter wheat were harvest in early july 2013 and early july 2014 respectively the yield of italian ryegrass was determined from a 1 1 m2 area in the center of the plots at the flowering stage all winter wheat was harvested at maturity firstly counting the total number of spikes in all two rows of wheat to calculate the spike number per unit area then 20 wheat plants were randomly selected the stalks and ears were cut and oven dried to constant to measure stem weight and spike head weight the grains per spike were counted the 1000 grain weight of the remaining wheat samples was measured by random sampling after threshing the aboveground biomass per unit area was calculated with total stem and spike head weight per spike multiplying the spike number per unit area the harvest index hi was calculated as hi yield biomass 2 3 2 soil water content soil moisture was measured with a 20 cm increment to a depth of 5 m in the center of each plot by the neutron scattering technique cnc503 cpn international inc concord ca usa at sowing and harvest in march and october 2013 and july 2014 the neutron moisture meter was calibrated using soil water content determined gravimetrically in a wet and dry profile at the experimental site and read after 64 s 2 3 3 water use and water use efficiency accumulated evapotranspiration et was calculated as et mm p i c r d δ s where p is the precipitation mm during one cultivar growth period i is the irrigation mm c is upward flux into root zone mm r is surface runoff mm d is the downward drainage out of the root zone mm and δs is the change of total soil water between harvest and plowed time in the soil profile mm runoff never happened because the experiment field was flat due to the deep groundwater table c was assumed to be negligible during the experimental period no heavy rain or waterlogging events happened thus deep drainage was assumed to be negligible and no irrigation was conducted at the experimental field therefore et can be translated to et p δ s finally water use efficiency wue for cultivar yield was calculated as wue g hm 2 mm 1 yield et 2 3 4 soil water restoration index a previous study in a farmland following alfalfa growth reported that the maximum depth of soil water restoration was 3 m in the third year and 4 8 m in the twelfth years wang et al 2008 therefore the water content was measured at soil depth of 5 m in this study two soil water restoration indexes were used in our study in order to decrease the experimental error caused by the differences in soil water content between legume treatments and fallow in march 2013 the soil water relative restoration index was determined using the equation wr dw t dw f dw f 100 dw t 0 dw f 0 dw f 0 100 where wr is soil water restoration index dwt is the amount of soil water stored in the legume treatment mm and dwf is the amount of soil water stored in the control treatment mm in october 2013 or july 2014 dwt0 and dwf0 are the amount of soil water stored in the legume treatment and control treatment mm in march 2013 respectively the soil water absolute restoration index indicated the variety of soil moisture in each plot itself and is determined using the equation wa dw i dw 0 dw 0 100 where wa was soil water restoration index dwi is the amount of soil water storage in october 2013 and july 2014 and dw0 is the amount of soil water storage in march 2013 2 4 statistical analysis considering a completely randomized design with four treatments used in this study one way analysis of variance anova was adopted to examine the effects of legumes on the aboveground biomass and wue of italian ryegrass and winter wheat crop yield and harvest index of winter wheat and soil water storage and recovery at different soil profile multiple comparisons were conducted with least significant difference lsd at the 5 level of significance paired t test was used to determine the difference in soil water storage and recovery between different dates significant difference was at p 0 05arithmetic mean values are reported in tables and figures all statistical analyses were performed using spss 19 0 spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 subsequent cultivar yield and water use efficiency the yield and wue of italian ryegrass in the fallow treatment were not significantly different from that in legume treatments table 2 the harvest index of winter wheat also did not differ between fallow treatment and legume treatments the yield aboveground biomass and wue of winter wheat were significantly higher in legume treatments than in fallow treatment except aboveground biomass between alfalfa and fallow treatments in addition there were no significant differences among legume treatments in all these variables for both italian ryegrass and winter wheat 3 2 soil water storage and dynamics there were no significant differences in soil water in the upper 1 m of soil profile among the four treatments fig 1 the average soil water content in the 5 m soil profile was highest in fallow and lowest in alfalfa treatment fig 1 this difference in soil moisture content between alfalfa and fallow treatments diminished gradually with time and soil depth until becoming non significant in the upper 3 m soil fig 1 this was also the case between the other two legume treatments and fallow treatment a higher soil water storage was observed in the fallow treatment in april 2013 table 3 from april 2013 to july 2014 there were no significant differences for the total soil water storage in the upper 1 m among all treatments the total soil water storage was highest in fallow and lowest in alfalfa at a depth of 1 5 m the initial significant difference in the total soil water storage between alfalfa and other treatments that was observed in 0 5 m and 1 5 m soil depths became non significant by the end of the experiment table 3 3 3 soil water restoration degree and dynamics there were no significant differences in the average soil water recovery level among the three legume treatments in the upper 1 m soil depth table 4 the average soil water recovery level increased over time at the depths of 0 5 m and 1 5 m table 4 the average soil water recovery level was significantly lower in alfalfa than in the other two legume treatments and there was no significant difference between bush clover and milk vetch treatments table 4 the water absolute and relative recovery rates were significantly higher in alfalfa than in the other two legume treatments in the depth of 1 5 m however there was no significant difference between alfalfa and the other two legumes in the upper 1 m soil depth figs 2 and 3 4 discussion in the alfalfa crop rotation system soil water was restored regularly from up to down in the crop phase which is consistent with other study zhang et al 2020 long term cultivation with legume pasture could induce soil desiccation and consequently decrease grain yield harris 1995 wheat has a shallower root system and thus can consume less soil water than legume pasture therefore cultivation of wheat crop after long term legume pasture might recover soil desiccation wang et al 2012 wang et al 2008 reported that the soil water from four alfalfa crop rotation systems was restored to 92 3 of natural condition in a semi arid environment in our study the soil water was restored to 95 6 of natural condition on average after two years following 9 year cultivation of legume pasture this result indicates that the soil desiccation may be alleviated if the long term legume pasture system is converted into pasture crop system the fastest soil water restoration rate was observed after alfalfa pasture was converted in to cropland compared to fallow bc and mv treatments one possible explanation is that alfalfa pasture depleted more soil water in pasture phase which induced dryer soil profile contributing to water storage fig 1 second explanation is that alfalfa has a deeper root system and consequently deposited more roots in the deeper soil profile compared to bush clover and milk vetch which subsequently induced stronger capillary action smaller bulk density in cultivation phase zhang et al 2018 last explanation is that our previous study showed the highest deep soil organic carbon was observed in alfalfa treatment guan et al 2016 implying higher water holding capacity minasny and mcbratney 2017 wood et al 2016 therefore dryer soil stronger capillary action and higher water holding capacity jointly induced faster restoration of soil water in the cultivation phase under alfalfa treatment the soil water relative recovery is considered a reasonable water restoration indicator of dry soil wang et al 2008 when the equation developed by wang et al 2008 was applied to calculate the soil water relative recovery an inverse pattern was observed compared to the result in this study fig 2 and a a possible explanation is that the initial differences among treatments in the cultivation phase after long term legume pasture i e march 2013 could not be eliminated in the equation of wang et al 2008 on the contrary the relative recovery index used in our study could eliminate the initial differences among treatments in the cultivation phase therefore the relative recovery index could demonstrate the more realistic soil water restoration condition after long term legume pasture in our study aboveground biomass and wue in the italian ryegrass phase were not changed table 2 after long term legume pastures plantation as compared with fallow treatment which might be due to the balance between negative effect of lower soil water storage and a positive effect of stronger soil capillary action fig 1 zhang et al 2018 however aboveground biomass was enhanced by 54 40 and 24 and yield was increased by 64 49 and 36 under bush clover milk vetch and alfalfa treatments respectively compared to fallow in the winter wheat phase previous studies have also reported that the legume pasture introduction in a cropping sequence has long been perceived as an effective means of improving the yield of subsequent crops garcı a préchac et al 2004 pala et al 2007 wang et al 2008 jefferson et al 2013 franzluebbers et al 2014 water represents a primary limitation of crop growth in the rainfed area of loess plateau li et al 2013 in the winter wheat phase stronger soil capillary action could promote water absorption by the crop roots under legume treatments compared to fallow thus higher wues were observed under legume treatments inducing the increases of wheat aboveground biomass and yield these results indicated that the responses of aboveground in cultivation phase to long term legume pasture were delayed pala et al 2007 reported that differences in grain yield in the wheat phase were likely attributed to the enhanced soil n supply from legumes when there was no carryover effect in contrast there was carryover effect from legume pasture in term of aboveground variables e g yield and wue table 4 and no enhanced soil n supply in our study table a in addition there were no significant differences in aboveground traits among legume pasture treatments table 4 these results further indicate that the locally adapted forage legumes may be as productive as alfalfa as a source of fodder in the cultivation phase in a mixed cropping livestock system 5 conclusion with a field manipulative experiment this study investigated the soil water characteristic and wheat yield in a subsequent cultivation system succeeding three 9 year old leguminous pastures in a rainfed agricultural area the decreased soil water storage induced by the former legume pasture cultivations could be restored regularly from up to down in the cultivation phase in the pasture crop rotation system wheat grain yield increase was achieved after long term legume pasture plantation was converted into cropland these results suggested that legume
