20955,as vital key parts of offshore floating structures mooring systems should be able to withstand harsh environmental conditions this study aims to assess the design loads of mooring lines subjected to random loads using various statistical models a benchmark of extreme values is established using the global maxima method and is based upon a weibull distribution model for the maxima of 150 3 h time series generated by a given design sea condition with different random seeds to reduce the computational cost a peak over threshold pot method is combined with an asymptotic approach different variations are investigated and a better choice for the number of individual top peaks from single time domain simulations is determined from a statistical error analysis the average conditional exceedance rate acer method and environmental contour ec approach are also applied and compared the effects of various load combinations are considered and a 3 d ec surface is established based on the nataf transformation model a simplified long term extreme response analysis is conducted by accounting for the pot based variabilities so as to provide a more reliable design load estimation numerical results are presented and discussed for the tension estimation of a semi submersible platform considering a long term coupled analysis keywords mooring system extreme response analysis ec approach long term response analysis acer approach 1 introduction floating structures such as semi submersible platforms and offshore wind turbines must operate under complex marine conditions for long service periods mooring systems play a key role in the station keeping of those floating structures thus it is important to evaluate extreme responses against the mooring strength and offset limit to ensure safety during operational and survival conditions cheng and kuang 2016 there are three common evaluation criteria for assessing a characteristic load effect for the design of a mooring system vázquez hernandez et al 2006 i an extreme response analysis under independently designed sea states associated with a given return period ii a chosen maximum extreme response from a series of dependent sea conditions along an environmental contour ec line with a given return period and iii a characteristic response calculation from a long term statistical analysis the extreme values of mooring line tensions are of great interest and can be obtained from short term time domain stochastic analyses whereas the application of various models will produce significant uncertainties and lead to different results the dynamic behaviour of a mooring system is non gaussian owing to the combination of waves and low frequencies in addition the nonlinear geometric and material properties have strong effects on the dynamic behaviour of the entire system the mooring line response analysis is significantly dependent on simulating the randomness of the environmental conditions all of these aspects produce challenging points for the prediction of characteristic extreme values of mooring systems karlsen and naess 2005 xu et al 2019a a widely used procedure for estimating extreme mooring line tension comprises specifying meteorological and metocean design conditions corresponding to a given return period and then assessing the time series response using asymptotic approaches it is common to neglect the correlations between environmental conditions which are typically a combination of the individual 100 yr return values of waves currents and wind this will lead to a more conservative design load than the true 100 yr load tromans and vanderschuren 1995 various parametric distribution functions have been adopted to simulate the extreme responses of marine structures based on following a certain extrapolation procedure from time domain simulations such as the gumbel distribution lognormal distribution generalised extreme value gev distribution and weibull distribution api 2005 ding et al 2013 ambühl et al 2014 dnvgl 2015 guo et al 2016 hsu et al 2017 cheng et al 2020 prevosto et al 2007 discussed various alternative methods for the statistical analysis of the extreme low frequency motions of moored floating bodies including rice s formula breitung s formula hagberg s approaches and asymptotic expansion in the process of exploring a short term extreme response distribution one important problem that cannot be ignored is the definition and selection of extreme points the maximum peak from each time response can be selected as the extreme value and several time domain simulations should be conducted to consider the randomness of environmental conditions using different seeds stanisic et al 2017 examined how the accuracy of predicting the design mooring load from a sample of response maxima improved as the number of simulations was progressively increased from 10 to 170 for a 100 yr extreme condition and 10000 yr survival condition it was concluded that 30 or 40 maxima could achieve an accurate prediction of the true design loads the global maximum approach is usually adopted as a benchmark for confirming the accuracy of other extrapolation models stanisic et al 2018 xu et al 2019b a coupled nonlinear dynamic analysis is computationally extensive thus the individual top peaks from a single time series are utilised and fitted to develop a short term extreme response dnvgl 2015 sagrilo et al 2011 proposed a straightforward approach to account for the statistical uncertainty associated with the simulation length and characterised a short term extreme response value based on a single time series stanisic et al 2018 concluded that the peaks between two mean up crossings defined as maximum loads would produce a more accurate and precise prediction of the extreme tension response than all local peaks or peaks with a time constraint the peak over threshold pot method is a common technique for selecting peaks with lower dependence for extreme value analyses however the definition of an appropriate threshold is a popular topic cheng and kuang 2016 conducted extreme response predictions for a deepwater mooring system using the weibull winterstein jensen and gumbel fitting methods the results indicated that considering 30 40 of the top peaks could lead to a more close fitting to the observed upper tailing segment for the weibull model and that at least ten 3 h simulations were needed for the gumbel model wang 2017 proposed an optimal threshold selection approach based on incorporating a declustering algorithm in the pot method and employed it for an extreme value prediction of the dynamic response of a spar type floating wind turbine xu et al 2019b estimated the short term extreme responses of a moored semi submersible platform using the pot method and the effects of the threshold ensemble size and simulation durations on the extreme values were discussed in addition to the above mentioned approaches the average conditional exceedance rate acer method has been proposed to account for the statistical dependence between peaks for extreme value estimations from sampled time series naess and gaidai 2009 naess et al 2010 chai et al 2018 sagrilo et al 2012 predicted the extreme values of floater system based upon a weibull distribution model for the peaks of the time series and the results showed that the weibull model is a particular case of the acer method in another study the stochastic dynamic responses and short term extreme tension responses of floating horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines were estimated based on extrapolation of a mean up crossing rate method cheng et al 2017 xu et al 2020 applied the acer method to estimate the extreme loads of a site specific semi submersible type wind turbine the acer method has shown good performance for nonstationary time series and can perform better than the pot and gumbel methods naess and gaidai 2009 to avoid numerous numerical simulations and complex long term response analyses ecs are commonly employed to identify extreme environmental conditions and predict extreme response and design loads for marine structures combining contours with structural response distributions is a popular way to estimate design responses velarde et al 2019 vanem 2017 performed a comparison study on the estimation of extreme structural responses from different ec methods velarde et al 2019 derived an extreme load distribution for an offshore wind turbine the variability in short term structural response was accounted for by inflating the ecs vanem et al 2020 compared different contour methods with response based methods for extreme ship response analysis and found that all approaches to contour estimation produce reasonable and comparable results zhao and dong 2020 presented an extension of the alternative ec approach based on inverse first order reliability theory in a 3 d model to account for short term extreme response uncertainties and employed a simplified discrete approach combined with monte carlo simulations to estimate long term extreme loads an all sea state approach could provide the exact levels for long term extreme response analyses but is computationally prohibitive some efficient techniques have been proposed and implemented for accurate long term extreme analyses of mooring lines in recent years grime and langley 2008 vázquez hernández et al 2011 agarwal and manuel 2009 provided a long term extreme load prediction for an offshore wind turbine response based on a combination of the inverse reliability method and pot method in which the response variability is approximately modelled from a statistical extrapolation procedure stanisic et al 2018 provided an appropriate expression for calculating the long term distribution of a mooring load in which the short term variability was described in terms of a gumbel distribution videiro et al 2019 conducted a long term analysis using a scatter diagram key region bounded by extreme ec lines to evaluate the extreme response s of steel risers leong et al 2020 applied a monte carlo simulation and classical control variates technique to perform integration over the long term variables of mooring lines gramstad et al 2020 presented a sequential sampling method using gaussian process regression for estimating a long term extreme structural response the short term variability was considered using a gaussian regression when estimating design loads for floating structures using simulation responses the simulation effort can undoubtedly become unmanageable if uncertainties in the extreme value prediction and efficiency issues in the statistical extrapolation models are not well addressed the aims of this study are threefold first the characteristic extreme tension responses following different extrapolation procedures including the pot and acer algorithms from time domain simulations are assessed using various extreme value models under designed environmental conditions a benchmark of extreme values is established using the global maximum method thus short term extreme variabilities with various models are evaluated and the definition of the threshold and distribution fitting are investigated and discussed second this study attempts to determine critical sea state and design loads based on a 3 d ec approach in which the nataf transformation model is employed to construct a 3 d ec surface third it demonstrates a simplified framework for the assessment of long term extreme tension considering short term distribution fitting uncertainties the proposed framework for evaluating and comparing the results from the characteristic responses of mooring systems is shown in fig 1 the conventional extreme value analysis methodology is summarised in section 2 and the global maxima method pot and acer methods are introduced the identification of critical environmental conditions and design loads is further discussed in section 3 based on ec approach the hindcasting time series of sea data and associated dependencies are considered using copula theory section 4 discusses a numerical simulation and describes the environmental conditions in the barents sea the floating system relevant results from extreme tension predictions including short term variabilities and long term design loads conclusions and recommendations are presented in section 5 this study addresses the characteristic extreme values of mooring systems as related to the specification of design conditions focusing particularly on the requirement for nominal loads in the load and resistance factor design procedure and on reliability based design for floating structures 2 short term response based method the design of a floating system generally requires an estimation of the load effects associated with design conditions occurring with a particular recurrence period the design sea states for various load types and combinations can be determined independently or by considering the likelihood of the simultaneity of metocean conditions in a short term response based method the characteristic design loads of the time series t e t generally correspond to a q percentile of the largest tension distribution f t n x for floating structures a 3 h dynamic response simulation is usually performed to ensure the stability of the statistical characteristics t e t denotes the extreme peaks of the random process t e t associated with the period t s 3 h and its distribution can be defined as follows 1 f t e x p t e t x where p represents the probability of extreme tension then the cumulative distribution function cdf for the extreme tension can be determined as follows 2 f t n x f t e x v e t s t where v e n e t s is the average rate of peaks and n e is the number of sample peaks in the time domain simulations the estimation of short term extreme responses may cause prediction results with significant differences depending on the selection of thresholds distribution fitting models and model parameter estimation methods 2 1 global maxima method the straightforward way to estimate short term extreme values is to employ an extreme distribution function to fit a set of data with n extreme values defined as the maxima of n independent time simulations to account for the randomness of the sea state identical environmental variables with various seeds are simulated and the different seeds produce different response time histories fig 2 illustrates the most loaded line tension time histories generated using the same wave parameters but different seeds the maxima data is determined from the tension time histories based on a coupled nonlinear time domain analysis the weibull distribution is commonly adopted to fit the sample maxima of several time series of responses the cdf of the weibull distribution can be expressed as follows 3 f t e x 1 exp x α w γ w λ w where α w γ w and λ w are the location scale and shape parameters of the distribution respectively the characteristic short term design loads associated with a given q percentile can be estimated as follows 4 x d α w γ w ln 1 q 1 v e t s t 1 λ w for the most probable maximum extreme value q is adopted as 0 368 and as 0 8 for an extreme level which has a 20 exceedance probability 2 2 peak over threshold pot method the selection of maxima from n independent time simulations is time consuming owing to the coupled nonlinear numerical simulations peaks can be defined from a single time series utilising the pot method in which only the individual top peaks above a given threshold are selected and fitted several algorithms have been proposed for the optimal threshold selection such as the mean residual life plot and root square error methods ragan and manuel 2008 dimitrov 2016 xu et al 2019b a general threshold at the mean plus 1 4 standard deviation level or at the 50 95 percentile of the total top peaks is also commonly adopted agarwal and manuel 2009 cheng and kuang 2016 liu et al 2019 the individual peak response of a single time series is depicted in fig 3 various extreme distribution models can be employed to fit the top peaks 2 2 1 gumbel model the three parameter weibull distribution the cdf of which is described by eq 5 is extensively used to predict the extreme values of oceanic variables and extreme response of marine structures 5 f t e x exp exp x α g γ g where α g and γ g are the location and scale parameters of the distribution respectively and can be estimated by using the moment method or least squares method with the sample data for the gumbel model the estimation of the characteristic design loads is as follows 6 x d α g γ g ln ln q 1 v e t s 2 2 2 generalised pareto model the cdf of the generalised pareto distribution gpd can be expressed as follows 7 f t e x 1 1 λ p x α p γ p 1 λ p λ p 0 1 exp x α p γ p λ p 0 where α p γ p and λ p are the location scale and shape parameters of the gpd model respectively the design loads can be written as follows 8 x d α p γ p 1 q 1 v e t s t λ p 1 λ p λ p 0 α p γ p ln 1 q 1 v e t s t λ p 0 2 2 3 generalised extreme value gev model the cdf of the gev distribution is defined as follows 9 f t e x exp 1 λ e x α e γ e 1 λ e where α e γ e and λ e are the location scale and shape parameters of the gev model respectively the gumbel distribution is a particular case of the gev model for λ e 0 a close relationship exists between the gpd and gev models for the gev model the extreme level is given as follows 10 x d α e γ e ln q 1 v e t s t λ e 1 λ e 2 3 average conditional exceedance rate acer method the acer method considers the dependence of peaks and can be adopted to determine the extreme value distribution of tension response peaks the tension time series is regarded as a stochastic process z t and the time interval of the sequence is δ t thus there is a total of n observed tension response peaks z 1 z 2 z n over the simulated period 0 t the extreme value of the sampled peaks is defined as z max max z j j 1 2 n and the cumulative distribution of the extreme value can be expressed as follows 11 f z prob z max z prob z 1 z z n z j 2 n prob z j z z j 1 z z 1 z prob z 1 z by assuming that tension peaks and conditional exceedance events are independent and follow a poisson process the basic extreme value distribution derived from the acer method can be approximated as follows 12 f z exp n k 1 ε ˆ k z where ε ˆ k z represents the empirical acer function of the kth order and k denotes the immediately preceding non exceedances the gumbel distribution model is commonly adopted to predict extreme responses for marine structures using asymptotic approaches the acer function employs a similar expression to fit the tail region based on a logarithmic form of the gumbel distribution function the empirical acer function of the extreme level z is assumed to follow a form as follows 13 ε ˆ k q k exp a k z b k c k z z 0 where q k a k b k and c k are suitable constants depending on the order k and can be estimated using extrapolation by minimising the mean square error function as follows 14 f q k a k b k c k j 1 s ξ j log ε ˆ k z j log q a z j b c 2 where z 1 z 2 z s represents the response levels estimated using acer function ξ j is a weight factor the levenberg marquardt method is commonly adopted to solve eq 14 the 95 confidence interval of the acer function can be expressed as follows 15 c i z ε ˆ k z 1 1 96 n k 1 ε ˆ k z detailed descriptions of acer function derivation can be found in naess and gaidai 2009 and chai et al 2018 3 environmental contour ec approach the ec approach decouples the structural response and environmental variables based on the inverse first order reliability method iform winterstein et al 1993 thus it is regarded as an ideal alternative to solve for full long term design loads while avoiding expensive numerical simulations haver and winterstein 2009 the general procedure for developing ecs comprises constructing a joint probability for environmental variables based on a conditional joint distribution model copula theory or monte carlo simulation and transforming the independent standard normal variables into original environmental parameters in the physical space using a rosenblatt transformation haver and winterstein 2009 huseby et al 2013 montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 velarde et al 2019 vanem et al 2020 2d ecs for bivariate metocean variables h s t p and corresponding extreme structural response analyses are common and mature in current studies however to the author s best knowledge there are few research studies on deriving extreme levels of tensions from 3d ec approaches deriving an environmental contour from a metocean data generally involves two steps estimating the joint distribution of the environmental variables and constructing the environmental contour based on that distribution the nataf transformation gaussian copula and iform are adopted to construct environmental contour in this study the ec approach can consider multivariate environmental variables using copulas or conditional joint distributions and iform as described in silva gonzález et al 2011 and montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 actually there are variabilities and uncertainties on the estimation of extreme structural response from different environmental contour methods vanem 2017 the purpose of this study is to estimate the characteristic extreme response for mooring system in a complex ocean environment ec approach is an alternative to be adopted to reduce the variabilities there are more variabilities for constructing multivariate joint distribution of environmental variables using various joint models just 2 d and 3 d ecs considering wind wave and current parameters are constructed in this study the global maxima method pot method and acer method are also adopted and compared the 3d contours for multivariate environmental variables proposed by silva gonzález et al 2011 using the nataf distribution model are employed for the characteristic design tension analysis various environmental parameters may describe the loading acting on marine structures at a specific location such as the wind speed wave height wave period and current speed in addition to the directions of those variables a vector with three random environmental variables x x 1 x 2 x 3 can be considered corresponding to an exceeding probability p f associated with a reliability index β 16 p f t s 365 24 t r 17 p f φ β β φ 1 p f where t s is the sea state duration usually sampled at 3 h intervals t r is the target return period in years the reliability index β in the iform denotes a constant radius in a standard normal space the environmental sphere in a standard normal space u with a radius β can be determined and the independent random variables which vary with angles θ and ϕ can be given as follows 18 u 1 2 u 2 2 u 3 2 β 2 u 1 β sin ϕ sin θ u 2 β sin ϕ cos θ u 3 β cos ϕ 0 θ 2 π 0 ϕ π the nataf transformation of the random vector x x 1 x 2 x 3 can be given as follows 19 φ y i f x i x i y i φ 1 f x i x i i 1 2 3 where φ and φ 1 are the cdf and inverse cdf of the standard normal variables respectively the joint distribution of the original environmental variables can be expressed by a trivariate normal distribution of y as follows 20 f x x 1 x 2 x 3 φ φ 1 f x 1 x 1 φ 1 f x 2 x 2 φ 1 f x 3 x 3 ρ y where ρ y is the correlation matrix of the standard normal variables y the correlation coefficients in the matrix can be calculated as follows 21 ρ i j e y i y j e y i e y j e y i 2 e 2 y i e y j 2 e 2 y j r 1 k y i r y j r 1 k r 1 k y i r r 1 k y j r r 1 k y i r 2 1 k r 1 k y i r 2 r 1 k y j r 2 1 k r 1 k y j r 2 i j 1 2 3 where k is the total number of sample data y i the environmental variables in the physical space corresponding to the random points in the standard normal space x can be determined as follows 22 x 1 f x 1 1 φ u 1 23 x 2 f x 2 1 φ u 2 1 ρ 12 2 ρ 12 u 1 24 x 3 f x 3 1 φ u 3 1 ρ 12 2 1 ρ 12 2 ρ 13 2 ρ 23 2 2 ρ 12 ρ 13 ρ 23 1 1 ρ 12 2 ρ 13 ρ 12 ρ 23 u 1 ρ 23 ρ 12 ρ 23 u 2 the extreme response can be estimated by primarily studying the short term response under critical sea states located at the environmental isosurface let x d represent the design capacity of the mooring system associated with an exceeding probability and f x denote the relationship between the environmental variables and tension response then x d can be determined as follows 25 x d max f x x x 1 x 2 x 3 located at environmental isosurface fig 4 illustrates the random variables in the transformed space u and corresponding environmental isosurface in the physical space x using the nataf distribution model in this example we consider that the recurrence period is 100 years and that the random variables x 1 and x 3 follow weibull distributions in which the scale and shape parameters are 3 50 1 27 and 14 29 1 66 respectively variable x 2 follows a lognormal distribution in which the mean and standard deviation are equal to 2 12 and 0 62 respectively the correlation coefficients between those variables are ρ 12 0 70 ρ 13 0 80 and ρ 23 0 64 4 case study extreme tension of a semi submersible platform the characteristic extreme tension of a mooring system for a semi submersible platform was assessed and compared using the proposed framework based on hindcasting metocean data in the barents sea the design sea states associated with a n yr return period were determined and ecs were constructed to define the critical environmental conditions a long term extreme response assessment was performed based on the variabilities of the short term extreme analysis 4 1 environmental conditions the barents sea is a marginal sea of the arctic ocean located north of norway and russia few in situ metocean data are available in the barents sea thus 20 yr datasets of the wind wave and current parameters for every 3 h were hindcasted based on the polar weather research and forecast simulating waves nearshore and finite volume community ocean models fig 5 shows the selected offshore site geographic position 70 n 30 e an annual ice free area which is used to demonstrate the application of the various models for the estimation of design sea states and loads the mooring system design tensions of interest were investigated considering various combinations of environmental conditions e g winds waves and currents the wind can be described by a suitable empirical wind spectrum the npd spectrum was adopted in this case the currents were addressed by using a current profile with depth the irregular waves were simulated by employing a jonswap spectrum as characterised by a significant wave height and peak period we used the significant wave height h s peak period t p wind speed at 10 m above sea level w s and surface current speeds c s hindcasted from various numerical models to demonstrate the variability in predicting design loads using various criteria based on an offshore site in the barents sea with a 318 m water depth providing 58440 pieces of 3 h data from january 1 1996 to december 31 2015 the statistical distributions of the individual w s h s and v c values were all approximated by a three parameter weibull distribution and the probability density function pdf can be expressed as follows 26 f x λ γ x α γ λ 1 exp x α γ λ where x is the variable α γ and λ are the location scale and shape parameters respectively and can be estimated by using the maximum likelihood method t p follows a lognormal distribution which is a continuous probability distribution for a positively valued random variable the pdf of the lognormal distribution is given as follows 27 f x 1 2 π σ exp 1 2 σ 2 ln x μ 2 where μ and σ are mean and standard deviation of the sample data respectively the histograms and marginal distribution fittings for environmental variables are depicted in fig 6 and the distribution parameters as estimated using the maximum likelihood method are provided in table 1 the optimal marginal distributions are adopted to construct the multivariate joint distribution functions those distributions can also be used to determine the conventional environmental design parameters associated with an n yr return period as listed in table 2 4 2 model description and coupled dynamic analysis a multi functional semi submersible platform composed of two pontoons four columns and four braces was employed in this study the mooring system consisted of twelve symmetrically arranged mooring lines the longitudinal angles between each group of three mooring lines and the platform were 37 40 and 45 respectively as shown in fig 7 tables 3 and 4 summarise the relevant dimensions of the floating platform and the main properties of the mooring lines to investigate the variabilities of the various fitting and extrapolation models this study selected various seeds to generate random sea states and a 3 h coupled time domain dynamic analysis for the moored semi submersible platform was conducted using ansys aqwa fig 8 displays a coupled hydrodynamic model of the floating system the pretension for all mooring lines was 1430 kn for a large scale coupled floating system the wave loads and structural dynamic response are quantified based on 3 d radiation diffraction theories and the morison equation the total velocity potential function for the flow field can be given as follows 28 φ φ i φ d φ r re ϕ i x y z ϕ d x y z ϕ r x y z where φ i φ d and φ r represent the incident wave potential scattered wave

floating body as external forces the simulation length for all cases in this study was adopted as 10800 s 3 h with a time interval of 0 2 s 4 3 environmental contours the most researches conducted in previous literatures are bivariate methods and only require modelling of the marginal distribution of h s and t p the ec model described in this section is trivariate and considers the joint distribution of extreme values of h s t p w s or h s t p c s the marginal distributions of all three variables are validated to be three parameter weibull distribution and lognormal distribution as

2d ec in a 3d model greater domain for h s t p is contained corresponding to various wind or current speed a proper characteristic extreme level can be determined considering all random environmental variables due to the high sensitivity of floating structures to hydrodynamic loading 4 4 extreme tension estimation the outputs of the coupled nonlinear dynamic response analysis of the floating system using ansys aqwa are the time histories of most loaded mooring line s line 7 in the head sea condition tension responses the characteristic extreme levels of the tension can be determined from the time histories using various models under different combinations of environmental loads 4 4 1 estimation by the global maxima method the design 100 yr environmental condition is given in section 4

to be used as the benchmarks for assessing the accuracy and applicability of other models the maxima peaks extracted from the time histories are plotted in fig 12 fig 12 indicates that the maxima of the tension histories vary evident with different seed numbers thus it is necessary to consider wave randomness in the characteristic value prediction for the floating system the weibull distribution was employed to describe the global maxima tension as expressed by eq 3 and the distribution parameters were estimated using the common moment method diagnostic tests were conducted for the global maxima values the global maxima distribution test diagrams including the probability quantile return level and density plots for 100 yr environmental conditions with various combinations are illustrated in fig 13 as shown in those diagrams the global maxima values represented using light blue circles fit well with the corresponding empirical red curves the density histogram indicates that the density curve matches the original data well the extreme values as evaluated from the data of all 150 simulations were 3277 1 kn 3541 5 kn and 3193 1 kn respectively for various environmental combinations wave only wave and wind wave and current these are regarded as accurate design values from the global maxima distribution the statistical errors can be calculated based on the benchmark using other extrapolation and fitting approaches stanisic et al 2018 xu et al 2019b as follows 41 e r x d p r e d i c t e d x d b e n c h m a r k x d b e n c h m a r k 100 a total of 150 predicted results as constructed from the data of extreme values from single time histories and the corresponding statistical errors can be calculated based on the various models the statistics of the errors were evaluated to indicate the optimisation of the candidate models the mean variance minimum and maximum were adopted as statistical parameters stanisic et al 2018 the mean value μ shows the bias of the predicted results a lower value of μ indicates a closely predicted result as compared with benchmark the variance σ 2 describes the variability of the predicted results the greater the variance the greater the fluctuation of the predicted data the minimum and maximum values indicate the total deviation of the statistical error an optimal extreme prediction model can be chosen with lower mean variance minimum and maximum values 4 4 2 estimation by the pot method one of the most essential procedures in the pot method is defining the optimal threshold value as it has a significant effect on extreme predictions there are useful criteria for determining an optimum threshold value such as the mean residual life plot and mean square error methods davison and smith 1990 ragan and manuel 2008 dimitrov 2016 another common choice is to adopt a mean plus 1 4 standard deviation level cheng and kuang 2016 in this study for simplicity the various percentiles of all individual top peaks of the time history response were investigated for extreme level prediction another important part of the pot method comprises defining suitable distribution models in this study the general candidate extreme distribution models described in section 2 2 were employed and the statistics of the prediction errors were calculated the peaks defined as 50 of the all individual top peaks for various environmental loading combinations were fitted using the three prescribed fitting models fig 14 presents the cumulative probability fitting results it is observed that under different load combinations the performances of the distribution models seem similar the gumbel distribution fits well with the sample data followed by the gpd model the gev model is the worst for tail fitting however it is worth mentioning that performance of the prescribed distribution models can be very different for various percentiles of the individual top peaks from a single time series fig 15 gives the statistics of the errors for the different percentiles of peaks for each of the 150 simulations using gumbel and gev models under wave conditions the results for gpd model are not shown here as the performance is less effective than that of the gumbel model table 5 lists all of the error statistics from using the various models from the histogram of the prediction error and statistics it can be seen that as the number of tail fitting peaks changes there will be evidently different variability in the prediction results leading to prediction errors from fig 15 and table 5 it can be seen that regardless of the percentiles of the individual top peaks the prediction errors using the gpd and gev models are more divergent than those of the gumbel distribution for the same percentiles of peaks the various extreme distribution models produce different prediction errors under wave conditions the gumbel model usually yields a conservative extreme prediction in which the means of prediction errors are positive values the gdp and gev models will give predicted results lower than the benchmark value owing to their negative bias the gumbel fitting method yields over prediction results with the lowest variance indicating that this model will produce consistent estimations for a higher percentile of top peaks the tail of the sample data are more concentrated the estimated characteristic levels show the lowest bias indicating good efficiency for design load prediction however the total deviation as expressed by maximum and minimum errors also increases therefore from an integrated assessment the gumbel distribution model is recommended for the characteristic level estimation based on the top 20 30 of peaks with its small bias error range and variance fig 16 presents a histogram of prediction errors from using the gumbel model under various environmental load combinations the prediction error statistics are listed in tables 6 and 7 the results indicate that the gumbel distribution remains the optimal model for extreme value estimation when considering the effects of winds and currents although the statistics of the prediction errors increased relative to the wave only condition as the sea states become more complex the randomness in the environmental conditions and mooring line response including the stiffness characteristics increase leading to a more difficult prediction for the tension response similarly taking the top 10 20 of the peaks will yield both over and under estimations the minimum and maximum prediction errors are negative and positive respectively with high variance overall the top 20 30 individual peaks are suggested for the extreme level estimation in the pot method using the gumbel distribution model 4 4 3 estimation by the acer method the acer method is different from the prescribed asymptotic extreme distribution models which predict the exact extreme level by constructing a sequence of nonparametric distribution functions the empirical acer functions ε ˆ k z for different orders of k under various environmental combinations are depicted in fig 17 as shown in fig 17 the dependence of the sample data has an evident effect on the lower range of extreme tensions while this effect disappears in the tail of the data thus all of the acer functions k 1 can be used to describe the tails of extreme tensions in this case k 2 is adopted to guarantee precision with more available data a linear trend can be observed in the tail of the sample data indicating that the assumption of an expression like the gumbel distribution can work well for tail fitting chai et al 2018 another essential part of the acer method is determining the appropriate threshold z 0 for tail fitting as shown in fig 17 the empirical acer functions are similar with high z 0 values a similar finding is observed for all three environmental combinations the extreme level associated with a given return period can be calculated by solving eq 12 a preliminary sensitivity study was performed to investigate suitable threshold values table 8 lists the predicted extreme levels using various thresholds as expressed by a mean plus n standard deviation level the results show that the acer method will yield different extreme values with different thresholds but the effect of the threshold can be negligible with a higher value a good consistency is shown from using the acer method in this study compared with the benchmark obtained from the global maxima method a high threshold may not always yield an ideal estimation fig 17 presents the acer2 function fitting obtained by the levenberg marquardt algorithm the corresponding fitted 95 confidence intervals are also depicted and calculated and indicate that the empirical acer functions can be well fitted by a parametric function overall the acer method can produce accurate predictions for extreme mooring tension and the accuracy of this model supports it as an alternative technique for estimating the extreme responses of a floating system 4 4 4 estimation by the ec approach in the conventional 3d ec approach u 1 u 2 and u 3 in the standard normal space correspond to the significant wave height h s wave peak period t p and wind speed w s or current speed c s respectively all of the environmental parameters were modelled as random variables whereas the extreme tension values of the mooring lines r were modelled as their conditional median values expressed as follows 42 u 4 0 r d f r h s t p w s c s 1 φ u 4 α h ˆ s t ˆ p w ˆ s c ˆ s γ h ˆ s t ˆ p w ˆ s c ˆ s where r d is the estimated design loads one should search the entire surface to find the maximum extreme tension h ˆ s t ˆ p w ˆ s c ˆ s denotes the critical environmental conditions at the 3d environmental surface figs 9 and 10 resulting in the largest extreme tension response the mooring tension response is sensitive to the environmental variables i e h s and t p zhao and dong 2020 because the floating system involves complex nonlinear dynamic properties a coupled time domain analysis for all sea states in the 3d surface is computationally expensive in this case only a portion of the entire surface is considered for the numerical simulations which is expected to cause higher mooring line tension higher values of the significant wave height h s 8 m wind speed w s 15 m s current speed c s 0 5 m s and wave peak period close to the structural period 10 s t p 20 s were involved in this case fig 18 presents the colours of the surface which indicate the magnitude of the extreme mooring tension corresponding to the selected environmental combinations of h s t p h s t p w s and h s t p c s table 9 lists the design values for the critical points in the 2d contour and 3d surface it is observed that the design levels obtained from the 2d and 3d ec approaches do not correspond to the largest w s c s h s or t p the influence of the peak wave period can be clearly seen from fig 18 and table 9 the joint variables with a period of approximately 10 s can cause a critical tension response even though the corresponding values of other environmental variables are smaller than some points on the surface another important point is that the characteristic extreme tension values determined by the various models with independent or dependent design sea states are different considering the dependency of the environmental variables a difference of approximately 211 2 can be observed between the maximum and minimum values for the design levels this is owing to the dependent 100 yr wave period adopted in conventional standards the wave peak especially close to the structural natural period has a significant effect on the dynamic response a specific investigation of extreme tension distribution parameters and wave data h s t p was conducted by zhao and dong 2020 in addition the design levels obtained from the gev model are much lower than the true values to provide an efficient and accurate approach for estimating short term extreme tension responses it is critical to determine the environmental conditions for floating structures whose dynamic characteristics are closely related to the wave period as illustrated in the previous section the ec method is utilised to identify design sea states and the corresponding tension response then a design mooring tension based on the design sea states can be estimated using the various models the design levels obtained from various models are listed in table 10 the design mooring response obtained from global maxima method can be used as a benchmark the simulated mooring tension responses with various random seeds are different and the prediction error using the pot method was investigated as shown in fig 19 it is observed that the prediction errors from using the pot method with various seeds follow a normal distribution 4 5 long term extreme tension analysis the most precise approach for predicting a long term extreme response is simply known as the full sea state approach wherein each sea condition is regarded as a stochastic process and the corresponding short term extreme response is obtained by performing nonlinear time domain numerical simulations of the coupled floating system for 2d environmental conditions such as h s t p a discrete approach combined with a parametric model for the short term extreme distribution parameters and wave data can solve the long term extreme response perfectly with high efficiency zhao and dong 2020 however for 3d environmental conditions such as h s t p w s and h s t p c s the construction of a parametric model for the short term extreme distribution parameters and wave data with a precise meshing grid is computationally expensive thus the simplified approach adopted by van zutphen and christou 2009 and stanisic et al 2018 is employed to estimate the long term extreme levels in this study notably however the high performance of this algorithm comes at the expense of accuracy considering that the dynamic tension response is highly sensitive to the wave peak period the dependency of environmental variables is involved in the long term extreme response analysis the critical joint sea states for return periods of 10 yr 100 yr and 1000 yr as determined using the ec approach are listed in tables 9 and 11 the design tension responses obtained from the global maxima method are adopted as benchmarks as listed in table 12 to provide an efficient assessment based on a single tension series the pot method is utilised and the design levels are presented in table 12 considering the randomness in simulating environmental conditions the prediction errors with random seeds are calculated and listed in table 13 it is observed that the prediction errors vary with the design sea states and increase from 10 yr to 1000 yr when considering winds and currents a larger prediction error could arise from a single tension response assessment as the full sea state approach is too time consuming to evaluate a long term extreme tension response a simplified approach is developed based on the return levels for the 10 100 and 1000 yr design sea states the critical environmental conditions can be identified using the ec approach as described in previous section then the simple pot method is utilised to estimate the design tension response from a single hydrodynamic analysis in which the critical sea states are used as input a long term tension response intensity can be approximately fitted using those return levels as discussed above the gumbel distribution is simple and convenient for short term extreme response predictions however there will be evident short term variabilities owing to the simulation of random environmental conditions the short term variability can be described by a normal distribution the return levels for various environmental combinations and different design values are calculated as tglob10 tpot10 tglob100 tpot100 and tglob1000 tpot1000 the long term tension response distribution can be fitted as follows 43 p 1 t e n t a exp b t a exp b 1 t t g l o b 10 44 p 2 t e n t p exp q t p exp q 1 t t p o t 10 exponential functions are utilised to fit those discrete points and the fitting curves are presented in fig 20 short term variability exists in the pot method owing to the randomness of the numerical simulations thus the long term extreme response considering the short term variability can be calculated as follows 45 p t e n t 0 1 p t t g l o b t g l o b p t g l o b d t g l o b where p t glob is the probability density function of eq 43 p t t g l o b represents the distributions of the short term variability for the pot based mooring line tension response and can be fitted by a normal format as follows 46 p t t g l o b i 1 2 π σ 0 t t g l o b i e t μ 2 2 σ 2 d t the variability increases with the return period thus the mean value and standard deviation are calculated based on a linear interpolation procedure the long term distributions of the mooring line response are presented in fig 21 the design loads considering variabilities show different trends in various conditions wave wind and wave current and wave first short term variabilities existing in the pot method for three cases are different additionally the randomness in wave simulations jonswap spectrum is greater than wind and current loads which are represented using constant speed values actually there are significant variabilities in dynamic response simulation considering random seeds with different design conditions the results including variability is unstable which only shows that there is significant difference between the method using pot based peak values and considering random seeds of dynamic response in this study the results for long term extreme tension obtained from the simplified approach are compared with the full sea state approach which provides exact results a discrete scheme based on monte carlo simulation is utilised to solve the full integration vázquez hernández et al 2011 zhao and dong 2020 47 f x l e x r n f x s s e x s f s s d s k 1 n u f x s s e x s k f s s k where f s s is the joint probability density function pdf of n dimensional environmental variables vector s s 1 s 2 s n t f x s s e x s represents the short term extreme response conditional on a specific environmental condition s which is usually assumed spectrally constant s k is the discrete sample of random environmental variables that follow the joint pdf f s s f x s s e x s k is the cumulative conditional distribution of the extreme response given the short term environmental condition s s k f s s k represents the probability of occurrence corresponding to the kth condition n u is the total number of generated random variables this monte carlo based approach could yield an exact result close to direct integral solution of full long term analysis for wave conditions there is an obvious trend of extreme response distribution parameters with h s and t p a limit set of discretized representative wave data combinations with intervals δ h s δ t p are selected usually n s1 n s2 numerical simulations of the coupled dynamical system are required performing the gumbel distribution is adopted to describe the short term extreme tensions the investigation of the relation between short term distribution parameters δ ρ and wave variables is performed using a discrete grid mapping which is composed by a mesh of n r 153 points after 153 3 h nonlinear time domain dynamic analyses of the floating structure system and statistical analysis of tension response the fitting results for distribution parameters and wave related variables are shown in fig 22 the parameters of conditional peak response distribution for any individual wave condition can be evaluated using a linear interpolation function for wave wind and current combinations a huge number of 3d environmental meshing are employed n s1 n s2 n s3 numerical simulations should be performed to compute response parameters to overcome expensive computation the artificial neural network ann is utilised to simulate complex nonlinear or implicit functions for any inputs based on the established database the ann are trained to learn the underivable relationship between the input and output data the results obtained from full sea state based approach are presented in fig 21 the full sea state model could yield maximum design loads compared to simplified models the results indicate that the contribution of all short term conditions is significant for predicting the design level for floating structures however the full long term analysis is computationally expensive in practical situations the simplified approach can be adopted as an alternative with underestimated design loads 5 conclusions the sea states corresponding to 10 100 and 1000 yr return periods were estimated using independent and ec approaches respectively ansys aqwa software was utilised to simulate the dynamic response of a semi submersible system as resulting from each design sea state this study focused on the extreme tension in the mooring cables various models were utilised to estimate the characteristic extreme response the global maxima pot ec and acer approaches were adopted to estimate the extreme tension from a 3 h coupled time domain simulation in the case of the pot approach the individual top peaks from a single time domain simulation were extracted in addition the gumbel gpd and gev models were adopted and their prediction errors on the response were studied the extreme response was found to be associated with various sea state combinations e g h s t p h s t p w s and h s t p c s the hydrodynamic response of the floating structure was sensitive to the wave period which would cause a higher structural response near the natural frequency the larger individual wave period obtained from the independent approach yielded much smaller design levels than those estimated using the ec approach thus it was suggested to identify the critical sea states using the ec approach considering the dependency of environmental variables and dynamic properties of floating structures as depicted in fig 22 the wave height current velocity and wind speed associated with a wave period of approximately 10 s corresponding to a given joint return period causing a critical structural response were determined as the design sea states significant differences were observed from these two approaches and the maximum and minimum values for the design levels differed several times the global maxima tension from 150 3 h time series was extracted and the weibull distribution model was adopted to fit the data design values with expensive computational costs were used as benchmarks the pot based design levels were convenient to estimate from a single time series response under the given sea states although the results could be less accurate as the random seeds of the environmental simulation were not considered thus the prediction error was studied and was found to follow a normal distribution in the pot based process the effect of the distribution models and threshold was included and was compared to the benchmark determined by the global maxima method a prediction error analysis was conducted for the different percentiles of the top peaks the mean value of the prediction error decreased with a lower percentile of individual top peaks but the prediction results were more dispersed it was observed that the top 20 30 of peaks were optimal for extreme response estimations with small statistical errors and high stability and that a gumbel distribution model fit better than the gpd and gev models for the tailing data in addition the effect of the threshold on the acer method was investigated relatively small differences were found and the effect of threshold in this model was negligible a 3d ec surface was constructed based on the nataf transformation and provided a good estimation of extreme mooring tension a simplified approach based on 10 100 and 1000 yr pot based design levels was utilised to approximate the long term extreme response the results emphasised the variability of the pot based return levels in the design sea states when considering the random seeds therefore the long term extreme tension was obtained by considering the variabilities in a short term analysis based on the pot method as expected a higher extreme response was yielded accounting for the short term variability those abovementioned approaches are generally used to estimate design loads within a larger engineering design workflow however many design responses exist and they are typically specific to the floater type and water depths for example one could focus the maximum offset of a floating platform tower bending moment of an offshore wind turbine or mooring loads in a floating structure it will largely come back to the wave period and vessel natural periods the design loads estimation for different floater type in different water depths requires determining the dynamic response of floating structure which will lead to a high computational cost as it is derived from complex finite element time domain simulation tools surrogate models could approximate the behaviour of complex systems with cheap computations for full long term analysis in future study credit authorship

20955,as vital key parts of offshore floating structures mooring systems should be able to withstand harsh environmental conditions this study aims to assess the design loads of mooring lines subjected to random loads using various statistical models a benchmark of extreme values is established using the global maxima method and is based upon a weibull distribution model for the maxima of 150 3 h time series generated by a given design sea condition with different random seeds to reduce the computational cost a peak over threshold pot method is combined with an asymptotic approach different variations are investigated and a better choice for the number of individual top peaks from single time domain simulations is determined from a statistical error analysis the average conditional exceedance rate acer method and environmental contour ec approach are also applied and compared the effects of various load combinations are considered and a 3 d ec surface is established based on the nataf transformation model a simplified long term extreme response analysis is conducted by accounting for the pot based variabilities so as to provide a more reliable design load estimation numerical results are presented and discussed for the tension estimation of a semi submersible platform considering a long term coupled analysis keywords mooring system extreme response analysis ec approach long term response analysis acer approach 1 introduction floating structures such as semi submersible platforms and offshore wind turbines must operate under complex marine conditions for long service periods mooring systems play a key role in the station keeping of those floating structures thus it is important to evaluate extreme responses against the mooring strength and offset limit to ensure safety during operational and survival conditions cheng and kuang 2016 there are three common evaluation criteria for assessing a characteristic load effect for the design of a mooring system vázquez hernandez et al 2006 i an extreme response analysis under independently designed sea states associated with a given return period ii a chosen maximum extreme response from a series of dependent sea conditions along an environmental contour ec line with a given return period and iii a characteristic response calculation from a long term statistical analysis the extreme values of mooring line tensions are of great interest and can be obtained from short term time domain stochastic analyses whereas the application of various models will produce significant uncertainties and lead to different results the dynamic behaviour of a mooring system is non gaussian owing to the combination of waves and low frequencies in addition the nonlinear geometric and material properties have strong effects on the dynamic behaviour of the entire system the mooring line response analysis is significantly dependent on simulating the randomness of the environmental conditions all of these aspects produce challenging points for the prediction of characteristic extreme values of mooring systems karlsen and naess 2005 xu et al 2019a a widely used procedure for estimating extreme mooring line tension comprises specifying meteorological and metocean design conditions corresponding to a given return period and then assessing the time series response using asymptotic approaches it is common to neglect the correlations between environmental conditions which are typically a combination of the individual 100 yr return values of waves currents and wind this will lead to a more conservative design load than the true 100 yr load tromans and vanderschuren 1995 various parametric distribution functions have been adopted to simulate the extreme responses of marine structures based on following a certain extrapolation procedure from time domain simulations such as the gumbel distribution lognormal distribution generalised extreme value gev distribution and weibull distribution api 2005 ding et al 2013 ambühl et al 2014 dnvgl 2015 guo et al 2016 hsu et al 2017 cheng et al 2020 prevosto et al 2007 discussed various alternative methods for the statistical analysis of the extreme low frequency motions of moored floating bodies including rice s formula breitung s formula hagberg s approaches and asymptotic expansion in the process of exploring a short term extreme response distribution one important problem that cannot be ignored is the definition and selection of extreme points the maximum peak from each time response can be selected as the extreme value and several time domain simulations should be conducted to consider the randomness of environmental conditions using different seeds stanisic et al 2017 examined how the accuracy of predicting the design mooring load from a sample of response maxima improved as the number of simulations was progressively increased from 10 to 170 for a 100 yr extreme condition and 10000 yr survival condition it was concluded that 30 or 40 maxima could achieve an accurate prediction of the true design loads the global maximum approach is usually adopted as a benchmark for confirming the accuracy of other extrapolation models stanisic et al 2018 xu et al 2019b a coupled nonlinear dynamic analysis is computationally extensive thus the individual top peaks from a single time series are utilised and fitted to develop a short term extreme response dnvgl 2015 sagrilo et al 2011 proposed a straightforward approach to account for the statistical uncertainty associated with the simulation length and characterised a short term extreme response value based on a single time series stanisic et al 2018 concluded that the peaks between two mean up crossings defined as maximum loads would produce a more accurate and precise prediction of the extreme tension response than all local peaks or peaks with a time constraint the peak over threshold pot method is a common technique for selecting peaks with lower dependence for extreme value analyses however the definition of an appropriate threshold is a popular topic cheng and kuang 2016 conducted extreme response predictions for a deepwater mooring system using the weibull winterstein jensen and gumbel fitting methods the results indicated that considering 30 40 of the top peaks could lead to a more close fitting to the observed upper tailing segment for the weibull model and that at least ten 3 h simulations were needed for the gumbel model wang 2017 proposed an optimal threshold selection approach based on incorporating a declustering algorithm in the pot method and employed it for an extreme value prediction of the dynamic response of a spar type floating wind turbine xu et al 2019b estimated the short term extreme responses of a moored semi submersible platform using the pot method and the effects of the threshold ensemble size and simulation durations on the extreme values were discussed in addition to the above mentioned approaches the average conditional exceedance rate acer method has been proposed to account for the statistical dependence between peaks for extreme value estimations from sampled time series naess and gaidai 2009 naess et al 2010 chai et al 2018 sagrilo et al 2012 predicted the extreme values of floater system based upon a weibull distribution model for the peaks of the time series and the results showed that the weibull model is a particular case of the acer method in another study the stochastic dynamic responses and short term extreme tension responses of floating horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines were estimated based on extrapolation of a mean up crossing rate method cheng et al 2017 xu et al 2020 applied the acer method to estimate the extreme loads of a site specific semi submersible type wind turbine the acer method has shown good performance for nonstationary time series and can perform better than the pot and gumbel methods naess and gaidai 2009 to avoid numerous numerical simulations and complex long term response analyses ecs are commonly employed to identify extreme environmental conditions and predict extreme response and design loads for marine structures combining contours with structural response distributions is a popular way to estimate design responses velarde et al 2019 vanem 2017 performed a comparison study on the estimation of extreme structural responses from different ec methods velarde et al 2019 derived an extreme load distribution for an offshore wind turbine the variability in short term structural response was accounted for by inflating the ecs vanem et al 2020 compared different contour methods with response based methods for extreme ship response analysis and found that all approaches to contour estimation produce reasonable and comparable results zhao and dong 2020 presented an extension of the alternative ec approach based on inverse first order reliability theory in a 3 d model to account for short term extreme response uncertainties and employed a simplified discrete approach combined with monte carlo simulations to estimate long term extreme loads an all sea state approach could provide the exact levels for long term extreme response analyses but is computationally prohibitive some efficient techniques have been proposed and implemented for accurate long term extreme analyses of mooring lines in recent years grime and langley 2008 vázquez hernández et al 2011 agarwal and manuel 2009 provided a long term extreme load prediction for an offshore wind turbine response based on a combination of the inverse reliability method and pot method in which the response variability is approximately modelled from a statistical extrapolation procedure stanisic et al 2018 provided an appropriate expression for calculating the long term distribution of a mooring load in which the short term variability was described in terms of a gumbel distribution videiro et al 2019 conducted a long term analysis using a scatter diagram key region bounded by extreme ec lines to evaluate the extreme response s of steel risers leong et al 2020 applied a monte carlo simulation and classical control variates technique to perform integration over the long term variables of mooring lines gramstad et al 2020 presented a sequential sampling method using gaussian process regression for estimating a long term extreme structural response the short term variability was considered using a gaussian regression when estimating design loads for floating structures using simulation responses the simulation effort can undoubtedly become unmanageable if uncertainties in the extreme value prediction and efficiency issues in the statistical extrapolation models are not well addressed the aims of this study are threefold first the characteristic extreme tension responses following different extrapolation procedures including the pot and acer algorithms from time domain simulations are assessed using various extreme value models under designed environmental conditions a benchmark of extreme values is established using the global maximum method thus short term extreme variabilities with various models are evaluated and the definition of the threshold and distribution fitting are investigated and discussed second this study attempts to determine critical sea state and design loads based on a 3 d ec approach in which the nataf transformation model is employed to construct a 3 d ec surface third it demonstrates a simplified framework for the assessment of long term extreme tension considering short term distribution fitting uncertainties the proposed framework for evaluating and comparing the results from the characteristic responses of mooring systems is shown in fig 1 the conventional extreme value analysis methodology is summarised in section 2 and the global maxima method pot and acer methods are introduced the identification of critical environmental conditions and design loads is further discussed in section 3 based on ec approach the hindcasting time series of sea data and associated dependencies are considered using copula theory section 4 discusses a numerical simulation and describes the environmental conditions in the barents sea the floating system relevant results from extreme tension predictions including short term variabilities and long term design loads conclusions and recommendations are presented in section 5 this study addresses the characteristic extreme values of mooring systems as related to the specification of design conditions focusing particularly on the requirement for nominal loads in the load and resistance factor design procedure and on reliability based design for floating structures 2 short term response based method the design of a floating system generally requires an estimation of the load effects associated with design conditions occurring with a particular recurrence period the design sea states for various load types and combinations can be determined independently or by considering the likelihood of the simultaneity of metocean conditions in a short term response based method the characteristic design loads of the time series t e t generally correspond to a q percentile of the largest tension distribution f t n x for floating structures a 3 h dynamic response simulation is usually performed to ensure the stability of the statistical characteristics t e t denotes the extreme peaks of the random process t e t associated with the period t s 3 h and its distribution can be defined as follows 1 f t e x p t e t x where p represents the probability of extreme tension then the cumulative distribution function cdf for the extreme tension can be determined as follows 2 f t n x f t e x v e t s t where v e n e t s is the average rate of peaks and n e is the number of sample peaks in the time domain simulations the estimation of short term extreme responses may cause prediction results with significant differences depending on the selection of thresholds distribution fitting models and model parameter estimation methods 2 1 global maxima method the straightforward way to estimate short term extreme values is to employ an extreme distribution function to fit a set of data with n extreme values defined as the maxima of n independent time simulations to account for the randomness of the sea state identical environmental variables with various seeds are simulated and the different seeds produce different response time histories fig 2 illustrates the most loaded line tension time histories generated using the same wave parameters but different seeds the maxima data is determined from the tension time histories based on a coupled nonlinear time domain analysis the weibull distribution is commonly adopted to fit the sample maxima of several time series of responses the cdf of the weibull distribution can be expressed as follows 3 f t e x 1 exp x α w γ w λ w where α w γ w and λ w are the location scale and shape parameters of the distribution respectively the characteristic short term design loads associated with a given q percentile can be estimated as follows 4 x d α w γ w ln 1 q 1 v e t s t 1 λ w for the most probable maximum extreme value q is adopted as 0 368 and as 0 8 for an extreme level which has a 20 exceedance probability 2 2 peak over threshold pot method the selection of maxima from n independent time simulations is time consuming owing to the coupled nonlinear numerical simulations peaks can be defined from a single time series utilising the pot method in which only the individual top peaks above a given threshold are selected and fitted several algorithms have been proposed for the optimal threshold selection such as the mean residual life plot and root square error methods ragan and manuel 2008 dimitrov 2016 xu et al 2019b a general threshold at the mean plus 1 4 standard deviation level or at the 50 95 percentile of the total top peaks is also commonly adopted agarwal and manuel 2009 cheng and kuang 2016 liu et al 2019 the individual peak response of a single time series is depicted in fig 3 various extreme distribution models can be employed to fit the top peaks 2 2 1 gumbel model the three parameter weibull distribution the cdf of which is described by eq 5 is extensively used to predict the extreme values of oceanic variables and extreme response of marine structures 5 f t e x exp exp x α g γ g where α g and γ g are the location and scale parameters of the distribution respectively and can be estimated by using the moment method or least squares method with the sample data for the gumbel model the estimation of the characteristic design loads is as follows 6 x d α g γ g ln ln q 1 v e t s 2 2 2 generalised pareto model the cdf of the generalised pareto distribution gpd can be expressed as follows 7 f t e x 1 1 λ p x α p γ p 1 λ p λ p 0 1 exp x α

γ p ln 1 q 1 v e t s t λ p 0 2 2 3 generalised extreme value gev model the cdf of the gev distribution is defined as follows 9 f t e x exp 1 λ e x α e γ e 1 λ e where α e γ e and λ e are the location scale and shape parameters of the gev model respectively the gumbel distribution is a particular case of the gev model for λ e 0 a close relationship exists between the gpd and gev models for the gev model the extreme level is given as follows 10 x d α e γ e ln q 1 v e t s t λ e 1 λ e 2 3 average conditional exceedance rate acer method the acer method considers the dependence of peaks and can be adopted to determine the extreme value distribution of tension response peaks the tension time series is regarded as a stochastic process z t and the time interval of the sequence is δ t thus there is a total of n observed tension response peaks z 1 z 2 z n over the simulated period 0 t the extreme value of the sampled peaks is defined as z max max z j j 1 2 n and the cumulative distribution of the extreme value can be expressed as follows 11 f z prob z max z prob z 1 z z n z j 2 n prob z j z z j 1 z z 1 z prob z 1 z by assuming that tension peaks and conditional exceedance events are independent and follow a poisson process the basic extreme value distribution derived from the acer method can be approximated as follows 12 f z exp n k 1 ε ˆ k z where ε ˆ k z represents the empirical acer function of the kth order and k denotes the immediately preceding non exceedances the gumbel distribution model is commonly adopted to predict extreme responses for marine structures using asymptotic approaches the acer function employs a similar expression to fit the tail region based on a logarithmic form of the gumbel distribution function the empirical acer function of the extreme level z is assumed to follow a form as follows 13 ε ˆ k q k exp a k z b k c k z z 0 where q k a k b k and c k are suitable constants depending on the order k and can be estimated using extrapolation by minimising the mean square error function as follows 14 f q k a k b k c k j 1 s ξ j log ε ˆ k z j log q a z j b c 2 where z 1 z 2 z s represents the response levels estimated using acer function ξ j is a weight factor the levenberg marquardt method is commonly adopted to solve eq 14 the 95 confidence interval of the acer function can be expressed as follows 15 c i z ε ˆ k z 1 1 96 n k 1 ε ˆ k z detailed descriptions of acer function derivation can be found in naess and gaidai 2009 and chai et al 2018 3 environmental contour ec approach the ec approach decouples the structural response and environmental variables based on the inverse first order reliability method iform winterstein et al 1993 thus it is regarded as an ideal alternative to solve for full long term design loads while avoiding expensive numerical simulations haver and winterstein 2009 the general procedure for developing ecs comprises constructing a joint probability for environmental variables based on a conditional joint distribution model copula theory or monte carlo simulation and transforming the independent standard normal variables into original environmental parameters in the physical space using a rosenblatt transformation haver and winterstein 2009 huseby et al 2013 montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 velarde et al 2019 vanem et al 2020 2d ecs for bivariate metocean variables h s t p and corresponding extreme structural response analyses are common and mature in current studies however to the author s best knowledge there are few research studies on deriving extreme levels of tensions from 3d ec approaches deriving an environmental contour from a metocean data generally involves two steps estimating the joint distribution of the environmental variables and constructing the environmental contour based on that distribution the nataf transformation gaussian copula and iform are adopted to construct environmental contour in this study the ec approach can consider multivariate environmental variables using copulas or conditional joint distributions and iform as described in silva gonzález et al 2011 and montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 actually there are variabilities and uncertainties on the estimation of extreme structural response from different environmental contour methods vanem 2017 the purpose of this study is to estimate the characteristic extreme response for mooring system in a complex ocean environment ec approach is an alternative to be adopted to reduce the variabilities there are more variabilities for constructing multivariate joint distribution of environmental variables using various joint models just 2 d and 3 d ecs considering wind wave and current parameters are constructed in this study the global maxima method pot method and acer method are also adopted and compared the 3d contours for multivariate environmental variables proposed by silva gonzález et al 2011 using the nataf

response under critical sea states located at the environmental isosurface let x d represent the design capacity of the mooring system associated with an exceeding probability and f x denote the relationship between the environmental variables and tension response then x d can be determined as follows 25 x d max f x x x 1 x 2 x 3 located at environmental isosurface fig 4 illustrates the random variables in the transformed space u and corresponding environmental isosurface in the physical space x using the nataf distribution model in this example we consider that the recurrence period is 100 years and that the random variables x 1 and x 3 follow weibull distributions in which the scale and shape parameters are 3 50 1 27 and 14 29 1 66 respectively variable x 2 follows a lognormal distribution in which the mean and standard deviation are equal to 2 12 and 0 62 respectively the correlation coefficients between those variables are ρ 12 0 70 ρ 13 0 80 and ρ 23 0 64 4 case study extreme tension of a semi submersible platform the characteristic extreme tension of a mooring system for a semi submersible platform was assessed and compared using the proposed framework based on hindcasting metocean data in the barents sea the design sea states associated with a n yr return period were determined and ecs were constructed to define the critical environmental conditions a long term extreme response assessment was performed based on the variabilities of the short term extreme analysis 4 1 environmental conditions the barents sea is a marginal sea of the arctic ocean located north of norway and russia few in situ metocean data are available in the barents sea thus 20 yr datasets of the wind wave and current parameters for every 3 h were hindcasted based on the polar

wave height h s peak period t p wind speed at 10 m above sea level w s and surface current speeds c s hindcasted from various numerical models to demonstrate the variability in predicting design loads using various criteria based on an offshore site in the barents sea with a 318 m water depth providing 58440 pieces of 3 h data from january 1 1996 to december 31 2015 the statistical distributions of the individual w s h s and v c values were all approximated by a three parameter weibull distribution and the probability density function pdf can be expressed as follows 26 f x λ γ x α γ λ 1 exp x α γ λ where x is the variable α γ and λ are the location scale and shape parameters respectively and can be estimated by using the maximum likelihood method t p follows a lognormal distribution which is a continuous probability distribution for a positively valued random variable the pdf of the lognormal distribution is given as follows 27 f x 1 2 π σ exp 1 2 σ 2 ln x μ 2 where μ and σ are mean and standard deviation of the sample data respectively the histograms and marginal distribution fittings for environmental variables are depicted in fig 6 and the distribution parameters as estimated using the maximum likelihood method are provided in table 1 the optimal marginal distributions are adopted to construct the multivariate joint distribution functions those distributions can also be used to determine the conventional environmental design parameters associated with an n yr return period as listed in table 2 4 2 model description and coupled dynamic analysis a multi functional semi submersible platform composed of two pontoons four columns and four braces was employed in this study the mooring system consisted of twelve symmetrically arranged mooring lines the longitudinal angles between each group of three mooring lines and the platform were 37 40 and 45 respectively as shown in fig 7 tables 3 and 4 summarise the relevant dimensions of the floating platform and the main properties of the mooring lines to investigate the variabilities of the various fitting and extrapolation models this study selected various seeds to generate random sea states and a 3 h coupled time domain dynamic analysis for the moored semi submersible platform was conducted using ansys aqwa fig 8 displays a coupled hydrodynamic model of the floating system the pretension for all mooring lines was 1430 kn for a large scale coupled floating system the wave loads and structural dynamic response are quantified based on 3 d radiation diffraction theories and the morison equation the total velocity potential function for the flow field can be given as follows 28 φ φ i φ d φ r re ϕ i x y z ϕ d x y z ϕ r x y z where φ i φ d and φ r represent the incident wave potential scattered wave potential and radiation potential respectively then the linearised bernoulli equation can be employed to calculate the pressure distribution on the wet surface of the floating structure in the wave

matrix h t τ is the retardation function k represents the stiffness matrix x x and x denote the floating body displacement velocity and acceleration respectively f e is the external load including hydrodynamic and functional forces and f m is the mooring forces the compatibility of the body motions and mooring tensions at the fairleads is considered to solve the dynamic behaviour of the coupled floating system for each integration step the body motions at the fairlead are solved first and then are used to calculate the top tensions of mooring lines which can also be transferred to the floating body as external forces the simulation length for all cases in this study was adopted as 10800 s 3 h with a time interval of 0 2 s 4 3 environmental contours the most researches conducted in previous literatures are bivariate methods and only require modelling of the marginal distribution of h s and t p the ec model described in this section is trivariate and considers the joint distribution of extreme values of h s t p w s or h s t p c s the marginal distributions of all three variables are validated to be three parameter weibull distribution and lognormal distribution as described in section 4 1 the random variables following optimal marginal distribution can be transformed using nataf transformation 33 y 1 φ 1 f h s h s φ 1 1 exp h s 0 66 1 61 1 22 h s 0 66 34 y 2 φ

ρ 23 ρ 12 ρ 23 u 2 fig 10 a shows the 3d environmental contour for h s t p and c s and the cross section with a fixed current speed is depicted in fig 10 b in a 2d ec based model both wave data h s and t p are modelled as random variables and the extreme response can be determined by searching along the contour the constructed 2d contour for h s t p is depicted in fig 11 in the 3d ec based model for simplicity u 3 0 then the third variable can be adopted as the median value c s 0 34 m s w s 6 82 m s as depicted in figs 9 and 10 the cross section of 3d environmental contour is coincident with 2d ec in a 3d model greater domain for h s t p is contained corresponding to various wind or current speed a proper characteristic extreme level can be determined considering all random environmental variables due to the high sensitivity of floating structures to hydrodynamic loading 4 4 extreme tension estimation the outputs of the coupled nonlinear dynamic response analysis of the floating system using ansys aqwa are the time histories of most loaded mooring line s line 7 in the head sea condition tension responses the characteristic extreme levels of the tension can be determined from the time histories using various models under different combinations of environmental loads 4 4 1 estimation by the global maxima method the design 100 yr environmental condition is given in section 4 1 and a total of 150 numerical simulations were conducted using different random seeds to consider the randomness of the sea states the global maxima method was employed to predict the extreme values to be used as the benchmarks for assessing the accuracy and applicability of other models the maxima peaks extracted from the time histories are plotted in fig 12 fig 12 indicates that the maxima of the tension histories vary evident with different seed numbers thus it is necessary to consider wave randomness in the characteristic value prediction for the floating system the weibull distribution was employed to describe the global maxima tension as expressed by eq 3 and the distribution parameters were estimated using the common moment method diagnostic tests were conducted for the global maxima values the global maxima distribution test diagrams including the probability quantile return level and density plots for 100 yr environmental conditions with various combinations are illustrated in fig 13 as shown in those diagrams the global maxima values represented using light blue circles fit well with the corresponding empirical red curves the density histogram indicates that the density curve matches the original data well the extreme values as evaluated from the data of all 150 simulations were 3277 1 kn 3541 5 kn and 3193 1 kn respectively for various environmental combinations wave only wave and wind wave and current these are regarded as accurate design values from the global maxima distribution the statistical errors can be calculated based on the benchmark using other extrapolation and fitting approaches stanisic et al 2018 xu et al 2019b as follows 41 e r x d p r e d i c t e d x d b e n c h m a r k x d b e n c h m a r k 100 a total of 150 predicted results as constructed from the data of extreme values from single time histories and the corresponding statistical errors can be calculated based on the various models the statistics of the errors were evaluated to indicate the optimisation of the candidate models the mean variance minimum and maximum were adopted as statistical parameters stanisic et al 2018 the mean value μ shows the bias of the predicted results a lower value of μ indicates a closely predicted result as compared with benchmark the variance σ 2 describes the variability of the predicted results the greater the variance the greater the fluctuation of the predicted data the minimum and maximum values indicate the total deviation of the statistical error an optimal extreme prediction model can be chosen with lower mean variance minimum and maximum values 4 4 2 estimation by the pot method one of the most essential procedures in the pot method is defining the optimal threshold value as it has a significant effect on extreme predictions there are useful criteria for determining an optimum threshold value such as the mean residual life plot and mean square error methods davison and smith 1990 ragan and manuel 2008 dimitrov 2016 another common choice is to adopt a mean plus 1 4 standard deviation level cheng and kuang 2016 in this study for simplicity the various percentiles of all individual top peaks of the time history response were investigated for extreme level prediction another important part of the pot method comprises defining suitable distribution models in this study the general candidate extreme distribution models described in section 2 2 were employed and the statistics of the prediction errors were calculated the peaks defined as 50 of the all individual top peaks for various environmental loading combinations were fitted using the three prescribed fitting models fig 14 presents the cumulative probability fitting results it is observed that under different load combinations the performances of the distribution models seem similar the gumbel distribution fits well with the sample data followed by the gpd model the gev model is the worst for tail fitting however it is worth mentioning that performance of the prescribed distribution models can be very different for various percentiles of the individual top peaks from a single time series fig 15 gives the statistics of the errors for the different percentiles of peaks for each of the 150 simulations using gumbel and gev models under wave conditions the results for gpd model are not shown here as the performance is less effective than that of the gumbel model table 5 lists all of the error statistics from using the various models from the histogram of the prediction error and statistics it can be seen that as the number of tail fitting peaks changes there will be evidently different variability in the prediction results leading to prediction errors from fig 15 and table 5 it can be seen that regardless of the percentiles of the individual top peaks the prediction errors using the gpd and gev models are more divergent than those of the gumbel distribution for the same percentiles of peaks the various extreme distribution models produce different prediction errors under wave conditions the gumbel model usually yields a conservative extreme prediction in which the means of prediction errors are positive values the gdp and gev models will give predicted results lower than the benchmark value owing to their negative bias the gumbel fitting method yields over prediction results with the lowest variance indicating that this model will produce consistent estimations for a higher percentile of top peaks the tail of the sample data are more concentrated the estimated characteristic levels show the lowest bias indicating good efficiency for design load prediction however the total deviation as expressed by maximum and minimum errors also increases therefore from an integrated assessment the gumbel distribution model is recommended for the characteristic level estimation based on the top 20 30 of peaks with its small bias error range and variance fig 16 presents a histogram of prediction errors from using the gumbel model under various environmental load combinations the prediction error statistics are listed in tables 6 and 7 the results indicate that the gumbel distribution remains the optimal model for extreme value estimation when considering the effects of winds and currents although the statistics of the prediction errors increased relative to the wave only condition as the sea states become more complex the randomness in the environmental conditions and mooring line response including the stiffness characteristics increase leading to a more difficult prediction for the tension response similarly taking the top 10 20 of the peaks will yield both over and under estimations the minimum and maximum prediction errors are negative and positive respectively with high variance overall the top 20 30 individual peaks are suggested for the extreme level estimation in the pot method using the gumbel distribution model 4 4 3 estimation by the acer method the acer method is different from the prescribed asymptotic extreme distribution models which predict the exact extreme level by constructing a sequence of nonparametric distribution functions the empirical acer functions ε ˆ k z for different orders of k under various environmental combinations are depicted in fig 17 as shown in fig 17 the dependence of the sample data has an evident effect on the lower range of extreme tensions while this effect disappears in the tail of the data thus all of the acer functions k 1 can be used to describe the tails of extreme tensions in this case k 2 is adopted to guarantee precision with more available data a linear trend can be observed in the tail of the sample data indicating that the assumption of an expression like the gumbel distribution can work well for tail fitting chai et al 2018 another essential part of the acer method is determining the appropriate threshold z 0 for tail fitting as shown in fig 17 the empirical acer functions are similar with high z 0 values a similar finding is observed for all three environmental combinations the extreme level associated with a given return period can be calculated by solving eq 12 a preliminary sensitivity study was performed to investigate suitable threshold values table 8 lists the predicted extreme levels using various thresholds as expressed by a mean plus n standard deviation level the results show that the acer method will yield different extreme values with different thresholds but the effect of the threshold can be negligible with a higher value a good consistency is shown from using the acer method in this study compared with the benchmark obtained from the global maxima method a high threshold may not always yield an ideal estimation fig 17 presents the acer2 function fitting obtained by the levenberg marquardt algorithm the corresponding fitted 95 confidence intervals are also depicted and calculated and indicate that the empirical acer functions can be well fitted by a parametric function overall the acer method can produce accurate predictions for extreme mooring tension and the accuracy of this model supports it as an alternative technique for estimating the extreme responses of a floating system 4 4 4 estimation by the ec approach in the conventional 3d ec approach u 1 u 2 and u 3 in the standard normal space correspond to the significant wave height h s wave peak period t p and wind speed w s or current speed c s respectively all of the environmental parameters were modelled as random variables whereas the extreme tension values of the mooring lines r were modelled as their conditional median values expressed as follows 42 u 4 0 r d f r h s t p w s c s 1 φ u 4 α h ˆ s t ˆ p w ˆ s c ˆ s γ h ˆ s t ˆ p w ˆ s c ˆ s where r d is the estimated design loads one should search the entire surface to find the maximum extreme tension h ˆ s t ˆ p w ˆ s c ˆ s denotes the critical environmental conditions at the 3d environmental surface figs 9 and 10 resulting in the largest extreme tension response the mooring tension response is sensitive to the environmental variables i e h s and t p zhao and dong 2020 because the floating system involves complex nonlinear dynamic properties a coupled time domain analysis for all sea states in the 3d surface is computationally expensive in this case only a portion of the entire surface is considered for the numerical simulations which is expected to cause higher mooring line tension higher values of the significant wave height h s 8 m wind speed w s 15 m s current speed c s 0 5 m s and wave peak period close to the structural period 10 s t p 20 s were involved in this case fig 18 presents the colours of the surface which indicate the magnitude of the extreme mooring tension corresponding to the selected environmental combinations of h s t p h s t p w s and h s t p c s table 9 lists the design values for the critical points in the 2d contour and 3d surface it is observed that the design levels obtained from the 2d and 3d ec approaches do not correspond to the largest w s c s h s or t p the influence of the peak wave period can be clearly seen from fig 18 and table 9 the joint variables with a period of approximately 10 s can cause a critical tension response even though the corresponding values of other environmental variables are smaller than some points on the surface another important point is that the characteristic extreme tension values determined by the various models with independent or dependent design sea states are different considering the dependency of the environmental variables a difference of approximately 211 2 can be observed between the maximum and minimum values for the design levels this is owing to the dependent 100 yr wave period adopted in conventional standards the wave peak especially close to the structural natural period has a significant effect on the dynamic response a specific investigation of extreme tension distribution parameters and wave data h s t p was conducted by zhao and dong 2020 in addition the design levels obtained from the gev model are much lower than the true values to provide an efficient and accurate approach for estimating short term extreme tension responses it is critical to determine the environmental conditions for floating structures whose dynamic characteristics are closely related to the wave period as illustrated in the previous section the ec method is utilised to identify design sea states and the corresponding tension response then a design mooring tension based on the design sea states can be estimated using the various models the design levels obtained from various models are listed in table 10 the design mooring response obtained from global maxima method can be used as a benchmark the simulated mooring tension responses with various random seeds are different and the prediction error using the pot method was investigated as shown in fig 19 it is observed that the prediction errors from using the pot method with various seeds follow a normal distribution 4 5 long term extreme tension analysis the most precise approach for predicting a long term extreme response is simply known as the full sea state approach wherein each sea condition is regarded as a stochastic process and the corresponding short term extreme response is obtained by performing nonlinear time domain numerical simulations of the coupled floating system for 2d environmental conditions such as h s t p a discrete approach combined with a parametric model for the short term extreme distribution parameters and wave data can solve the long term extreme response perfectly with high efficiency zhao and dong 2020 however for 3d environmental conditions such as h s t p w s and h s t p c s the construction of a parametric model for the short term extreme distribution parameters and wave data with a precise meshing grid is computationally expensive thus the simplified approach adopted by van zutphen and christou 2009 and stanisic et al 2018 is employed to estimate the long term extreme levels in this study notably however the high performance of this algorithm comes at the expense of accuracy considering that the dynamic tension response is highly sensitive to the wave peak period the dependency of environmental variables is involved in the long term extreme response analysis the critical joint sea states for return periods of 10 yr 100 yr and 1000 yr as determined using the ec approach are listed in tables 9 and 11 the design tension responses obtained from the global maxima method are adopted as benchmarks as listed in table 12 to provide an efficient assessment based on a single tension series the pot method is utilised and the design levels are presented in table 12 considering the randomness in simulating environmental conditions the prediction errors with random seeds are calculated and listed in table 13 it is observed that the prediction errors vary with the design sea states and increase from 10 yr to 1000 yr when considering winds and currents a larger prediction error could arise from a single tension response assessment as the full sea state approach is too time consuming to evaluate a long term extreme tension response a simplified approach is developed based on the return levels for the 10 100 and 1000 yr design sea states the critical environmental conditions can be identified using the ec approach as described in previous section then the simple pot method is utilised to estimate the design tension response from a single hydrodynamic analysis in which the critical sea states are used as input a long term tension response intensity can be approximately fitted using those return levels as discussed above the gumbel distribution is simple and convenient for short term extreme response predictions however there will be evident short term variabilities owing to the simulation of random environmental conditions the short term variability can be described by a normal distribution the return levels for various environmental combinations and different design values are calculated as tglob10 tpot10 tglob100 tpot100 and tglob1000 tpot1000 the long term tension response distribution can be fitted as follows 43 p 1 t e n t a exp b t a exp b 1 t t g l o b 10 44 p 2 t e n t p exp q t p exp q 1 t t p o t 10 exponential functions are utilised to fit those discrete points and the fitting curves are presented in fig 20 short term variability exists in the pot method owing to the randomness of the numerical simulations thus the long term extreme response considering the short term variability can be calculated as follows 45 p t e n t 0 1 p

mooring line tension response and can be fitted by a normal format as follows 46 p t t g l o b i 1 2 π σ 0 t t g l o b i e t μ 2 2 σ 2 d t the variability increases with the return period thus the mean value and standard deviation are calculated based on a linear interpolation procedure the long term distributions of the mooring line response are presented in fig 21 the design loads considering variabilities show different trends in various conditions wave wind and wave current and wave first short term variabilities existing in the pot method for three cases are different additionally the randomness in wave simulations jonswap spectrum is greater than wind and current loads which are represented using constant speed values actually there are significant variabilities in dynamic response simulation considering random seeds with different design conditions the results including variability is unstable which only shows that there is significant difference between the method using pot based peak values and considering random seeds of dynamic response in this study the results for long term extreme tension obtained from the simplified approach are compared with the full sea state approach which provides exact results a discrete scheme based on monte carlo simulation is utilised to solve the full integration vázquez hernández et al 2011 zhao and dong 2020 47 f x l e x r n f x s s e x s f s s d s k 1 n u f x s s e x s k f s s k where f s s is the joint probability density function pdf of n dimensional environmental variables vector s s 1 s 2 s n t f x s s e x s represents the short term extreme response conditional on a specific environmental condition s which is usually assumed spectrally constant s k is the discrete sample of random environmental variables that follow the joint pdf f s s f x s s e x s k is the cumulative conditional distribution of the extreme response given the short term environmental condition s s k f s s k represents the probability

full long term analysis for wave conditions there is an obvious trend of extreme response distribution parameters with h s and t p a limit set of discretized representative wave data combinations with intervals δ h s δ t p are selected usually n s1 n s2 numerical simulations of the coupled dynamical system are required performing the gumbel distribution is adopted to describe the short term extreme tensions the investigation of the relation between short term distribution parameters δ ρ and wave variables is performed using a discrete grid mapping which is composed by a mesh of n r 153 points after 153 3 h nonlinear time domain dynamic analyses of the floating structure system and statistical analysis of tension response the fitting results for distribution parameters and wave related variables are shown in fig 22 the parameters of conditional peak response distribution for any individual wave condition can be evaluated using a linear interpolation function for wave wind and current combinations a huge number of 3d environmental meshing are employed n s1 n s2 n s3 numerical simulations should be performed to compute response parameters to overcome expensive computation the artificial neural network ann is utilised to simulate complex nonlinear or implicit functions for any inputs based on the established database the ann are trained to learn the underivable relationship between the input and output data the results obtained from full sea state based approach are presented in fig 21 the full sea state model could yield maximum design loads compared to simplified models the results indicate that the contribution of all short term conditions is significant for predicting the design level for floating structures however the full long term analysis is computationally expensive in practical situations the simplified approach can be adopted as an alternative with underestimated design loads 5 conclusions the sea states corresponding to 10 100 and 1000 yr return periods were estimated using independent and ec approaches respectively ansys aqwa software was utilised to simulate the dynamic response of a semi submersible system as resulting from each design sea state this study focused on the extreme tension in the mooring cables various models were utilised to estimate the characteristic extreme response the global maxima pot ec and acer approaches were adopted to estimate the extreme tension from a 3 h coupled time domain simulation in the case of the pot approach the individual top peaks from a single time domain simulation were extracted in addition the gumbel gpd and gev models were adopted and their prediction errors on the response were studied the extreme response was found to be associated with various sea state combinations e g h s t p h s t p w s and h s t p c s the hydrodynamic response of the floating structure was sensitive to the wave period which would cause a higher structural response near the natural frequency the larger individual wave period obtained from the independent approach yielded much smaller design levels than those estimated using the ec approach thus it was suggested to identify the critical sea states using the ec approach considering the dependency of environmental variables and dynamic properties of floating structures as depicted in fig 22 the wave height current velocity and wind speed associated with a wave period of approximately 10 s corresponding to a given joint return period causing a critical structural response were determined as the design sea states significant differences were observed from these two approaches and the maximum and minimum values for the design levels differed several times the global maxima tension from 150 3 h time series was extracted and the weibull distribution model was adopted to fit the data design values with expensive computational costs were used as benchmarks the pot based design levels were convenient to estimate from a single time series response under the given sea states although the results could be less accurate as the random seeds of the environmental simulation were not considered thus the prediction error was studied and was found to follow a normal distribution in the pot based process the effect of the distribution models and threshold was included and was compared to the benchmark determined by the global maxima method a prediction error analysis was conducted for the different percentiles of the top peaks the mean value of the prediction error decreased with a lower percentile of individual top peaks but the prediction results were more dispersed it was observed that the top 20 30 of peaks were optimal for extreme response estimations with small statistical errors and high stability and that a gumbel distribution model fit better than the gpd and gev models for the tailing data in addition the effect of the threshold on the acer method was investigated relatively small differences were found and the effect of threshold in this model was negligible a 3d ec surface was constructed based on the nataf transformation and provided a good estimation of extreme mooring tension a simplified approach based on 10 100 and 1000 yr pot based design levels was utilised to approximate the long term extreme response the results emphasised the variability of the pot based return levels in the design sea states when considering the random seeds therefore the long term extreme tension was obtained by considering the variabilities in a short term analysis based on the pot method as expected a higher extreme response was yielded accounting for the short term variability those abovementioned approaches are generally used to estimate design loads within a larger engineering design workflow however many design responses exist and they are typically specific to the floater type and water depths for example one could focus the maximum offset of a floating platform tower bending moment of an offshore wind turbine or mooring loads in a floating structure it will largely come back to the wave period and vessel natural periods the design loads estimation for different floater type in different water depths requires determining the dynamic response of floating structure which will lead to a high computational cost as it is derived from complex finite element time domain simulation tools surrogate models could approximate the behaviour of complex systems with cheap computations for full long term analysis in future study credit authorship

wise in the oxy plane of the global coordinate system as shown in fig 1 2 2 three dimensional potential theory the fluid is assumed to be inviscid continuous and incompressible the flow can be considered as irrotational flow so the potential theory can be used to calculate the interaction of surface gravity waves with the pontoons faltinsen 1995 in this linear theory analysis the amplitude of the surface wave is small and the pontoon is undergoing small oscillations besides the pontoon is assumed as a rigid body with six dofs under these assumptions the velocity potential φ x y z t can

denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex variable respectively variations in the wetted hull surface due to severe sea waves and or large amplitude motions may contribute significantly to nonlinear hydrodynamic loads nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov wave forces over the instantaneous wetted surface should be calculated from the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic model and the integral area of equation 8 will be changed from s 0 m to s m which is the instantaneous wetted surface of m th floating structure ansys 2014 however the diffraction and radiation components are the comparable

kinematics current velocity and floater velocity the viscous force per unit length is given by 15 d f c t 1 2 ρ d t c d u w u c u s u w u c u s where d t is the characteristic width of the floating pontoon at time t u w is the wave particle velocity vector u c is the current particle velocity vector u s is the local body velocity vector c d is the quadratic drag coefficient vector and the drag

integrating the viscous force per unit length d f c t along the longitudinal direction of the pontoon 2 4 vehicle loads each axle load of the vehicle is loaded on the pontoon in the form of concentrated force as shown in fig 1 the friction between the wheels and the bridge deck is not taken into account in this paper so there are three components of the vehicle loads f v for each pontoon of the floating bridge which are vertical force f v z the moment about the oy axis f v m y and the moment about the ox axis f v m x the vehicle loads can be expressed as 16 f v z i 1 n m i g 17 f v m y i 1 n m i l i t 18 f v m x j 1 p m j d v j where m i is the i th axle load of the vehicle l i t is the distance of the i th axle load from the center of gravity of pontoon at time t which is determined by the time and the vehicle velocity and the positive value is taken in the front side of the center of gravity and the negative value is taken in the backside of the center of gravity m j is the j th eccentric axle load d v j is the eccentric distance of the j th eccentric axle load and it takes a negative value on the port side of the bridge and a positive value on the starboard side if the vehicle is not eccentric through the floating bridge the eccentric distance d v j becomes zero 2 5 mooring forces the mooring system is important for the floating bridge so that the coupled analysis between the pontoon motions and the mooring forces is necessary the most commonly used types for the mooring system of floating structures are flexible moorings in this paper the mooring system is used to prevent pontoons drifting away so the wire ropes are modeled as elastic lines the pontoon motions and mooring forces are calculated simultaneously at each time step one end of the line is attached to the attachment point on the floating pontoon and the other is fixed at the anchor point which is set on the still water surface therefore the mooring forces can be calculated by 19 t k m l l 0 if l l 0 0 if l l 0 where t is the tension force k m is the stiffness of mooring line l 0 is the unstretched suspended length of the chain l is the stretched length of the mooring line at time t the forces and moments with respect of the centre of gravity due to the mooring forces at the attachment point are given by 20 f m i t a t f a where f m is the forces and moments at the center of gravity f a is the force at the attachment point i is the unit matrix t a t is the transpose matrix of coordinate transformation matrix t a of the line 21 t a 0 z m z g y m y g z m z g 0 x m x g y m y g x m x g 0 where x m y m z m is the coordinate of the attachment point of the mooring line x g y g z g is the coordinate of the gravity point of the pontoon 2 6 motion equations in order to consider the coupling effects between floating pontoons and the external forces the time domain coupled analyses are fulfilled in waves the motion equation in the time domain can be given as 22 m a x t f w t f b t f m t f c t f v t 0 t h t τ x τ d τ 23 h t 2 π 0 b ω sin ω t ω d ω 2 π 0 a ω a cos ω t d ω where m is the structural mass matrix a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency f w t is the wave exciting force vector including the nonlinear froude krylov forces and the diffraction forces f b t is the hydrostatic force vector which can be calculated by integrating the hydrostatic pressure over the instantaneous wetted surface of the pontoon x t is the structure acceleration response vector h t is the acceleration convolution integral function matrix if the initial conditions are given the motions and the forces can be calculated by the above equations in each time step the above second order differential equations of motion in the time domain can be solved by various numerical integration methods and a 2 stage predictor corrector algorithm is used in the present work 3 numerical results and validations 3 1 numerical model description in the present paper the floating bridge consists of 15 bridge pontoons and the parameters of a single pontoon are listed in table 1 fu and cui 2012 the numerical model of the floating bridge is built by using of the ansys aqwa and the numerical simulation model is shown in fig 2 the pontoons are simulated as rigid bodies and marked as pn n 1 15 the connectors between modules are modeled as hinges and fenders as shown in fig 3 in order to simulate the connection type of pontoon and river bank or other neighboring structures the virtual river banks are set up by using of the pmas element which is 10000 kg in the numerical simulation two ends of the floating bridge are hinged to the virtual river banks as shown in fig 4 regarding the hydrodynamic modeling the pontoons were considered as large volume structures and their hydrodynamic coefficients such as the added mass the radiation damping and the wave excitation forces were estimated based on the potential flow theory by using of aqwa line in the frequency domain and the hydrodynamic interaction effects between pontoons were considered while calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients the dynamic motions of the floating bridge under moving loads were calculated in the time domain by using of the aqwa naut in which nonlinear froude krylov and hydrostatic forces were estimated over the instantaneous incident wave surface the hydrodynamic interaction effects and the connectors mechanical coupling effects among pontoons have been taken into consideration in the time domain analysis the moving loads at each time step were imported by an external forces data file which was calculated in advance by matlab codes the convolution technique was applied to estimate the radiation forces based on added mass and radiation damping in the time domain when the dynamic motions of the floating bridge are calculated under irregular waves in addition in order to calculate the viscous forces of the pontoons stub elements were built in the numerical simulation the length of the stub element is 6 7 m and the cross section is 7 m 0 75 m the floating bridge is moored by the mooring lines to prevent it from drifting away in the time domain and the stiffness of the lines is 4 0 105 n m the attachment point of the mooring line is located on the cross section of the pontoon and the other end of the mooring line is fixed at the anchor point which is set on the still water surface and the mooring radius is 20 m in the horizontal projection distance of the mooring line the water depth is 50 m in the numerical simulations 3 2 numerical results and validations the numerical method was verified by comparing it with both fu and cui s numerical results and the modeling results from an existing model fu and cui 2012 the moving load was simulated as a 4 5 m long 50000 kg two axle vehicle and both axle loads are the same in order to simulate the vehicle load more accurately the small time step 0 05 s is selected in this numerical simulation figs 5 7 compare the deformations of the floating bridge with static loads of the present method and test results and the results calculated by fu and cui 2012 where the horizontal and vertical axes denote the pontoon number and the corresponding vertical displacement of joint position between two neighboring pontoons respectively both comparisons show acceptable agreement for most cases from these figures it is known that the vehicle load has influences on both the loaded pontoon and the neighboring pontoons and the pontoons that are one pontoon away from the loaded pontoon are affected by the vehicle loads the effects on the pontoons far away from the loaded pontoon could be neglected time histories of the vertical displacement of the pontoon 6 of the floating bridge subjected to moving loads under different speeds are presented in fig 8 from these figures it can be found that the present numerical simulated results agree with the test results especially the trends of present results agree well with the measured data in the time domain under different vehicle speeds however there are some discrepancies of downward maximum dynamic displacements between the present results and the measured results under the speed of 3 m s and 6 m s because the connectors in the numerical calculation models are the ideal hinge but the pin and keyholes of the test model have manufacturing errors there are also differences between the present results and the results from fu and cui 2012 because the pontoon in the present method is considered as the rigid module while the elastic deformation is taken into account in fu and cui 2012 from the above analysis it can be seen that the present method can predict the dynamic deformations of the floating bridge under the static loads and single moving vehicle compared with the model tests and hydroelastic analysis the present numerical simulation method is more time saving besides the dynamic deformation of the floating bridge under the motorcade loads in different environmental conditions can be calculated by the present numerical simulation method 4 results and discussion 4 1 load cases and environmental conditions let us consider now the floating bridge composed of 15 pontoons subjected to the moving motorcades each vehicle of the motorcade is a 4 5 m long 50000 kg two axle vehicle and the speed of each vehicle is the same in this study the motorcade has a sufficient number of vehicles and there will be vehicles passing through the floating bridge until the end of numerical simulation the schematic diagram of the motorcade loading passage is shown in fig 9 in this figure d a is the wheelbase which is equal to 4 5 m and d is the distance between the neighboring vehicles vehicles travel at a constant speed v along the centerline of the floating bridge each axle load is half of the vehicle s weight and the axle load is considered as concentrated force based on section 2 4 based on the above numerical simulation model we will study the bridge s motion during the time of moving loads passage for different speeds v and different distance d between the neighboring vehicles see table 2 for the loads cases considered in addition the influences of the waves and currents on the bridge s motion are also studied in detail the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum was used to generate the irregular waves in the numerical calculation and the uniform current is applied in the numerical calculation the function of jonswap is shown below 24 s ω α g 2 γ a ω 5 exp 5 ω p 4 4 ω 4 25 a exp ω ω

this study because the measured data shows that the non dimensional peak shape parameter of the sea area where the floating bridge is arranged is about 2 0 ω is wave frequency h s is the significant wave height which is defined as the average height trough to crest of the highest one third waves in the indicated time period the jonswap spectrum is expected to be a reasonable model for 27 3 6 t p h s 5 where t p is spectral peak period and t p 2 π ω p in order to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the pontoons under the combined action of environmental loads and moving loads the varying wave spectrum wave directions current velocities and moving loads are defined and shown in table 3 three representative wave spectra of the wave conditions used in this study are demonstrated in fig 10 where t p 3 6 h s 5 h s 2 the current direction is the same as the wave direction if the no was filled in table 3 it means there is no motorcade on the floating bridge otherwise there will be a moving motorcade passing through the floating bridge the vehicle speed of the motorcade is 6 m s and the distance between neighboring vehicles is 60 m whereas the vehicle weight is varied from 1 0 104 kg to 5 0 104 kg 4 2 effect of vehicle speed and distance between neighboring vehicles on the dynamic motions fig 11 presents time histories of the vertical displacement of pontoon 3 pontoon 6 and pontoon 9 of the floating bridge under moving motorcade in which the speed of the vehicle is 6 m s and the distance d is 10 m 20 m 40 m and 60 m fig 12 presents the maximum and minimum vertical displacements of pontoons under different distances between two neighboring vehicles with a speed of 6 m s the values of the first pontoon and the last pontoon are not shown in fig 12 due to these two pontoons are linked with the virtual banks from figs 11 and 12 it is found that the upward response of pontoon is more sensitive to d compared with the downward response the upward responses at d 10 m and d 20 m are obviously smaller than that at d 40 m and d 60 m because the pontoons would be subject to heavy moving axle loads when the distance between vehicles becomes smaller which is equal to the static loads staying on the floating bridge the pontoon is too late to return to the equilibrium position due to that the time between the two neighboring vehicles acting the pontoon is short moreover it is known that the upward vertical displacement at d 40 m is almost equal to that at d 60 m and the downward vertical displacement also has similar characteristics besides it is found that the first downward response at different distances is same because there is only one vehicle on the floating bridge at the beginning as time elapses there are more vehicles on the floating bridge and the effect of distance on the dynamic motions begins to show up so the distance between neighboring vehicles is preferably bigger than 20 m if conditions permit the distance between vehicles should be maintained at 40 60 m fig 13 presents time histories of the vertical displacements of different pontoons under moving motorcade in which the speeds of the vehicle are 3 m s 6 m s and 9 m s respectively and the distance d is 60 m from these figures the upward responses of pontoon 6 and pontoon 9 increase with increasing vehicle speed the tendency of the upward response of pontoon 3 with the vehicle speed is not very significant as that of pontoon 6 and pontoon 9 because pontoon 3 is near the end of the floating bridge and the end pontoon has an influence on the vertical displacement of pontoon 3 fig 14 fig 15 and fig 16 present the maximum and minimum vertical displacements of pontoons under different vehicle speeds with d 20 m d 40 m and d 60 m respectively from these figures it is found that vehicle speed can influence the maximum and minimum values of vertical displacement of pontoons with a distance between neighboring vehicles and the maximum vertical displacement increases with increasing vehicle speed at d 40 m and d 60 m because the effect of displacement wave accumulation will become stronger with the increase of vehicle speed the maximum vertical displacement of most pontoons pontoon 7 13 at a vehicle speed of 9 m s is about two times bigger than that at a vehicle speed of 3 m s at d 40 m and d 60 m but the minimum vertical displacement at a vehicle speed of 6 m s is smaller than that at vehicle speeds of 3 m s and 9 m s 4 3 environmental parameter analysis in the following section the effects of significant wave height wave direction and current velocity on the dynamic motions of pontoons will be analyzed besides the effects of vehicle weight on the vertical displacement of pontoons under the wave and current condition will be investigated the load cases b1 b6 are shown in table 3 which will be used to investigate the dynamic properties of pontoons under environmental loads without moving loads meanwhile the dynamic responses of the floating bridge will be investigated under the wave current and moving motorcade from load cases shown as b7 b14 in table 3 the statistical values presented herein are based on the average of 10 seeds for a wave spectrum for each load case shown as b1 b14 in table 3 the simulation duration of each load case is half an hour and the time step is 0 05 s fig 17 presents the time histories of the vertical displacements of pontoon 6 under different load cases b1 b4 in which the significant wave height is the same and the current velocity varies from 0 5 m s to 1 5 m s under the same wave condition and the maximum and minimum vertical displacements for each pontoon under these load cases are shown in fig 19 from figs 17 and 19 it is found that the current velocity has little influence on the vertical displacements of pontoons when the current is parallel to the floating bridge because the draft of the pontoon is very small the forces reduced by current velocity are also small from fig 19 it is also found that the maximum value of vertical displacement is bigger than the amplitude of the minimum fig 18 presents the time histories of vertical displacements of pontoon 6 under different significant wave heights from 0 5 m to 1 5 m with the same current velocity 1 0 m s fig 18 shows that vertical displacement becomes bigger with the increase of significant wave height theoretically the power is proportional to the square of the wave height a feature also reflected in the wave spectrum of fig 10 fig 19 shows that the maximum and minimum vertical displacements of the pontoons under different wave conditions which indicates that the vertical displacements of pontoons are more sensitive to the wave heights than the current velocities the maximum vertical displacement of pontoons is about 0 5 m when the hs 1 0 m and the maximum vertical displacements of pontoons are about 0 7 1 2 m when the hs 1 5 m because the freeboard of the pontoon is about 0 55 m when the vertical displacement exceeds 0 5 m the pontoon may be waved and unfavorable to the vehicle passing through the bridge it is not recommended for motorcades passing through the floating bridge when the significant wave height is bigger than 1 0 m to study the effects of different load combinations on the dynamic motions of pontoons the time histories of vertical displacements of pontoon 6 are compared under several different load cases b1 b3 and b7 as plotted in fig 20 it is found that the troughs of vertical displacement of the pontoon become smaller while the moving loads were added however the peaks of vertical displacement become bigger while the combined loads of environmental loads and moving loads are placed on the floating bridge the maximum exciting force on pontoon 6 due to wave current and moving motorcade is about 6 0 104 n 9 0 104 n and 9 81 104 n respectively it is indicated that the vertical displacement of the pontoon is mainly determined by the moving loads although the moving loads are only 10 tons which is 3 tons heavier than the single pontoon mass fig 21 shows the maximum and minimum vertical displacements of pontoons subjected by the wave current and moving motorcade with different vehicle weights varied from 1 104 kg to 5 104 kg i e cases b7 b11 the results show that the vertical displacement is sensitive to the vehicle weight and the minimum vertical displacement of the pontoon is proportional to vehicle weight fig 22 presents the time histories of the vertical displacement of pontoon 6 when the wave direction is varied from 0 deg to 90 deg i e cases b11 b14 fig 23 shows the maximum and minimum vertical displacements of different pontoons due to the variation of wave direction from fig 22 it is found that the peaks and troughs change with the wave direction but the tendency of the time history of vertical displacement is the same under different wave directions this is due to the fact that the vertical displacement of the floating bridge is mainly determined by the vehicle loads fig 23 indicates that the minimum vertical displacement of most pontoons is bigger under load case b13 with β 60 than other load cases and the maximum vertical displacement of most pontoons is bigger under load case b14 with β 90 than other load cases 5 conclusions a numerical simulation method for calculating the dynamic responses of a floating bridge consisting of pontoons subjected to environmental loads and moving loads is presented in this paper the numerical results were verified by the model tests the sensitivity studies of moving loads and environmental loads were carried out the main conclusions from the study can be drawn as follows 1 the approach proposed in this study can faithfully predict the motions of pontoons under moving loads further this method can be used to simulate the dynamic responses of a floating bridge under combinations of environmental loads and moving motorcades 2 as the pontoon of the floating bridge cannot return to the equilibrium position immediately when the distance between vehicles is too small and the vehicle should maintain a proper distance it is recommended to maintain a distance of more than 40 m for 50 ton vehicles 3 the maximum vertical displacement increases with increasing vehicle speeds at d 40 m and d 60 m and the maximum vertical displacement of most pontoons at a vehicle speed of 9 m s is about two times bigger than that at 3 m s under the action of the moving load 4 the magnitude of vertical motion of the pontoons increases with the increase of significant wave heights on the other hand the current velocity has little influence it is suggested that the vehicle cannot pass through the floating bridge when the significant wave height is bigger than 1 0 m 5 the vertical displacement of the floating bridge is significantly affected by the moving loads which is proportional to the vehicle weight at the same time the wave loads influence the upwards of the dynamic responses when the floating bridge is subjected to the environmental loads and moving loads the vertical displacement of the floating bridge becomes bigger under the oblique wave credit

infinite fluid subjected to impulsive and moving loads had been proposed by qiu 2007 most of the above studies focus on the effects of moving loads or environmental loads on the floating bridge motion responses but little attention was paid to the combined effect of environment al loads and moving loads on the hydrodynamic performances of the floating bridges in the present paper a numerical

the numerical model is introduced and the vertical displacements of the floating bridge calculated by the numerical simulation method are verified by the measured data next the dynamic properties of the floating bridge induced by environmental loads and motorcade are investigated by the above numerical method finally several conclusions are presented 2 theory and numerical methods 2 1 coordinate systems in order to simplify the expression coordinate systems are introduced as shown in fig 1 one is the global coordinate system o xyz with the origin located at the mean free surface of the fluid the x y and z axis are positive and point to the bow port and upwards the local coordinate system o m x m y m z m is fixed on the m th floating body relative to the mean position with the origin located at the center of gravity cog of m th floating body the axes of the local coordinate system of the floating pontoon are parallel to the axes of the global coordinate system at the initial time respectively the pontoons are assumed as rigid bodies the six degrees of freedom dof of each pontoon are named surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw respectively each axle load of the vehicle acting on the floating bridge is simplified as a concentrated load m i as shown in fig 1 the wave direction is defined as the angle between the wave propagating direction and the positive x axis measured clock wise in the oxy plane of the global coordinate system as shown in fig 1 2 2 three dimensional potential theory the fluid is assumed to be inviscid continuous and incompressible the flow can be considered as irrotational flow so the potential theory can be used to calculate the interaction of surface gravity waves with the pontoons faltinsen 1995 in this linear theory analysis the amplitude of the surface wave is small and the pontoon is undergoing small oscillations besides the pontoon is assumed as a rigid body with six dofs under these assumptions the velocity potential φ x y z t can be separated into three parts 1 φ x y z t ϕ x y z e i ω t ϕ i ϕ d m 1 m j 1 6 ϕ r j m x j m e i ω t where ϕ x y z is the space potential of the velocity potential φ x y z t ϕ i x y z and ϕ d x y z are

gravitational acceleration α is wave phase k is the wave number which is related to the angular frequency ω through the dispersion relation 3 ω 2 g k tanh k d the diffraction wave potential ϕ d x y z should satisfy the governing equation and the boundary conditions and it will be expressed in terms of pulsating sources distributed over the mean wetted surface of the floating structures on the basis of green s theorem for a multi body system the boundary value problem bvp for radiation potential ϕ r j m x y z should satisfy the following equations 4 l 2 ϕ r j m 0 s f ω 2 ϕ r j m g ϕ r j m z

m th floating body surface the radiation wave potential could be solved by the direct boundary element method 2 3 environmental loads after the velocity potential φ x y z t is obtained the first order hydrodynamic pressure distribution can be calculated by using the linearized bernoulli s equation 5 p 1 ρ φ x y z t t the first order hydrodynamic force and moment components can be expressed in a generalized form 6 f j m e i ω t s 0 m p 1 n j m d s i ω ρ s 0 m ϕ n j m d s e i ω t where n j m is the j th component of the unit normal vector of the m th body surface pointing outwards the surface

10 f r j l m ω 2 a j l m n i ω b j l m n i ρ ω s 0 m ϕ r l n n j m d s where the superscripts m and n correspond to the m th and n th floating body and the subscripts j and l are the motion modes f i j is the j th mode froude krylov force due to incident wave f d j is the j th mode diffracting force f r j l is j th mode radiation force due to l th mode motion of unit amplitude the real and imaginary parts in equation 10 are called added mass and radiation damping coefficients and they can be expressed as 11 a j l ρ ω s 0 im φ r l n j d s 12 b j l ρ s 0 re φ r l n j d s here re and im denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex variable respectively variations in the wetted hull surface due to severe sea waves and or large amplitude motions may contribute significantly to nonlinear hydrodynamic loads nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov wave forces over the instantaneous wetted surface should be calculated from the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic model and the integral area of equation 8 will be changed from s 0 m to s m which is the instantaneous wetted surface of m th floating structure ansys 2014 however the diffraction and radiation components are the comparable magnitude and are simplified as linear quantities the diffraction force in short crest waves contributed by all the diffracting panels is 13 f d m t e t p 1 n d j 1 n p a j p f d m ω j p β p e i k j p

increment 14 a j p 2 s ω j δ ω j the current forces on the pontoons are incorporated through morison s equation by considering only the quadratic viscous drag term they are caused by the wave kinematics current velocity and floater velocity the viscous force per unit length is given by 15 d f c t 1 2 ρ d t c d u w u c u s u w u c u s where d t is the characteristic width of the floating pontoon at time t u w is the wave particle velocity vector u c is the current particle velocity vector u s is the local body velocity vector c d is the quadratic drag coefficient vector and the drag coefficient used in this study is c d x 1 c d y 0 4 c d z 4 8 dnv gl 2014 and the corresponding coordinate system is shown in fig 1 the resistance force of the pontoon f c t can be calculated by integrating the viscous force per unit length d f c t along the longitudinal direction of the pontoon 2 4 vehicle loads each axle load of the vehicle is loaded on the pontoon in the form of concentrated force as shown in fig 1 the friction between the wheels and the bridge deck is not taken into account in this paper so there are three components of the vehicle loads f v for each pontoon of the floating bridge which are vertical force f v z the moment about the oy axis f v m y and the moment about the ox axis f v m x the vehicle loads can be expressed as 16 f v z i 1 n m i g 17 f v m y i 1 n m i l i t 18 f v m x j 1 p m j d v j where m i is the i th axle load of the vehicle l i t is the distance of the i th axle load from the center of gravity of pontoon at time t which is determined by the time and the vehicle velocity and the positive value is taken in the front side of the center of gravity and the negative value is taken in the backside of the center of gravity m j is the j th eccentric axle load d v j is the eccentric distance of the j th eccentric axle load and it takes a negative value on the port side of the bridge and a positive value on the starboard side if the vehicle is not eccentric through the floating bridge the eccentric distance d v j becomes zero 2 5 mooring forces the mooring system is important for the floating bridge so that the coupled analysis between the pontoon motions and the mooring forces is necessary the most commonly used types for the mooring system of floating structures are flexible moorings in this paper the mooring system is used to prevent pontoons drifting away so the wire ropes are modeled as elastic lines the pontoon motions and mooring forces are calculated simultaneously at each time step one end of the line is attached to the attachment point on the floating pontoon and the other is fixed at the anchor point which is set on the still water surface therefore the mooring forces can be calculated by 19 t k m l l 0 if l l 0 0 if l l 0 where t is the tension force k m is the stiffness of mooring line l 0 is the unstretched suspended length of the chain l is the stretched length of the mooring line at time t the forces and moments with respect of the centre of gravity due to the mooring forces at the attachment point are given by 20 f m i t a t f a where f m is the forces and moments at the center of gravity f a is the force at the attachment point i is the unit matrix t a t is the transpose matrix of coordinate transformation matrix t a of the line 21 t a 0 z m z g y m y g z m z g 0 x m x g y m y g x m x g 0 where x m y m z m is the coordinate of the attachment point of the mooring line x g y g z g is the coordinate of the gravity point of the pontoon 2 6 motion equations in order to consider the coupling effects between floating pontoons and the external forces the time domain coupled analyses are fulfilled in waves the motion equation in the time domain can be given as 22 m a x t f w t f b t f m t f c t f v t 0 t h t τ x τ d τ 23 h t 2 π 0 b ω sin ω t ω d ω 2 π 0 a ω a cos ω t d ω where m is the structural mass matrix a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency f w t is the wave exciting force vector including the nonlinear froude krylov forces and the diffraction forces f b t is the hydrostatic force vector which can be calculated by integrating the hydrostatic pressure over the instantaneous wetted surface of the pontoon x t is the structure acceleration response vector h t is the acceleration convolution integral function matrix if the initial conditions are given the motions and the forces can be calculated by the above equations in each time step the above second order differential equations of motion in the time domain can be solved by various numerical integration methods and a 2 stage predictor corrector algorithm is used in the present work 3 numerical results and validations 3 1 numerical model description in the present paper the floating bridge consists of 15 bridge pontoons and the parameters of a single pontoon are listed in table 1 fu and cui 2012 the numerical model of the floating bridge is built by using of the ansys aqwa and the numerical simulation model is shown in fig 2 the pontoons are simulated as rigid bodies and marked as pn n 1 15 the connectors between modules are modeled as hinges and fenders as shown in fig 3 in order to simulate the connection type of pontoon and river bank or other neighboring structures the virtual river banks are set up by using of the pmas element which is 10000 kg in the numerical simulation two ends of the floating bridge are hinged to the virtual river banks as shown in fig 4 regarding the hydrodynamic modeling the pontoons were considered as large volume structures and their hydrodynamic coefficients such as the added mass the radiation damping and the wave excitation forces were estimated based on the potential flow theory by using of aqwa line in the frequency domain and the hydrodynamic interaction effects between pontoons were considered while calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients the dynamic motions of the floating bridge under moving loads were calculated in the time domain by using of the aqwa naut in which nonlinear froude krylov and hydrostatic forces were estimated over the instantaneous incident wave surface the hydrodynamic interaction effects and the connectors mechanical coupling effects among pontoons have been taken into consideration in the time domain analysis the moving loads at each time step were imported by an external forces data file which was calculated in advance by matlab codes the convolution technique was applied to estimate the radiation forces based on added mass and radiation damping in the time domain when the dynamic motions of the floating bridge are calculated under irregular waves in addition in order to calculate the viscous forces of the pontoons stub elements were built in the numerical simulation the length of the stub element is 6 7 m and the cross section is 7 m 0 75 m the floating bridge is moored by the mooring lines to prevent it from drifting away in the time domain and the stiffness of the lines is 4 0 105 n m the attachment point of the mooring line is located on the cross section of the pontoon and the other end of the mooring line is fixed at the anchor point which is set on the still water surface and the mooring radius is 20 m in the horizontal projection distance of the mooring line the water depth is 50 m in the numerical simulations 3 2 numerical results and validations the numerical method was verified by comparing it with both fu and cui s numerical results and the modeling results from an existing model fu and cui 2012 the moving load was simulated as a 4 5 m long 50000 kg two axle vehicle and both axle loads are the same in order to simulate the vehicle load more accurately the small time step 0 05 s is selected in this numerical simulation figs 5 7 compare the deformations of the floating bridge with static loads of the present method and test results and the results calculated by fu and cui 2012 where the horizontal and vertical axes denote the pontoon number and the corresponding vertical displacement of joint position between two neighboring pontoons respectively both comparisons show acceptable agreement for most cases from these figures it is known that the vehicle load has influences on both the loaded pontoon and the neighboring pontoons and the pontoons that are one pontoon away from the loaded pontoon are affected by the vehicle loads the effects on the pontoons far away from the loaded pontoon could be neglected time histories of the vertical displacement of the pontoon 6 of the floating bridge subjected to moving loads under different speeds are presented in fig 8 from these figures it can be found that the present numerical simulated results agree with the test results especially the trends of present results agree well with the measured data in the time domain under different vehicle speeds however there are some discrepancies of downward maximum dynamic displacements between the present results and the measured results under the speed of 3 m s and 6 m s because the connectors in the numerical calculation models are the ideal hinge but the pin and keyholes of the test model have manufacturing errors there are also differences between the present results and the results from fu and cui 2012 because the pontoon in the present method is considered as the rigid module while the elastic deformation is taken into account in fu and cui 2012 from the above analysis it can be seen that the present method can predict the dynamic deformations of the floating bridge under the static loads and single moving vehicle compared with the model tests and hydroelastic analysis the present numerical simulation method is more time saving besides the dynamic deformation of the floating bridge under the motorcade loads in different environmental conditions can be calculated by the present numerical simulation method 4 results and discussion 4 1 load cases and environmental conditions let us consider now the floating bridge composed of 15 pontoons subjected to the moving motorcades each vehicle of the motorcade is a 4 5 m long 50000 kg two axle vehicle and the speed of each vehicle is the same in this study the motorcade has a sufficient number of vehicles and there will be vehicles passing through the floating bridge until the end of numerical simulation the schematic diagram of the motorcade loading passage is shown in fig 9 in this figure d a is the wheelbase which is equal to 4 5 m and d is the distance between the neighboring vehicles vehicles travel at a constant speed v along the centerline of the floating bridge each axle load is half of the vehicle s weight and the axle load is considered as concentrated force based on section 2 4 based on the above numerical simulation model we will study the bridge s motion during the time of moving loads passage for different speeds v and different distance d between the neighboring vehicles see table 2 for the loads cases considered in addition the influences of the waves and currents on the bridge s motion are also studied in detail the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum was used to generate the irregular waves in the numerical calculation and the uniform current is applied in the numerical calculation the function of jonswap is shown below 24 s ω α g 2 γ a ω 5 exp 5 ω p 4 4 ω 4 25 a exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 σ 0 07 where ω ω p 0 09 where ω ω p 26 α h s 4 2 0 g 2 γ a ω 5 exp 5 ω p 4 4 ω 4 d ω where ω p is the spectral peak frequency γ is non dimensional peak shape parameter and γ 2 0 in this study because the measured data shows that the non dimensional peak shape parameter of the sea area where the floating bridge is arranged is about 2 0 ω is wave frequency h s is the significant wave height which is defined as the average height trough to crest of the highest one third waves in the indicated time period the jonswap spectrum is expected to be a reasonable model for 27 3 6 t p h s 5 where t p is spectral peak period and t p 2 π ω p in order to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the pontoons under the combined action of environmental loads and moving loads the varying wave spectrum wave directions current velocities and moving loads are defined and shown in table 3 three representative wave spectra of the wave conditions used in this study are demonstrated in fig 10 where t p 3 6 h s 5 h s 2 the current direction is the same as the wave direction if the no was filled in table 3 it means there is no motorcade on the floating bridge otherwise there will be a moving motorcade passing through the floating bridge the vehicle speed of the motorcade is 6 m s and the distance between neighboring vehicles is 60 m whereas the vehicle weight is varied from 1 0 104 kg to 5 0 104 kg 4 2 effect of vehicle speed and distance between neighboring vehicles on the dynamic motions fig 11 presents time histories of the vertical displacement of pontoon 3 pontoon 6 and pontoon 9 of the floating bridge under moving motorcade in which the speed of the vehicle is 6 m s and the distance d is 10 m 20 m 40 m and 60 m fig 12 presents the maximum and minimum vertical displacements of pontoons under different distances between two neighboring vehicles with a speed of 6 m s the values of the first pontoon and the last pontoon are not shown in fig 12 due to these two pontoons are linked with the virtual banks from figs 11 and 12 it is found that the upward response of pontoon is more sensitive to d compared with the downward response the upward responses at d 10 m and d 20 m are obviously smaller than that at d 40 m and d 60 m because the pontoons would be subject to heavy moving axle loads when the distance between vehicles becomes smaller which is equal to the static loads staying on the floating bridge the pontoon is too late to return to the equilibrium position due to that the time between the two neighboring vehicles acting the pontoon is short moreover it is known that the upward vertical displacement at d 40 m is almost equal to that at d 60 m and the downward vertical displacement also has similar characteristics besides it is found that the first downward response at different distances is same because there is only one vehicle on the floating bridge at the beginning as time elapses there are more vehicles on the floating bridge and the effect of distance on the dynamic motions begins to show up so the distance between neighboring vehicles is preferably bigger than 20 m if conditions permit the distance between vehicles should be maintained at 40 60 m fig 13 presents time histories of the vertical displacements of different pontoons under moving motorcade in which the speeds of the vehicle are 3 m s 6 m s and 9 m s respectively and the distance d is 60 m from these figures the upward responses of pontoon 6 and pontoon 9 increase with increasing vehicle speed the tendency of the upward response of pontoon 3 with the vehicle speed is not very significant as that of pontoon 6 and pontoon 9 because pontoon 3 is near the end of the floating bridge and the end pontoon has an influence on the vertical displacement of pontoon 3 fig 14 fig 15 and fig 16 present the maximum and minimum vertical displacements of pontoons under different vehicle speeds with d 20 m d 40 m and d 60 m respectively from these figures it is found that vehicle speed can influence the maximum and minimum values of vertical displacement of pontoons with a distance between neighboring vehicles and the maximum vertical displacement increases with increasing vehicle speed at d 40 m and d 60 m because the effect of displacement wave accumulation will become stronger with the increase of vehicle speed the maximum vertical displacement of most pontoons pontoon 7 13 at a vehicle speed of 9 m s is about two times bigger than that at a vehicle speed of 3 m s at d 40 m and d 60 m but the minimum vertical displacement at a vehicle speed of 6 m s is smaller than that at vehicle speeds of 3 m s and 9 m s 4 3 environmental parameter analysis in the following section the effects of significant wave height wave direction and current velocity on the dynamic motions of pontoons will be analyzed besides the effects of vehicle weight on the vertical displacement of pontoons under the wave and current condition will be investigated the load cases b1 b6 are shown in table 3 which will be used to investigate the dynamic properties of pontoons under environmental loads without moving loads meanwhile the dynamic responses of the floating bridge will be investigated under the wave current and moving motorcade from load cases shown as b7 b14 in table 3 the statistical values presented herein are based on the average of 10 seeds for a wave spectrum for each load case shown as b1 b14 in table 3 the simulation duration of each load case is half an hour and the time step is 0 05 s fig 17 presents the time histories of the vertical displacements of pontoon 6 under different load cases b1 b4 in which the significant wave height is the same and the current velocity varies from 0 5 m s to 1 5 m s under the same wave condition and the maximum and minimum vertical displacements for each pontoon under these load cases are shown in fig 19 from figs 17 and 19 it is found that the current velocity has little influence on the vertical displacements of pontoons when the current is parallel to the floating bridge because the draft of the pontoon is very small the forces reduced by current velocity are also small from fig 19 it is also found that the maximum value of vertical displacement is bigger than the amplitude of the minimum fig 18 presents the time histories of vertical displacements of pontoon 6 under different significant wave heights from 0 5 m to 1 5 m with the same current velocity 1 0 m s fig 18 shows that vertical displacement becomes bigger with the increase of significant wave height theoretically the power is proportional to the square of the wave height a feature also reflected in the wave spectrum of fig 10 fig 19 shows that the maximum and minimum vertical displacements of the pontoons under different wave conditions which indicates that the vertical displacements of pontoons are more sensitive to the wave heights than the current velocities the maximum vertical displacement of pontoons is about 0 5 m when the hs 1 0 m and the maximum vertical displacements of pontoons are about 0 7 1 2 m when the hs 1 5 m because the freeboard of the pontoon is about 0 55 m when the vertical displacement exceeds 0 5 m the pontoon may be waved and unfavorable to the vehicle passing through the bridge it is not recommended for motorcades passing through the floating bridge when the significant wave height is bigger than 1 0 m to study the effects of different load combinations on the dynamic motions of pontoons the time histories of vertical displacements of pontoon 6 are compared under several different load cases b1 b3 and b7 as plotted in fig 20 it is found that the troughs of vertical displacement of the pontoon become smaller while the moving loads were added however the peaks of vertical displacement become bigger while the combined loads of environmental loads and moving loads are placed on the floating bridge the maximum exciting force on pontoon 6 due to wave current and moving motorcade is about 6 0 104 n 9 0 104 n and 9 81 104 n respectively it is indicated that the vertical displacement of the pontoon is mainly determined by the moving loads although the moving loads are only 10 tons which is 3 tons heavier than the single pontoon mass fig 21 shows the maximum and minimum vertical displacements of pontoons subjected by the wave current and moving motorcade with different vehicle weights varied from 1 104 kg to 5 104 kg i e cases b7 b11 the results show that the vertical displacement is sensitive to the vehicle weight and the minimum vertical displacement of the pontoon is proportional to vehicle weight fig 22 presents the time histories of the vertical displacement of pontoon 6 when the wave direction is varied from 0 deg to 90 deg i e cases b11 b14 fig 23 shows the maximum and minimum vertical displacements of different pontoons due to the variation of wave direction from fig 22 it is found that the peaks and troughs change with the wave direction but the tendency of the time history of vertical displacement is the same under different wave directions this is due to the fact that the vertical displacement of the floating bridge is mainly determined by the vehicle loads fig 23 indicates that the minimum vertical displacement of most pontoons is bigger under load case b13 with β 60 than other load cases and the maximum vertical displacement of most pontoons is bigger under load case b14 with β 90 than other load cases 5 conclusions a numerical simulation method for calculating the dynamic responses of a floating bridge consisting of pontoons subjected to environmental loads and moving loads is presented in this paper the numerical results were verified by the model tests the sensitivity studies of moving loads and environmental loads were carried out the main conclusions from the study can be drawn as follows 1 the approach proposed in this study can faithfully predict the motions of pontoons under moving loads further this method can be used to simulate the dynamic responses of a floating bridge under combinations of environmental loads and moving motorcades 2 as the pontoon of the floating bridge cannot return to the equilibrium position immediately when the distance between vehicles is too small and the vehicle should maintain a proper distance it is recommended to maintain a distance of more than 40 m for 50 ton vehicles 3 the maximum vertical displacement increases with increasing vehicle speeds at d 40 m and d 60 m and the maximum vertical displacement of most pontoons at a vehicle speed of 9 m s is about two times bigger than that at 3 m s under the action of the moving load 4 the magnitude of vertical motion of the pontoons increases with the increase of significant wave heights on the other hand the current velocity has little influence it is suggested that the vehicle cannot pass through the floating bridge when the significant wave height is bigger than 1 0 m 5 the vertical displacement of the floating bridge is significantly affected by the moving loads which is proportional to the vehicle weight at the same time the wave loads influence the upwards of the dynamic responses when the floating bridge is subjected to the environmental loads and moving loads the vertical displacement of the floating bridge becomes bigger under the oblique wave credit

20957,the water exit course of a submerged vehicle launched underwater that moves into the atmosphere is one of the most important considerations in naval applications in the present work a large eddy simulation with a uniform filter of an octree based isotropic mesh and a high resolution interface capturing algorithm is employed to investigate this issue with a special emphasis on the flow structures and pressure features various launch parameters including the immersion depth navigation speed and angle of attack are discussed the flow structures sensitive to adverse pressure relevant to the water exit angle are captured and discussed the flow experiences a laminar turbulent transition and forms coherent turbulence structures which develop a series of primary and secondary hairpin vortices the distribution of pressure is more monotonic and regular on the pressure side of the vehicle as the angle increases while a propagation of disturbance and a transition to turbulence can occur across the lateral side based on the clearly captured evolution of the water surface and cavitation the cavity shedding induced by a pinch off effect of the travelling liquid vapor contact lines is found and investigated the structural features of turbulence are greatly affected in this case which contrasts with the noncavitating features the structures are tuned due to the existence of cavitation which blocks the hairpin vortex generation mechanism the cavity surface is full of tollmien schlichting wave like vortical structures caused by liquid vapor interface shearing hundreds of monitors are intensively arranged on the vehicle s surface to capture the transient pressure signals through which the crucial pressure features induced by the growth and collapse of the cavitation are captured keywords cavitation water exit large eddy simulation submerged vehicle 1 introduction the water exit course of a submerged vehicle launched underwater that moves into the atmosphere is one of the most important considerations in naval applications although modern axisymmetric vehicles are usually designed with streamlined head forms cavitation may also develop from a vehicle s shoulder as it approaches the sea surface at an adequately high speed cavitation interacts with the water surface during the water exit course with features distinct from conventional cavitation appearing in marine propulsion cavitation collapse can induce a violent impact on the vehicle surface and even damage its structure so it is important to explore water exit cavitating flows at a high degree of accuracy this issue has seldom been investigated or reported in the past due to the secrecy accompanying its military uses in recent decades cavitating flows of hydrofoils propellers and hydraulic machinery have been extensively studied including recent experimental observations and measurements arndt 2002 coutier delgosha et al 2007 gavaises et al 2015 ganesh et al 2016 xu et al 2017

cavitation involved in water exit issues one primary aspect is the sheet cloud cavitation transition and cavitation shedding involving the widely discussed re entrant jet mechanism le et al 1993 callenaere et al 2001 leroux et al 2004 de giorgi et al 2019 trummler et al 2020 and the later discovered shock wave mechanism schnerr et al 2008 makiharju et al 2013 ganesh et al 2016 2020 in many cases flow on the cavity surface can reflect oblique or curved cavity closure to form a re entrant jet inducing a noticeable three dimensional effect of cavitation shedding laberteaux and ceccio 2001

2013 peng et al 2016 arabnejad et al 2019 some researchers have addressed the interactions between cavitation and the turbulent boundary layer brandner et al 2010 croci et al 2019 as well as the influence of kelvin helmholtz instability on cavity break up and cloud formation dittakavi et al 2010 mithun et al 2018 many other aspects of cavitation regimes hydrodynamic loads and frequency features have also received previous examination cavitating flows around axisymmetric objects have also attracted some research interest more than half a century ago rouse and mcnown 1948 systematically measured pressure distributions on cavitated axisymmetric bodies with various head forms which has become a benchmark for numerical work in this area huang et al 2011 measured the cavitating flow pattern and dynamics of an ogive revolution body chen et al 2012 2015 investigated the cavity shape and dynamic behaviour of cavitation on axisymmetric vehicles under different navigation conditions wang et al 2016 studied cloud cavitating flow around an axisymmetric projectile near the surface of the water xu et al 2018 employed large eddy simulations les and cut cell meshes to analyse the near wall effects of cloud cavitating flow nevertheless the majority of cavitation work relevant to axisymmetric bodies in recent years has been dedicated to ventilated cavitation yu et al 2015 skidmore et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sun et al 2019 water exit issues without considering cavitation were generally treated using analytical methods with attention mainly given to hydrodynamic loads tassin et al 2013 rajavaheinthan and greenhow 2015 korobkin et al 2017 wu et al 2018 breton et al 2020 if cavitation is considered the resulting flow is so complicated that it s rarely reported liu et al 2003 calculated the water exit cavity and re entrant jet development using the marker and cell mac method quan et al 2008 discussed the mechanisms that guide high pressure generation by the collapse of a water exit cavity chu et al 2010 simulated the water exit of an air containing cavity and analysed its interactions with the water surface wang et

underwater vehicle to discuss the mechanism of hydrodynamic improvement that it offers to the vehicle ma et al 2019 also discussed the influence of uncertainty in the launch parameters in a cavity although some valuable results on water exit cavitation have been reported the details of turbulent flow structures remain hardly known experimental techniques are not yet able to identify complex vortical structures and high resolution numerical methods have a unique advantage over experiments in this regard les has become widely used to predict cavitating flows in recent years gavaises et al 2015 ji et al 2015 pendar and roohi 2016 bai et al 2018 long et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 2020 fang et al 2020 most of les work has been performed on anisotropic meshes whose cells cannot be considered a uniform box filter les is more effective on uniform filters of isotropic meshes particularly in near wall regions so that the turbulent flow structures that develop from the boundary layer can be well predicted in the present work a high resolution les with an octree based isotropic mesh is employed to investigate the cavitating flows in the water exit course of a submerged vehicle launched upward with an emphasis on its turbulence structures and pressure features this work is a follow up to the authors previous work chen et al 2020 where turbulence structures were not addressed the work was conducted using the commercial cfd software ansys fluent 14 0 2 mathematical models and numerical methods 2 1 les model of water exit multiphase flow the flow induced by the upward navigation of the vehicle is handled with a one fluid homogeneous multiphase flow model i e the fluid is a compressible mixture composed of the phases of liquid vapor and air no slip between the phases is considered i e any physical variable is assumed to be consistent for each phase component due to the high compressibility involved in the flow a compressible les model using the hybrid of regular filtering and density weighted favre filtering is employed i e the resolved part of a physical variable φ x t is filtered as follows 1 φ ρ φ ρ 1 ρ d ρ x φ x g x x d x where g x x is the filtering function and the bar over a quantity indicates the regular filtering operation the continuity equation is treated using favre filtering to avoid modelling sub filter scales 2 ρ t ρ u j x j 0 the favre filtered momentum equation in its complete form is written as follows 3 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 x i μ u k x k τ i j x j the sgs term is split into isotropic and deviatoric parts the isotropic part is not modelled but added to the filtered static pressure the deviatoric part is modelled using the compressible form of the sgs model based on the boussinesq hypothesis 4 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j 1 3 s k k δ i j in the present work the sgs turbulent viscosity μ t is calculated using the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale model nicoud and ducros 1999 5 μ t ρ l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 where s i j is the strain rate tensor of the filtered flow and s i j d and l s are defined as follows 6 s i j d 1 2 g i j 2 g j i 2 1 3 δ i j g k k 2 g i j u i x j 7 l s min κ d c w δ v 1 3 where the von karman constant κ is 0 4187 d is the wall distance δ v is the cell volume and c w is the model parameter specified as 0 325 the regularly filtered density of the mixture ρ is expressed as follows 8 ρ 1 α v α a ρ l α v ρ v α a ρ a where ρ l and ρ v are the liquid and vapor densities which are assumed to be incompressible respectively and ρ a is the air density regarded as an ideal gas α v and α a denote the regularly filtered volume fractions of the vapor and air phases related to the corresponding favre filtered mass fraction as f v ρ α v ρ v and f a ρ α a ρ a the transport of the phase fractions of vapor and air by the flow should be considered to close the equation system and this transport is modelled in the following two transport equations 9 ρ f v t ρ u j f v x j m m 10 ρ f a t ρ u j f a x j 0 we adopt the mass transfer sources of cavitation proposed by zwart et al 2004 11 m c e 3 α 0 1 α v ρ v r b 2 3 max p v p ρ l 0 12 m c c 3 α v ρ v r b 2 3 max p p v ρ l 0 where p v is the saturated vapor pressure α 0 is the initial fraction of the water phase due to the existence of nuclei and r b is the radius of the nuclei the calibration parameters r b 10 6 α 0 5 10 4 c e 50 and c c 0 01 have been found to work well for typical water quality in cavitation experiments the filtered phase transport equations are used with the extra stress ρ u j f neglected as in most previous les work in fact the local vapor fraction is scarcely subject to high frequency fluctuations in space because the bubble clusters in cavitation make the phase fraction change integrally in response to pressure pulsation due to bubble bubble interactions studies seo et al 2010 zeravcic et al 2011 have indicated that this effect is especially strong where the phase fraction is high so the oscillation of bubble clusters will be greatly restrained as a result the phase fraction will be primarily determined by the mean pressure distribution thus the sub grid scales f a and f v could be negligible with respect to f a and f v in the cavitation region and above the water surface where the mean pressure is nearly uniform for the simplicity of notation the bar and tilde symbols over the physical variables will be omitted in the following sections 2 2 numerical methodology the governing equations are discretized using the cell centred finite volume method fvm and solved using an implicit segregated solver wherein the equations are solved sequentially and iteratively a pressure velocity density correction algorithm demirdzic et al 1993 for arbitrary mach numbers based on the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple is used to decouple and solve the governing equations the algorithm automatically adapts to the local nature of the flow at low mach numbers the laplacian term dominates so the equation recovers to a poisson equation at high mach numbers the convective term dominates and reflects the hyperbolic nature of the flow the linearized algebraic equations resulting from the discretization are solved using an algebraic multigrid amg method the integral forms of the governing equations are used in the fvm discretization for the equation of a variable φ integrated on a cell centroid denoted by p with volume δ v limited by faces with vector area a the half discretized form is described as follows 13 ρ φ t p δ v f a c e s ρ u a φ f a c e s γ φ a s φ δ v p for temporal discretization bounded implicit time integration is used for the following second order discretization 14 3 ρ φ t δ t 4 ρ φ t ρ φ t δ t 2 δ t f φ t δ t les requires either a high resolution mesh or a high order scheme for the convective term even order schemes are nondissipative so they do not affect the contributions of the subgrid scale model to dissipation a central differencing scheme cds is an ideal choice for les but it often leads to unphysical oscillations in the flow field we employ a bounded cds for the convective term of the momentum equation based on the normalized variable diagram nvd approach leonard 1991 together with the convection boundedness criterion cbc the bounded cds is a composite nvd scheme that consists of a pure cds a blended scheme of cds and a second order upwind scheme and a first order upwind scheme the gradient vector φ is calculated using the least squares cell based evaluation method the gradient at a cell centroid p can be evaluated by the value difference between p and any neighbouring cell centre n along the vector r pointing from p to n 15 φ p r φ n φ p considering all the cells surrounding cell p the following system of compact form is used to compute the gradient 16 j φ p δ φ where j is the jacobi coefficient matrix purely as a function of geometry and δ φ is the difference vector this linear system of equations is overdetermined and can be solved by decomposing the coefficient matrix using the gram schmidt process anderson and bonhus 1994 two basic computational procedures are executed at every step within the iteration cycle of time step t δ t first the discretized momentum equation is solved by iteration as shown below for the iteration step n 17 α p u i u i p n σ α n u i u i n n b u i n 1 δ p n 1 δ x i p where α p u i and α n u i are the coefficients in the discretized algebra equation and b u i n 1 denotes the source term minus the pressure contribution as u i n and ρ n 1 do not satisfy the mass conservation a coupling correction procedure for the pressure velocity and density fields is performed the equation for the imbalance quantity q n is described as follows 18 ρ n 1 t δ t ρ t δ v δ t f a c e s ρ n 1 t δ t u i n a i q n where a i denotes the normal area vector of the face by combining the corrections of the pressure velocity and density a coupling correction equation in the following form is used 19 c ρ p δ v δ t f a c e s c ρ u i n a i p ρ n 1 a 1 α p u i δ p δ n 0 the corrections for pressure velocity and density can ultimately be computed using this equation and the compressibility relation between ρ and p then the velocity and density corrections can both be obtained the dynamic mesh technique is used to achieve upward motion of the vehicle with a prescribed trajectory the computational domain is then forced to move relative to the sea surface together with the vehicle in other words the water surface continues to move downward in the computational domain updates to the volumetric mesh are performed at each time step based on the new position of the boundaries 2 3 phase interface capturing upwind schemes are too diffusive to capture the deformable water surface and cavity surface while unbounded central schemes may give unphysical results to overcome these shortcomings a high resolution interface capturing hric scheme muzaferija et al 1998 of the volume of the fluid vof method is adopted this scheme provides a better accuracy than the quadratic upwind interpolation of convective kinematics quick and second order schemes and is less computationally expensive than the conventional geometry reconstruction scheme of the vof when a cell of the computational mesh appears near the interface between two phases the normalized volume fraction α of one phase on the cell centre is estimated to be the following expression 20 α ˆ c α d α u α a α u where d denotes the cell identified as the donor of an amount of phase to a neighbouring acceptor cell denoted as a and u denotes the upwind cell with regard to the flow direction the normalized cell value α ˆ c is used to calculate the normalized face value α ˆ f 21 α ˆ f α ˆ c α ˆ c 0 o r α ˆ c 1 2 α ˆ c 0 α ˆ c 0 5 1 0 5 α ˆ c 1 to restrain interface wrinkles caused by the direct usage of this α ˆ f when the flow is parallel to the interface the algorithm is automatically switched to a one dimensional bounded quick scheme based on the angle θ between the cell face normal and the interface normal 22 α ˆ f q α ˆ c α ˆ c 0 o r α ˆ c 1 min α ˆ f 6 α ˆ c 3 8 0 α ˆ c 1 this expression leads to a corrected normalized face volume fraction 23 α ˆ f cos θ α ˆ f

n x y z r e 1 76 ln re for at least 80 of the turbulence energy to be resolved pope 2000 if the real vehicle is supposed to have a diameter scale of 1 m and a velocity scale of tens of metres per second re 10 7 a grid number of n x y z 10 13 is required for a typical water exit flow which is impractical for the currently available computer resources in the present work we use a geometrically similar scale model of the vehicle rather than the prototype the most important dynamic similarity laws regarding the water exit issue are the reynolds number re froude number fr and cavitation number σ defined as follows 25 re ρ v d μ fr v d g σ p p v 1 2 ρ v 2 where d is the vehicle diameter v is the navigation speed and p is the ambient pressure to achieve les nwr it is necessary to ensure re 10 5 for the scale model similarity laws cannot be simultaneously satisfied for the reynolds number and froude number if the physical properties of water in the prototype and scale model cases are identical fortunately both cases are assumed to lie in the quadratic resistance region of turbulent flow so the similarity of the reynolds number is automatically fulfilled and only the similarities of the froude number fr and the cavitation number σ should be guaranteed we employ a scale model diameter of d m 0 01 d p so that froude number similarity leads to a velocity scaling of v m 0 1 v p the similarity of the cavitation number is achieved by reducing the atmospheric pressure p 0 above the surface of the water this result means that the p 0 of the scale model case should be p 0 m p v 0 01 p 0 p p v notably σ varies dynamically as the vehicle moves upward 4 computational setup and isotropic mesh the scale model of the vehicle is composed of a cylindrical body and a hemispheric head with a total length of l 0 1 m and a diameter of d 0 02 m the vehicle is initially placed at an immersion depth 1 10 l measured from the head apex to the undisturbed water level the vehicle moves upward at a specified speed v 30 40 l s and an angle of attack aoa 0 4 8 12 relative to the vertical direction the working condition covers a range of cavitation numbers from 0 12 to 0 22 when the head apex reaches the altitude of the undisturbed water level i e p p 0 in the definition of the cavitation number shown in eq 25 the reynolds number and froude number are in the ranges of 6 104 re 8 104 and 6 8 fr 9 0 respectively the simulation is performed in a computational domain limited by the vehicle surface and a set of closed external boundaries the domain is consolidated with the vehicle like a rigid body moving upward together relative to the stationary water surface and achieved through the dynamic mesh technique the configuration of the moving domain is illustrated in fig 1 at three typical moments with the boundary conditions marked the reference frame is fixed at the still water level vertically above the apex of the vehicle head the domain has widths of 20 d and 10 d in the two horizontal directions x and z respectively and a height of 5 l in the vertical direction y the head apex is 1 l from the top of the domain which is positioned to satisfy the specified initial immersion depth h 0 1 10 l to reduce the computational costs the domain occupies only half of the real fluid domain since the flow is symmetric about the pitching plane zero velocity boundaries are set on all the lateral sides where the water is actually still les prefers an isotropic filter that has less commutation error between the filtering and differentiating operations in numerical solving the spatial distribution of the mesh acts as the filter but conventional near wall meshes with large aspect ratios are far from isotropic so we adopt the octree method to generate a uniform isotropic mesh with near wall refinement fig 2 presents the layout of the grids on the longitudinal section of the computational domain for the finest mesh we used the domain is divided with the multiblock structured mesh where a cylindrical block around the vehicle body is isotropic and has a diameter of 3d the near wall mesh is then refined with a three level transition to generate square cells and guarantee that the wall distance y 1 the mesh on the vehicle surface is not shown because the grid lines there are too intensive to be clearly recognized the nondimensional grid sizes conventionally denoted as δ x and δ z in the les are constants here where x and z denote the axial and circumferential coordinates respectively typically δ x 50 100 and δ z 15 40 are suggested piomelli and chasnov 1996 to be basic prerequisites for les nwr here the isotropic mesh is sufficiently fine to meet this requirement the finest set of the mesh has 17 4 million cells in the computational domain of the half fluid area 34 8 million effective cells for the full fluid area meeting the les nwr requirement in the range of 6 104 re 8 104 5 verification and validation 5 1 verification of the les resolution les requires a substantially fine mesh to resolve the intrinsic turbulence structures although mesh convergence of les cannot be expected because richer flow details will be resolved if a finer mesh is used before the kolmogorov scale is reached the influence of the mesh resolution on mean flow quantities should be evaluated we performed simulations on three sets of meshes as listed in table 1 to check the influence of the mesh quality on the numerical results the meshes have the same grid topology and near wall grid size but different resolutions in the main flow around the vehicle body a typical case h 0 10 l v 35 l s aoa 4 was simulated on the three meshes to determine the influence of the mesh resolution on the flow hydrodynamic forces acting on objects in a fluid are commonly used as good indicators for the effect of mesh resolution on the mean flow fig 3 presents the time histories of the coefficient of the lift force acting on the vehicle body the lift has strong fluctuations in the first stage of motion of the vehicle where the predicted value of the coarse mesh m1 has an obvious deviation from the values of the fine meshes m2 and m3 after the lift reaches a stable value the mean value of m1 is slightly higher than those of m2 and m3 but the difference is essentially negligible the predicted values of m2 and m3 are so close that little difference can be observed between them however the high frequency oscillation of lift induced by turbulence pulsation can only be well captured by the finest mesh therefore mesh m3 will be adopted for all the simulation cases in the present work at this time the requirements of the nondimensional mesh scales y δ x and δ z are checked for the finest mesh the wall distance y is case dependent according to the flow reynolds number and it is distributed in a range along the vehicle surface in addition cavitation may greatly affect the y distribution because of the large distinction in density to ensure that the coverage of y 1 is as wide as possible we check the y distribution on the vehicle surface for two cases of a high speed or a large angle of attack fig 4 in each case the instants of a deep immersion period and contact of the water surface with the attached cavity are shown this result confirms y 1 on the vehicle surface and y 1 in the cavitation region where the flow structure is especially concerned an accurate les of the main flow requires a very small grid size table 2 lists the average δ x and δ z for some important cases where the three grid levels close to the wall are shown the values are calculated at the instant when the vehicle head touches the undisturbed water surface h 0 notably δ x and δ z are far below the prerequisite of les i e δ x 100 and δ z 40 even for the third level deep into the main flow there are other ways to evaluate the les resolution such as the one suggested by benard et al 2016 where at least 80 of the turbulence kinetic energy of the entire flow field should be resolved the resolution is defined as follows 26 q c e s g s e s g s e r 0 2 where e r 1 2 u i u i is the resolved turbulence kinetic energy and e s g s is the sgs turbulence kinetic energy estimated from the sgs eddy viscosity ν s g s 27 e s g s c ν s g s δ 2 where δ is the local filter length and c is a parameter adopted as 100 the velocity fluctuation u i is not explicitly resolved in les but it can be statistically obtained using a data sampling approach in the deep water period where the mean flow is steady and not yet cavitated the time dependent lift and drag forces acting on the vehicle can be checked to ensure the steadiness of the mean flow fig 5 presents the coefficients of the lift and drag forces defined as follows 28 c l f l 1 2 ρ l v 2 1 8 π d 2 c d f d 1 2 ρ l v 2 1 8 π d 2 the force coefficients experience drastic fluctuations in the first stage of building the flow field up and then reach a long period in which the mean value remains nearly constant with tiny oscillations until the occurrence of cavitation makes the oscillation severe we re computed the flow in the time period t 0 1 0 2 with a data sampling function to acquire the velocity fluctuation u i and the root mean square rms values u 2 v 2 and w 2 the rms values were used to calculate e r and the sgs quantities were used to calculate e s g s the resolved turbulence kinetic energy e r and its resolution q c defined by eq 26 are obtained using a 500 time step computation with data sampling fig 6 displays their distributions at the mid section for some typical cases relatively high values are primarily on the suction side and in the wake the value of q c is slightly higher around the front stagnation point because the local turbulence fluctuation is extremely low there which makes it difficult to reduce the value of q c however it is much lower than 0 2 in the core area of the flow where e r is high thus it can be concluded that q c 0 2 is satisfied over almost the entire flow field the normalized power spectral density psd of the force coefficients during the steady period of mean flow is obtained using the fast fourier transform fft method following the method of blevins 2001 the sampling frequency is f s 10 4 and the number of sampling points is n f f t 1024 fig 7 shows the psd in log coordinates from which the slope of the marking line enveloping the peaks can be conveniently measured to indicate that the 5 3 power law of kolmogorov s k41 theory is accurately met 5 2 validation of interface capturing the hydrodynamic features of vehicle penetration through the water surface are the most central concerns in the early stage of penetration the surge of the water surface provides validation for the hric algorithm for capturing the shape and sharpness of the water air interface we performed a simulation approaching the water surface at a low speed to prevent cavitation from occurring and validated the surge effect using an experimental benchmark the experiment and simulation were conducted at a low navigation speed v 2 l s corresponding to f r 2 v 2 r g 0 4 and re 2000 under this condition the weber number w e 5 6 is so small that surface tension must be considered in the simulation fig 8 presents the surging course of the water surface as the vehicle approaches it the surface deforms from an initially horizontal line to a curved shape attached to the head of the vehicle a thin water air interface with density variation from 0 to 1000 is captured in detail this finding demonstrates that the hric scheme works well at capturing the interface between phases liju et al 2001 investigated the surge effects of water exits with experimental observations and using the boundary element method bem experimental images of the water surface are shown in fig 9 where the dashed lines represent the bem results the predicted profile of the water surface curved solid line accurately coincides with the experimental image 6 results and discussion the simulation cases are listed in table 3 where the launch parameters considered include the initial immersion depth h 0 the navigation speed v and the angle of attack for each parameter three values are adopted to reflect its influence on the flow in the table the cases marked with the same symbol hollow or solid or those marked with solid symbols in a one column are to be contrasted the vehicle is cavitation free in the navigation stage of deep water the specific turbulent flow structures around the vehicle are especially concerning the q criterion of vortex identification is widely adopted to show the turbulence structures defined as follows 29 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 1 2 ω i j ω j i s i j s j i where ω and s are the vorticity tensor and strain rate tensor respectively q actually acts as the source of the pressure poisson equation 2 p 2 ρ q deduced from the n s equation where the pressure gradient p points outside the boundary of any small region of q 0 the low pressure in the region implies the existence of a vortex high values of q are preferred to clearly separate the twisted turbulence vortices fig 10 shows detailed turbulent flow structures around the vehicle at an immersion time when cavitation has not yet occurred the smooth spherical layer of the isosurface of q on the head indicates the laminar flow state there the adverse pressure on the suction side of the vehicle makes the flow sensitive to disturbances which induce flow instability afterward the flow experiences a rapid laminar turbulent transition and forms coherent turbulence structures then the flow is composed of a packet of twisted vortical structures which separate in the streamwise direction and develop into a series of hairpin vortices the stretch of the primary hairpin vortex legs contributes to the growth of the secondary and third hairpin vortices the vortices experience periodic development and shedding meanwhile there is a very large scale vortex shed from the vehicle s tail into its wake details of the captured coherent structures of turbulence are shown from different perspectives in fig 11 the flow is laminar in a band along the central line of the pressure side but it is easy to sense the numerical disturbance brought in through the geometric roughness as represented by the thin strings of the q isosurface the flow state transitions from laminar to turbulent across the lateral side of the vehicle the interlacing streamwise and circumferential vortices represent an alternative pressure distribution during the laminar turbulent transition as illustrated by the pressure contours shown in figs 12 and 13 the pressure variation is monotonic and regular on the pressure side of the vehicle at large angles but the disturbance propagation and the transition to turbulence can be clearly observed close to the two lateral sides this it is acknowledged that the flow tends to be disturbed when the pressure gradient is in the reverse direction to the stream so hydrostatic pressure will make the flow unstable at small angles say aoa 4 however the stability is strengthened at larger angles the cavitation number keeps dropping as the vehicle moves so the transient σ 0 as the apex reaches the water surface is adopted to represent a case numerical snapshots in the water exit course of different cases are shown with the 3d cavity shapes and the density distribution at the midsection the decreasing ambient hydrostatic pressure increases the size of the cavity during this time until it is pressed downward by the water surface figs 14 and 15 give upright water exit cases at different speeds the surfaces of the water and cavity are captured with a sharp density interface the cavity shape is regular and smooth particularly in the case of a relatively high speed the cavity on the shoulder keeps growing as the vehicle moves upward accomplished by the development of the re entrant water jet flowing backward into the cavity the dashed lines in fig 15 indicate that the front of the re entrant jet is almost stationary relative to the vehicle wall because the cavity closure itself develops downward as the jet moves upward relative to it the cavity is pinched off under the coaction of the jet and the water surface presses down the high pressure induced by the leading edge cavitation collapse produces notable water splashing and elevation another noticeable aspect is that the wake cavity presents repeated shrinkage and expansion until the tail of the vehicle leaves the water surface 30 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ l v 2 the pressure distribution on the vehicle surface evolves during cavity shedding fig 16 shows the pressure coefficients defined in eq 30 on the central line of the suction side in the time period 0 030 0 053 the pressure peak at the leading edge of the cavity propagates axially much faster than the high pressure of the cavity closure the maximal pressure peak appears when leading edge collapse occurs but a much stronger pressure will appear when the cavity finally collapses which is not presented here because of the finite time interval shown in the figure the collapsing pressure will be discussed in detail below significant effects of the water exit angle on the cavitation behaviour can be observed in fig 17 as the cavity drifts to the suction side the flow along the cavity surface will be reflected on oblique cavity closure to induce a re entrant jet directed to the suction side of the vehicle chen et al 2020 the cavitation appears to be extremely irregular on the suction side indicating the strong effects of adverse pressure on the turbulent flow structure the total volume of the vapor in the cavitation is recorded by integrating the vapor fraction α v over the domain as presented in fig 18 the cavities have different growth rates along the ascending branches of the curves in relation to the various speeds but the slopes of the descending branches are all the same this finding is understood as follows at the shedding stage the cavity is always beneath the water surface so the shrinkage is dominated by ambient pressure but has little to do with the vehicle fig 18 a and b show that the cavities have almost the same shrinkage rate regardless of the speed a higher speed corresponds to a larger cavity size which has a longer lifetime during shedding the comparisons shown in fig 18 c and e indicate that the angle has some influence on the cavity size but the effect is much weaker than those of the other parameters in fig 18 d it is counterintuitive that the maximum cavity size is smaller if the vehicle is initially submerged deeper in fact if the vehicle is initially placed shallower the flow built up around the vehicle will deviate more from its equilibrium state which makes the cavity tend to expand more violently as mentioned above the cavity is pinched off by the coaction of the re entrant jet front moving up and the water surface pressing down the pinch off effect is illustrated in fig 19 using the cavity profiles on the midsection and the vehicle surface the water surface prevents the leading edge of the cavity from following the vehicle while the jet front is almost immobile relative to the vehicle so pinch off occurs on the spot of the jet front an asymmetric pinch off occurs when an angle of attack exists as shown in fig 19 b the jet is directed to the suction side where the flow of the cavity tail is so turbulent that it breaks the cavity up in this case the cavity is first pinched off on the pressure side and then drifts to the suction side under the intersection of the two liquid vapor contact lines on the vehicle surface the jet front is still stationary at both the pressure and suction sides the slope of the contact line of the cavity leading edge keeps increasing until it intersects with the contact line of the cavity closure the jet fronts then remain stationary at the two opposite sides the flow structures shown in figs 20 and 21 explain the flow mechanism behind the axisymmetric and asymmetric pinch off with the aid of cavity shape flow velocity and the pressure coefficient in fig 20 as the shoulder of the vehicle emerges from the water level it begins to lose flow separation producing low pressure to drive cavity growth the water layer compresses the vapor at the front of the cavity where mass transfer from vapor to liquid rapidly occurs on the other hand the thin layer of the re entrant water jet moves very slowly v j 0 as indicated by the velocity vectors in the figure when a water exit angle exists the stream reflects on the cavity closure and flows tangentially along the cavity tail to the suction side so that the pressure side cavity is rarely affected by the re entrant jet and the cavity tail remains constant as cavitation develops the turbulence structures are significantly affected fig 22 shows the vortical structures of the cavitating flow during the water exit course the regular hairpin series appearing in the previous non cavitating case is restrained here due to the existence of the cavity which blocks the mechanism of the hairpin vortex generation this phenomenon is more obvious for larger cavities with greater angles of attack where a primary vortex ring sheds from the cavity closure connected to one or two irregular hairpin vortices on the wetted part of the suction side behind the cavity intensive streamwise vortex tubes are observed which are most typical in the case of the largest angle the cavity surface is full of numerous tollmien schlichting t s wave like structures that result from surface shearing these structures break up and disappear as the head of the vehicle rises out of the water then the structures are explored using the pressure distribution in fig 23 the cavity is not long on the suction side and the re entrant jet produces a cavity fracture where a locally high pressure appears then the adverse pressure induces the propagation of vortical structures along the upper fraction of the cavity we are interested in the hydrodynamic forces acting on the vehicle particularly the pressure feature dominated by the cavitation evolution during the water exit course in scale model experiments it is difficult to measure pressure sufficiently due to the difficulty in arranging so many pressure sensors on a vehicle s surface numerical pressure monitors are easily arranged intensively to record pressure signals at every time step during the simulation fig 24 illustrates the arrangement of the pressure monitors on the vehicle surface and in the wake there are 271 monitors placed on the surface in total numbered in sequence but marked every 10 monitors in the figure the axial spacing between each pair of neighbouring monitors on the surface is 0 01 l there are three additional monitors placed in the wake with spacings of 1 l the coordinates of the monitors are inputted into the solver through a text file so that they can be conveniently adjusted and flexibly refined the recorded pressure signals of the vertical case are depicted in fig 25 where the pressure coefficient is defined in eq 30 at least two pressure increases or peaks appear at each pressure monitor for the stage of cavity growth a uniform pressure increase occurs as the cavity tail sweeps over the monitor in the subsequent cavity shedding stage of the water exit there is a series of up to seven pressure peaks that appear one of which is overwhelmingly stronger than the others the first four sets of peaks are caused by the minor collapse of the cavitation cloud dropped from the upstream part of the cavity bulk the peaks in these sets are in fact not overlapping but are arranged in order if checked in an enlarged view however the extremely high pressure of the final collapse is sensed simultaneously by monitors across a wide area of the vehicle surface as explained by the primary peak in the enlarged view finally the last two sets of peaks are induced by the vehicle s tail leaving the water surface as well as the following collapse of the cavity figs 26 28 present the pressure signals recorded in cases with a water exit angle in the case of a small angle of aoa 4 fig 26 several monitors in the front part of the pressure side detect turbulence disturbance similar to the pressure distribution mentioned in fig 12 this result occurs because of the large adverse pressure gradient indicated by the great variation in the pressure coefficients across only several monitors from p004 to p007 in contrast the pressure signals p007 to p080 concentrate in a narrow band in the case of a larger angle of aoa 12 the pressure signals are smooth and the pressure gradient of the forepart monitors is lower than that in the case of a small angle high resolution pressure evolution during the cavitation period is considered in fig 27 when the cavity breaks on the pressure side see fig 17 for cavity evolution a third pressure increase with a strong peak is captured which is simultaneously sensed by the monitors around the collapsing point in addition the collapse energy is much lower than that of the axisymmetric case the collapsing point deviating to the suction side is then farther away from the vehicle wall the enlarged graph in fig 27 indicates that when the cavity shrinks to a sufficiently small size the second and third pressure peaks overlap the pressure on the suction side shown in fig 28 is notably different aside from the turbulent state of the pressure of the forepart monitors the pressure signals of most of the left monitors on the suction side are uniform 7 conclusions in the present work an les method with a uniform filter of an octree based isotropic mesh and an hric algorithm was employed to study the water exit course of a submerged vehicle launched upward with an emphasis on the turbulence structure and the pressure feature which have not been sufficiently investigated in previous work cases with various launch parameters including immersion depth navigation speed and angle of attack were simulated the water surface and cavitation evolution were captured with a high resolution and the turbulent vortical structures of the non cavitating and cavitating flows were finely captured and discussed in detail the primary conclusions and findings are summarized as follows 1 cavity shedding with a pinch off effect of the travelling vapor liquid contact line was observed the pinch off effect was determined to be caused by the coaction of the water surface pressing down and the stationary re entrant jet front the effect of the oblique contact line makes the cavitation drift to the suction side and cause irregular shedding 2 the adverse pressure gradient makes the flow sensitive to numerical disturbance which is amplified to a laminar turbulent transition to form coherent turbulence structures the structures gradually separate in the stream direction and develop into a series of hairpin vortices the stretch of the primary hairpin vortex legs contributes to the growth of the secondary and third hairpin vortices 3 as cavitation begins to develop around the vehicle the features of the turbulence structures are significantly affected the regular hairpin series are restrained because the existence of the cavity attached to the leading edge blocks the mechanism of hairpin vortex generation the cavity surface is full of t s wave like vortical structures formed by shearing at the liquid vapor interface 4 specific pressure signals were observed increasing as the pressure monitors move in and out of the cavitation region and finally overlapping with the simultaneous pressure peaks induced by the final cavitation collapse credit authorship

20957,the water exit course of a submerged vehicle launched underwater that moves into the atmosphere is one of the most important considerations in naval applications in the present work a large eddy simulation with a uniform filter of an octree based isotropic mesh and a high resolution interface capturing algorithm is employed to investigate this issue with a special emphasis on the flow structures and pressure features various launch parameters including the immersion depth navigation speed and angle of attack are discussed the flow structures sensitive to adverse pressure relevant to the water exit angle are captured and discussed the flow experiences a laminar turbulent transition and forms coherent turbulence structures which develop a series of primary and secondary hairpin vortices the distribution of pressure is more monotonic and regular on the pressure side of the vehicle as the angle increases while a propagation of disturbance and a transition to turbulence can occur across the lateral side based on the clearly captured evolution of the water surface and cavitation the cavity shedding induced by a pinch off effect of the travelling liquid vapor contact lines is found and investigated the structural features of turbulence are greatly affected in this case which contrasts with the noncavitating features the structures are tuned due to the existence of cavitation which blocks the hairpin vortex generation mechanism the cavity surface is full of tollmien schlichting wave like vortical structures caused by liquid vapor interface shearing hundreds of monitors are intensively arranged on the vehicle s surface to capture the transient pressure signals through which the crucial pressure features induced by the growth and collapse of the cavitation are captured keywords cavitation water exit large eddy simulation submerged vehicle 1 introduction the water exit course of a submerged vehicle launched underwater that moves into the atmosphere is one of the most important considerations in naval applications although modern axisymmetric vehicles are usually designed with streamlined head forms cavitation may also develop from a vehicle s shoulder as it approaches the sea surface at an adequately high speed cavitation interacts with the water surface during the water exit course with features distinct from conventional cavitation appearing in marine propulsion cavitation collapse can induce a violent impact on the vehicle surface and even damage its structure so it is important to explore water exit cavitating flows at a high degree of accuracy this issue has seldom been investigated or reported in the past due to the secrecy accompanying its military uses in recent decades cavitating flows of hydrofoils propellers and hydraulic machinery have been extensively studied including recent experimental observations and measurements arndt 2002 coutier delgosha et al 2007 gavaises et al 2015 ganesh et al 2016 xu et al 2017

charriere 2014 ji et al 2015 chen et al 2017 2019 long et al 2018 bhatt and mahesh 2020 zhang et al 2020 many general principles found in previous works may also aid in understanding the features of cavitation involved in water exit issues one primary aspect is the sheet cloud cavitation transition and cavitation shedding involving the widely discussed re entrant jet mechanism le et al 1993 callenaere et al 2001 leroux et al 2004 de giorgi et al 2019 trummler et al 2020 and the later discovered shock wave mechanism schnerr et al 2008 makiharju et al 2013 ganesh et al 2016 2020 in many cases flow on the cavity surface can reflect oblique or curved cavity closure to form a re entrant jet inducing a noticeable three dimensional effect of cavitation shedding laberteaux and ceccio 2001 decaix and goncalves 2013 brunhart et al 2020 the observed classic cavitation structures include a u shaped cloud structure leighton et al 2003 and horseshoe cavitating vortical structures ji et al 2013 peng et al 2016 arabnejad et al 2019 some researchers have addressed the interactions between cavitation and the turbulent boundary layer brandner et al 2010 croci et al 2019 as well as the influence of kelvin helmholtz instability on cavity break up and cloud formation dittakavi et al 2010 mithun et al 2018 many other aspects of cavitation regimes hydrodynamic loads and frequency features have also received previous examination cavitating flows around axisymmetric objects have also attracted some research interest more than half a century ago rouse and mcnown 1948 systematically measured pressure distributions on cavitated axisymmetric bodies with various head forms which has become a benchmark for numerical work in this area huang et al 2011 measured the cavitating flow pattern and dynamics of an ogive revolution body chen et al 2012 2015 investigated the cavity shape and dynamic behaviour of cavitation on axisymmetric vehicles under different navigation conditions wang et al 2016 studied cloud cavitating flow around an axisymmetric projectile near the surface of the water xu et al 2018 employed large eddy simulations les and cut cell meshes to analyse the near wall effects of cloud cavitating flow nevertheless the majority of cavitation work relevant to axisymmetric bodies in recent years has been dedicated to ventilated cavitation yu et al 2015 skidmore et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sun et al 2019 water exit issues without considering cavitation were generally treated using analytical methods with attention mainly given to hydrodynamic loads tassin et al 2013 rajavaheinthan and greenhow 2015 korobkin et al 2017 wu et al 2018 breton et al 2020 if cavitation is considered the resulting flow is so complicated that it s rarely reported liu et al 2003 calculated the water exit cavity and re entrant jet development using the marker and cell mac method quan et al 2008 discussed the mechanisms that guide high pressure generation by the collapse of a water exit cavity chu et al 2010 simulated the water exit of an air containing cavity and analysed its interactions with the water surface wang et al 2014 studied the collapse of air containing cavitation bubbles surrounding a projectile launched from underwater ma et al 2017 studied pressure equalizing air film cavitation around a water exiting underwater vehicle to discuss the mechanism of hydrodynamic improvement that it offers to the vehicle ma et al 2019 also discussed the influence of uncertainty in the launch parameters in a cavity although some valuable results on water exit cavitation have been reported the details of turbulent flow structures remain hardly known experimental techniques are not yet able to identify complex vortical structures and high resolution numerical methods have a unique advantage over experiments in this regard les has become widely used to predict cavitating flows in recent years gavaises et al 2015 ji et al 2015 pendar and roohi 2016 bai et al 2018 long et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 2020 fang et al 2020 most of les work has been performed on anisotropic meshes whose cells cannot be considered a uniform box filter les is more effective on uniform filters of isotropic meshes particularly in near wall regions so that the turbulent flow structures that develop from the boundary layer can be well predicted in the present work a high resolution les with an octree based isotropic mesh is employed to investigate the cavitating flows in the water exit course of a submerged vehicle launched upward with an emphasis on its turbulence structures and pressure features this work is a follow up to the authors previous work chen et al 2020 where turbulence structures were not addressed the work was conducted using the commercial cfd software ansys fluent 14 0 2 mathematical models and numerical methods 2 1 les model of water exit multiphase flow the flow induced by the upward navigation of the vehicle is handled with a one fluid homogeneous multiphase flow model i e the fluid is a compressible mixture composed of the phases of liquid vapor and air no slip between the phases is considered i e any physical variable is assumed to be consistent for each phase component due to the high compressibility involved in the flow a compressible les model using the hybrid of regular filtering and density weighted favre filtering is employed i e the resolved part of a physical variable φ x t is filtered as follows 1 φ ρ φ ρ 1 ρ d ρ x φ x g x x d x where g x x is the filtering function and the bar over a quantity indicates the regular filtering operation the continuity equation is treated using favre filtering to avoid modelling sub filter scales 2 ρ t ρ u j x j 0 the favre filtered momentum equation in its complete form is written as follows 3 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 x i μ u k x k τ i j x j the sgs term is split into isotropic and deviatoric parts the isotropic part is not modelled but added to the filtered static pressure the deviatoric part is modelled using the compressible form of the sgs model based on the boussinesq hypothesis 4 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j 1 3 s k k δ i j in the present work the sgs turbulent viscosity μ t is calculated using the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale model nicoud and ducros 1999 5 μ t ρ l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 where s i j is the strain rate tensor of the filtered flow and s i j d and l s are defined as follows 6 s i j d 1 2 g i j 2 g j i 2 1 3 δ i j g k k 2 g i j u i x j 7 l s min κ d c w δ v 1 3 where the von karman constant κ is 0 4187 d is the wall distance δ v is the cell volume and c w is the model parameter specified as 0 325 the regularly filtered density of the mixture ρ is expressed as follows 8 ρ 1 α v α a ρ l α v ρ v α a ρ a where ρ l and ρ v are the liquid and vapor densities which are assumed to be incompressible respectively and ρ a is the air density regarded as an ideal gas α v and α a denote the regularly filtered volume fractions of the vapor and air phases related to the corresponding favre filtered mass fraction as f v ρ α v ρ v and f a ρ α a ρ a the transport of the phase fractions of vapor and air by the flow should be considered to close the equation system and this transport is modelled in the following two transport equations 9 ρ f v t ρ u j f v x j m m 10 ρ f a t ρ u j f a x j 0 we adopt the mass transfer sources of cavitation proposed by zwart et al 2004 11 m c e 3 α 0

r b is the radius of the nuclei the calibration parameters r b 10 6 α 0 5 10 4 c e 50 and c c 0 01 have been found to work well for typical water quality in cavitation experiments the filtered phase transport equations are used with the extra stress ρ u j f neglected as in most previous les work in fact the local vapor fraction is scarcely subject to high frequency fluctuations in space because the bubble clusters in cavitation make the phase fraction change integrally in response to pressure pulsation due to bubble bubble interactions studies seo et al 2010 zeravcic et al 2011 have indicated that this effect is especially strong where the phase fraction is high so the oscillation of bubble clusters will be greatly restrained as a result the phase fraction will be primarily determined by the mean pressure distribution thus the sub grid scales f a and f v could be negligible with respect to f a and f v in the cavitation region and above the water surface where the mean pressure is nearly uniform for the simplicity of notation the bar and tilde symbols over the physical variables will be omitted in the following sections 2 2 numerical methodology the governing equations are discretized using the cell centred finite volume method fvm and solved using an implicit segregated solver wherein the equations are solved sequentially and iteratively a pressure velocity density correction algorithm demirdzic et al 1993 for arbitrary mach numbers based on the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple is used to decouple and solve the governing equations the algorithm automatically adapts to the local nature of the flow at low mach numbers the laplacian term dominates so the equation recovers to a poisson equation at high mach numbers the convective term dominates and reflects the hyperbolic nature of the flow the linearized algebraic equations resulting from the discretization are solved using an algebraic multigrid amg method the integral forms of the governing equations are used in the fvm discretization for the equation of a variable φ integrated on a cell centroid denoted by p with volume δ v limited by faces with vector area a the half discretized form is described as follows 13 ρ φ t p δ v f a c e s ρ u a φ f a c e s γ φ a s φ δ v p for temporal discretization bounded implicit time integration is used for the following second order discretization 14 3 ρ φ t δ t 4 ρ φ t ρ φ t δ t 2 δ t f φ t δ t les requires either a high resolution mesh or a high order scheme for the convective term even order schemes are nondissipative so they do not affect the contributions of the subgrid scale model to dissipation a central differencing scheme cds is an ideal choice for les but it often leads to unphysical oscillations in the flow field we employ a bounded cds for the convective term of the momentum equation based on the normalized variable diagram nvd approach leonard 1991 together with the convection boundedness criterion cbc the bounded cds is a composite nvd scheme that consists of a pure cds a blended scheme of cds and a second order upwind scheme and a first order upwind scheme the gradient vector φ is calculated using the least squares cell based evaluation method the gradient at a cell centroid p can be evaluated by the value difference between p and any neighbouring cell centre n along the vector r pointing from p to n 15 φ p r φ n φ p considering all the cells surrounding cell p the following system of compact form is used to compute the gradient 16 j φ p δ φ where j is the jacobi coefficient matrix purely as a function of geometry and δ φ is the difference vector this linear system of equations is overdetermined and can be solved by decomposing the coefficient matrix using the gram schmidt process anderson and bonhus 1994 two basic computational procedures are executed at every step within the iteration cycle of time step t δ t first the discretized momentum equation is solved by iteration as shown below for the iteration step n 17 α p u i u i p n σ α n u i u i n n b u i n 1 δ p n 1 δ x i p where α p u i and α n u i are the coefficients in the discretized algebra equation and b u i n 1 denotes the source term minus the pressure contribution as u i n and ρ n 1 do not satisfy the mass conservation a coupling correction procedure for the pressure velocity and density fields is performed the equation for the imbalance quantity q n is described as follows 18 ρ n 1 t δ t ρ t δ v δ t f a c e s ρ n 1 t δ t u i n a i q n where a i denotes the normal area vector of the face by combining the corrections of the pressure velocity and density a coupling correction equation in the following form is used 19 c ρ p δ v δ t f a c e s c ρ u i n a i p ρ n 1 a 1 α p u i δ p δ n 0 the corrections for pressure velocity and density can ultimately be computed using this equation and the compressibility relation between ρ and p then the velocity and density corrections can both be obtained the dynamic mesh technique is used to achieve upward motion of the vehicle with a prescribed trajectory the computational domain is then forced to move relative to the sea surface together with the vehicle in other words the water surface continues to move downward in the computational domain updates to the volumetric mesh are performed at each time step based on the new position of the boundaries 2 3 phase interface capturing upwind schemes are too diffusive to capture the deformable water surface and cavity surface while unbounded central schemes may give unphysical results to overcome these shortcomings a high resolution interface capturing hric scheme muzaferija et al 1998 of the volume of the fluid vof method is adopted this scheme provides a better accuracy than the quadratic upwind interpolation of convective kinematics quick and second order schemes and is less computationally expensive than the conventional geometry reconstruction scheme of the vof when a cell of the computational mesh appears near the interface between two phases the normalized volume fraction α of one phase on the cell centre is estimated to be the following expression

n x y z r e 1 76 ln re for at least 80 of the turbulence energy to be resolved pope 2000 if the real vehicle is supposed to have a diameter scale of 1 m and a velocity scale of tens of metres per second re 10 7 a grid number of n x y z 10 13 is required for a typical water exit flow which is impractical for the currently available computer resources in the present work we use a geometrically similar scale model of the vehicle rather than the prototype the most important dynamic similarity laws regarding the water exit issue are the reynolds number re froude number fr and cavitation number σ defined as follows 25 re ρ v d μ fr v d g σ p p v 1 2 ρ v 2 where d is the vehicle diameter v is the navigation speed and p is the ambient pressure to achieve les nwr it is necessary to ensure re 10 5 for the scale model similarity laws cannot be simultaneously satisfied for the reynolds number and froude number if the physical properties of water in the prototype and scale model cases are identical fortunately both cases are assumed to lie in the quadratic resistance region of turbulent flow so the similarity of the reynolds number is automatically fulfilled and only the similarities of the froude number fr and the cavitation number σ should be guaranteed we employ a scale model diameter of d m 0 01 d p so that froude number similarity leads to a velocity scaling of v m 0 1 v p the similarity of the cavitation number is achieved by reducing the atmospheric pressure p 0 above the surface of the water this result means that the p 0 of the scale model case should be p 0 m p v 0 01 p 0 p p v notably σ varies dynamically as the vehicle moves upward 4 computational setup and isotropic mesh the scale model of the vehicle is composed of a cylindrical body and a hemispheric head with a total length of l 0 1 m and a diameter of d 0 02 m the vehicle is initially placed at an immersion depth 1 10 l measured from the head apex to the undisturbed water level the vehicle moves upward at a specified speed v 30 40 l s and an angle of attack aoa 0 4 8 12 relative to the vertical direction the working condition covers a range of cavitation numbers from 0 12 to 0 22 when the head apex reaches the altitude of the undisturbed water level i e p p 0 in the definition of the cavitation number shown in eq 25 the reynolds number and froude number are in the ranges of 6 104 re 8 104 and 6 8 fr 9 0 respectively the simulation is performed in a computational domain limited by the vehicle surface and a set of closed external boundaries the domain is consolidated with the vehicle like a rigid body moving upward together relative to the stationary water surface and achieved through the dynamic mesh technique the configuration of the moving domain is illustrated in fig 1 at three typical moments with the boundary conditions marked the reference frame is fixed at the still water level vertically above the apex of the vehicle head the domain has widths of 20 d and 10 d in the two horizontal directions x and z respectively and a height of 5 l in the vertical direction y the head apex is 1 l from the top of the domain which is positioned to satisfy the specified initial immersion depth h 0 1 10 l to reduce the computational costs the domain occupies only half of the real fluid domain since the flow is symmetric about the pitching plane zero velocity boundaries are set on all the lateral sides where the water is actually still les prefers an isotropic filter that has less commutation error between the filtering and differentiating operations in numerical solving the spatial distribution of the mesh acts as the filter but conventional near wall meshes with large aspect ratios are far from isotropic so we adopt the octree method to generate a uniform isotropic mesh with near wall refinement fig 2 presents the layout of the grids on the longitudinal section of the computational domain for the finest mesh we used the domain is divided with the multiblock structured mesh where a cylindrical block around the vehicle body is isotropic and has a diameter of 3d the near wall mesh is then refined with a three level transition to generate square cells and guarantee that the wall distance y 1 the mesh on the vehicle surface is not shown because the grid lines there are too intensive to be clearly recognized the nondimensional grid sizes conventionally denoted as δ x and δ z in the les are constants here where x and z denote the axial and circumferential coordinates respectively typically δ x 50 100 and δ z 15 40 are suggested piomelli and chasnov 1996 to be basic prerequisites for les nwr here the isotropic mesh is sufficiently fine to meet this requirement the finest set of the mesh has 17 4 million cells in the computational domain of the half fluid area 34 8 million effective cells for the full fluid area meeting the les nwr requirement in the range of 6 104 re 8 104 5 verification and validation 5 1 verification of the les resolution les requires a substantially fine mesh to resolve the intrinsic turbulence structures although mesh convergence of les cannot be expected because richer flow details will be resolved if a finer mesh is used before the kolmogorov scale is reached the influence of the mesh resolution on mean flow quantities should be evaluated we performed simulations on three sets of meshes as listed in table 1 to check the influence of the mesh quality on the numerical results the meshes have the same grid topology and near wall grid size but different resolutions in the main flow around the vehicle body a typical case h 0 10 l v 35 l s aoa 4 was simulated on the three meshes to determine the influence of the mesh resolution on the flow hydrodynamic forces acting on objects in a fluid are commonly used as good indicators for the effect of mesh resolution on the mean flow fig 3 presents the time histories of the coefficient of the lift force acting on the vehicle body the lift has strong fluctuations in the first stage of motion of the vehicle where the predicted value of the coarse mesh m1 has an obvious deviation from the values of the fine meshes m2 and m3 after the lift reaches a stable value the mean value of m1 is slightly higher than those of m2 and m3 but the difference is essentially negligible the predicted values of m2 and m3 are so close that little difference can be observed between them however the high frequency oscillation of lift induced by turbulence pulsation can only be well captured by the finest mesh therefore mesh m3 will be adopted for all the simulation cases in the present work at this time the requirements of the nondimensional mesh scales y δ x and δ z are checked for the finest mesh the wall distance y is case dependent according to the flow reynolds number and it is distributed in a range along the vehicle surface in addition cavitation may greatly affect the y distribution because of the large distinction in density to ensure that the coverage of y 1 is as wide as possible we check the y distribution on the vehicle surface for two cases of a high speed or a large angle of attack fig 4 in each case the instants of a deep immersion period and contact of the water surface with the attached cavity are shown this result confirms y 1 on the vehicle surface and y 1 in the cavitation region where the flow structure is especially concerned an accurate les of the main flow requires a very small grid size table 2 lists the average δ x and δ z for some important cases where the three grid levels close to the wall are shown the values are calculated at the instant when the vehicle head touches the undisturbed water surface h 0 notably δ x and δ z are far below the prerequisite of les i e δ x 100 and δ z 40 even for the third level deep into the main flow there are other ways to evaluate the les resolution such as the one suggested by benard et al 2016 where at least 80 of the turbulence kinetic energy of the entire flow field should be resolved the resolution is defined as follows 26 q c e s g s e s g s e r 0 2 where e r 1 2 u i u i is the resolved turbulence kinetic energy and e s g s is the sgs turbulence kinetic energy estimated from the sgs eddy viscosity ν s g s 27 e s g s c ν s g s δ 2 where δ is the local filter length and c is a parameter adopted as 100 the velocity fluctuation u i is not explicitly resolved in les but it can be statistically obtained using a data sampling approach in the deep water period where the mean flow is steady and not yet cavitated the time dependent lift and drag forces acting on the vehicle can be checked to ensure the steadiness of the mean flow fig 5 presents the coefficients of the lift and drag forces defined as follows 28 c l f l 1 2 ρ l v 2 1 8 π d 2 c d f d 1 2 ρ l v 2 1 8 π d 2 the force coefficients experience drastic fluctuations in the first stage of building the flow field up and then reach a long period in which the mean value remains nearly constant with tiny oscillations until the occurrence of cavitation makes the oscillation severe we re computed the flow in the time period t 0 1 0 2 with a data sampling function to acquire the velocity fluctuation u i and the root mean square rms values u 2 v 2 and w 2 the rms values were used to calculate e r and the sgs quantities were used to calculate e s g s the resolved turbulence kinetic energy e r and its resolution q c defined by eq 26 are obtained using a 500 time step computation with data sampling fig 6 displays their distributions at the mid section for some typical cases relatively high values are primarily on the suction side and in the wake the value of q c is slightly higher around the front stagnation point because the local turbulence fluctuation is extremely low there which makes it difficult to reduce the value of q c however it is much lower than 0 2 in the core area of the flow where e r is high thus it can be concluded that q c 0 2 is satisfied over almost the entire flow field the normalized power spectral density psd of the force coefficients during the steady period of mean flow is obtained using the fast fourier transform fft method following the method of blevins 2001 the sampling frequency is f s 10 4 and the number of sampling points is n f f t 1024 fig 7 shows the psd in log coordinates from which the slope of the marking line enveloping the peaks can be conveniently measured to indicate that the 5 3 power law of kolmogorov s k41 theory is accurately met 5 2 validation of interface capturing the hydrodynamic features of vehicle penetration through the water surface are the most central concerns in the early stage of penetration the surge of the water surface provides validation for the hric algorithm for capturing the shape and sharpness of the water air interface we performed a simulation approaching the water surface at a low speed to prevent cavitation from occurring and validated the surge effect using an experimental benchmark the experiment and simulation were conducted at a low navigation speed v 2 l s corresponding to f r 2 v 2 r g 0 4 and re 2000 under this condition the weber number w e 5 6 is so small that surface tension must be considered in the simulation fig 8 presents the surging course of the water surface as the vehicle approaches it the surface deforms from an initially horizontal line to a curved shape attached to the head of the vehicle a thin water air interface with density variation from 0 to 1000 is captured in detail this finding demonstrates that the hric scheme works well at capturing the interface between phases liju et al 2001 investigated the surge effects of water exits with experimental observations and using the boundary element method bem experimental images of the water surface are shown in fig 9 where the dashed lines represent the bem results the predicted profile of the water surface curved solid line accurately coincides with the experimental image 6 results and discussion the simulation cases are listed in table 3 where the launch parameters considered include the initial immersion depth h 0 the navigation speed v and the angle of attack for each parameter three values are adopted to reflect its influence on the flow in the table the cases marked with the same symbol hollow or solid or those marked with solid symbols in a one column are to be contrasted the vehicle is cavitation free in the navigation stage of deep water the specific turbulent flow structures around the vehicle are especially concerning the q criterion of vortex identification is widely adopted to show the turbulence structures defined as follows 29 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 1 2 ω i j ω j i s i j s j i where ω and s are the vorticity tensor and strain rate tensor respectively q actually acts as the source of the pressure poisson equation 2 p 2 ρ q deduced from the n s equation where the pressure gradient p points outside the boundary of any small region of q 0 the low pressure in the region implies the existence of a vortex high values of q are preferred to clearly separate the twisted turbulence vortices fig 10 shows detailed turbulent flow structures around the vehicle at an immersion time when cavitation has not yet occurred the smooth spherical layer of the isosurface of q on the head indicates the laminar flow state there the adverse pressure on the suction side of the vehicle makes the flow sensitive to disturbances which induce flow instability afterward the flow experiences a rapid laminar turbulent transition and forms coherent turbulence structures then the flow is composed of a packet of twisted vortical structures which separate in the streamwise direction and develop into a series of hairpin vortices the stretch of the primary hairpin vortex legs contributes to the growth of the secondary and third hairpin vortices the vortices experience periodic development and shedding meanwhile there is a very large scale vortex shed from the vehicle s tail into its wake details of the captured coherent structures of turbulence are shown from different perspectives in fig 11 the flow is laminar in a band along the central line of the pressure side but it is easy to sense the numerical disturbance brought in through the geometric roughness as represented by the thin strings of the q isosurface the flow state transitions from laminar to turbulent across the lateral side of the vehicle the interlacing streamwise and circumferential vortices represent an alternative pressure distribution during the laminar turbulent transition as illustrated by the pressure contours shown in figs 12 and 13 the pressure variation is monotonic and regular on the pressure side of the vehicle at large angles but the disturbance propagation and the transition to turbulence can be clearly observed close to the two lateral sides this it is acknowledged that the flow tends to be disturbed when the pressure gradient is in the reverse direction to the stream so hydrostatic pressure will make the flow unstable at small angles say aoa 4 however the stability is strengthened at larger angles the cavitation number keeps dropping as the vehicle moves so the transient σ 0 as the apex reaches the water surface is adopted to represent a case numerical snapshots in the water exit course of different cases are shown with the 3d cavity shapes and the density distribution at the midsection the decreasing ambient hydrostatic pressure increases the size of the cavity during this time until it is pressed downward by the water surface figs 14 and 15 give upright water exit cases at different speeds the surfaces of the water and cavity are captured with a sharp density interface the cavity shape is regular and smooth particularly in the case of a relatively high speed the cavity on the shoulder keeps growing as the vehicle moves upward accomplished by the development of the re entrant water jet flowing backward into the cavity the dashed lines in fig 15 indicate that the front of the re entrant jet is almost stationary relative to the vehicle wall because the cavity closure itself develops downward as the jet moves upward relative to it the cavity is pinched off under the coaction of the jet and the water surface presses down the high pressure induced by the leading edge cavitation collapse produces notable water splashing and elevation another noticeable aspect is that the wake cavity presents repeated shrinkage and expansion until the tail of the vehicle leaves the water surface 30 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ l v 2 the pressure distribution on the vehicle surface evolves during cavity shedding fig 16 shows the pressure coefficients defined in eq 30 on the central line of the suction side in the time period 0 030 0 053 the pressure peak at the leading edge of the cavity propagates axially much faster than the high pressure of the cavity closure the maximal pressure peak appears when leading edge collapse occurs but a much stronger pressure will appear when the cavity finally collapses which is not presented here because of the finite time interval shown in the figure the collapsing pressure will be discussed in detail below significant effects of the water exit angle on the cavitation behaviour can be observed in fig 17 as the cavity drifts to the suction side the flow along the cavity surface will be reflected on oblique cavity closure to induce a re entrant jet directed to the suction side of the vehicle chen et al 2020 the cavitation appears to be extremely irregular on the suction side indicating the strong effects of adverse pressure on the turbulent flow structure the total volume of the vapor in the cavitation is recorded by integrating the vapor fraction α v over the domain as presented in fig 18 the cavities have different growth rates along the ascending branches of the curves in relation to the various speeds but the slopes of the descending branches are all the same this finding is understood as follows at the shedding stage the cavity is always beneath the water surface so the shrinkage is dominated by ambient pressure but has little to do with the vehicle fig 18 a and b show that the cavities have almost the same shrinkage rate regardless of the speed a higher speed corresponds to a larger cavity size which has a longer lifetime during shedding the comparisons shown in fig 18 c and e indicate that the angle has some influence on the cavity size but the effect is much weaker than those of the other parameters in fig 18 d it is counterintuitive that the maximum cavity size is smaller if the vehicle is initially submerged deeper in fact if the vehicle is initially placed shallower the flow built up around the vehicle will deviate more from its equilibrium state which makes the cavity tend to expand more violently as mentioned above the cavity is pinched off by the coaction of the re entrant jet front moving up and the water surface pressing down the pinch off effect is illustrated in fig 19 using the cavity profiles on the midsection and the vehicle surface the water surface prevents the leading edge of the cavity from following the vehicle while the jet front is almost immobile relative to the vehicle so pinch off occurs on the spot of the jet front an asymmetric pinch off occurs when an angle of attack exists as shown in fig 19 b the jet is directed to the suction side where the flow of the cavity tail is so turbulent that it breaks the cavity up in this case the cavity is first pinched off on the pressure side and then drifts to the suction side under the intersection of the two liquid vapor contact lines on the vehicle surface the jet front is still stationary at both the pressure and suction sides the slope of the contact line of the cavity leading edge keeps increasing until it intersects with the contact line of the cavity closure the jet fronts then remain stationary at the two opposite sides the flow structures shown in figs 20 and 21 explain the flow mechanism behind the axisymmetric and asymmetric pinch off with the aid of cavity shape flow velocity and the pressure coefficient in fig 20 as the shoulder of the vehicle emerges from the water level it begins to lose flow separation producing low pressure to drive cavity growth the water layer compresses the vapor at the front of the cavity where mass transfer from vapor to liquid rapidly occurs on the other hand the thin layer of the re entrant water jet moves very slowly v j 0 as indicated by the velocity vectors in the figure when a water exit angle exists the stream reflects on the cavity closure and flows tangentially along the cavity tail to the suction side so that the pressure side cavity is rarely affected by the re entrant jet and the cavity tail remains constant as cavitation develops the turbulence structures are significantly affected fig 22 shows the vortical structures of the cavitating flow during the water exit course the regular hairpin series appearing in the previous non cavitating case is restrained here due to the existence of the cavity which blocks the mechanism of the hairpin vortex generation this phenomenon is more obvious for larger cavities with greater angles of attack where a primary vortex ring sheds from the cavity closure connected to one or two irregular hairpin vortices on the wetted part of the suction side behind the cavity intensive streamwise vortex tubes are observed which are most typical in the case of the largest angle the cavity surface is full of numerous tollmien schlichting t s wave like structures that result from surface shearing these structures break up and disappear as the head of the vehicle rises out of the water then the structures are explored using the pressure distribution in fig 23 the cavity is not long on the suction side and the re entrant jet produces a cavity fracture where a locally high pressure appears then the adverse pressure induces the propagation of vortical structures along the upper fraction of the cavity we are interested in the hydrodynamic forces acting on the vehicle particularly the pressure feature dominated by the cavitation evolution during the water exit course in scale model experiments it is difficult to measure pressure sufficiently due to the difficulty in arranging so many pressure sensors on a vehicle s surface numerical pressure monitors are easily arranged intensively to record pressure signals at every time step during the simulation fig 24 illustrates the arrangement of the pressure monitors on the vehicle surface and in the wake there are 271 monitors placed on the surface in total numbered in sequence but marked every 10 monitors in the figure the axial spacing between each pair of neighbouring monitors on the surface is 0 01 l there are three additional monitors placed in the wake with spacings of 1 l the coordinates of the monitors are inputted into the solver through a text file so that they can be conveniently adjusted and flexibly refined the recorded pressure signals of the vertical case are depicted in fig 25 where the pressure coefficient is defined in eq 30 at least two pressure increases or peaks appear at each pressure monitor for the stage of cavity growth a uniform pressure increase occurs as the cavity tail sweeps over the monitor in the subsequent cavity shedding stage of the water exit there is a series of up to seven pressure peaks that appear one of which is overwhelmingly stronger than the others the first four sets of peaks are caused by the minor collapse of the cavitation cloud dropped from the upstream part of the cavity bulk the peaks in these sets are in fact not overlapping but are arranged in order if checked in an enlarged view however the extremely high pressure of the final collapse is sensed simultaneously by monitors across a wide area of the vehicle surface as explained by the primary peak in the enlarged view finally the last two sets of peaks are induced by the vehicle s tail leaving the water surface as well as the following collapse of the cavity figs 26 28 present the pressure signals recorded in cases with a water exit angle in the case of a small angle of aoa 4 fig 26 several monitors in the front part of the pressure side detect turbulence disturbance similar to the pressure distribution mentioned in fig 12 this result occurs because of the large adverse pressure gradient indicated by the great variation in the pressure coefficients across only several monitors from p004 to p007 in contrast the pressure signals p007 to p080 concentrate in a narrow band in the case of a larger angle of aoa 12 the pressure signals are smooth and the pressure gradient of the forepart monitors is lower than that in the case of a small angle high resolution pressure evolution during the cavitation period is considered in fig 27 when the cavity breaks on the pressure side see fig 17 for cavity evolution a third pressure increase with a strong peak is captured which is simultaneously sensed by the monitors around the collapsing point in addition the collapse energy is much lower than that of the axisymmetric case the collapsing point deviating to the suction side is then farther away from the vehicle wall the enlarged graph in fig 27 indicates that when the cavity shrinks to a sufficiently small size the second and third pressure peaks overlap the pressure on the suction side shown in fig 28 is notably different aside from the turbulent state of the pressure of the forepart monitors the pressure signals of most of the left monitors on the suction side are uniform 7 conclusions in the present work an les method with a uniform filter of an octree based isotropic mesh and an hric algorithm was employed to study the water exit course of a submerged vehicle launched upward with an emphasis on the turbulence structure and the pressure feature which have not been sufficiently investigated in previous work cases with various launch parameters including immersion depth navigation speed and angle of attack were simulated the water surface and cavitation evolution were captured with a high resolution and the turbulent vortical structures of the non cavitating and cavitating flows were finely captured and discussed in detail the primary conclusions and findings are summarized as follows 1 cavity shedding with a pinch off effect of the travelling vapor liquid contact line was observed the pinch off effect was determined to be caused by the coaction of the water surface pressing down and the stationary re entrant jet front the effect of the oblique contact line makes the cavitation drift to the suction side and cause irregular shedding 2 the adverse pressure gradient makes the flow sensitive to numerical disturbance which is amplified to a laminar turbulent transition to form coherent turbulence structures the structures gradually separate in the stream direction and develop into a series of hairpin vortices the stretch of the primary hairpin vortex legs contributes to the growth of the secondary and third hairpin vortices 3 as cavitation begins to develop around the vehicle the features of the turbulence structures are significantly affected the regular hairpin series are restrained because the existence of the cavity attached to the leading edge blocks the mechanism of hairpin vortex generation the cavity surface is full of t s wave like vortical structures formed by shearing at the liquid vapor interface 4 specific pressure signals were observed increasing as the pressure monitors move in and out of the cavitation region and finally overlapping with the simultaneous pressure peaks induced by the final cavitation collapse credit authorship

20958,the hydrofoil a basic blade cross section shape is widely used in various hydraulic machinery we establish two bionic hydrofoil models sside and stop through 3d reverse engineering and numerically simulate these models with large eddy simulation to reveal the transient evolution mechanism of the cavitating flow of a bionic hydrofoil the simulation results of the classic clark y

lift force can meet the designer s requirements in accordance with this theory the traditional airfoil has been widely used in the fields of aerospace propeller hydrofoil wind power blade section airfoil tidal energy power blade airfoil and other fields with the development of science and technology people are no longer satisfied with the dynamic performance provided by traditional wings with the expansion of application fields such as marine water jet propeller underwater vehicles and other large scale use of hydraulic machinery fluid medium density and viscosity change resulting in the variation of reynolds number re and strouhal number st of detouring flow in a high speed operation the leading edge of the airfoil is prone to cavitating flow cloud cavitation and other complex unstable flows in long term operation in the cavitation state it easily forms cavitation corrosion damages the wall of hydraulic machinery and induces vibration and noise thereby seriously affecting performance kim et al 2019 jaiswal et al 2019 research on a new bionic hydrofoil and revelation its lift drag characteristics and unsteady cavitating flow is necessary and the corresponding findings can serve as basic support to meet the new development needs of hydraulic machinery bionics research has achieved much in the past decades researchers have found that different creatures produce lift in different ways the leading edge vortices generate lifting forces when bats fly slowly muijres et al 2008 whereas butterflies relied on a wide range of aerodynamic mechanisms to take off manipulate maintain stable flight and land srygley et al 2002 researchers have successfully copied the wings of flying creatures and established a large scale mechanical flapping model with flying creatures as the object so that the machines generated lift e g birch and dickinson 2001 dickinson et al 1999 the bionic airfoil which was built with wings of birds such as the long eared owl and domestic swallow could improve the lift characteristics of bionic slats ge et al 2013 reduce the resistance of bionic fans tian et al 2017 and improve the aerodynamic characteristics of fan blades zhang et al 2013 tian et al 2013 moreover the zigzag shape structure of the leading edge of the wing and the trailing edge of the feather was applied to the blade of the axial flow fan and a good noise reduction effect was also achieved ge et al 2014 liu et al 2014 the bionic design based on the body surface characteristics of dolphins and turtles could effectively improve the turbulent boundary layer and velocity distribution of the surface flow field and achieved the purpose of reducing drag and increasing efficiency fish et al 2011 bushnell et al 1991 pu et al 2016 common features were present in the abovementioned bionic studies the bionic object and the application machine had the same fluid medium air and the boundary conditions were similar thereby ensuring the basic conditions of geometric similarity however when traditional airfoil or bionic airfoil with air as the similar medium was applied to the field of hydraulic machinery cavitating flow easily forms changing the traditional airfoil geometry could improve cavitation performance yan et al 2018 numerical and experimental studies on unsteady cavitating flow have always been popular in the academic field in experimental research particle image velocimetry piv technology is used to conduct studies on the process of cavitating flow around hydrofoils tassin et al 1995 which was a non contact method to measure instantaneous cavity motion experts in the field of fluid mechanics successfully captured the cavitating flows of the classic naca0015 hydrofoil and clark hydrofoil by using this method studied the unsteady cavitating flow around the hydrofoils and its relationship with the impact of thermal cavitation cervone et al 2006 analysed the influence of leading edge vortex on the flow of airfoil stolt et al 2019 and compared the cavitating flow of semi circular leading edge plate and naca0015 hydrofoil kravtsova et al 2014 and the unsteady structure of the plate and cloud cavitation huang et al 2013 in numerical research a numerical simulation based on computational fluid dynamics cfd is conducted researchers used the averaged navier stokes method huang 2011 2017 unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans long et al 2017 volume of fluid vof method karim et al 2014 imine et al 2015 and large eddy simulation les ji et al 2015 movahedian et al 2019 to visually simulate the cavitating flow of naca0015 naca0012 and clark hydrofoils and obtained the cavitating flow under different conditions then the data were compared with the experimental results and numerical simulation was able to accurately predict the sheet and cloud cavitation within a certain accuracy range the results of les were closer to the experimental results the abovementioned research results show that the design of airfoil is used in the field of aerodynamics whereas in the field of hydrodynamics the classic airfoils naca series and clark y hydrofoils are mostly selected directly with narrow application range and lack of sufficient hydrofoil samples fish live in almost all the aquatic environments on the earth from freshwater lakes and rivers to saltwater seas and oceans their shape allows superior hydrodynamic performance both top and side views are hydrofoil characteristics that provide materials for this study therefore this paper uses sturgeons as the research object to design the bionic hydrofoils and uses a method for the b spline curve to build their physical models les is used to solve their lift drag characteristics and unsteady cavitating flow under different schemes in comparison with those of classic naca0015 and clark y hydrofoils finally the merits and demerits of each scheme are revealed to obtain the law of lift drag characteristic variation and the mechanism of cavitation evolution thus a new method for the basic research of hydro mechanical blades is achieved 2 bionic hydrofoil design and numerical simulation 2 1 physical model as shown in fig 1 a we select three sturgeons as the research object in consideration of the errors caused by different physical sizes in the collection of data and point coordinates we added an assumption that the effect of the elastic deformation of the body surface is not considered when establishing the bionic airfoil to increase the scientificity and rigor of this study huang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 and we use a high precision 0 03 mm noncontact 3d reverse scanner to obtain the body surface characteristics of the sturgeons as illustrated in fig 1 b after obtaining

obtained as shown in fig 1 c finally the control points are fitted with a b spline curve to build the bionic hydrofoil physical model and considering that the sturgeon is a three dimensional creature it is one sided to demonstrate the superiority of the obtained bionic hydrofoil from one direction we obtain two types of bionic hydrofoil from two directions the symmetric bionic hydrofoil stop and the asymmetric bionic hydrofoil sside as shown in fig 1 d 2 2 numerical simulation les is used to simulate the lift drag characteristics and unsteady cavitating flow of two bionic hydrofoils and the control equation that is discretised by the finite volume method is a two phase mixture model the diffusion term of the equation is a central difference scheme and the separation semi implicit pressure coupling algorithm is used to solve the equation zwart equation based on rayleile plesset is used to describe the mass transfer process between the occurrence and collapse of the cavitating and fluid flows for the vapor liquid two phase mixing model the fluid is assumed to be homogeneous thus the multiphase fluid components have the same velocity and pressure the gas phase control equation is 1 t α v ρ v α v ρ v v m m where α v is the volume fraction of the vapor ρ v is the density of the vapor and m and m represent the mass transfer rates of evaporation and condensation

in the liquid ρ 1 is the density of the liquid and f v a p and f c o n d represent the evaporation and condensation coefficients respectively in this work we take α n u c 5 10 4 r b 10 6 f v a p is set to 50 and f c o n d is set to 0 01 on the basis of the incompressible navier stokes equations the governing equations consisting of the mass and momentum conservation equation can be written as

defined as 11 τ i j ρ m u i u j u i u j the computational domain is shown in fig 1 e and the chord length c 70 mm the inlet velocity is set at 10 m s and the outlet pressure is adjusted according to the cavitation number the hydrofoil wall surface is set as the no sliding wall boundary all the properties of water in the numerical simulation process are consistent with those of kim et al 2015 the time step is set as 0 1 ms and the calculation steps are set as 4000 steps icem software code is used to divide the calculation area into a hexahedral mesh taking the sside and stop as an example other schemes adopt the same mesh division method the mesh near the hydrofoil are encrypted as shown in fig 1 f the mesh number is verified by grid independence the lift coefficient of the bionic hydrofoil changes accordingly with the increase in mesh number as shown in table 1 when the grid number is increased from grid 1 to grid 4 the lift coefficient c l changes considerably the increase in the lift coefficient c l of sside and stop schemes from grid 4 to grid 5 is less than 1 indicating that change occurs only in the third place after the decimal point the influence of the increase in mesh number on the flow field can be ignored we finally select grid 4 as the final grid number to reduce the computational workload 3 results and discussions 3 1 validation of les fig 2 shows the distribution of unsteady cavitating flow around the classic asymmetric clark y hydrofoil symmetric naca0015 hydrofoil and bionic hydrofoil sside and stop when the cavitation number σ 0 8 the results are compared with those of wang et al 2001 and roohi et al 2013 the test time of the laser doppler velocity ldv experiment is 0 50 ms and the test interval of experimental equipment is 0 1 ms which is the same as the setting of the numerical simulation experiment the expression of the cavitation number σ is σ 2 p p v ρ u 0 2 where p v is the saturated vapor pressure of 25 c water compared with fig 2 a 2 b and 2 c for the asymmetric clark y hydrofoil in one cycle the cavitating flow around the hydrofoil s surface first appears as an attached cavity and its breakdown cavity shedding cavity breakdown and attached cavity are shown in this process the results are obtained by the numerical calculation method results are highly consistent with the experimental results of wang et al 2001 and roohi et al 2013 in terms of the position of the attached cavity or the shape and size of cavity shedding and breakdown thereby proving the correctness of the les in the current study after verifying the accuracy of the numerical simulation results in this paper the water properties and boundary conditions used in the calculation of sside stop and naca0015 hydrofoils are the same as those mentioned above which can be better compared and the conclusion is correct comparing fig 2 c with fig 2 d the position of the attached cavity in the sside moves backward the starting point of the attached cavity appears at the position of the hydrofoil s maximum thickness where the cavity breakdown is more likely to form resulting in the larger impact of the vortex shedding and the cloud cavitation this finding indicates that the cavitating flow is related to the geometric shape of the leading edge of the hydrofoil the leading edge of the sside is like a sloping line from starting point to the maximum thickness that results in the separation point of fluid flow movement back to the maximum thickness making the leading edge unfavorable for the formation of the attached cavity comparing 2 e and fig 2 f the symmetrical stop and the classic naca0015 hydrofoil have similar variation laws of cavitating flow the difference is that the impact of the cavity shedding of stop is relatively small the impact on the mainstream is relatively small 3 2 lift drag characteristics 3 2 1 comparison of eight hydrofoils naca series hydrofoils are very popular in the design of hydraulic machinery blades and they are still widely used to better study the lift drag characteristics of the bionic hydrofoil we select three common symmetrical hydrofoils naca0015 naca0012 naca0009 and three common asymmetric hydrofoils clark y naca4412 naca66 and compare their lift drag characteristics as shown in fig 3 fig 3 a and b show that for an asymmetric hydrofoil the lift and drag show periodic fluctuations and the frequencies of the lift and drag fluctuations are the same their general trend is that the first curve reaches the first peak from the trough over time then the curve drops slightly then reaches the second peak after the middle is relatively stable and then decreases rapidly from the peak to the end of the first cycle the lift coefficient and the drag coefficient fluctuation range of the bionic hydrofoil sside are small indicating that its lift and drag are stable the lift and drag of symmetric hydrofoils also show periodic fluctuations but these fluctuations are more severe than those of asymmetric hydrofoils the average lift coefficients drag coefficients and lift drag ratios are provided in table 2 for the further comparison of the lift drag coefficients of the eight hydrofoils the table shows that the lift coefficients of the asymmetric hydrofoil are obviously greater than those of the symmetric hydrofoil among asymmetric hydrofoils the bionic hydrofoil sside has the largest lift coefficient and its lift drag ratio is also higher than that of the other three hydrofoils among the symmetric hydrofoils the bionic hydrofoil stop has the highest lift coefficient and the smallest drag coefficient and its lift drag ratio is higher than the other three common hydrofoils the bionic hydrofoil better lift drag and hydrodynamic characteristics than the common hydrofoil whether it is asymmetric or not 3 2 2 the effect of cavitation numbers fig 4 shows the lift drag characteristic curves and pressure coefficient c p distribution of the four hydrofoils in the figure the expressions of lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d are c l f l 0 5 ρ u 0 2 c b and c d f d 0 5 ρ u 0 2 c b where b is the span wise length u 0 is the starting point flow rate and f l and f d are the lift and drag of hydrofoil respectively the pressure coefficient c p is expressed as c p 2 p ρ u 0 2 the dotted lines named as ① ② and ③ in the figure represent the lift coefficient and drag coefficient corresponding to σ 0 8 σ 1 2 and σ 1 6 respectively it can be seen from the figure that the lift coefficient of the asymmetric hydrofoil is significantly larger than that of the symmetric hydrofoil due to the large c p value difference between the upper and the lower parts of the asymmetric hydrofoil in particular the c p value at the lower part of the hydrofoil is large with increasing cavitation number the difference of c p value between the upper and lower parts of asymmetric hydrofoil increases gradually whereas the difference of the c p value between the upper and lower parts of symmetric hydrofoil increases first and then decreases comparing the lift drag characteristics of asymmetric sside bionic and clark y hydrofoils the c l value increases linearly with increasing cavitation number in a certain range before reaching the inflection point the c l value of clark y hydrofoil is larger than that of sside whereas the difference of c d curve is relatively small the difference is that the position of inflection point in the sside moves to σ 1 4 which means that the flow stall improves obviously and the fluid flow is more stable when c l curve reaches the inflection point the c l value tends to be stable with increasing cavitation number compared with clark y hydrofoil the c d value of sside is smaller after the inflection point comparing the lift drag characteristics of symmetrical stop bionic hydrofoil and naca0015 hydrofoil it can be concluded that inflection points also exist on the curves of c l and c d before the stop reaches the inflection point its lift coefficient is lower than that of naca0015 hydrofoil and after the inflection point its c l value is superior to that of naca0015 hydrofoil the inflection point is the stall point compared with naca0015 hydrofoil the stall point of stop also moves backward with better adaptability 3 3 the evolution of transient cavitating flow for bionic hydrofoils fig 5 a reveals that the c l and c d curves show obvious periodic changes with time under different cavitation numbers σ the c l and c d curves show similar changes and peaks and troughs appear at the same time taking σ 1 2 as an example red line in the figure the c l and c d value are closely related to the amount of cavity at the leading edge of the asymmetric bionic hydrofoil sside the results are as follows when c l and c d value are maximum peak the cavitating flow corresponding to point ① occurs in the middle and rear of the asymmetric sside which is reflected as the cavity shedding flow with increasing time c l and c d value achieve the minimum value trough and correspond to the cavitating flow at point ② at this time the leading edge of the asymmetric sside has a cavity which is accompanied by the tearing of the cavity with continuous time increase the amount of cavity at the leading edge decreases continuously and c l and c d values increase gradually until the maximum value peak reappears the cavitating flow on the right side of the figure shows that the cavitating flow around the sside changes in one cycle when the surface tension of the cavity is less than the total force exerted on the surface by the fluid the cavitation breaks and the phenomenon of shedding cavity ensues when the cavity bubble moves with the fluid in the direction of flow it rotates and moves in the direction of the mainstream expands upward and finally disappears in the mainstream for the symmetrical stop as shown in fig 5 b the change law of c l and c d curves is similar to that of the asymmetric sside and the c l and c d values are closely related to the amount of cavity at the leading edge of the bionic hydrofoils the peaks on the c l and c d curves correspond to ⑥ when the leading edge has no cavity on the contrary the troughs on the c l and c d curves correspond to ④ when the leading edge cavity is the maximum and the cavity length is the largest the lift coefficient c l of symmetric bionic hydrofoil stop increases first and then becomes stable with the cavitation number σ and the inflection point appears near σ 1 2 in the numerical simulation the increase of σ will increase the whole pressure field and the pressure coefficient near the pressure surface will also increase however the pressure coefficient on the suction surface can not form a stable pressure coefficient due to the influence of cavitation which can be explained by the change of pressure coefficient field on the right side of fig 5 when the cavitation number is small the stop leading edge of the symmetrical bionic hydrofoil can form a stable cavity as shown in fig 8 this may be the main reason for the increase of lift coefficient c l watanabe et al 2014 with the increase of cavitation σ the stable cavity is destroyed and part of the cavity becomes unstable the cavity often falls off from its trailing edge and oscillates when the local cavity oscillation changes to the transition cavity oscillation the lift coefficient starts to increase again and then remains stable it can be seen from fig 5 b that the c l value of stop hydrofoil under the condition of σ 1 2 will increase greatly after three cycles this is due to the special geometric structure of the symmetrical bionic hydrofoil stop which can force the formation of a stable cavity under large cavitation number and this cavity will be destroyed when σ 1 2 fig 6 shows the velocity fluctuation curve of the bionic hydrofoil under different cavitation numbers in the figure x c represents the ratio of x coordinate to chord length c along the flow direction whereas y c represents the ratio of y coordinate to chord length c perpendicular to the flow direction the expression of velocity fluctuation is u u 0 u 0 which reflects the difference between the fluid particle and initial velocities it can be see that the velocity fluctuation is related to the cavitation number and the position of coordinate x c near the leading edge of the bionic hydrofoil the velocity fluctuation increases with increasing cavitation number along the y axis direction the velocity fluctuation is a relatively small near the bone line of the hydrofoil as the fluid particles continue to move forward the velocity fluctuation tends to be stable when the fluid particle reaches x c 0 2 obvious velocity fluctuation appears near the bone line on the hydrofoil which is related to the location of cavitation in fig 5 with the backward movement of the fluid particle the influence range of the velocity fluctuation in the y axis direction increases gradually at x c 1 0 the influence range has expanded to the position of y c 0 3 moreover the velocity fluctuation decreases with increasing cavitation number near the hydrofoil bone line in the same position for the stop the variation trend of velocity fluctuation is similar to that of the sside the difference is that the velocity fluctuation curves at the y axis of the σ 1 2 are closer to the velocity fluctuation curve of σ 0 8 whereas the sside shows that the velocity fluctuation curve of the cavitation number σ 1 2 is closer to the velocity fluctuation curve of σ 1 6 moreover the distance between the velocity fluctuation curve of σ 1 2 and that of σ 1 6 is reduced when x c 0 4 they coincide and the difference tends to be zero when x c 0 4 the velocity fluctuation of σ 1 2 is significantly larger than that of σ 1 6 the trend increases gradually with the change of the fluid particle to the trailing edge of the bionic hydrofoil u v u 0 2 is the expression of reynolds stress which reflects the additional stress of fluid particles caused by turbulent pulsating motion fig 7 a shows that the value of reynolds stress u v u 0 2 is related to the σ value and the position of coordinate x c when σ 0 8 the leading edge of the sside is not affected by the cavity the value of u v u 0 2 increases gradually along the y axis direction and the maximum value is near the hydrofoil bone line the value u v u 0 2 tends to gradually become stable as it moves towards the y axis positive direction with increasing σ value the value u v u 0 2 also increases gradually and the changing trend is consistent with that when σ 0 8 with the fluid particle moving to the trailing edge of the bionic hydrofoil the u v u 0 2 value under different cavitation numbers decreases gradually when x c 0 4 the fluid particle moves to the trailing edge of the bionic hydrofoil and the u v u 0 2 value shows amplitude revealing a trend of gradual increase near the trailing edge of the bionic hydrofoil in the y axis direction the u v u 0 2 value decreases first and then increases when y c 0 2 the value u v u 0 2 reaches the maximum which is related to the continuous expansion of the cavity to the outside after falling off for the stop the variation trend of u v u 0 2 value is similar to that of the sside however due to the different geometric constructions the value of u v u 0 2 still largely varies at the leading edge of the stop the value of u v u 0 2 increases first and then decreases in the y axis direction according to fig 5 b few cavities exist near the leading edge of stop thereby affecting the distribution of u v u 0 2 value with the fluid particle moving towards the trailing edge of the hydrofoil the value of u v u 0 2 under different cavitation numbers decreases continuously when x c 0 4 the value of u v u 0 2 becomes negative and the closer it is to the trailing edge the smaller it becomes moreover in the direction of the y axis near the trailing edge of the bionic hydrofoil the value of u v u 0 2 is similar to that of the sside they all achieve the maximum value when y c 0 2 3 4 maximum cavity length lmax fig 8 a shows the change law of cavity length l with time when cavitation number σ 0 8 and σ 1 6 for sside and the lower part of the figure shows the velocity streamlines it can be seen from the figure that l max is related to the cavitation number σ the larger the cavitation number is the less the cavity is and the smaller the l max is when the cavitation number σ 0 8 the starting position of the cavity is 0 25c the maximum thickness of the bionic hydrofoil and it continuously extends to the vicinity of the trailing edge with increasing time the l max changes periodically a re entrant flow is found at about 1 15c and then it moves towards the leading edge of hydrofoil until the cavity breaks down and falls off the influence length of this part of the cavity after falling off is the largest and its value is about 1 68c the slanted dotted line in the figure represents the extension point of the cavity there is a change process of cavity falling behind in the range of 1 4t 2 4t and the cavity decreases with the main flow in the interval of 2 4t 3 4t the cavity appears to backflow and continuously flows towards the leading edge of the bionic hydrofoil the abovementioned phenomena can be explained by the velocity streamlines below as shown in the figure in the velocity streamline diagram of 2 4t 4 4t the starting point of the re entrant flow is continuously toward the leading edge of the hydrofoil and the direction is inclined upward along the hydrofoil bone line in the range of 3 4t 4 4t the initial cavity appears at the maximum thickness of the bionic hydrofoil and extends to the mainstream until it is connected with the cavity at the trailing edge as a whole for the stop the l max is similar to that of sside however the l max is about 1 74c and the starting point of cavity backflow appears near 1 2c fig 8 b shows that the velocity of the primary cavitating flow into the mainstream is greater than that of the detached cavitating flow into the mainstream when the two merge the l max is formed and then disappears in the mainstream soon 3 5 evolution law of vortex in bionic hydrofoil fig 9 shows the evolution of the vortex of the bionic hydrofoil within a period on the left side of the figure the vorticity of the bionic hydrofoils is identified by the q criterion which is defined as q ω 2 s 2 2 ω represents the vorticity amplitude and s represents the strain rate tensor on the right side the three columns represent vortex stretching term the vortex dilatation term and the baroclinic torque the vortex stretching term ω v denotes the stretching and the tilting of a vortex due to the velocity gradients the vortex dilatation term ω v comes from the volumetric expansion contraction and the baroclinic torque ρ m ρ ρ m 2 represents the generation of vorticity due to the misaligned pressure and the density gradients it can be seen from the figure that the evolution process of the 3d vortex structure of the asymmetric sside in one cycle the vortices are formed in two positions one is near the leading edge and the other is at the later of the maximum thickness in which the latter plays a major role from the stretch of the vortex in the x axis direction it appears at the later part of its maximum thickness with the movement of the fluid particles the vortex continues to stretch in the x axis and y axis directions compared with the stretch of the vortex the influence range of the dilatation of the vortex is obviously weakened but it still shows the law of continuous diffusion around the vortex caused by the baroclinic torque appears near the trailing edge although it is not as significant as the stretching and dilatation of the vortex the baroclinic torque term is very important it may be the main mechanism of the cavity vortex the vortex formation positions of symmetrical bionic hydrofoil stop and asymmetric bionic hydrofoil sside appear in two positions one is near the leading edge the other is later than the maximum thickness of the airfoil and the latter plays a major role and will gradually develop to the trailing edge of the hydrofoil in this respect the evolution of the vortices of the two hydrofoils is similar however many differences exist between them for example a relatively stable attached vortex can be formed near the leading edge of the symmetrical stop the stretching and dilatation of the vortex indicate that compared with the asymmetric sside the stretching influence range of the symmetric stop is weaker however for the baroclinic torque term that determines the cavity vortex the symmetric stop is obviously stronger this finding shows that the vortex of the symmetrical stop rotates more violently 3 6 unsteady flow and main frequency characteristics of bionic hydrofoils this section analyses the unsteady flow characteristics of bionic hydrofoils from the pressure fluctuation coefficient c p fig 10 a shows that the c p of each monitoring point of the asymmetric sside changes periodically with time the variation amplitude of the c p of point 1 at the leading edge of the hydrofoil is relatively small compared with other monitoring points the more the fluid particle moves towards the trailing edge the more intense the change of c p becomes which is consistent with the location of the re entrant flow area in fig 8 the cavitation number also changes the law of c p the increase of the cavitation number increases the amplitude of c p and the position of the cavitation number with different amplitudes also changes greatly the larger the cavitation number is the earlier the position will be taking point 2 as an example when the cavitation number σ 0 8 the pulsation amplitude t 0 195s and the c p value is 1 17 when the cavitation number σ 1 2 the pulsation amplitude t 0 012 s and the c p value is 2 4 when the cavitation number σ 1 6 the pulsation amplitude t 0 08s and the c p value is 3 66 compared with the asymmetrical sside the symmetrical stop has a similar change law and the c p value changes periodically with time the size of c p value is related to the cavitation number for example the larger the cavitation number σ is the larger the c p value will be the time corresponding to the occurrence of the maximum value is the same however the difference between them is that the c p value of the symmetrical stop is slightly higher than that of the sside fig 11 a shows that the change law of spectrum distribution characteristic curves of asymmetrical sside is different from various monitoring points and the change of the spectrum amplitude of the point 1 curve at the leading edge is relatively small with the fluid particle moving towards the trailing edge the spectrum distribution characteristic curve changes relatively violently especially in the vicinity of monitoring points 4 5 and 6 the spectrum amplitude appears in the low frequency region and is related to the cavitation number when cavitation σ 0 8 the main frequency of different monitoring points does not change and all are 33 56 hz when the cavitation number σ 1 2 the main frequency of different monitoring points 1 4 has not changed and all are 42 55 hz however near the trailing edge although the main frequency at the monitoring point 5 is still 42 55 hz a spectrum amplitude also appears at 13 42 hz with an intensity that is not much different from the main frequency at monitoring point 6 the main frequency becomes 26 84 hz when the cavitation number σ 1 6 the main frequency also does not change and both are 73 83 hz the closer the monitoring point is to the trailing edge the greater the amplitude will be compared with the asymmetrical sside the spectrum distribution curve of the symmetrical stop has a similar change law the difference is that when the cavitation number σ 0 8 the dominant frequency is 34 72 hz when the cavitation number σ 1 2 the main frequency of leading edge and trailing edge monitoring points 1 2 3 and 6 is 48 61 hz the main frequency of monitoring points 4 and 5 in the middle position of hydrofoil changes violently and the regularity is not strong when the cavitation number σ 1 6 the main frequency is not obvious near the leading edge but when it is in the middle of the hydrofoil and close to the trailing edge the main frequency appears to be near 100 hz two similar peaks appear in succession corresponding to the main frequencies of 90 91 and 115 15 hz 4 conclusions taking sturgeon as the research object the physical models of asymmetric sside and symmetrical stop are established from the perspective of the top and side views respectively the numerical simulation of the two bionic hydrofoils is conducted by les and their lift coefficient and drag coefficient cavitating flow and unsteady flows are obtained through comparative analysis the following conclusions are obtained compared with the les results and experimental results of the classic asymmetric clark y hydrofoil it is found that in one cycle from the attached cavity and its breakdown cavity shedding cavity breakdown and re attachment of cavity the two results show a high degree of consistency in terms of the location of the generation of an attached cavity and the shape and size of shedding cavity thereby verifying the accuracy of the numerical calculation method used in this study the lift coefficient c l of asymmetric hydrofoils sside and clark y hydrofoils is significantly higher than that of symmetric hydrofoils stop and naca0015 hydrofoils compared with the traditional clark y and naca0015 hydrofoils the inflection point in the lift drag curves of the sside and stop moves backward and the flow stall is significantly alleviated the extreme values of lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d curves are related to the range and position of the cavity when no cavitation is present in the leading edge of the bionic hydrofoils the maximum values of c l and c d appear the minimum values of c l and c d appear when more cavities exist in the leading edge and the length of the cavity is the maximum the maximum cavity length l max is related to the geometric construction and cavitation number of the bionic hydrofoil the larger the cavitation number is the less the cavity will be compared with the l max of sside l max 1 68c the l max of stop is larger with a value of 1 74c from the curves reflecting the reynolds stress the u v u 0 2 value is related to the cavitation number σ the larger the cavitation number σ is the larger the u v u 0 2 value is in the y axis direction the u v u 0 2 value decreases first and then increases reaching the maximum value when y c 0 2 the formation position of the vortex of the sside appears in two places one is near the leading edge and the other is at the later part of the maximum thickness of the hydrofoil the latter plays the main role and spreads to all sides with the fluid flow compared with vortex stretching the influence range of the vortex dilatation is significantly weakened the vortex caused by the baroclinic torque appears near the trailing edge which is closely related to the position of the cavity compared with the sside the stop forms a relatively stable attached vortex near the leading edge the influence range of the vortex is obviously weak and the baroclinic torque term of the cavity vortex is obviously enhanced the main frequency that affects the unsteady flow around the hydrofoil is related to the cavitation number the larger the cavitation number is the larger the main frequency and the larger the spectrum amplitude will be under the same cavitation number the main frequency of the leading edge of the hydrofoil does not change the spectrum amplitude near the trailing edge increase and the main frequency change greatly which is related to the frequency of cavity breakdown when the bionic hydrofoil is different its main frequency also changes the main frequency of the stop is slightly larger than that

20958,the hydrofoil a basic blade cross section shape is widely used in various hydraulic machinery we establish two bionic hydrofoil models sside and stop through 3d reverse engineering and numerically simulate these models with large eddy simulation to reveal the transient evolution mechanism of the cavitating flow of a bionic hydrofoil the simulation results of the classic clark y hydrofoil are highly consistent with the experimental results in a single cycle the lift drag coefficient is related to the leading edge amount and cavity range the cavitation number affects the lift drag coefficient and cavity length l and large cavitation numbers are associated with small values of lift drag coefficient and cavity length in contrast to the sside scheme the stop scheme forms a relatively stable attachment vortex near the leading edge the influence range of the vortex stretching is weak and the baroclinic torque term that determines the cavity vortex is enhanced the pressure

lift force can meet the designer s requirements in accordance with this theory the traditional airfoil has been widely used in the fields of aerospace propeller hydrofoil wind power blade section airfoil tidal energy power blade airfoil and other fields with the development of science and technology people are no longer satisfied with the dynamic performance provided by traditional wings with the expansion of application fields such as marine water jet propeller underwater vehicles and other large scale use of hydraulic machinery fluid medium density and viscosity change resulting in the variation of reynolds number re and strouhal number st of detouring flow in a high speed operation the leading edge of the airfoil is prone to cavitating flow cloud cavitation and other complex unstable flows in long term operation in the cavitation state it easily forms cavitation corrosion damages the wall of hydraulic machinery and induces vibration and noise thereby seriously affecting performance kim et al 2019 jaiswal et al 2019 research on a new bionic hydrofoil and revelation its lift drag characteristics and unsteady cavitating flow is necessary and the corresponding findings

the abovementioned bionic studies the bionic object and the application machine had the same fluid medium air and the boundary conditions were similar thereby ensuring the basic conditions of geometric similarity however when traditional airfoil or bionic airfoil with air as the similar medium was applied to the field of hydraulic machinery cavitating flow easily forms changing the traditional airfoil geometry could improve cavitation performance yan et al 2018 numerical and experimental studies on unsteady cavitating flow have always been popular in the academic field in experimental research particle image velocimetry piv technology is used to conduct studies on the process of cavitating flow around hydrofoils tassin et al 1995 which was a non contact method to measure instantaneous cavity motion experts in the field of fluid mechanics successfully captured the cavitating flows of the classic naca0015 hydrofoil and clark hydrofoil by using this method studied the unsteady cavitating flow around the hydrofoils and its relationship with the impact of thermal cavitation cervone et al 2006 analysed the influence of leading edge vortex on the flow of airfoil stolt et al 2019 and compared the cavitating flow of semi circular leading edge plate and naca0015 hydrofoil kravtsova et al 2014 and the unsteady structure of the plate and cloud cavitation huang et al 2013 in numerical research a numerical simulation based on computational fluid dynamics cfd is conducted researchers used the averaged navier stokes method huang 2011 2017 unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans long et al 2017 volume of fluid vof method karim et al 2014 imine et al 2015 and large eddy simulation les ji et al 2015 movahedian et al 2019 to visually simulate the cavitating flow of naca0015 naca0012 and clark hydrofoils and obtained the cavitating flow under different conditions then the data were compared with the experimental results and numerical simulation was able to accurately predict the sheet and cloud cavitation within a certain accuracy range the results of les were closer to the experimental results the abovementioned research results show that the design of airfoil is used in the field of aerodynamics whereas in the field of hydrodynamics the classic airfoils naca series and clark y hydrofoils are mostly selected directly with narrow application range and lack of sufficient hydrofoil samples fish live in almost all the aquatic environments on the earth from freshwater lakes and rivers to saltwater seas and oceans their shape allows superior hydrodynamic performance both top and side views are hydrofoil characteristics that provide materials for this study therefore this paper uses sturgeons as the research object to design the bionic hydrofoils and uses a method for the b spline curve to build their physical models les is used to solve their lift drag characteristics and unsteady cavitating flow under different schemes in comparison with those of classic naca0015 and clark y hydrofoils finally the merits and demerits of each scheme are revealed to obtain the law of lift drag characteristic variation and the mechanism of cavitation evolution thus a new method for the basic research of hydro mechanical blades is achieved 2 bionic hydrofoil design and numerical simulation 2 1 physical model as shown in fig 1 a we select three sturgeons as the research object in consideration of the errors caused by different physical sizes in the collection of data and point coordinates we added an assumption that the effect of the elastic deformation of the body surface is not considered when establishing the bionic airfoil to increase the scientificity and rigor of this study huang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 and we use a high precision 0 03 mm noncontact 3d reverse scanner to obtain the body surface characteristics of the sturgeons as illustrated in fig 1 b after obtaining editable data from geomagic design x software two dimensionless parameters χ and ψ are defined for χ x i c ψ f u i f l i δ max c is the chord length of the bionic airfoil f u i is the distance from the upper bone line of the hydrofoil at x i point to the chord length and f l i is the distance from the lower bone line of the hydrofoil at x i point to the chord length we choose the value of χ as 0 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 95 and 1 0 yan et al 2020 on the basis of these values and after averaging the data of the three sturgeons a 3d physical model of the sturgeon is obtained as shown in fig 1 c finally the control points are fitted with a b spline curve to build the bionic hydrofoil physical model and considering that the sturgeon is a three dimensional creature it is one sided to demonstrate the superiority of the obtained bionic hydrofoil from one direction we obtain two types of bionic hydrofoil from two directions the symmetric bionic hydrofoil stop and the asymmetric bionic hydrofoil sside as shown in fig 1 d 2 2 numerical simulation les is used to simulate the lift drag characteristics and unsteady cavitating flow of two bionic hydrofoils and the control equation that is discretised by the finite volume method is a two phase mixture model the diffusion term of the equation is a central difference scheme and the separation semi implicit pressure coupling algorithm is used to solve the equation zwart equation based on rayleile plesset is used to describe the mass transfer process between the occurrence and collapse of the cavitating and fluid flows for the vapor liquid two phase mixing model the fluid is assumed to be homogeneous thus the multiphase fluid components have the same velocity and pressure the gas phase control equation is 1 t α v ρ v α v ρ v v m m where α v is the volume fraction of the vapor ρ v is the density of the vapor and m and m represent the mass transfer rates of evaporation and condensation respectively when p p v 2 m f v a p 3 1 α v α n u c ρ v r b 2 3 p v p ρ l when p p v 3 m f c o n d 3 α v ρ v r b 2 3 p p v ρ l p v is the vapor pressure α n u c is the proportion of noncondensable gas in the liquid ρ 1 is the density of the liquid and f v a p and f c o n d represent the evaporation and condensation coefficients respectively in this work we take α n u c 5 10 4 r b 10 6 f v a p is set to 50 and f c o n d is set to 0 01 on the basis of the incompressible navier stokes equations the governing equations consisting of the mass and momentum conservation equation can be written as follows 4 ρ m t ρ m u i x i 0 5 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j where u is the dynamic viscosity and ρ m is the mixture density which are defined as 6 μ α i μ i α v μ v 1 α v μ l 7 ρ m α i ρ i α v μ v 1 α v μ l the filter function g x x is defend as 8 g x x 1 v c x v c 0 x o t h e r w i s e where v c is the volume of the calculation cell the mass and momentum conservation equations are filtered through the above formula to obtain the les equation 9 p t ρ m u i x i 0 10 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j ν 2 u i x j x j p x i τ i j x j where τ i j is the subgrid scaled stress which is defined as 11 τ i j ρ m u i u j u i u j the computational domain is shown in fig 1 e and the chord length c 70 mm the inlet velocity is set at 10 m s and the outlet pressure is adjusted according to the cavitation number the hydrofoil wall surface is set as the no sliding wall boundary all the properties of water in the numerical simulation process are consistent with those of kim et al 2015 the time step is set as 0 1 ms and the calculation steps are set as 4000 steps icem software code is used to divide the calculation area into a hexahedral mesh taking the sside and stop as an example other schemes adopt the same mesh division method the mesh near the hydrofoil are encrypted as shown in fig 1 f the mesh number is verified by grid independence the lift coefficient of the bionic hydrofoil changes accordingly with the increase in mesh number as shown in table 1 when the grid number is increased from grid 1 to grid 4 the lift coefficient c l changes considerably the increase in the lift coefficient c l of sside and stop schemes from grid 4 to grid 5 is less than 1 indicating that change occurs only in the third place after the decimal point the influence of the increase in mesh number on the flow field can be ignored we finally select grid 4 as the final grid number to reduce the computational workload 3 results and discussions 3 1 validation of les fig 2 shows the distribution of unsteady cavitating flow around the classic asymmetric clark y hydrofoil symmetric naca0015 hydrofoil and bionic hydrofoil sside and stop when the cavitation number σ 0 8 the results are compared with those of wang et al 2001 and roohi et al 2013 the test time of the laser doppler velocity ldv experiment is 0 50 ms and the test interval of experimental equipment is 0 1 ms which is the same as the setting of the numerical simulation experiment the expression of the cavitation number σ is σ 2 p p v ρ u 0 2 where p v is the saturated vapor pressure of 25 c water compared with fig 2 a 2 b and 2 c for the asymmetric clark y hydrofoil in one cycle the cavitating flow around the hydrofoil s surface first appears as an attached cavity and its breakdown cavity shedding cavity breakdown and attached cavity are shown in this process the results are obtained by the numerical calculation method results are highly consistent with the experimental results of wang et al 2001 and roohi et al 2013 in terms of the position of the attached cavity or the shape and size of cavity shedding and breakdown thereby proving the correctness of the les in the current study after verifying the accuracy of the numerical simulation results in this paper the water properties and boundary conditions used in the calculation of sside stop and naca0015 hydrofoils are the same as those mentioned above which can be better compared and the conclusion is correct comparing fig 2 c with fig 2 d the position of the attached cavity in the sside moves backward the starting point of the attached cavity appears at the position of the hydrofoil s maximum thickness where the cavity breakdown is more likely to form resulting in the larger impact of the vortex shedding and the cloud cavitation this finding indicates that the cavitating flow is related to the geometric shape of the leading edge of the hydrofoil the leading edge of the sside is like a sloping line from starting point to the maximum thickness that results in the separation point of fluid flow movement back to the maximum thickness making the leading edge unfavorable for the formation of the attached cavity comparing 2 e and fig 2 f the symmetrical stop and the classic naca0015 hydrofoil have similar variation laws of cavitating flow the difference is that the impact of the cavity shedding of stop is relatively small the impact on the mainstream is relatively small 3 2 lift drag characteristics 3 2 1 comparison of eight hydrofoils naca series hydrofoils are very popular in the design of hydraulic machinery blades and they are still widely used to better study the lift drag characteristics of the bionic hydrofoil we select three common symmetrical hydrofoils naca0015 naca0012 naca0009 and three common asymmetric hydrofoils clark y naca4412 naca66 and compare their lift drag characteristics as shown in fig 3 fig 3 a and b show that for an asymmetric hydrofoil the lift and drag show periodic fluctuations and the frequencies of the lift and drag fluctuations are the same their general trend is that the first curve reaches the first peak from the trough over time then the curve drops slightly then reaches the second peak after the middle is relatively stable and then decreases rapidly from the peak to the end of the first cycle the lift coefficient and the drag coefficient fluctuation range of the bionic hydrofoil sside are small indicating that its lift and drag are stable the lift and drag of symmetric hydrofoils also show periodic fluctuations but these fluctuations are more severe than those of asymmetric hydrofoils the average lift coefficients drag coefficients and lift drag ratios are provided in table 2 for the further comparison of the lift drag coefficients of the eight hydrofoils the table shows that the lift coefficients of the asymmetric hydrofoil are obviously greater than those of the symmetric hydrofoil among asymmetric hydrofoils the bionic hydrofoil sside has the largest lift coefficient and its lift drag ratio is also higher than that of the other three hydrofoils among the symmetric hydrofoils the bionic hydrofoil stop has the highest lift coefficient and the smallest drag coefficient and its lift drag ratio is higher than the other three common hydrofoils the bionic hydrofoil better lift drag and hydrodynamic characteristics than the common hydrofoil whether it is asymmetric or not 3 2 2 the effect of cavitation numbers fig 4 shows the lift drag characteristic curves and pressure coefficient c p distribution of the four hydrofoils in the figure the expressions of lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d are c l f l 0 5 ρ u 0 2 c b and c d f d 0 5 ρ u 0 2 c b where b is the span wise length u 0 is the starting point flow rate and f l and f d are the lift and drag of hydrofoil respectively the pressure coefficient c p is expressed as c p 2 p ρ u 0 2 the dotted lines named as ① ② and ③ in the figure represent the lift coefficient and drag coefficient corresponding to σ 0 8 σ 1 2 and σ 1 6 respectively it can be seen from the figure that the lift coefficient of the asymmetric hydrofoil is significantly larger than that of the symmetric hydrofoil due to the large c p value difference between the upper and the lower parts of the asymmetric hydrofoil in particular the c p value at the lower part of the hydrofoil is large with increasing cavitation number the difference of c p value between the upper and lower parts of asymmetric hydrofoil increases gradually whereas the difference of the c p value between the upper and lower parts of symmetric hydrofoil increases first and then decreases comparing the lift drag characteristics of asymmetric sside bionic and clark y hydrofoils the c l value increases linearly with increasing cavitation number in a certain range before reaching the inflection point the c l value of clark y hydrofoil is larger than that of sside whereas the difference of c d curve is relatively small the difference is that the position of inflection point in the sside moves to σ 1 4 which means that the flow stall improves obviously and the fluid flow is more stable when c l curve reaches the inflection point the c l value tends to be stable with increasing cavitation number compared with clark y hydrofoil the c d value of sside is smaller after the inflection point comparing the lift drag characteristics of symmetrical stop bionic hydrofoil and naca0015 hydrofoil it can be concluded that inflection points also exist on the curves of c l and c d before the stop reaches the inflection point its lift coefficient is lower than that of naca0015 hydrofoil and after the inflection point its c l value is superior to that of naca0015 hydrofoil the inflection point is the stall point compared with naca0015 hydrofoil the stall point of stop also moves backward with better adaptability 3 3 the evolution of transient cavitating flow for bionic hydrofoils fig 5 a reveals that the c l and c d curves show obvious periodic changes with time under different cavitation numbers σ the c l and c d curves show similar changes and peaks and troughs appear at the same time taking σ 1 2 as an example red line in the figure the c l and c d value are closely related to the amount of cavity at the leading edge of the asymmetric bionic hydrofoil sside the results are as follows when c l and c d value are maximum peak the cavitating flow corresponding to point ① occurs in the middle and rear of the asymmetric sside which is reflected as the cavity shedding flow with increasing time c l and c d value achieve the minimum value trough and correspond to the cavitating flow at point ② at this time the leading edge of the asymmetric sside has a cavity which is accompanied by the tearing of the cavity with continuous time increase the amount of cavity at the leading edge decreases continuously and c l and c d values increase gradually until the maximum value peak reappears the cavitating flow on the right side of the figure shows that the cavitating flow around the sside changes in one cycle when the surface tension of the cavity is less than the total force exerted on the surface by the fluid the cavitation breaks and the phenomenon of shedding cavity ensues when the cavity bubble moves with the fluid in the direction of flow it rotates and moves in the direction of the mainstream expands upward and finally disappears in the mainstream for the symmetrical stop as shown in fig 5 b the change law of c l and c d curves is similar to that of the asymmetric sside and the c l and c d values are closely related to the amount of cavity at the leading edge of the bionic hydrofoils the peaks on the c l and c d curves correspond to ⑥ when the leading edge has no cavity on the contrary the troughs on the c l and c d curves correspond to ④ when the leading edge cavity is the maximum and the cavity length is the largest the lift coefficient c l of symmetric bionic hydrofoil stop increases first and then becomes stable with the cavitation number σ and the inflection point appears near σ 1 2 in the numerical simulation the increase of σ will increase the whole pressure field and the pressure coefficient near the pressure surface will also increase however the pressure coefficient on the suction surface can not form a stable pressure coefficient due to the influence of cavitation which can be explained by the change of pressure coefficient field on the right side of fig 5 when the cavitation number is small the stop leading edge of the symmetrical bionic hydrofoil can form a stable cavity as shown in fig 8 this may be the main reason for the increase of lift coefficient c l watanabe et al 2014 with the increase of cavitation σ the stable cavity is destroyed and part of the cavity becomes unstable the cavity often falls off from its trailing edge and oscillates when the local cavity oscillation changes to the transition cavity oscillation the lift coefficient starts to increase again and then remains stable it can be seen from fig 5 b that the c l value of stop hydrofoil under the condition of σ 1 2 will increase greatly after three cycles this is due to the special geometric structure of the symmetrical bionic hydrofoil stop which can force the formation of a stable cavity under large cavitation number and this cavity will be destroyed when σ 1 2 fig 6 shows the velocity fluctuation curve of the bionic hydrofoil under different cavitation numbers in the figure x c represents the ratio of x coordinate to chord length c along the flow direction whereas y c represents the ratio of y coordinate to chord length c perpendicular to the flow direction the expression of velocity fluctuation is u u 0 u 0 which reflects the difference between the fluid particle and initial velocities it can be see that the velocity fluctuation is related to the cavitation number and the position of coordinate x c near the leading edge of the bionic hydrofoil the velocity fluctuation increases with increasing cavitation number along the y axis direction the velocity fluctuation is a relatively small near the bone line of the hydrofoil as the fluid particles continue to move forward the velocity fluctuation tends to be stable when the fluid particle reaches x c 0 2 obvious velocity fluctuation appears near the bone line on the hydrofoil which is related to the location of cavitation in fig 5 with the backward movement of the fluid particle the influence range of the velocity fluctuation in the y axis direction increases gradually at x c 1 0 the influence range has expanded to the position of y c 0 3 moreover the velocity fluctuation decreases with increasing cavitation number near the hydrofoil bone line in the same position for the stop the variation trend of velocity fluctuation is similar to that of the sside the difference is that the velocity fluctuation curves at the y axis of the σ 1 2 are closer to the velocity fluctuation curve of σ 0 8 whereas the sside shows that the velocity fluctuation curve of the cavitation number σ 1 2 is closer to the velocity fluctuation curve of σ 1 6 moreover the distance between the velocity fluctuation curve of σ 1 2 and that of σ 1 6 is reduced when x c 0 4 they coincide and the difference tends to be zero when x c 0 4 the velocity fluctuation of σ 1 2 is significantly larger than that of σ 1 6 the trend increases gradually with the change of the fluid particle to the trailing edge of the bionic hydrofoil u v u 0 2 is the expression of reynolds stress which reflects the additional stress of fluid particles caused by turbulent pulsating motion fig 7 a shows that the value of reynolds stress u v u 0 2 is related to the σ value and the position of coordinate x c when σ 0 8 the leading edge of the sside is not affected by the cavity the value of u v u 0 2 increases gradually along the y axis direction and the maximum value is near the hydrofoil bone line the value u v u 0 2 tends to gradually become stable as it moves towards the y axis positive direction with increasing σ value the value u v u 0 2 also increases gradually and the changing trend is consistent with that when σ 0 8 with the fluid particle moving to the trailing edge of the bionic hydrofoil the u v u 0 2 value under different cavitation numbers decreases gradually when x c 0 4 the fluid particle moves to the trailing edge of the bionic hydrofoil and the u v u 0 2 value shows amplitude revealing a trend of gradual increase near the trailing edge of the bionic hydrofoil in the y axis direction the u v u 0 2 value decreases first and then increases when y c 0 2 the value u v u 0 2 reaches the maximum which is related to the continuous expansion of the cavity to the outside after falling off for the stop the variation trend of u v u 0 2 value is similar to that of the sside however due to the different geometric constructions the value of u v u 0 2 still largely varies at the leading edge of the stop the value of u v u 0 2 increases first and then decreases in the y axis direction according to fig 5 b few cavities exist near the leading edge of stop thereby affecting the distribution of u v u 0 2 value with the fluid particle moving towards the trailing edge of the hydrofoil the value of u v u 0 2 under different cavitation numbers decreases continuously when x c 0 4 the value of u v u 0 2 becomes negative and the closer it is to the trailing edge the smaller it becomes moreover in the direction of the y axis near the trailing edge of the bionic hydrofoil the value of u v u 0 2 is similar to that of the sside they all achieve the maximum value when y c 0 2 3 4 maximum cavity length lmax fig 8 a shows the change law of cavity length l with time when cavitation number σ 0 8 and σ 1 6 for sside and the lower part of the figure shows the velocity streamlines it can be seen from the figure that l max is related to the cavitation number σ the larger the cavitation number is the less the cavity is and the smaller the l max is when the cavitation number σ 0 8 the starting position of the cavity is 0 25c the maximum thickness of the bionic hydrofoil and it continuously extends to the vicinity of the trailing edge with increasing time the l max changes periodically a re entrant flow is found at about 1 15c and then it moves towards the leading edge of hydrofoil until the cavity breaks down and falls off the influence length of this part of the cavity after falling off is the largest and its value is about 1 68c the slanted dotted line in the figure represents the extension point of the cavity there is a change process of cavity falling behind in the range of 1 4t 2 4t and the cavity decreases with the main flow in the interval of 2 4t 3 4t the cavity appears to backflow and continuously flows towards the leading edge of the bionic hydrofoil the abovementioned phenomena can be explained by the velocity streamlines below as shown in the figure in the velocity streamline diagram of 2 4t 4 4t the starting point of the re entrant flow is continuously toward the leading edge of the hydrofoil and the direction is inclined upward along the hydrofoil bone line in the range of 3 4t 4 4t the initial cavity appears at the maximum thickness of the bionic hydrofoil and extends to the mainstream until it is connected with the cavity at the trailing edge as a whole for the stop the l max is similar to that of sside however the l max is about 1 74c and the starting point of cavity backflow appears near 1 2c fig 8 b shows that the velocity of the primary cavitating flow into the mainstream is greater than that of the detached cavitating flow into the mainstream when the two merge the l max is formed and then disappears in the mainstream soon 3 5 evolution law of vortex in bionic hydrofoil fig 9 shows the evolution of the vortex of the bionic hydrofoil within a period on the left side of the figure the vorticity of the bionic hydrofoils is identified by the q criterion which is defined as q ω 2 s 2 2 ω represents the vorticity amplitude and s represents the strain rate tensor on the right side the three columns represent vortex stretching term the vortex dilatation term and the baroclinic torque the vortex stretching term ω v denotes the stretching and the tilting of a vortex due to the velocity gradients the vortex dilatation term ω v comes from the volumetric expansion contraction and the baroclinic torque ρ m ρ ρ m 2 represents the generation of vorticity due to the misaligned pressure and the density gradients it can be seen from the figure that the evolution process of the 3d vortex structure of the asymmetric sside in one cycle the vortices are formed in two positions one is near the leading edge and the other is at the later of the maximum thickness in which the latter plays a major role from the stretch of the vortex in the x axis direction it appears at the later part of its maximum thickness with the movement of the fluid particles the vortex continues to stretch in the x axis and y axis directions compared with the stretch of the vortex the influence range of the dilatation of the vortex is obviously weakened but it still shows the law of continuous diffusion around the vortex caused by the baroclinic torque appears near the trailing edge although it is not as significant as the stretching and dilatation of the vortex the baroclinic torque term is very important it may be the main mechanism of the cavity vortex the vortex formation positions of symmetrical bionic hydrofoil stop and asymmetric bionic hydrofoil sside appear in two positions one is near the leading edge the other is later than the maximum thickness of the airfoil and the latter plays a major role and will gradually develop to the trailing edge of the hydrofoil in this respect the evolution of the vortices of the two hydrofoils is similar however many differences exist between them for example a relatively stable attached vortex can be formed near the leading edge of the symmetrical stop the stretching and dilatation of the vortex indicate that compared with the asymmetric sside the stretching influence range of the symmetric stop is weaker however for the baroclinic torque term that determines the cavity vortex the symmetric stop is obviously stronger this finding shows that the vortex of the symmetrical stop rotates more violently 3 6 unsteady flow and main frequency characteristics of bionic hydrofoils this section analyses the unsteady flow characteristics of bionic hydrofoils from the pressure fluctuation coefficient c p fig 10 a shows that the c p of each monitoring point of the asymmetric sside changes periodically with time the variation amplitude of the c p of point 1 at the leading edge of the hydrofoil is relatively small compared with other monitoring points the more the fluid particle moves towards the trailing edge the more intense the change of c p becomes which is consistent with the location of the re entrant flow area in fig 8 the cavitation number also changes the law of c p the increase of the cavitation number increases the amplitude of c p and the position of the cavitation number with different amplitudes also changes greatly the larger the cavitation number is the earlier the position will be taking point 2 as an example when the cavitation number σ 0 8 the pulsation amplitude t 0 195s and the c p value is 1 17 when the cavitation number σ 1 2 the pulsation amplitude t 0 012 s and the c p value is 2 4 when the cavitation number σ 1 6 the pulsation amplitude t 0 08s and the c p value is 3 66 compared with the asymmetrical sside the symmetrical stop has a similar change law and the c p value changes periodically with time the size of c p value is related to the cavitation number for example the larger the cavitation number σ is the larger the c p value will be the time corresponding to the occurrence of the maximum value is the same however the difference between them is that the c p value of the symmetrical stop is slightly higher than that of the sside fig 11 a shows that the change law of spectrum distribution characteristic curves of asymmetrical sside is different from various monitoring points and the change of the spectrum amplitude of the point 1 curve at the leading edge is relatively small with the fluid particle moving towards the trailing edge the spectrum distribution characteristic curve changes relatively violently especially in the vicinity of monitoring points 4 5 and 6 the spectrum amplitude appears in the low frequency region and is related to the cavitation number when cavitation σ 0 8 the main frequency of different monitoring points does not change and all are 33 56 hz when the cavitation number σ 1 2 the main frequency of different monitoring points 1 4 has not changed and all are 42 55 hz however near the trailing edge although the main frequency at the monitoring point 5 is still 42 55 hz a spectrum amplitude also appears at 13 42 hz with an intensity that is not much different from the main frequency at monitoring point 6 the main frequency becomes 26 84 hz when the cavitation number σ 1 6 the main frequency also does not change and both are 73 83 hz the closer the monitoring point is to the trailing edge the greater the amplitude will be compared with the asymmetrical sside the spectrum distribution curve of the symmetrical stop has a similar change law the difference is that when the cavitation number σ 0 8 the dominant frequency is 34 72 hz when the cavitation number σ 1 2 the main frequency of leading edge and trailing edge monitoring points 1 2 3 and 6 is 48 61 hz the main frequency of monitoring points 4 and 5 in the middle position of hydrofoil changes violently and the regularity is not strong when the cavitation number σ 1 6 the main frequency is not obvious near the leading edge but when it is in the middle of the hydrofoil and close to the trailing edge the main frequency appears to be near 100 hz two similar peaks appear in succession corresponding to the main frequencies of 90 91 and 115 15 hz 4 conclusions taking sturgeon as the research object the physical models of asymmetric sside and symmetrical stop are established from the perspective of the top and side views respectively the numerical simulation of the two bionic hydrofoils is conducted by les and their lift coefficient and drag coefficient cavitating flow and unsteady flows are obtained through comparative analysis the following conclusions are obtained compared with the les results and experimental results of the classic asymmetric clark y hydrofoil it is found that in one cycle from the attached cavity and its breakdown cavity shedding cavity breakdown and re attachment of cavity the two results show a high degree of consistency in terms of the location of the generation of an attached cavity and the shape and size of shedding cavity thereby verifying the accuracy of the numerical calculation method used in this study the lift coefficient c l of asymmetric hydrofoils sside and clark y hydrofoils is significantly higher than that of symmetric hydrofoils stop and naca0015 hydrofoils compared with the traditional clark y and naca0015 hydrofoils the inflection point in the lift drag curves of the sside and stop moves backward and the flow stall is significantly alleviated the extreme values of lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d curves are related to the range and position of the cavity when no cavitation is present in the leading edge of the bionic hydrofoils the maximum values of c l and c d appear the minimum values of c l and c d appear when more cavities exist in the leading edge and the length of the cavity is the maximum the maximum cavity length l max is related to the geometric construction and cavitation number of the bionic hydrofoil the larger the cavitation number is the less the cavity will be compared with the l max of sside l max 1 68c the l max of stop is larger with a value of 1 74c from the curves reflecting the reynolds stress the u v u 0 2 value is related to the cavitation number σ the larger the cavitation number σ is the larger the u v u 0 2 value is in the y axis direction the u v u 0 2 value decreases first and then increases reaching the maximum value when y c 0 2 the formation position of the vortex of the sside appears in two places one is near the leading edge and the other is at the later part of the maximum thickness of the hydrofoil the latter plays the main role and spreads to all sides with the fluid flow compared with vortex stretching the influence range of the vortex dilatation is significantly weakened the vortex caused by the baroclinic torque appears near the trailing edge which is closely related to the position of the cavity compared with the sside the stop forms a relatively stable attached vortex near the leading edge the influence range of the vortex is obviously weak and the baroclinic torque term of the cavity vortex is obviously enhanced the main frequency that affects the unsteady flow around the hydrofoil is related to the cavitation number the larger the cavitation number is the larger the main frequency and the larger the spectrum amplitude will be under the same cavitation number the main frequency of the leading edge of the hydrofoil does not change the spectrum amplitude near the trailing edge increase and the main frequency change greatly which is related to the frequency of cavity breakdown when the bionic hydrofoil is different its main frequency also changes the main frequency of the stop is slightly larger than that

random access memory 1 introduction ship compartment layout design scld is one of the main contents of the ship general design it refers to the reasonable arrangement of various functional cabins on the deck region which satisfies the daily work and living needs of the personnel on the basis of meeting the requirements of the specifications scld needs to determine the locations for various function cabins deck passages and stairs between decks at the same time it needs to take into account the functional requirements safety convenience comfort and so on so it is a multi objective combination optimization problem feng 2005 due to the diversity and fuzziness of design objectives and the complexity of constraints it is difficult to achieve an accurate numerical model for scld zhang 2007 traditional ship compartment layout method is based on designer s experience and relative design regulations designers need to utilize mouse and keyboard to repeatedly revise layout scheme in cad system the design process is tedious and long the level of automation is low with the development of computer technology intelligent ship layout has become a research hotspot the main purpose of the research on intelligent layout optimization for design of ship cabin is to use advanced computer technology to improve the space utilization and the ship design quality and to reduce the workload of the designer cai et al 2019 excellent compartment layout can effectively improve the combat effectiveness and vitality of warships and the transport capacity the comfort and convenience of transport ships since 1940s scholars have done a lot of research on layout optimization brooks et al 1940 jajodia et al 1992 dai and cha 1994 scheithauer and temo 2003 shields et al 2018 the layout optimization in ship design has always been a hot and difficult point in ship design and some algorithms have been used to solve it some traditional optimization algorithms were used to ship layout and achieved certain effect the building block design methodology was applied to advanced naval ship design by andrews and dicks 1997 which was the earlier research of layout optimization in ship design van and hopman 2010 presented a packing approach to help the naval architect to find a suitable balance between the ship s capability and affordability gillespie et al 2013 presented a new approach to ship arrangements that started with a non spatial network theory based perspective and resulted in the traditional assignment of shipboard items to designated structural zones but the approach was just suited to early stage design processes shields et al 2017 used a scalable network approach to generate ship arrangements and distributed system configuration kana 2017 introduced a decision making model for forecasting design and decision paths in ship design by applying eigenvector analysis to the ship centric markov decision process model which was beneficial to improve the decision level in ship design process these research results play a good role in promoting the development of automatic layout optimization in ship design the application of intelligent algorithm in ship compartment layout optimization is a hot topic in recent years li et al 2001 constructed the ga structure fitness value selection operator crossover operator and mutation operator for ship cabin layout and he applied improved ga on cadds5 computervison automated design and drafting system platform and accomplished three dimensional 3d layout optimization for simple cabins lee et al 2002 presented an improved ga to solve single deck cabin layout in a warship ölcer et al 2006 designed cabin layout of a ro ro ship by intelligent algorithm combined with fuzzy sets based on the improved ga wang et al 2013 2013 established an optimized mathematical model for ship cabin layout the energy method was used to realize the automatic layout of the equipment in cabin and the concept of effective space utilization ratio of ship s cabins was established considering comprehensively the day lighting and comfort of the cabin galinsky and muratov 2013 proposed a ga combined with interactive multi object modularized optimization method to deal with layout problem zong et al 2013 and chen et al 2018 studied the intelligent layout method of manned submersible cabin equipment

single deck layout area model and multi objective optimization mathematical model and then based on the idea of multi initial solution co evolution a simulated annealing taboo search algorithm was established to solve the problem and provide more design schemes for designers reference the above research work has greatly enriched the theory and application of intelligent design of ship cabin layout but most of the research objects are single deck layout optimization problems and the research on multi deck compartment layout optimization problem is less the optimization of ship compartment layout based on expert system and knowledge engineering has also been paid more attention and achieved abundant results byun 1998 put forward a new method based on the combination of rules and expert system to support the cabin layout of ships lee et al 1998 established the knowledge base of ship cabin layout and developed the expert system of cabin equipment layout based on knowledge reasoning li et al 2002 researched intelligent 3d layout of ship compartment based on integrated knowledge model and promoted the development of ship 3d layout technology helvacioglu and insel 2005 proposed a concept of multi level expert system to divide and arrange the ship cabins zhang 2007 established an expert system by combining artificial intelligence technology with ship computer aided design cad technology which basically realizes the automatic design of cabin division and layout of single deck superstructure of ships and improved the degree of automation of ship cabin design chung et al 2011

optimized it with genetic algorithm to complete the knowledge reasoning process cheng 2014 introduced semantic web technology and ontology engineering into the field of ship cabin layout put forward the construction method of applying ontology and established the framework of ship cabin layout method based on semantic web technology from the point of view of ontology xu et al 2018 summarized the semantic relations such as class concept and attribute to be considered in the field of ship cabin layout put forward the construction method of ship cabin layout field ontology and preliminarily verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the ontology model through the example of cabin layout of fishery patrol vessel in view of the general situation of the research on the optimal design of ship compartment layout we can see that the existing research on ship cabin layout optimization mainly focuses on the single deck problem but in large warships and transport ships compartment layout problems are mostly composed of multi storey deck in this paper an intelligent design method is presented for ship multi deck compartment layout smcl based on the improved taboo search genetic algorithm itsga multi deck compartment layout optimization models are established including layout area model relative location model absolute location model and ergonomic model by combining taboo rule and domain transformation criteria of taboo search algorithm the itsga gains better local optimization capacity and global optimization ability during the layout process the energy method is firstly used to determine the deck layer of various cabins to be arranged and then the position of the deck passages cabins and stairway between upper and lower decks are carried out by nested itsga at the same time according to the characteristics of ship compartment layout a new coding method is introduced to avoid the damage to the cabin sequence caused by crossover and mutation operations in ga finally the new method is used to solve the problem of multi storey residential deck compartment automatic layout for an oil tanker and the simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the methodology of improved taboo search genetic algorithm for smcl section 3 presents the smcl optimization models section 4 shows the test result to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method section 5 discusses the diversity of the solutions of the new algorithm finally section 6 contains the conclusion of this paper 2 description of the improved taboo search genetic algorithm for smcl genetic algorithm ga was firstly brought up by holland in 1970s holland 1975 ga imitates genetic evolution process of living creature each chromosome represents a solution of the problem to be solved these chromosomes will go through iteration process the superior ones will be kept and the inferior ones will be discarded after certain iteration the optimal one will be obtained ga is a global optimization algorithm giving an optimal solution theoretically because of parallel search and strong robustness in ga it has been widely applied in various fields but the drawback of ga is that its local optimization ability is poor and the convergence speed is slow in the later stage of the algorithm which makes the ga often converge near the optimal solution but can t reach the optimal solution in a limited time taboo search algorithm tsa was brought up by glover 1989 tsa obtains several feasible solutions from a starting specific solution through adjacent transformation rule which is to keep target function value moving in the maximum or minimum direction to avoid repetitive search tsa introduces memory structure and taboo rule during calculation the areas that have been searched will be recorded by tsa and avoid repetition in the following search thus accelerating the rate of convergence its adjacent transformation rules and taboo rule help tsa to search in optimal direction which can effectively improve the local search capacity liu 2014 tsa has an advantage of local search capacity but it is weak in global search and the quality of its final solution is strongly influenced by its starting solution the new algorithm combining tsa and ga methods can not only improve the global search ability and parallel computing ability of the algorithm but also provide good local search performance in the later stage of calculation this paper proposed the improved taboo search genetic algorithm itsga to solve smcl problem itsga can improve the local search ability of ga by introducing the neighborhood transformation criterion and taboo criterion of tsa into ga the improved algorithm can further improve the quality of the solution and the speed of convergence at the same time a new coding method is given according to the characteristics of ship cabins layout partition problem 2 1 coding scheme in ga crossover operator and mutation operator change chromosome by breaking and rebuilding the crossover operation and mutation operation in genetic algorithm will cause damage to the cabin layout sequence chromosome in scld for example genetic algorithm crossover and mutation operations are performed on the cabin sequence 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 of a certain deck with a total number of eight cabins through ga s crossover and mutation new cabin array may have one or more same cabin numbers and lost some cabin numbers in the meantime cabin array like this is unqualified referring to fig 1 two random cabin arrays are selected for ga s operation after crossover operation cabin array 1 has two number cabin1 and cabin array 2 has two number cabin4 and two number cabin7 in order to avoid the damage to the cabin sequence caused by crossover and mutation operations in ga the itsga uses a combination of decimal sequence coding method and grefenstette coding method grefenstette et al 1985 this particular coding scheme can well avoid illegal cabin sequence in the ordinal representation a cabin layout scheme is described by a list of n integers in which the ith element can range from 1 to n i 1 given a cabin sequence representation of a layout scheme we can construct the ordinal representation nestlist as follows let freelist be an ordered list of the cabins such as a b c d e f g h or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 for each cabin in the layout append the position of that cabin in the freelist to the nestlist and delete that cabin from the freelist for example the cabin layout sequence c e a b d g f h correspond to an ordinal layout sequence 3 4 1 1 1 2 1 1 as shown nestlist freelist a b c d e f g h 3 a b d e f g h 3 4 a b d f g h 3 4 1 b d f g h 3 4 1 1 d f g h 3 4 1 1 1 f g h 3 4 1 1 1 2 f h 3 4 1 1 1 2 1 h 3 4 1 1 1 2 1 1 a similar procedure provides a mapping from the ordinal representation back to the cabin sequence representation in fact the mapping between the two representations is one to one the coding and decoding processes of crossover operation are shown in fig 2 two original sequences remain qualified after coding and decoding processes under grefenstette coding scheme similarly the coding and decoding processes of mutation operation are shown in fig 3 therefore the new coding scheme successfully avoids the illegal solution in both crossover and mutation operation 2 2 selection operator roulette selection strategy is used in itsga the probability of each individual to be chosen is in direct proportion to its fitness value first fitness of each individual is being calculated marked as f i i 1 2 m then calculate the probability of each individual q i which determines whether this individual is to be chosen into next generation next produce a random number r from 0 1 if r q 1 then select individual 1 otherwise select individual k which satisfies the condition q k 1 r q k after m times of the above operation repeatedly the new colony can be obtained 2 3 crossover operator crossover operator adopts self adaption strategy during calculation individuals with high fitness values have relatively low crossover probability in reverse individuals with low fitness values have relatively high crossover probability this strategy prompts to keep superior individuals and in the meantime abandon inferior individuals the function for self adaption crossover operation is in the following 1 p c p c 2 p c 2 p c 1 f f a v g f max f a v g f f a v g p c 2 f f a v g where f a v g is average fitness value in present generation f max is the maximum fitness value in present generation f is the larger fitness value in the selected individual for crossover operation p c 1 is relatively low crossover probability and p c 2 is relatively high crossover probability 2 4 mutation operator mutation operator is very important in ga s optimization process if mutation probability p m is too low new individual is hardly produced if mutation probability is too high ga s function is going to be similar with random search algorithm so a fixed mutation probability p m is not appropriate to keep good global search capacity of ga the mutation operator in this paper adopts self adaption strategy referring to function 2 compare with traditional ga s mutation operator self adaption mutation operator changes with individual s fitness value to promote producing superior individuals individuals with higher fitness values have relatively lower mutation probability p m in reverse individuals with lower fitness values have relatively higher mutation probability 2 p m p m 2 p m 2 p m 1 f f a v g f max f a v g f f a v g p m 2 f f a v g where f a v g is average fitness value in present generation f max is the maximum fitness value in present generation f is the fitness value of individual to be mutated among present generation p m 1 is relatively low mutation probability and p m 2 is relatively high mutation probability 2 5 neighborhood transformation neighborhood is a very important concept in the process of solving continuous differentiable function problems neighborhood selection is to select a limited number of feasible solutions near the initial point from a point to make the function value move in the maximum or minimum direction in space the neighborhood can be regarded as the feasible region around the initial point in the field of combinatorial optimization the concept of neighborhood transformation is essentially the same as continuous optimization but slightly different in expression form for example for a simple digital sequence 2 1 3 5 4 a number sequence such as 1 2 3 5 4 2 3 1 5 4 and 2 5 3 1 4 can be obtained according to the neighborhood transformation rules these are the neighbors of the digital sequence 2 1 3 5 4 a solution that move the objective function of the problem to the maximum or minimum direction can be selected as a new solution sequence by the neighborhood transformation the flow chart of itsga is shown in fig 4 3 smcl optimization models ship compartment layout quality plays an important role in general design therefore scld should keep in line with scientific principles including specification safety convenience and comfort cabins to be arranged deck passages and stairways between decks are regarded as multi objects multilayer decks are treated as layout area scld is to arrange a certain number of functional compartments in the layout area and also consider the passage layout and stairway layout therefore scld is a combinational optimization problem with multi objects and various constraints 3 1 passage form and deck layout area model 3 1 1 passage form for scld the premise is deck passage layout after deck passage form is determined deck layout can be divided into several layout area then coding form of cabin sequence can be determined through the analysis of various ship deck passage layout forms the following kinds of passage layout forms are summarized as shown in fig 5 passage forms of a b c and d is common in cargo ships and passage forms of e and f is commonly adopted in passenger ships large scale cruises and warships 3 1 2 single deck layout area model take the oil tanker living region compartment layout as an example first establish 2 dimensional coordinate system of single deck layout area model x axis represents for transversal direction and y axis represents for longitudinal direction once the passage on the deck is determined deck layout area will be divided into several subordinate layout areas cabins then will be placed in these subordinate layout areas for instance if form passage is determined for a deck this deck then will be divided into four subordinate layout areas shown in fig 6 these four layout areas will be coded as 1 2 3 and 4 assume that on this deck the total number of cabin to be placed is i the number of cabin placed in layout area 1 is i 1 the number of cabin placed in layout area 2 is i 2 the number of cabin placed in layout area 3 is i 3 and the number of cabin placed in area 4 is i 4 the total deck area is s the passage area is s 0 and the layout region area 1 2 3 and 4 is s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 respectively thus the following condition should be satisfied s 1 s 2 s i 1 s 1 s i 1 1 s i 1 2 s i 1 i 2 s 2 s i 1 i 2 1 s i 1 i 2 2 s i 1 i 2 i 3 s 3 s i 1 i 2 i 3 1 s i 1 i 2 i 3 2 s i s 4 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 s 0 s to make sure cabins can be placed automatically an appropriate area parameter should be set to make sure that the total area of cabins is less than the total layout area if the total area of cabins is equal to the total layout area only one layout solution tends to be obtained and this is not acceptable for iterative calculation once all cabins are placed in the layout areas areas that are not occupied can be calculated to make full use of these residual areas these areas will then be distributed to all cabins automatically the principle is even distribution viz the residual areas will be distributed evenly to all cabins the distribution process is shown in fig 7 the circulation relationship of crew and goods between cabins is important when locating each cabin the circulation distance between cabins is important in this paper s cabin layout approach and also is the premise of calculating fitness value in practice the circulation distance starts from one cabin s central point passes through cabin door and deck passage and ends in another cabin s central point to simplify calculation the circulation distance in this paper is represented by the linear distance between two cabins assume that the central point of cabin i and cabin j is x i y i and x j y j then the equation 3 of calculating the circulation distance d i j between cabin i and cabin j is shown in fig 8 3 d i j x i x j y i y j 3 1 3 multi deck compartment layout area model smcl is to layout many functional cabins on multilayer decks and meanwhile determine the positions of passages and stairs compared with single layer accommodation layout smcl is more complex and the automatic solution is more difficult in single layer accommodation layout relationships between cabins passages and the both each other need to be considered when it comes to smcl besides the above cabins and passages between different decks should also be taken into consideration at the same time the layout of stairways between different floors should be considered which makes it more difficult to get the intelligent layout of multi deck compartment the following problems need to be solved to establish the multi deck compartment layout area model 1 relationships between cabins it mainly includes the adjacent and circulation relations between the cabins of the same deck layer at the same time because the compartment arrangement of adjacent deck layers will also affect each other it is necessary to consider the relationship between the compartments of upper and lower deck 2 relationships between passages these refer to passages on different decks for adjacent deck passages which have the same layout direction usually possess similar relative location on their deck as shown in fig 9 passages on deck a and b possess same layout direction and their relative location on their deck is similar therefore when conducting smcl design this passage layout pattern should be made full use of to guarantee harmonious relationship between passages it can also reduce calculation workload to improve the efficiency of automation layout 3 relationships among cabins passages and stairs passage location impacts on decisions of cabins location and stairs location the stair position between adjacent deck layers also has an important influence on the circulation between compartments of adjacent deck layers and the arrangement position of the stair should generally be adjacent to the passage which is beneficial to the circulation between the adjacent deck layers 4 circulation distance of cabins between different decks when conducting smcl circulation distance of cabins on the same deck as well as different decks should be calculated to obtain target function value circulation distance of cabins on different decks is shown in fig 9 assume that central point of cabin a is x 1 y 1 central point of cabin b is x 2 y 2 and central point of the stair is x 0 y 0 the circulation distance of cabin a and b starts from cabin a then to the stair on the same deck next down stair to the next deck and finally ends in cabin b therefore the equation for circulation distance of cabins on different decks is shown in the following formula 4 4 d i j x 1 x 0 y 1 y 0 h x 2 x 0 y 2 y 0 where h represents the height between the two decks 3 2 ship cabins intelligent layout mathematical model in ship cabins layout all cabins should be placed next to each other when determining passage location cabins on its same side usually have the same room depth besides all deck area should be placed by cabins and passage as much as possible to minimize residual area in order to realize the intelligent layout of ship compartment we must first analyze the correlation between various types of compartments transform the design experience of ship designer and general design principle into mathematical thought expression and then we can establish the objective function of cabin layout according to the layout principle in this paper the relative location model the absolute location model and the ergonomics constraint model for compartment layout problem are established according to the principle specification and experience of ship accommodation layout 3 2 1 relative location model relative location model consists of circulation intensity function and adjacent intensity function which explains the circulation requirement and adjacent requirement between two cabins these two target functions define the mutual relation of cabins and thus prompt cabins to locate in optimal relative location 1 circulation intensity model circulation intensity function f1 describes logistics and human flow between two cabins in order to quantitatively describe logistics and human flow existed between cabins circulation intensity scale and coefficient are listed in table 1 for example the circulation relationship between the captain s cabin and the bridge is relatively close so the distance between them is required to be closer and the circulation intensity coefficient can be 0 8 on the contrary there is little circulation relationship between the captain s cabin and the scullery and the distance between them is not required so the circulation intensity coefficient between them can be taken 0 function of circulation intensity is in the following the smaller the circulation intensity function value the better the scheme 5 f 1 i j n 1 j i 1 n f i j d i j where f1 is the circulation intensity function f i j represents circulation intensity coefficient between cabin i and j d i j presents circulation distance between cabin i and j 2 adjacent intensity model adjacent intensity function f2 describes correlation between two adjacent cabins the stronger the adjacent intensity between compartments the smaller the distance between compartments such as chef living room and kitchen two cabins that have strong circulation intensity may have relatively weak adjacent intensity such as living cabin and dining room therefore adjacent intensity scale is important in ship cabin layout which is listed in table 2 function of adjacent intensity is shown in the following the smaller the adjacent intensity function value the better the scheme 6 f 2 i j n 1 j i 1 n c i j d i j where f2 is the adjacent intensity function c i j represents adjacent intensity coefficient between cabin i and j d i j is circulation distance between cabin i and j 3 2 2 absolute location model absolute location model is used to evaluate the cabin layout and leads cabin layout solution to evolve in a particular direction there are many factors which are difficult to quantify but also important to the final arrangement solution in the field of cabin layout including environment noise comfort and maximization of the utility of the cabin considering all the influencing factors each compartment has an optimal absolute position designers should evaluate cabins absolute location based on ship s types and their accumulated experience which is also a comprehensive consideration for the expert knowledge experience since the factors considered are difficult to quantify the penalty function f3 is introduced here for convenience the penalty function is a function established by a cabin with special requirements for certain positions it can accelerate the algorithm to converge to the required direction the objective function is as follows 7 f 3 α 1 f x α 2 f y where f3 is the penalty function for absolute location f x is the distance from optimal position in x axis f y is the distance from optimal position in y axis α 1 α 2 are penalty coefficients respectively generally their value ranges are 0 1 3 2 3 ergonomic constraint model this constraint model explains the function f4 that is to optimize length width ratio of cabins ergonomics improves equipment to make people work better and more quickly and designers have paid more and more attention on ergonomics when designing a product for closed cabins the room parameters can have a huge impact on crews work and living experience and is the key to its ergonomic performance for living cabins according to the results of ergonomics the theoretical optimal length width ratio is 3 2 with appropriate total room area thus providing a comfortable living and working experience wang and zhong 2011 the function is shown in the following the smaller the f4 value the better the scheme 8 f 4 β i 1 n r i r 0 i 2 where f4 is the ergonomic constraint function r i is the practical length width ratio of cabin i r 0 i is the theoretical optimal length width ratio of cabin i β is consistent coefficient generally its value range is 0 1 3 3 the distribution strategy of compartments on multi deck in the study of intelligent layout of ship multi deck compartments it is difficult to determine the allocation rules of compartments on different decks in the traditional ship multi deck cabin layout process the designers firstly assign the cabins to different decks according to experience and specification requirements and so on then carry out cabins layout on the decks this design method makes it very difficult to summarize its regularity and it is difficult to be transformed into mathematical model to describe it in order to quantify the empirical knowledge the energy method is introduced here energy method is developed from artificial potential field which has been widely used in intelligent path planning of robots khatib et al 1986 pan et al 2011 in the beginning of scld energy method is used to determine which deck each cabin is going to be deployed on first each cabin type should be allotted with an energy value according to its category for example when deploying dining room kitchen first mate living room and captain living room these four cabins energy value should be set first usually captain living room and first mate living room are set on the upper deck kitchen and dining room are located on the lower deck the energy rule is that cabins with high demand for layout condition have low energy value on the contrary cabins with low demand for layout condition have relatively high energy value 3 4 multi deck compartment layout rules and flow chart we first have to determine the type and number of cabins to be arranged the number of decks to be arranged the form of passage for each deck the number of longitudinal and transverse passages and the number of stairs between adjacent decks after the basic analysis of the problem we can get the necessary parameters of the intelligent layout of the multi storey deck compartment then the following problems need to be solved in order to achieve the intelligent arrangement of ship multi deck compartment firstly the energy method is used to distribute the compartments to each deck secondly the form of each deck layer passage is selected and the passage is arranged thirdly the layout of the cabins on each deck is carried out finally the locations of the upper and lower stairways are determined 1 allocate the cabins to different decks the allocation of the cabins to different decks can transform search in global space into search in local space which can greatly reduce the computational cost on the basis of summing up the layout experience and specifications of different types of cabins between different decks the allocation rules are put forward such as senior officers living room is upper than ordinary crew s kitchen storeroom and material room are located on the lower deck there are two methods of cabin distribution on deck automatic distribution method and artificial distribution method ①automatic allocation method is to use the energy method to automatically allocate cabins to different decks that is to say according to the design experience and functional requirements the energy value of the corresponding compartment is set such as the captain room is generally arranged on the upper deck and the kitchen is arranged on the lower deck for the captain room the upper deck gives a low energy value and the lower deck gives a high energy value for the kitchen the opposite is true and then the deck is allocated according to the magnitude of the energy value the lower the total energy value the better the distribution scheme ②the artificial distribution method is that the designer distributes cabins to the appropriate decks according to experience and specification requirements and so on although the automation degree of this method is not high it can reasonably distribute the cabin deck 2 determine the passage form and location for the solution of the passage position of each deck layer it needs to be determined according to the number of passage and the form of passage of each deck layer there are single passage form and multichannel passage form referring to fig 1 after determining passage form of each deck layer the coding mode of each deck passage can be determined and then the corresponding constraint conditions can be set according to the number of longitudinal and horizontal passageways and the deck layout criteria for multi deck compartment layout passage location of each layer will influence passage location of adjacent deck layers overall consideration should be taken after determining passage location s constraints of both subordinate deck layer and adjacent deck layers algorithm for passage location can thus be carried out optimal solution for passage location can be obtained after limited iteration 3 arrangement of the cabins on deck after the location of the passage is determined the position and area of the region to be divided on each deck can be obtained by calculation and then the position sequence of the cabins can be solved by the intelligent algorithm first the layout sequence of the cabin position is obtained then according to the cabin array zig zag shape arrangement can be carried out from the upper left position to the lower right position of the deck to be arranged the layout diagram is shown in fig 10 after determining cabin layout array based on the area of each cabin the center point of each cabin can then be listed the process of multi deck compartment intelligent layout is shown in fig 11 first energy method is applied to distribute various cabins on different deck layers then conduct nested itsga to determine deck passages position cabins position and stairs position in turn 4 simulation and result in this section the proposed method is applied to multi deck residential region compartment layout of a 50000dwt oil tanker accommodation deck a and b is to be deployed the deck breadth is 30 m deck length is 15 m and deck height is 3 m 4 1 test condition condition of this simulation test is shown in table 3 4 2 problem description double layer deck model is established in coordinate system referring to fig 12 first determine passage form of each deck deck a adopts 一 form passage and deck b adopts form passage both decks are arranged with various cabins and connected by a stair each cabin is given proper area property according to its function and the total layout area which should meet the relevant requirements of the specification deck a is divided into 2 subordinate layout areas by the passage and deck b is divided into 4 subordinate layout areas by the passage and then use the energy method to distribute the cabins to different decks cabins on deck a are listed in table 4 and cabins on deck b are listed in table 5 4 3 coding scheme passage location cabin array and stair location need to be coded respectively in multi deck compartment automation layout this double layer deck has 4 passages among which transverse passage on both deck layer a and deck layer b is correlated for convenience these two transverse passages share the same coordinate in coordinate system therefore only three passages need to be coded viz 1 transverse passage and 2 longitudinal passages passage location is coded through 15 digit binary system shown in fig 13 y1 represents y coordinate of transverse passage s central point x1 and x2 are x coordinates of two longitudinal passages central point cabin array is coded by serial numbers cabin arrays of deck a and b are coded and shown in fig 14 when calculating these cabin arrays are further been transformed by grefenstette coding scheme between deck a and b a stair is set this stair is coded by 5 digits binary system shown in fig 15 4 4 calculation parameter initialization the parameters of itsga for double layer deck cabins layout are listed in table 6 based on relevant layout regulation and expertise the

away from stern areas and noise areas on deck layer a for comfort these four rooms should be set near ship sides based on ergonomic constraint model the r 0 i is 2 3 for head chef living room deputy chef living room engine department office and deck department office the kitchen r 0 i is 3 2 as for deck b engineer living room chief engineer living room boatswain living room and sailor living room should keep distance from stern area and ship sides are preferable senior crew dining room can locate in stern direction based on ergonomic constraint model r 0 i is 2 3 for engineer living room and sailor living room 4 5 fitness function based on the previous analysis of section 3 the fitness function of the double deck compartment layout problem can be defined as 9 f c 1 c 2 x ω 1 f 1 ω 2 f 2 ω 3 f 3 ω 4 f 4 s t i 1 8 s i 1 s 1 i 1 13 s i 2 s 2 s 1 1 s 2 1 s i 1 s 1 1 1 i j s j 1 1 s j 2 1 s n 1 1 s 2 1 i j n 1 n 1 8 s 1 2 s 2 2 s i 2 s 1 2 1 i j s i 1 2 s i 2 2 s j 2 s 2 2 i j k s j 1 2 s j

their sum is 1 based on experience of many tests the values of each weight are obtained ω 1 is 0 15 ω 2 is 0 25 ω 3 is 0 5 ω 4 is 0 1 α 1 α 2 are 0 9 and 0 7 in f3 respectively β is 0 9 in f4 s i is the area of cabin i s 1 is total layout region area of deck layer a s 2 is total layout region area of deck layer b s 1 1 is the first region layout area on deck layer a s 2 1 is the second region layout area on deck layer a s 1 2 is the first region layout area on deck layer b s 2 2 is the second region layout area on deck layer b s 3 2 is the third region layout area on deck layer b s 4 2 is the fourth region layout area on deck layer b the solution produced includes passage location stair location and cabin array the smaller the fitness function value the better the scheme 4 6 calculating process calculation process adopts nested itsga for outer layer algorithm itsga is applied to solve passage location based on passage location middle layer algorithm is used to calculate relevant cabin arrays and specify coordinate of each cabin afterwards the inner algorithm adopts local random search algorithm to deal with stairs location based on the data obtained distance matrix between cabins and stairs can be calculated thus fitness value of present solution can be obtained this completes a loop and continues the next cycle until the end condition of the simulation experiment is met the end condition of the nested itsga is to satisfy the maximum number of iteration t outer layer algorithm t 300 middle layer algorithm t 20 inner layer algorithm t 20 shown in table 6 through limited iteration the algorithm outputs the optimal cabin array and stair location under determined passage location the solution for double layer deck layout is also been showed in the form of diagram the flow chart of smcl intelligent design of the simulation test is shown in fig 16 4 7 results based on the above parameters 300 iterations are set for the itsga the simulation test result for double layer deck compartment layout is concluded as a convergence curve in fig 17 it can be seen from the diagram that the itsga finds the optimal solution after 40 iterations which shows that the algorithm has high search efficiency because the number of cabins in this example is relatively small it is easier to solve with the increase of the number of compartments the computation will increase sharply and the time required for the algorithm to find the optimal solution will increase accordingly the optimal solution information of itsga is shown in table 7 the passage location is 8 95 7 20 23 12 from table 7 we can see that after the passage location is determined the proposed algorithm can give different cabin layout schemes according to the different location of the staircase the layout solution diagrams are shown in fig 18 cabin serial numbers of deck layer a is marked by italic and underline cabin serial numbers of deck layer b is in common form in the optimization process the stairs are constrained to approach the edge of the passage y coordinate y1 belongs to transverse passage s central point x coordinate x1 belongs to longitudinal passage 1 s central point and x coordinate x2 belongs to longitudinal passage 2 s central point at the same time the algorithm can produce more selection schemes and provide more options for the designer which we will analyze later in the discussion section it can be seen from the simulation results that a suitable cabin layout scheme can be obtained by using the intelligent design method established in this paper the passage position converges near the passage of the original layout plan and most of the layout of the cabins such as chef living room sailor living room cargo oil control room deck department office engine department office dining room catering room kitchen senior crew dining room smoking room and ward room in scheme i are consistent with the original scheme of deck a and deck b shown in fig 19 a and b the simulation results show that the optimization model and the optimization algorithm established in this paper are effective in solving the intelligent design problem of ship multi deck cabin layout 5 discussion the main purpose of this paper is to study the intelligent design method of ship multi deck compartment layout which is used to automatically generate reasonable ship cabin layout scheme maintaining the diversity of solutions of intelligent algorithms is one of the important conditions to ensure the innovation of design schemes the simulation results in above section proved that the proposed itsga for smcl is feasible the fitness function of the double deck compartment layout includes four sub functions namely the circulation intensity f1 adjacent intensity f2 penalty f3 and ergonomic constraint f4 and their weighting factors ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 respectively their values have a great influence on the optimization results and it is difficult to get a good layout scheme using unreasonable weight distribution after many repeated tests the best values of weighting factors are determined as 0 15 0 25 0 5 and 0 1 respectively the new algorithm established in this paper can produce more layout schemes and provide reference for designers for example the change of passage location will produce different arrangement scheme in the test example selected in this paper we choose the design schemes of two approximate passage locations to illustrate the diversity of the solution and to prove that the new algorithm can provide more feasible schemes for the designer shown in table 8 and the diagrams of the feasible solutions are shown in fig 20 for table 8 we can find that the new method can successful avoid the damage to the cabin sequence caused by crossover and mutation operations the feasible schemes provided are similar to the actual ship cabin layout so as to prove the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method on the other hand a small change can provide different feasible schemes which provides some proof of the diversity of the solution on deck layer a head chef living room is close to deputy chef living room two offices are also close to each other and near ship sides dining room is close to pantry room which is close to kitchen and these three cabins are separated from living rooms by passages all the details show good ergonomics thus proving feasibility on deck layer b living cabins are all placed on ship s sides and away from stern deck department crew living cabin is located on the right side and engine department crew living cabin is located on the left side warehouse and senior crew dining room is located in the post median area therefore the layout solution for deck layer b is feasible and proper the innovation of the design scheme is an important problem facing the intelligent design of ship cabin layout and it is also an important research direction of intelligent design algorithm in the future in this paper we try to improve the innovation of the resulting scheme by improving the diversity of the computational solutions 6 conclusion in this paper an intelligent design method of ship multi deck residential compartment layout is proposed according to the characteristics of multi deck residential compartment deck layout area model and cabin layout multi objective optimization mathematical model which is composed of relative location model absolute location model and ergonomic constraint model are established itsga is presented to determine deck passage positions cabin positions and stair positions in turn by introducing the neighborhood transformation criterion and taboo criterion into genetic algorithm to advance the local search ability of

the deck region which satisfies the daily work and living needs of the personnel on the basis of meeting the requirements of the specifications scld needs to determine the locations for various function cabins deck passages and stairs between decks at the same time it needs to take into account the functional requirements safety convenience comfort and so on so it is a multi objective combination optimization problem feng 2005 due to the diversity and fuzziness of design objectives and the complexity of constraints it is difficult to achieve an accurate numerical model for scld zhang 2007 traditional ship compartment layout method is based on designer s experience and relative design regulations designers need to utilize mouse and keyboard to repeatedly revise layout scheme in cad system the design process is tedious and long the level of automation is low with the development of computer technology intelligent ship layout has become a research hotspot the main purpose

workload of the designer cai et al 2019 excellent compartment layout can effectively improve the combat effectiveness and vitality of warships and the transport capacity the comfort and convenience of transport ships since 1940s scholars have done a lot of research on layout optimization brooks et al 1940 jajodia et al 1992 dai and cha 1994 scheithauer and temo 2003 shields et al 2018 the layout

approach to ship arrangements that started with a non spatial network theory based perspective and resulted in the traditional assignment of shipboard items to designated structural zones but the approach was just suited to early stage design processes shields et al 2017 used a scalable network approach to generate ship arrangements and distributed system configuration kana 2017 introduced a decision making model for forecasting design and decision paths in ship design by applying eigenvector analysis to the ship centric markov decision process model which was beneficial to improve the decision level in ship design process these research results play a good role in promoting the development of automatic layout optimization in ship design the application of intelligent algorithm in ship compartment layout optimization is a hot topic in recent years li et al 2001 constructed the ga structure fitness value selection operator crossover operator and mutation operator for ship cabin layout and he applied improved ga on cadds5 computervison automated design and drafting system platform and accomplished three dimensional 3d layout optimization for simple cabins lee et al 2002

established to solve the problem and provide more design schemes for designers reference the above research work has greatly enriched the theory and application of intelligent design of ship cabin layout but most of the research objects are single deck layout optimization problems and the research on multi deck compartment layout optimization problem is less the optimization of ship compartment layout based on expert system and knowledge engineering has also been paid more attention and achieved abundant results byun 1998 put forward a new method based on the combination of rules and expert system to support the cabin layout of ships lee et al 1998 established the knowledge base of ship cabin layout and developed the expert system of cabin equipment layout based on knowledge reasoning li

semantic relations such as class concept and attribute to be considered in the field of ship cabin layout put forward the construction method of ship cabin layout field ontology and preliminarily verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the ontology model through the example of cabin layout of fishery patrol vessel in view of the general situation of the research on the optimal design of ship compartment layout we can see that the existing research on ship cabin layout optimization mainly focuses on the single deck problem but in large warships and transport ships compartment layout problems are mostly composed of multi storey deck in this paper an intelligent design method is presented for ship multi deck compartment layout smcl based on the improved taboo search genetic algorithm itsga multi deck compartment layout optimization models are established including layout area model relative location model absolute location model and ergonomic model by combining taboo rule and domain transformation criteria of taboo search algorithm the itsga gains better local optimization capacity and global optimization ability during the layout process the energy method is firstly used to determine the deck layer of various cabins to be arranged and then the position of the deck passages cabins and stairway between upper and lower decks are carried out by nested itsga at the same time according to the characteristics of ship compartment layout a new coding method is introduced to avoid the damage to the cabin sequence caused by crossover and mutation operations in ga finally the new method is used to solve the problem of multi storey residential deck compartment automatic layout for an oil tanker and the simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the methodology of improved taboo search genetic algorithm for smcl section 3 presents the smcl optimization models section 4 shows the test result to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method section 5 discusses the diversity of the solutions of the new algorithm finally section 6 contains the conclusion of this paper 2 description of the improved taboo search genetic algorithm for smcl genetic algorithm ga was firstly brought up by holland in 1970s holland 1975 ga imitates genetic evolution process of living creature each chromosome represents a solution of the problem to be solved these chromosomes will go through iteration process the superior ones will be kept and the inferior ones will be discarded after certain iteration the optimal one will be obtained ga is a global optimization algorithm giving an optimal solution theoretically because of parallel search and strong robustness in ga it has been widely applied in various fields but the drawback of ga is that its local optimization ability is poor and the convergence speed is slow in the later stage of the algorithm which makes the ga often converge near the optimal solution but can t reach the optimal solution in a limited time taboo search algorithm tsa was brought up by glover 1989 tsa obtains several feasible solutions from a starting specific solution through adjacent transformation rule which is to keep target function value moving in the maximum or minimum direction to avoid repetitive search tsa introduces memory structure and taboo rule during calculation the areas that have been searched will be recorded by tsa and avoid repetition in the following search thus accelerating the rate of convergence its adjacent transformation rules and taboo rule help tsa to search in optimal direction which can effectively improve the local search capacity liu 2014 tsa has an advantage of local search capacity but it is weak in global search and the quality of its final solution is strongly influenced by its starting solution the new algorithm combining tsa and ga methods can not only improve the global search ability and parallel computing ability of the algorithm but also provide good local search performance in the later stage of calculation this paper proposed the improved taboo search genetic algorithm itsga to solve smcl problem itsga can improve the local search ability of ga by introducing the neighborhood transformation criterion and taboo criterion of tsa into ga the improved algorithm can further improve the quality of the solution and the speed of convergence at the same time a new coding method is given according to the characteristics of ship cabins layout partition problem 2 1 coding scheme in ga crossover operator and mutation operator change chromosome by breaking and rebuilding the crossover operation and mutation operation in genetic algorithm will cause damage to the cabin layout sequence chromosome in scld for example genetic algorithm crossover and mutation operations are performed on the cabin sequence 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 of a certain deck with a total number of eight cabins through ga s crossover and mutation new cabin array may have one or more same cabin numbers and lost some cabin numbers in the meantime cabin array like this is unqualified referring to fig 1 two random cabin arrays are selected for ga s operation after crossover operation cabin array 1 has two number cabin1 and cabin array 2 has two number cabin4 and two number cabin7 in order to avoid the damage to the cabin sequence caused by crossover and mutation operations in ga the itsga uses a combination of decimal sequence coding method and grefenstette coding method grefenstette et al 1985 this particular coding scheme can well avoid illegal cabin sequence in the ordinal representation a cabin layout scheme is described by a list of n integers in which the ith element can range from 1 to n i 1 given a cabin sequence representation of a layout scheme we can construct the ordinal representation nestlist as follows let freelist be an ordered list of the cabins such as a b c d e f g h or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 for each cabin in the layout append the position of that cabin in the freelist to the nestlist and delete that cabin from the freelist for example the cabin layout sequence c e a b d g f h correspond to an ordinal layout sequence 3 4 1 1 1 2 1 1 as shown nestlist freelist a b c d e f g h 3 a b d e f g h 3 4 a b d f g h 3 4 1 b d f g h 3 4 1 1 d f g h 3 4 1 1 1 f g h 3 4 1 1 1 2 f h 3 4 1 1 1 2 1 h 3 4 1 1 1 2 1 1 a similar procedure provides a mapping from the ordinal representation back to the cabin sequence representation in fact the mapping between the two representations is one to one the coding and decoding processes of crossover operation are shown in fig 2 two original sequences remain qualified after coding and decoding processes under grefenstette coding scheme similarly the coding and decoding processes of mutation operation are shown in fig 3 therefore the new coding scheme successfully avoids the illegal solution in both crossover and mutation operation 2 2 selection operator roulette selection strategy is used in itsga the probability of each individual to be chosen is in direct proportion to its fitness value first fitness of each individual is being calculated marked as f i i 1 2 m then calculate the probability of each individual q i which determines whether this individual is to be chosen into next generation next produce a random number r from 0 1 if r q 1 then select individual 1 otherwise select individual k which satisfies the condition q k 1 r q k after m times of the above operation repeatedly the new colony can be obtained 2 3 crossover operator crossover operator adopts self adaption strategy during calculation individuals with high fitness values have relatively low crossover probability in reverse individuals with low fitness values have relatively high crossover probability this strategy prompts to keep superior individuals and in the meantime abandon inferior individuals the function for self adaption crossover operation is in the following 1 p c p c 2 p c 2 p c 1 f f a v g f max f a v g f f a v g p c 2 f f a v g where f a v g is average fitness value in present generation f max is the maximum fitness value in present generation f is the larger fitness value in the selected individual for crossover operation p c 1 is relatively low crossover probability and p c 2 is relatively high crossover probability 2 4 mutation operator mutation operator is very important in ga s optimization process if mutation probability p m is too low new individual is hardly produced if mutation probability is too high ga s function is going to be similar with random search algorithm so a fixed mutation probability p m is not appropriate to keep good global search capacity of ga the mutation operator in this paper adopts self adaption strategy referring to function 2 compare with traditional ga s mutation operator self adaption mutation operator changes with individual s fitness value to promote producing superior individuals individuals with higher fitness values have relatively lower mutation probability p m in reverse individuals with lower fitness values have relatively higher mutation probability 2 p m p m 2 p m 2 p m 1 f f a v g f max f a v g f f a v g p m 2 f f a v g where f a v g is average fitness value in present generation f max is the maximum fitness value in present generation f is the fitness value of individual to be mutated among present generation p m 1 is relatively low mutation probability and p m 2 is relatively high mutation probability 2 5 neighborhood transformation neighborhood is a very important concept in the process of solving continuous differentiable function problems neighborhood selection is to select a limited number of feasible solutions near the initial point from a point to make the function value move in the maximum or minimum direction in space the neighborhood can be regarded as the feasible region around the initial point in the field of combinatorial optimization the concept of neighborhood transformation is essentially the same as continuous optimization but slightly different in expression form for example for a simple digital sequence 2 1 3 5 4 a number sequence such as 1 2 3 5 4 2 3 1 5 4 and 2 5 3 1 4 can be obtained according to the neighborhood transformation rules these are the neighbors of the digital sequence 2 1 3 5 4 a solution that move the objective function of the problem to the maximum or minimum direction can be selected as a new solution sequence by the neighborhood transformation the flow chart of itsga is shown in fig 4 3 smcl optimization models ship compartment layout quality plays an important role in general design therefore scld should keep in line with scientific principles including specification safety convenience and comfort cabins to be arranged deck passages and stairways between decks are regarded as multi objects multilayer decks are treated as layout area scld is to arrange a certain number of functional compartments in the layout area and also consider the passage layout and stairway layout therefore scld is a combinational optimization problem with multi objects and various constraints 3 1 passage form and deck layout area model 3 1 1 passage form for scld the premise is deck passage layout after deck passage form is determined deck layout can be divided into several layout area then coding form of cabin sequence can be determined through the analysis of various ship deck passage layout forms the following kinds of passage layout forms are summarized as shown in fig 5 passage forms of a b c and d is common in cargo ships and passage forms of e and f is commonly adopted in passenger ships large scale cruises and warships 3 1 2 single deck layout area model take the oil tanker living region compartment layout as an example first establish 2 dimensional coordinate system of single deck layout area model x axis represents for transversal direction and y axis represents for longitudinal direction once the passage on the deck is determined deck layout area will be divided into several subordinate layout areas cabins then will be placed in these subordinate layout areas for instance if form passage is determined for a deck this deck then will be divided into four subordinate layout areas shown in fig 6 these four layout areas will be coded as 1 2 3 and 4 assume that on this deck the total number of cabin to be placed is i the number of cabin placed in layout area 1 is i 1 the number of cabin placed in layout area 2 is i 2 the number of cabin placed in layout area 3 is i 3 and the number of cabin placed in area 4 is i 4 the total deck area is s the passage area is s 0 and the layout region area 1 2 3 and 4 is s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 respectively thus the following condition should be satisfied s 1 s 2 s i 1 s 1 s i 1 1 s i 1 2 s i 1 i 2 s 2 s i 1 i 2 1 s i 1 i 2 2 s i 1 i 2 i 3 s 3 s i 1 i 2 i 3 1 s i 1 i 2 i 3 2 s i s 4 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 s 0 s to make sure cabins can be placed automatically an appropriate area parameter should be set to make sure that the total area of cabins is less than the total layout area if the total area of cabins is equal to the total layout area only one layout solution tends to be obtained and this is not acceptable for iterative calculation once all cabins are placed in the layout areas areas that are not occupied can be calculated to make full use of these residual areas these areas will then be distributed to all cabins automatically the principle is even distribution viz the residual areas will be distributed evenly to all cabins the distribution process is shown in fig 7 the circulation relationship of crew and goods between cabins is important when locating each cabin the circulation distance between cabins is important in this paper s cabin layout approach and also is the premise of calculating fitness value in practice the circulation distance starts from one cabin s central point passes through cabin door and deck passage and ends in another cabin s central point to simplify calculation the circulation distance in this paper is represented by the linear distance between two cabins assume that the central point of cabin i and cabin j is x i y i and x j y j then the equation 3 of calculating the circulation distance d i j between cabin i and cabin j is shown in fig 8 3 d i j x i x j y i y j 3 1 3 multi deck compartment layout area model smcl is to layout many functional cabins on multilayer decks and meanwhile determine the positions of passages and stairs compared with single layer accommodation layout smcl is more complex and the automatic solution is more difficult in single layer accommodation layout relationships between cabins passages and the both each other need to be considered when it comes to smcl besides the above cabins and passages between different decks should also be taken into consideration at the same time the layout of stairways between different floors should be considered which makes it more difficult to get the intelligent layout of multi deck compartment the following problems need to be solved to establish the multi deck compartment layout area model 1 relationships between cabins it mainly includes the adjacent and circulation relations between the cabins of the same deck layer at the same time because the compartment arrangement of adjacent deck layers will also affect each other it is necessary to consider the relationship between the compartments of upper and lower deck 2 relationships between passages these refer to passages on different decks for adjacent deck passages which have the same layout direction usually possess similar relative location on their deck as shown in fig 9 passages on deck a and b possess same layout direction and their relative location on their deck is similar therefore when conducting smcl design this passage layout pattern should be made full use of to guarantee harmonious relationship between passages it can also reduce calculation workload to improve the efficiency of automation layout 3 relationships among cabins passages and stairs passage location impacts on decisions of cabins location and stairs location the stair position between adjacent deck layers also has an important influence on the circulation between compartments of adjacent deck layers and the arrangement position of the stair should generally be adjacent to the passage which is beneficial to the circulation between the adjacent deck layers 4 circulation distance of cabins between different decks when conducting smcl circulation distance of cabins on the same deck as well as different decks should be calculated to obtain target function value circulation distance of cabins on different decks is shown in fig 9 assume that central point of cabin a is x 1 y 1 central point of cabin b is x 2 y 2 and central point of the stair is x 0 y 0 the circulation distance of cabin a and b starts from cabin a then to the stair on the same deck next down stair to the next deck and finally ends in cabin b therefore the equation for circulation distance of cabins on different decks is shown in the following formula 4 4 d i j x 1 x 0 y 1 y 0 h x 2 x 0 y 2 y 0 where h represents the height between the two decks 3 2 ship cabins intelligent layout mathematical model in ship cabins layout all cabins should be placed next to each other when determining passage location cabins on its same side usually have the same room depth besides all deck area should be placed by cabins and passage as much as possible to minimize residual area in order to realize the intelligent layout of ship compartment we must first analyze the correlation between various types of compartments transform the design experience of ship designer and general design principle into mathematical thought expression and then we can establish the objective function of cabin layout according to the layout principle in this paper the relative location model the absolute location model and the ergonomics constraint model for compartment layout problem are established according to the principle specification and experience of ship accommodation layout 3 2 1 relative location model relative location model consists of circulation intensity function and adjacent intensity function which explains the circulation requirement and adjacent requirement between two cabins these two target functions define the mutual relation of cabins and thus prompt cabins to locate in optimal relative location 1 circulation intensity model circulation intensity function f1 describes logistics and human flow between two cabins in order to quantitatively describe logistics and human flow existed between cabins circulation intensity scale and coefficient are listed in table 1 for example the circulation relationship between the captain s cabin and the bridge is relatively close so the distance between them is required to be closer and the circulation intensity coefficient can be 0 8 on the contrary there is little circulation relationship between the captain s cabin and the scullery and the distance between them is not required so the circulation intensity coefficient between them can be taken 0 function of circulation intensity is in the following the smaller the circulation intensity function value the better the scheme 5 f 1 i j n 1 j i 1 n f i j d i j where f1 is the circulation intensity function f i j represents circulation intensity coefficient between cabin i and j d i j presents circulation distance between cabin i and j 2 adjacent intensity model adjacent intensity function f2 describes correlation between two adjacent cabins the stronger the adjacent intensity between compartments the smaller the distance between compartments such as chef living room and kitchen two cabins that have strong circulation intensity may have relatively weak adjacent intensity such as living cabin and dining room therefore adjacent intensity scale is important in ship cabin layout which is listed in table 2 function of adjacent intensity is shown in the following the smaller the adjacent intensity function value the better the scheme 6 f 2 i j n 1 j i 1 n c i j d i j where f2 is the adjacent intensity function c i j represents adjacent intensity coefficient between cabin i and j d i j is circulation distance between cabin i and j 3 2 2 absolute location model absolute location model is used to evaluate the cabin layout and leads cabin layout solution to evolve in a particular direction there are many factors which are difficult to quantify but also important to the final arrangement solution in the field of cabin layout including environment noise comfort and maximization of the utility of the cabin considering all the influencing factors each compartment has an optimal absolute position designers should evaluate cabins absolute location based on ship s types and their accumulated experience which is also a comprehensive consideration for the expert knowledge experience since the factors considered are difficult to quantify the penalty function f3 is introduced here for convenience the penalty function is a function established by a cabin with special requirements for certain positions it can accelerate the algorithm to converge to the required direction the objective function is as follows 7 f 3 α 1 f x α 2 f y where f3 is the penalty function for absolute location f x is the distance from optimal position in x axis f y is the distance from optimal position in y axis α 1 α 2 are penalty coefficients respectively generally their value ranges are 0 1 3 2 3 ergonomic constraint model this constraint model explains the function f4 that is to optimize length width ratio of cabins ergonomics improves equipment to make people work better and more quickly and designers have paid more and more attention on ergonomics when designing a product for closed cabins the room parameters can have a huge impact on crews work and living experience and is the key to its ergonomic performance for living cabins according to the results of ergonomics the theoretical optimal length width ratio is 3 2 with appropriate total room area thus providing a comfortable living and working experience wang and zhong 2011 the function is shown in the following the smaller the f4 value the better the scheme 8 f 4 β i 1 n r i r 0 i 2 where f4 is the ergonomic constraint function r i is the practical length width ratio of cabin i r 0 i is the theoretical optimal length width ratio of cabin i β is consistent coefficient generally its value range is 0 1 3 3 the distribution strategy of compartments on multi deck in the study of intelligent layout of ship multi deck compartments it is difficult to determine the allocation rules of compartments on different decks in the traditional ship multi deck cabin layout process the designers firstly assign the cabins to different decks according to experience and specification requirements and so on then carry out cabins layout on the decks this design method makes it very difficult to summarize its regularity and it is difficult to be transformed into mathematical model to describe it in order to quantify the empirical knowledge the energy method is introduced here energy method is developed from artificial potential field which has been widely used in intelligent path planning of robots khatib et al 1986 pan et al 2011 in the beginning of scld energy method is used to determine which deck each cabin is going to be deployed on first each cabin type should be allotted with an energy value according to its category for example when deploying dining room kitchen first mate living room and captain living room these four cabins energy value should be set first usually captain living room and first mate living room are set on the upper deck kitchen and dining room are located on the lower deck the energy rule is that cabins with high demand for layout condition have low energy value on the contrary cabins with low demand for layout condition have relatively high energy value 3 4 multi deck compartment layout rules and flow chart we first have to determine the type and number of cabins to be arranged the number of decks to be arranged the form of passage for each deck the number of longitudinal and transverse passages and the number of stairs between adjacent decks after the basic analysis of the problem we can get the necessary parameters of the intelligent layout of the multi storey deck compartment then the following problems need to be solved in order to achieve the intelligent arrangement of ship multi deck compartment firstly the energy method is used to distribute the compartments to each deck secondly the form of each deck layer passage is selected and the passage is arranged thirdly the layout of the cabins on each deck is carried out finally the locations of the upper and lower stairways are determined 1 allocate the cabins to different decks the allocation of the cabins to different decks can transform search in global space into search in local space which can greatly reduce the computational cost on the basis of summing up the layout experience and specifications of different types of cabins between different decks the allocation rules are put forward such as senior officers living room is upper than ordinary crew s kitchen storeroom and material room are located on the lower deck there are two methods of cabin distribution on deck automatic distribution method and artificial distribution method ①automatic allocation method is to use the energy method to automatically allocate cabins to different decks that is to say according to the design experience and functional requirements the energy value of the corresponding compartment is set such as the captain room is generally arranged on the upper deck and the kitchen is arranged on the lower deck for the captain room the upper deck gives a low energy value and the lower deck gives a high energy value for the kitchen the opposite is true and then the deck is allocated according to the magnitude of the energy value the lower the total energy value the better the distribution scheme ②the artificial distribution method is that the designer distributes cabins to the appropriate decks according to experience and specification requirements and so on although the automation degree of this method is not high it can reasonably distribute the cabin deck 2 determine the passage form and location for the solution of the passage position of each deck layer it needs to be determined according to the number of passage and the form of passage of each deck layer there are single passage form and multichannel passage form referring to fig 1 after determining passage form of each deck layer the coding mode of each deck passage can be determined and then the corresponding constraint conditions can be set according to the number of longitudinal and horizontal passageways and the deck layout criteria for multi deck compartment layout passage location of each layer will influence passage location of adjacent deck layers overall consideration should be taken after determining passage location s constraints of both subordinate deck layer and adjacent deck layers algorithm for passage location can thus be carried out optimal solution for passage location can be obtained after limited iteration 3 arrangement of the cabins on deck after the location of the passage is determined the position and area of the region to be divided on each deck can be obtained by calculation and then the position sequence of the cabins can be solved by the intelligent algorithm first the layout sequence of the cabin position is obtained then according to the cabin array zig zag shape arrangement can be carried out from the upper left position to the lower right position of the deck to be arranged the layout diagram is shown in fig 10 after determining cabin layout array based on the area of each cabin the center point of each cabin can then be listed the process of multi deck compartment intelligent layout is shown in fig 11 first energy method is applied to distribute various cabins on different deck layers then conduct nested itsga to determine deck passages position cabins position and stairs position in turn 4 simulation and result in this section the proposed method is applied to multi deck residential region compartment layout of a 50000dwt oil tanker accommodation deck a and b is to be deployed the deck breadth is 30 m deck length is 15 m and deck height is 3 m 4 1 test condition condition of this simulation test is shown in table 3 4 2 problem description double layer deck model is established in coordinate system referring to fig 12 first determine passage form of each deck deck a adopts 一 form passage and deck b adopts form passage both decks are arranged with various cabins and connected by a stair each cabin is given proper area property according to its function and the total layout area which should meet the relevant requirements of the specification deck a is divided into 2 subordinate layout areas by the passage and deck b is divided into 4 subordinate layout areas by the passage and then use the energy method to distribute the cabins to different decks cabins on deck a are listed in table 4 and cabins on deck b are listed in table 5 4 3 coding scheme passage location cabin array and stair location need to be coded respectively in multi deck compartment automation layout this double layer deck has 4 passages among which transverse passage on both deck layer a and deck layer b is correlated for convenience these two transverse passages share the same coordinate in coordinate system therefore only three passages need to be coded viz 1 transverse passage and 2 longitudinal passages passage location is coded through 15 digit binary system shown in fig 13 y1 represents y coordinate of transverse passage s central point x1 and x2 are x coordinates of two longitudinal passages central point cabin array is coded by serial numbers cabin arrays of deck a and b are coded and shown in fig 14 when calculating these cabin arrays are further been transformed by grefenstette coding scheme between deck a and b a stair is set this stair is coded by 5 digits binary system shown in fig 15 4 4 calculation parameter initialization the parameters of itsga for double layer deck cabins layout are listed in table 6 based on relevant layout regulation and expertise the

away from stern areas and noise areas on deck layer a for comfort these four rooms should be set near ship sides based on ergonomic constraint model the r 0 i is 2 3 for head chef living room deputy chef living room engine department office and deck department office the kitchen r 0 i is 3 2 as for deck b engineer living room chief engineer living room boatswain living room and sailor living room should keep distance from stern area and ship sides are preferable senior crew dining room can locate in stern direction based on ergonomic constraint model r 0 i is 2 3 for engineer living room and sailor living room 4 5 fitness function based on the previous analysis of section 3 the fitness function of the double deck compartment layout problem can be defined as 9 f c 1 c 2 x ω 1 f 1 ω 2 f 2 ω 3 f 3 ω 4 f 4 s t i 1 8 s i 1 s 1 i 1 13 s i 2 s 2 s 1 1 s 2 1 s i 1 s 1 1 1 i j s j 1 1 s j 2 1 s n 1 1 s 2 1 i j n 1 n 1 8 s 1 2 s 2 2 s i 2 s 1 2 1 i j s i 1 2 s i 2 2 s j 2 s 2 2 i j k s j 1 2 s j 2 2 s k 2 s 3 2 i j k s k 1 2 s k 2 2 s n 2 2 s 4 2 j k n 2 n 2 13 where c 1 is passage location solution c 2 is stair location solution x is cabin array solution ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 are relevant weights their sum is 1 based on experience of many tests the values of each weight are obtained ω 1 is 0 15 ω 2 is 0 25 ω 3 is 0 5 ω 4 is 0 1 α 1 α 2 are 0 9 and 0 7 in f3 respectively β is 0 9 in f4 s i is the area of cabin i s 1 is total layout region area of deck layer a s 2 is total layout region area of deck layer b s 1 1 is the first region layout area on deck layer a s 2 1 is the second region layout area on deck layer a s 1 2 is the first region layout area on deck layer b s 2 2 is the second region layout area on deck layer b s 3 2 is the third region layout area on deck layer b s 4 2 is the fourth region layout area on deck layer b the solution produced includes passage location stair location and cabin array the smaller the fitness function value the better the scheme 4 6 calculating process calculation process adopts nested itsga for outer layer algorithm itsga is applied to solve passage location based on passage location middle layer algorithm is used to calculate relevant cabin arrays and specify coordinate of each cabin afterwards the inner algorithm adopts local random search algorithm to deal with stairs location based on the data obtained distance matrix between cabins and stairs can be calculated thus fitness value of present solution can be obtained this completes a loop and continues the next cycle until the end condition of the simulation experiment is met the end condition of the nested itsga is to satisfy the maximum number of iteration t outer layer algorithm t 300 middle layer algorithm t 20 inner layer algorithm t 20 shown in table 6 through limited iteration the algorithm outputs the optimal cabin array and stair location under determined passage location the solution for double layer deck layout is also been showed in the form of diagram the flow chart of smcl intelligent design of the simulation test is shown in fig 16 4 7 results based on the above parameters 300 iterations are set for the itsga the simulation test result for double layer deck compartment layout is concluded as a convergence curve in fig 17 it can be seen from the diagram that the itsga finds the optimal solution after 40 iterations which shows that the algorithm has high search efficiency because the number of cabins in this example is relatively small it is easier to solve with the increase of the number of compartments the computation will increase sharply and the time required for the algorithm to find the optimal solution will increase accordingly the optimal solution information of itsga is shown in table 7 the passage location is 8 95 7 20 23 12 from table 7 we can see that after the passage location is determined the proposed algorithm can give different cabin layout schemes according to the different location of the staircase the layout solution diagrams are shown in fig 18 cabin serial numbers of deck layer a is marked by italic and underline cabin serial numbers of deck layer b is in common form in the optimization process the stairs are constrained to approach the edge of the passage y coordinate y1 belongs to transverse passage s central point x coordinate x1 belongs to longitudinal passage 1 s central point and x coordinate x2 belongs to longitudinal passage 2 s central point at the same time the algorithm can produce more selection schemes and provide more options for the designer which we will analyze later in the discussion section it can be seen from the simulation results that a suitable cabin layout scheme can be obtained by using the intelligent design method established in this paper the passage position converges near the passage of the original layout plan and most of the layout of the cabins such as chef living room sailor living room cargo oil control room deck department office engine department office dining room catering room kitchen senior crew dining room smoking room and ward room in scheme i are consistent with the original scheme of deck a and deck b shown in fig 19 a and b the simulation results show that the optimization model and the optimization algorithm established in this paper are effective in solving the intelligent design problem of ship multi deck cabin layout 5 discussion the main purpose of this paper is to study the intelligent design method of ship multi deck compartment layout which is used to automatically generate reasonable ship cabin layout scheme maintaining the diversity of solutions of intelligent algorithms is one of the important conditions to ensure the innovation of design schemes the simulation results in above section proved that the proposed itsga for smcl is feasible the fitness function of the double deck compartment layout includes four sub functions namely the circulation intensity f1 adjacent intensity f2 penalty f3 and ergonomic constraint f4 and their weighting factors ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 respectively their values have a great influence on the optimization results and it is difficult to get a good layout scheme using unreasonable weight distribution after many repeated tests the best values of weighting factors are determined as 0 15 0 25 0 5 and 0 1 respectively the new algorithm established in this paper can produce more layout schemes and provide reference for designers for example the change of passage location will produce different arrangement scheme in the test example selected in this paper we choose the design schemes of two approximate passage locations to illustrate the diversity of the solution and to prove that the new algorithm can provide more feasible schemes for the designer shown in table 8 and the diagrams of the feasible solutions are shown in fig 20 for table 8 we can find that the new method can successful avoid the damage to the cabin sequence caused by crossover and mutation operations the feasible schemes provided are similar to the actual ship cabin layout so as to prove the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method on the other hand a small change can provide different feasible schemes which provides some proof of the diversity of the solution on deck layer a head chef living room is close to deputy chef living room two offices are also close to each other and near ship sides dining room is close to pantry room which is close to kitchen and these three cabins are separated from living rooms by passages all the details show good ergonomics thus proving feasibility on deck layer b living cabins are all placed on ship s sides and away from stern deck department crew living cabin is located on the right side and engine department crew living cabin is located on the left side warehouse and senior crew dining room is located in the post median area therefore the layout solution for deck layer b is feasible and proper the innovation of the design scheme is an important problem facing the intelligent design of ship cabin layout and it is also an important research direction of intelligent design algorithm in the future in this paper we try to improve the innovation of the resulting scheme by improving the diversity of the computational solutions 6 conclusion in this paper an intelligent design method of ship multi deck residential compartment layout is proposed according to the characteristics of multi deck residential compartment deck layout area model and cabin layout multi objective optimization mathematical model which is composed of relative location model absolute location model and ergonomic constraint model are established itsga is presented to determine deck passage positions cabin positions and stair positions in turn by introducing the neighborhood transformation criterion and taboo criterion into genetic algorithm to advance the local search ability of genetic algorithm a numerical simulation result of double deck residential compartment layout for an oil tanker proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the established multi objective optimization model and optimization algorithm in the future research we will try to apply this method to the cabin layout of warship it will have a positive effect on the space utilization rate and improvement to
