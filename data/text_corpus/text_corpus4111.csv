20555,the effect of hydrodynamic force on the seismic response of structure in water cannot be ignored various methods have been developed to describe the effect of incompressible water but the relative performance of some practical simplified methods is largely unknown in this paper a comprehensive comparison of three representative simplified methods for assessing cylindrical hydrodynamic force is presented relative errors of structural elastic peak responses are constructed to measure the accuracy of the simplified method the errors are tested on 154 circular cylinders subjected to 100 ground motions the errors were first obtained by averaging the results of ground motions then the comparison between methods and the influence of parameters were studied based on the mean errors furthermore by analyzing the statistical characteristic values of the errors the kernel density estimation method was adopted to obtain the probability density of the errors finally the probabilities of cylindrical cases and methods were investigated the results show that if the added mass of hydrodynamic force depends on more structural parameters the accuracy of the method may higher the rigid structure method has the highest accuracy and the most complicated expression the accuracy and complexity of the method based on approximation of fundamental frequency are moderate the morison method has the simplest form and the maximum error the results indicate that the added mass should relate to several structural parameters ignoring the change of the added mass along the height will bring error to method and assuming the structure to be rigid is an effective way to simplify the analytical hydrodynamics keywords water cylinder interaction seismic response simplified method probability density 1 introduction many offshore structures such as bridges wind turbines and oil and gas platforms are surrounded by water the dynamic behavior of those structures is affected by the existing water structure interaction the importance of water structure interaction is generally accepted sun et al 2020 tian et al 2019 hydrodynamic force is the representation of the interaction effect many researchers have focused on finding solutions for hydrodynamic force especially for structure subjected to horizontal earthquakes wang et al 2018a yang et al 2017 whilst compressibility of water has a great influence on the form of hydrodynamic force fok and chopra 1987 hung and chen 1990 for ideal non viscous water considering compressibility of water liaw and chopra 1974 showed an expression for hydrodynamic force on elastic cylindrical tower due to the solution was shown in frequency domain it is almost impossible to be applied in time history analysis which is a basic and useful method to obtain seismic response of structure løkke and chopra 2018 based on the frequency domain solution wang et al 2018b presented an accurate and efficient hydrodynamic force model in time domain in addition researchers liaw and chopra 1974 tanaka and hudspeth 1988 greenhow and yanbao 1987 have concluded that water compressibility essentially has little influence on hydrodynamic force on slender cylinder that is to say water compressibility is negligible for slender cylinder zheng et al 2015 ignoring compressibility of water hydrodynamic force characterizes as inertial force solution for hydrodynamic force on structure can be conveniently modeled as a product of hypothetical added mass and acceleration of structure greenhow and yanbao 1987 zhang et al 2019 a number of researchers have focused on evaluating the hydrodynamic force or added mass among them liaw and chopra 1974 presented an analytical solution for hydrodynamic force of an elastic cylindrical tower in a theoretical way combined with the numerical discretization method the accurate response of the structure considering the influence of water can be obtained this method was called the exact method in this paper however the method is still inconvenient for analysis hence alternative simplified method is necessary wang et al 2018c one way to account the simplification is to replace the elastic deformation in the analytical solution by a rigid motion this simplified method was also proposed by liaw and chopra firstly liaw and chopra 1974 and is named as rigid structure method in this paper it s abbreviated as method 1 for the rest of this paper by do so expression of the obtained added mass is still too complex for engineers simplified formulas for the added mass have been proposed by researchers as jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2018b and li et al li and yang 2013 from the way of data fitting as added mass modifies dynamic properties of structure in water an alternative approach to get the mass was proposed by han and xu 1996 in their study an added mass representation to compute natural frequencies of water cylinder system was firstly presented on account of fundamental vibration has the greatest influence on dynamic response of most structures thomson and dahleh 2007 yang and li 2013a obtained an applicable simple formula of added masse based on discrepancy of fundamental frequency the fundamental frequency reduction rate was obtained based on simulation result such method is named as method based on approximation of fundamental frequency in this paper it s abbreviated as method 2 for the rest of this paper apart from the above methods morison equation is more widely used to consider the hydrodynamic effect on slender cylinder originally morison et al 1950 proposed a semiempirical formula to calculate the wave load on slender structure which has little influence on wave field later on penzien and kaul 1972 modified the equation to consider the hydrodynamic force caused by earthquake due to the simplicity and accuracy the morison method has been extensively used to consider the hydrodynamic force on slender cylinders li et al 2017 liu and sun 2014 yang and li 2013b the morison method is abbreviated as method 3 for the rest of this paper in aforementioned three simplified methods the stiffness of cylinder is assumed to be rigid flexible and fluidic flexible respectively so the three methods outline simplified ways to evaluate the added mass previous works have paid more attention to the balance of accuracy and efficient of one method under certain structural cases zhao et al 2019 omidi and lotfi 2017 wei et al 2015 furthermore huang and li 2011 found that the responses of bridge vary greatly when different methods of hydrodynamic added mass were used zarrin et al 2018 pointed out the uncertainty of the added mass has nonnegligible influence on the seismic performance and vulnerability of offshore platforms therefore the application of reasonable hydrodynamic added mass is very important in the dynamic response analysis of structures surrounded by water and the applicable range and relative accuracy of simplified method are concerned by engineering community in early papers of authors du et al 2019 guo et al 2019 preliminary analyses have been carried out from two perspectives responses in the time domain and transfer functions in the frequency domain in the preliminary studies peak responses to particular earthquakes resonant frequencies and amplitudes of resonant peaks were investigated and compared however earthquake ground motion has a strong randomness this randomness will have a large impact on results in order to consider the randomness this investigation will be conducted from the perspective of probability relatively stable response errors of simplified methods are accessed by inputting a large number of seismic excitations testing on the obtained errors the accuracy and application range of the simplified methods are studied finally recommendations are made on the simplified methods 2 methodology the dynamic behavior of a circular cylinder in water under earthquake is expressing as 1 m s u s c s u s k s u s m s u g f where m s c s and k s are the mass damping and stiffness matrices of the cylinder respectively u s u s u s are the deformation velocity and acceleration vectors of the cylinder respectively u g is the ground acceleration vector and f is the hydrodynamic force vector in this paper the structure is subjected to horizontal ground motion of single direction and the water is incompressible and non viscous the exact method used as the standard for simplified methods is briefly introduced firstly then the rigid structure method method based on approximation of fundamental frequency and morison method are sketched 2 1 representation of the analytical solution the analytical solution is obtained by radiation wave theory a brief introduction of the radiation wave theory is presented firstly the initial condition of water is assumed to be still after the cylinder is excited the surrounding water is no longer resting and the motion starts to propagate out this water motion is one kind of radiation motion to give a solution of this water motion the velocity potential or pressure of water is taken as a variable the governing equation of incompressible water is laplace equation combining the boundary conditions of the free surface seabed infinity and water structure interaction interface the solution of the motion can be obtained as shown in fig 1 the water depth from the bed to the surface is h radius of the cylinder is r and the origin of the cylindrical coordinate system locates at the base center of the cylinder the circular cylinder is assumed to be linearly elastic the water is assumed to be inviscid the surface wave is ignored the foundation is rigid and the horizontal ground motion excited by earthquake is along the direction of θ 0 the analytical expression for hydrodynamic force per unit height at depth z is liaw and chopra 1974 2 f w 2 ρ π r 2 h j 1 k 1 r 0 r 0 k 1 r 0 cos z 0 0 h u cos z 0 d z in which ρ is the density of water r 0 αr z 0 αz where α 2 j 1 π 2 h with j 1 2 k1 represents the modified bessel function of order one of the second kind and k 1 is the derivative of k 1 and u u s u g is the absolute acceleration of the cylinder combining with the finite element method f w can be defined as a product of mass matrix and displacement vector as follows 3 f w m w u s u g where m w is the added mass matrix of exact method which is a spatial coupled non diagonal matrix and it can be expressed as 4 m w 2 ρ π r 2 h j 1 k 1 r 0 r 0 k 1 r 0 w cos z 0 cos z 0 t w in which 5 w 0 h n t n d z where w is the shape function matrix n is a row vector of the global shape function of the one dimensional finite elements for the transverse displacement degrees of freedom immerged in the water and the superscript t denotes the matrix transpose from eq 3 eq 1 can be rewritten as 6 m s m w u s c s u s k s u s m s m w u g 2 2 representation of the rigid structure method as presented in eq 2 the exact expression for hydrodynamic force is constrained to the deformation of structure then the added mass depends on the discrete element this is troublesome for most seismic research and engineering application investigations for water structure interaction including problems in seismic response of dams liu 1986 pelecanos et al 2013 ship vibrations wang et al 2019 cerik et al 2016 etc assumed the structure to be rigid and computed an added mass to reproduce the hydrodynamic force on the vibrating structure therefore assuming the cylinder to be rigid the force reduced from eq 2 is liaw and chopra 1974 7 f rw 4 ρ r 2 u j 1 1 j 1 2 j 1 k 1 r 0 r 0 k 1 r 0 cos z 0 as f m u the added mass of the rigid structure method is 8 m rw 4 ρ r 2 j 1 1 j 1 2 j 1 k 1 r 0 r 0 k 1 r 0 cos z 0 as shown in eq 8 there exists a summation of series of special functions which is difficult to be used a fitting formula obtained by wang et al 2018b to replace eq 8 is expressed as 9 m rw ρ π r 2 d 1 1 z h exp d 2 z h 1 where 10 d 1 0 918 e 0 468 l 0 155 e 0 015 l d 2 1 248 l 1 1194 2 156 here d 1 and d 2 are parameters obtained by fitting l 2r h which is called width depth ratio wang et al 2018b the distribution of m rw along the water depth is presented in fig 2 and the rigid structure method is calculated in the form of eq 9 in this paper 2 3 representation of method based on approximation of fundamental frequency hydrodynamic force is a function of an added mass if the water is treated as incompressible the added mass certainly changes the vibration frequencies of cylinder based on the changed ratio of the fundamental frequency and assuming the added mass to be uniformly distributed along the depth the magnitude of the added mass could be obtained based on the above considerations yang and li 2013a fitted an added mass formula of circular cylinders which is suitable for cylinders of which the diameter is from 1 m to 20 m and with a water depth from 20 m to 140 m the expression of the added mass is 11 m f ρ c π r 2 c m 2 where ρ c is the mass density of concrete c m 2 0 0133 ln h 0 112 ln 2 r 0 0002 h 0 4 the nomenclature for r and h is the same as that above 2 4 representation of morison method in 1950 the notable morison equation was developed to calculate the wave force on cylinder morison et al 1950 in the equation the wave force consists of two components a drag force proportional to the square of the velocity and an inertia force proportional to the horizontal acceleration and virtual mass the application range defined in wave field is d λ 0 15 where d is the width of the cylinder and λ is the wave length penzien and kaul 1972 applied the morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic force caused by earthquake the hydrodynamic force exerted at depth z in unit length can be expressed as 12 f m f d f i 1 2 ρ a c d v z u v z u ρ v 0 c m 1 v z u ρ v 0 v z where f d is the drag force f i is the inertia force a is the projected area of cylinder of unit length on the vertical direction of wave c d is the coefficient of drag v z is the horizontal velocity of a water particle at depth z u and u are the absolute velocity and acceleration of the cylinder at depth z respectively v 0 is the volume of water discharged by structure of unit length c m1 is the coefficient of added mass whose value is 1 for circular cylinders v z is the local acceleration of fluid since the initial condition of water is resting v z and v z in eq 12 is zero in addition yuan et al 2005 proved the fact that damping of fluid has little contribution to seismic response of the cylinders and it could be neglected therefore eq 12 can be simplified as 13 f m f i ρ v 0 c m 1 u the corresponding added mass has the following form 14 m m ρ v 0 c m 1 using the three simplified methods of added mass to form mass matrices and substituting to the corresponding matrices in eq 6 the dynamic equations of structure considering the hydrodynamic effect are obtained it should be noted that the added mass matrix obtained from the exact method is a non diagonal matrix while the matrices obtained from simplified methods are all diagonal furthermore the added mass of rigid structure method is unevenly distributed along the height while it is identical in both morison method and method based on approximation of fundamental frequency to compare the calculation accuracy of simplified methods a relative error of peak responses is defined in the following number of ground motion records is first confirmed based on stability of the relative error the mean values coefficient of variation and coefficient of skewness of errors are then described based on the mean values the influence of parameters is analyzed based on the coefficient of variation and skewness an appropriate estimation method is selected to evaluate probability density function for errors of different methods finally probability of each method is analyzed 3 numerical cases 3 1 cylinder parameter as shown in the four methods above the hydrodynamic force depends on the added mass while the added mass depends on the parameters r h or l for simplicity the depth of water h is taken as equal to the height of cylinder h s so l is twice the slenderness ratio and there are only two independent parameters actually finally h and l are selected as the parameters of the added mass cylinders with fourteen different values of the slenderness ratio r h s are considered the slenderness ratio varies from 0 025 to 0 35 with a step of 0 025 the height of cylinder h s varies from 20 m to 120 m with a step of 10 m the total number of cylinders with different dimensions is 154 the mechanical parameters for all cylinders are mass density 2500 kg m3 poisson s ratio 0 2 young s modulus of elasticity 33 5 gpa gb 50010 2010 and energy dissipation represented by a rayleigh damping ratio of 5 determined by the first and third natural frequencies of cylinder in the water to consider the effect of transverse shear deformation the timoshenko beam elements are selected to simulate cylinders 3 2 number of ground motions since maximum response in time domain is an important indicator when evaluating the structural dynamic safety the absolute maximum responses are extracted here then a relative error δ is presented to quantify the comparison results to obtain δ the responses obtained from the exact method is taken as the reference standard hence δ is defined as maximum response of exact method maximum response of other methods maximum response of exact method 100 in this comparison the displacement at the top of the cylinder shear force and bending moment at the base of cylinder are considered due to the randomness of ground motion the errors for simplified methods fluctuate with the input ground motions in addition analyzing the method accuracy from the perspective of probability also need a sufficient number of earthquake samples therefore the relative stability of the error is tested to determine the number of input ground motions firstly ground motion records are selected from the nga west2 ground motion database of pacific earthquake engineering research center peer center 2015 under the environmental conditions such as river bottom or seabed the site is mostly soft soil site hence the factor firstly accounted in record selection is the average shear wave velocity of top 30 m of the site denoted as vs30 m s the other three factors accounted include d5 95 sec magnitude and r rup km which stand for the significant duration moment magnitude and closest distance to rupture plane and the peak acceleration of all records is adjusted to 2 m s2 for a certain cylinder 2r h 0 35 h 70m the variation of mean error with the number of ground motions can be seen in fig 3 the mean errors have drastic changes when the number is small and have slight fluctuations at large numbers according to the law of large numbers for a random event the mean value of random variable tends to be unstable when sample size is small but with the increasing of sample size the mean value will converge to define stability quantitatively five records are set as the increment of a step then the mean error is inspected to vary within 5 values of following six steps if the inspection standard is satisfied the number of records guarantees the stability of mean error the number of records that satisfy the stability of every cylinder are presented in figs 4 6 it is apparent that the upper limit values are all 100 for responses of method 1 the caps are all 95 for method 2 for method 3 the caps are 100 for displacement error and 95 for shear force and bending moment error so the amount of input ground motion is determined as 100 the statistics of finally selected ground motions are summarized in table 1 4 results and discussion as the aims of the research are studying the accuracy of the three simplified methods from the perspective of probability and the application range of methods the results are presented as following ⅰ comparison of added mass of the three simplified method under partial cylinders ⅱ comparison of the mean values of errors under all cylinders ⅲ analysis the influence rule of parameters based on the mean errors ⅳ analysis the statistical characteristic values of the errors then obtainment of the probability distribution function of the error finally comparison of the probabilities 4 1 the difference of added mass as described earlier the added mass matrix of exact method is non diagonal matrix while the matrices obtained from simplified methods are diagonal so a comparison of the added mass along the depth of cylinder for simplified methods are carried out here fig 7 shows the comparison under certain cylinder cases an added mass coefficient which is defined as the ratio of the added mass to the mass of water discharged by cylinder of unit length is plotted on the horizontal axis as can be seen the added mass coefficients of method 1 are unevenly distributed along the height while the coefficients of method 2 and method 3 are uniformly distributed according to the fitting formula of method 1 the distribution of the coefficient along the height can be written in the following functional form x a 1 1 y e a 2 y 1 y 0 1 where x is the coefficient y is the relative height z h a 1 and a 2 is the constant with respect to l it can be seen that the distribution of coefficient is complex as vividly shown in fig 7 from the bottom to the water surface the added mass decreases gradually and the closer to the water surface the more dramatic change of the added mass if the added mass of the bottom node was taken as unit 1 the changes within 1 and 5 are considered stable for the added mass respectively the length of the region in which the added mass dramatically changes define as h r the change of h r with l is shown in fig 8 as l increases h r increases when l increases from 0 1 to 0 7 h r h ranges from 0 4 to 0 8 and 0 2 to 0 6 respectively for the same l the added mass obtained by method 2 is different for different h and the difference decreases with the increases of l for the same h the added mass decreases with the increases of l while for method 3 the coefficient stays constant in addition it can be seen from the figure that the coefficient of method 3 is the largest the coefficient of the bottom of method 1 is the second and the coefficient of method 2 is the smallest simply put the added mass of method 3 is constant and larger while the added mass of other methods decreases with the increase of l 4 2 mean values of errors cloud charts of displacement error under studied cylinders are presented in fig 9 the gray solid lines in figures are the isopleth lines the red solid line is the 15 isopleth line the black dashed lines circle region a and b representing the maximum and minimum area of error for method 1 the errors vary from 0 8 to 2 9 of which the maximum value is less than 5 for method 2 the errors are in the range of 1 4 5 3 of which the maximum value is less than 10 for method 3 the errors are in the range of 2 8 28 8 the maximum value is about 30 and the error of about half the cases is more than 15 the trends of isopleth lines are always changing for the three methods for region a the position in method 1 and method 2 is closer for region b the position in method 2 and method 3 is closer cloud chart of shear force error under cylinders are presented in fig 10 for method 1 the errors vary from 0 6 to 3 4 of which the maximum value is also less than 5 for method 2 the errors vary between 2 1 and 7 6 of which the maximum value is less than 10 for method 3 the errors are in the range of 3 1 21 8 of which the maximum value is slightly larger than 20 and the error of about a third of the cases is more than 15 the trend of isopleth line of method 3 is more regular while that of method 2 is complex the position of region a in each method is quite different while the position of region b in method 2 and 3 is closer cloud chart of bending moment error under cylinders are presented in fig 11 for method 1 the errors vary from 0 7 to 3 0 of which the maximum value is also less than 5 for method 2 the errors vary between 1 5 and 5 1 of which the maximum value is just nearly 5 for method 3 the errors are in the range of 3 1 27 3 of which the maximum value approaches 30 and the error of half of cases is more than 15 as with the shear force error the trend of isopleth line of method 3 is more regular while that of method 2 is complex the position of region a in each method is quite different while the position of region b in method 2 and 3 is closer it is evident that the errors are strongly related with structure parameters and method 1 has the smallest range of error furthermore the accuracy of different methods is compared under each cylinder for each cylinder the method corresponding to the relatively minimum error is shown in fig 12 for displacement error the occupation of method 1 is already 93 5 the remaining is occupied by method 2 for the shear force error the occupation of method 1 is 97 4 and method 2 also occupies the remaining zone for bending moment error the occupation of method 1 is 93 5 method 2 occupies the remaining it is apparent that the error of method 3 is always relatively larger the error of method 2 may be the smallest when l is less than 0 15 and the proportion of method 2 is larger when l is 0 05 that is to say the mean error of method 1 is the smallest under most studied cylinders even for some slender cylinders and method 2 may be more accurate for slender cylinders none of the relative minimum errors access from method 3 4 3 influence of two structural parameters on error through the irregular distribution of isopleth lines in the cloud graph it can be found that it is not so easy to describe how the errors is affected by the parameter hence based on the regression analysis this section will further discuss how parameters affect errors as demonstrated previously the errors are related to the parameters h and l and after several attempts it is found that the quadric polynomial regression model works better than commonly used models as linear logarithm exponential and power function regression the expression of the fitting formula can be written as 15 δ a 0 a 1 h a 2 l a 12 h l a 11 h 2 a 22 l 2 where δ the fitted value a 0 a 1 a 2 a 11 a 12 a 22 are the fitted coefficients the coefficients of the fitting formulas and values of two evaluation indexes of regression effect are listed in table 2 as shown in table 2 errors of the three methods are affected by h l and their coaction the regression coefficients of different methods vary greatly the coefficients for different responses of the same method are also different among them the difference of method 2 is larger and that of method 1 is smaller moreover the results of r 2 indicate that the formulas of method 3 are better fitted while method 2 are worse fitted to understand the fitting formulas easier the fitting surfaces obtained from the formulas are presented in figs 13 15 the yellow dots with red edge in the figures are the original errors the colored surfaces are the fitting surfaces for method 1 fig 13 the fitting surfaces of displacement error and bending moment error are similar and the errors are more affected by l and there is a negative correlation when l is small and a positive correlation when l is large for the shear force error the effect of l and h are both important the correlation between the error and h is positive while it is negative between the error and l for method 2 fig 14 the fitting surfaces of shear force error and bending moment error are similar while the surface of displacement error is different the correlations with h and l are both complicated for method 3 fig 15 the fitting surfaces of displacement error and bending moment error are more similar than the surface of shear force error there are significant negative correlations between the errors and l and there are slight positive correlations between the errors and h besides the shear force error is less affected by h for the studied cylinders the above results indicated that there is a more obvious linear correlation between the error of method 3 and the parameters while there is a more complicated correlation between the error of method 2 and the parameters if the 10 error which is commonly accepted in engineering is used as the evaluation method 1 and method 2 could be used in all the studied cylinders while method 3 could only be used in some cylinders which l is small less than 0 2 in addition it can be seen that the shear force error of method 2 is relatively larger compared with that of other responses while the shear force error of method 3 is relatively smaller 4 4 probability analysis in order to calculate the accuracy from the perspective of probability the probability density function of the error should be obtained to obtain the probability density functions a suitable method need be selected based on the statistical characteristic values of the error the characteristic values include the mean value which have been discussed in the previous section coefficients of variation c v and coefficients of skewness s k therefore c v and s k are analyzed firstly based on the analysis results an appropriate method is selected to fit the probability density functions of errors subsequently finally the probabilities of error for each structural case and each simplified method under various errors are presented 4 4 1 coefficients of variation of errors variation coefficient of errors of displacement c v d shear force c v f and bending moment c v m are demonstrated in figs 16 18 respectively as presented in fig 16 the maximum values of c v d are similar however the minimum values are noticeably different the minimum values of method 1 and method 3 are close to each other but the value of method 2 is obviously smaller than the formers for shear force error the maximum values of c v f are greatly different where the value of method 1 is the largest and the value of method 2 is the smallest for the minimum values of method 1 and method 3 are also close and value of method 2 is still much smaller for bending moment error there shows a similar regularity with displacement that is the maximum values are similar but the minimum values are noticeably different and the minimum values of method 1 and method 3 are close the value of method 2 is obviously smaller it can be found from the above results the influence of the randomness of ground motion on the precision of displacement and bending moment is similar but different from shear force furthermore the mean values of c v for 154 cylinder cases and the percentage of cases whose c v are less than the mean value are all summarized in table 3 the data indicates accuracy of method 2 is less affected by the randomness of ground motion hence it turns out that if the fundamental frequency accessed from the simplified method is close to the exact one the accuracy of the method is less affected by the randomness of earthquake 4 4 2 coefficients of skewness of errors skewness coefficient of errors of displacement s k d shear force s k f and bending moment s k m are demonstrated in figs 19 21 respectively the values of s k d of method 1 and method 3 are all positive while the values of that of method 2 has negative values moreover method 2 has the widest variation range of s k d the regularity of s k f and s k m are some consistent with s k d while a slight difference is that method 1 has a relatively larger range of s k f and s k m hence it is logical that the probability density function varies greatly among cases for method 2 there even have the right skewed distributions and left skewed distributions 4 4 3 probability analysis for each cylinder there are two types of methods to obtain the probability density function of the variable one is the parameter estimation and the other is non parameter estimation method in the parametric estimation it is assumed that the random variable obeys a certain probability distribution such as linear reducible linear or exponential etc and then fitting the parameters in the distribution according to the sample data so the probability density of the random variable is obtained however as subjective prior knowledge is needed in parameter estimation methods there is often a large gap between the certain distribution and the actual distribution so the results do not always achieve satisfactory gong and li 2009 different from parameter estimation non parameter estimation does not add any prior knowledge but fits the distribution according to the characteristics and properties of the data itself which can obtain a better model than the parameter estimation method kernel density estimation is a kind of non parametric estimation proposed by murray rosenblatt and emanuel parzen also known as parzen window ruppert and cline proposed a revised kernel density estimation method based on the clustering algorithm hjort and glad 1995 kernel density estimation makes full use of the information of the data and avoids bringing in the prior knowledge subjectively so a closer distribution to the data sample can be obtained mccloud and parmeter 2020 through the above analysis of the statistical characteristic values of the errors it is found that the probability distributions of errors for cylinder are quite different so it is necessary to use this non parameter estimation method to obtain the probability density function after the probability density function is obtained the probability distribution function of error can be obtained later on based on the distribution function the probability p r which includes the p r d probability of displacement p r f probability of shear force and p r m probability of bending moment are obtained the probabilities of the methods errors less than 5 are shown in the fig 22 as can be seen from the figure there are probability surfaces made up of discrete points which are probabilities of errors of corresponding cylinders from the probability surfaces of error less than 5 it can be observed that the surfaces of method 1 and method 3 are relatively smooth while that of method 2 are relatively rough furthermore the surface of method 1 is quite flat which means the probability of method 1 varies little with parameters the surface of method 3 is steep and the probability of method 3 decreases rapidly with the increase of parameter l the error of method 2 has relatively discontinuous fluctuation under cases to sum up the probabilities range between 0 74 1 00 0 01 1 00 and 0 06 0 82 for the three method respectively in addition in most studies cylinders the probabilities of method 1 are the largest even when l is small which means the structure is slender the probabilities of method 1 are only slightly less than those of method 2 in some cylinders then the results that the probabilities of the methods error are less than 10 are shown in the fig 23 comparing figs 22 and 23 shows that surfaces are all relatively smooth and the surface features of method 2 have the greatest difference furthermore the surface of method 1 and mehtod 2 are both flat while method 3 is still steep the probabilities range between 0 95 1 00 0 83 1 00 and 0 15 0 98 for the three method respectively whereas the probabilities of method 1 and method 2 are all near 1 00 when error is 10 so there only show the probabilities of method 3 that the error is less than 15 in fig 24 similar to figs 22 and 23 the probabilities of method 3 vary dramatically with parameter l the probabilities range between 0 26 1 00 apparently there are differences in the probability between different cylinders especially for method 3 the probability of method 1 is minimum in most studied cylinders even for some slender ones furthermore the probability assessment for a method by integrating all cylinders needs applied which provides a comprehensive view for the accuracy of methods 4 4 4 probability analysis for each method before obtaining the probability density function of error of the method it is necessary to determine the adequacy of sample size of structure the 154 cylinders in the previous articles are generated regularly then cylinders with sample size of 12 20 30 42 77 and 294 are generated in the same way the rate of change of error with respect to sample size is analyzed the rate focuses on the absolute value and is defined as the error under the previous samples the error under this samples the error under this samples therefore in the cases of 20 30 42 77 154 and 294 samples the rates of methods are shown in fig 25 a fluctuation of 5 is acceptable in the engineering so it can be seen that the sample size of 154 meets the requirements considering all designed 15400 cases which contain 154 cylinders excited by 100 ground motions the probability density functions of responses errors for each method are accessed the probability varying with error is obtained and demonstrated in fig 26 as shown in the figure the curves have a similar trend however the growth rates of the curves for the three methods are quite different method 1 has the noticeable growth rate and the probability of method 1 approaches 1 00 when the error is around 10 as shown in table 4 method 2 has a slighter growth rate than method 1 and the probability approaches 1 00 when the error is around 13 method 3 has a relatively slow growth rate the probability approaches 1 00 when the error is around 60 in addition some small details can be found in fig 26 the probability of method 1 is always the largest among all the three method on the other hand the probability of method 3 are the smallest except the p r f of error less than 5 consistent with the results obtained in figs 14 and 15 the shear force error of method 2 is relatively larger compared with that of other responses while the shear force error of method 3 is relatively small based on the above research results it could be concluded that the accuracy of method 1 is the best although the expression of the added mass is complex the accuracy and complexity of method 2 are both moderate method 3 has the simplest form and the maximum error 5 conclusions prior works have focused on developing more accurate or practical calculation methods for seismically induced hydrodynamic force while this paper compared and analyzed the accuracy of the existing representative simplified methods in this study we compared and studied the relative errors of structural peak elastic responses under extensive cylinder cases in addition the probability distributions of relative errors were accessed the main findings of this paper can be drawn as follows 1 the added mass of the rigid structure method varies along the water depth and is related to several structural parameters and this method has the highest accurate and the widest application scope in the three compared methods 2 the added mass of the method based on approximation of fundamental frequency is evenly distributed along the height as it obtained based on the fitting of fundamental frequency it is related to some structural parameters the accuracy of this method is suitable for most engineering applications 3 the added mass of the morrison method is even along the depth and related to only one structural parameter the formula of the morrison method is the simplest and the application is the most convenient meanwhile the accuracy is the worst in the three simplified method it is necessary to consider its applicable scope when use it these findings extend the acknowledge of the computational accuracy and application range of representative simplified methods for hydrodynamic force this study therefore indicates the following recommendations for the analysis of structure in water subjected to earthquake the magnitude of the added mass should relate to several structural parameters ignoring the change of the added mass along the height will bring error to method this error may be acceptable for engineering problems it may be an effective way to simplify the analytical hydrodynamics by assuming the structure is rigid however some limitations are worth noting we only considered the fully submerged cylinders but there are plenty of partially submerged structures this way how is the effect of the weakening of hydrodynamic effect on the accuracy of the methods additionally the influences of the structural nonlinearity superstructure or top mass and the effect of structure soil interaction are ignored therefore further work is needed including the above

20555,the effect of hydrodynamic force on the seismic response of structure in water cannot be ignored various methods have been developed to describe the effect of incompressible water but the relative performance of some practical simplified methods is largely unknown in this paper a comprehensive comparison of three representative simplified methods for assessing cylindrical hydrodynamic force is presented relative errors of structural elastic peak responses are constructed to measure the accuracy of the simplified method the errors are tested on 154 circular cylinders subjected to 100 ground motions the errors were first obtained by averaging the results of ground motions then the comparison between methods and the influence of parameters were studied based on the mean errors furthermore by analyzing the statistical characteristic values of the errors the kernel density estimation method was adopted to obtain the probability density of the errors finally the probabilities of cylindrical cases and methods were investigated the results show that if the added mass of hydrodynamic force depends on more structural parameters the accuracy of the method may higher the rigid structure method has the highest accuracy and the most complicated expression the accuracy and complexity of the method based on approximation of fundamental frequency are moderate the morison method has the simplest form and the maximum error the results indicate that the added mass should relate to several structural parameters ignoring the change of the added mass along the height will bring error to method and assuming the structure to be rigid is an effective way to simplify the analytical hydrodynamics keywords water cylinder interaction seismic response simplified method probability density 1 introduction many offshore structures such as bridges wind turbines and oil and gas platforms are surrounded by water the dynamic behavior of those structures is affected by the existing water structure interaction the importance of water structure interaction is generally accepted sun et al 2020 tian et al 2019 hydrodynamic force is the representation of the interaction effect many researchers have focused on finding solutions for hydrodynamic force especially for structure subjected to horizontal earthquakes wang et al 2018a yang et al 2017 whilst compressibility of water has a great influence on the form of hydrodynamic force fok and chopra 1987 hung and chen 1990 for ideal non viscous water considering compressibility of water liaw and chopra 1974 showed an expression for hydrodynamic force on elastic cylindrical tower due to the solution was shown in frequency domain it is almost impossible to be applied in time history analysis which is a basic and useful method to obtain seismic response of structure løkke and chopra 2018 based on the frequency domain solution wang et al 2018b presented an accurate and efficient hydrodynamic force model in time domain in addition researchers liaw and chopra 1974 tanaka and hudspeth 1988 greenhow and yanbao 1987 have concluded that water compressibility essentially has little influence on hydrodynamic force on slender cylinder that is to say water compressibility is negligible for slender cylinder zheng et al 2015 ignoring compressibility of water hydrodynamic force characterizes as inertial force solution for hydrodynamic force on structure can be conveniently modeled as a product of hypothetical added mass and acceleration of structure greenhow and yanbao 1987 zhang et al 2019 a number of researchers have focused on evaluating the hydrodynamic force or added mass among them liaw and chopra 1974 presented an analytical solution for hydrodynamic force of an elastic cylindrical tower in a theoretical way combined with the numerical discretization method the accurate response of the structure considering the influence of water can be obtained this method was called the exact method in this paper however the method is still inconvenient for analysis hence alternative simplified method is necessary wang et al 2018c one way to account the simplification is to replace the elastic deformation in the analytical solution by a rigid motion this simplified method was also proposed by liaw and chopra firstly liaw and chopra 1974 and is named as rigid structure method in this paper it s abbreviated as method 1 for the rest of this paper by do so expression of the obtained added mass is still too complex for engineers simplified formulas for the added mass have been proposed by researchers as jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2018b and li et al li and yang 2013 from the way of data fitting as added mass modifies dynamic properties of structure in water an alternative approach to get the mass was proposed by han and xu 1996 in their study an added mass representation to compute natural frequencies of water cylinder system was firstly presented on account of fundamental vibration has the greatest influence on dynamic response of most structures thomson and dahleh 2007 yang and li 2013a obtained an applicable simple formula of added masse based on discrepancy of fundamental frequency the fundamental frequency reduction rate was obtained based on simulation result such method is named as method based on approximation of fundamental frequency in this paper it s abbreviated as method 2 for the rest of this paper apart from the above methods morison equation is more widely used to consider the hydrodynamic effect on slender cylinder originally morison et al 1950 proposed a semiempirical formula to calculate the wave load on slender structure which has little influence on wave field later on penzien and kaul 1972 modified the equation to consider the hydrodynamic force caused by earthquake due to the simplicity and accuracy the morison method has been extensively used to consider the hydrodynamic force on slender cylinders li et al 2017 liu and sun 2014 yang and li 2013b the morison method is abbreviated as method 3 for the rest of this paper in aforementioned three simplified methods the stiffness of cylinder is assumed to be rigid flexible and fluidic flexible respectively so the three methods outline simplified ways to evaluate the added mass previous works have paid more attention to the balance of accuracy and efficient of one method under certain structural cases zhao et al 2019 omidi and lotfi 2017 wei et al 2015 furthermore huang and li 2011 found that the responses of bridge vary greatly when different methods of hydrodynamic added mass were used zarrin et al 2018 pointed out the uncertainty of the added mass has nonnegligible influence on the seismic performance and vulnerability of offshore platforms therefore the application of reasonable hydrodynamic added mass is very important in the dynamic response analysis of structures surrounded by water and the applicable range and relative accuracy of simplified method are concerned by engineering community in early papers of authors du et al 2019 guo et al 2019 preliminary analyses have been carried out from two perspectives responses in the time domain and transfer functions in the frequency domain in the preliminary studies peak responses to particular earthquakes resonant frequencies and amplitudes of resonant peaks were investigated and compared however earthquake ground motion has a strong randomness this randomness will have a large impact on results in order to consider the randomness this investigation will be conducted from the perspective of probability relatively stable response errors of simplified methods are accessed by inputting a large number of seismic excitations testing on the obtained errors the accuracy and application range of the simplified methods are studied finally recommendations are made on the simplified methods 2 methodology the dynamic behavior of a circular cylinder in water under earthquake is expressing as 1 m s u s c s u s k s u s m s u g f where m s c s and k s are the mass damping and stiffness matrices of the cylinder respectively u s u s u s are the deformation velocity and acceleration vectors of the cylinder respectively u g is the ground acceleration vector and f is the hydrodynamic force vector in this paper the structure is subjected to horizontal ground motion of single direction and the water is incompressible and non viscous the exact method used as the standard for simplified methods is briefly introduced firstly then the rigid structure method method based on approximation of fundamental frequency and morison method are sketched 2 1 representation of the analytical solution the analytical solution is obtained by radiation wave theory a brief introduction of the radiation wave theory is presented firstly the initial condition of water is assumed to be still after the cylinder is excited the surrounding water is no longer resting and the motion starts to propagate out this water motion is one kind of radiation motion to give a solution of this water motion the velocity potential or pressure of water is taken as a variable the governing equation of incompressible water is laplace equation combining the boundary conditions of the free surface seabed infinity and water structure interaction interface the solution of the motion can be obtained as shown in fig 1 the water depth from the bed to the surface is h radius of the cylinder is r and the origin of the cylindrical coordinate system locates at the base center of the cylinder the circular cylinder is assumed to be linearly elastic the water is assumed to be inviscid the surface wave is ignored the foundation is rigid and the horizontal ground motion excited by earthquake is along the direction of θ 0 the analytical expression for hydrodynamic force per unit height at depth z is liaw and chopra 1974 2 f w 2 ρ π r 2 h j 1 k 1 r 0 r 0 k 1 r 0 cos z 0 0 h u cos z 0 d z in which ρ is the density of water r 0 αr z 0 αz where α 2 j 1 π 2 h with j 1 2 k1 represents the modified bessel function of order one of the second kind and k 1 is the derivative of k 1 and u u s u g is the absolute acceleration of the cylinder combining with the finite element method f w can be defined as a product of mass matrix and displacement vector as follows 3 f w m w u s u g where m w is the added mass matrix of exact method which is a spatial coupled non diagonal matrix and it can be expressed as 4 m w 2 ρ π r 2 h j 1 k 1 r 0 r 0 k 1 r 0 w cos z 0 cos z 0 t w in which 5 w 0 h n t n d z where w is the shape function matrix n is a row vector of the global shape function of the one dimensional finite elements for the transverse displacement degrees of freedom immerged in the water and the superscript t denotes the matrix transpose from eq 3 eq 1 can be rewritten as 6 m s m w u s c s u s k s u s m s m w u g 2 2 representation of the rigid structure method as presented in eq 2 the exact expression for hydrodynamic force is constrained to the deformation of structure then the added mass depends on the discrete element this is troublesome for most seismic research and engineering application investigations for water structure interaction including problems in seismic response of dams liu 1986 pelecanos et al 2013 ship vibrations wang et al 2019 cerik et al 2016 etc assumed the structure to be rigid and computed an added mass to reproduce the hydrodynamic force on the vibrating structure therefore assuming the cylinder to be rigid the force reduced from eq 2 is liaw and chopra 1974 7 f rw 4 ρ r 2 u j 1 1 j 1 2 j 1 k 1 r 0 r 0 k 1 r 0 cos z 0 as f m u the added mass of the rigid structure method is 8 m rw 4 ρ r 2 j 1 1 j 1 2 j 1 k 1 r 0 r 0 k 1 r 0 cos z 0 as shown in eq 8 there exists a summation of series of special functions which is difficult to be used a fitting formula obtained by wang et al 2018b to replace eq 8 is expressed as 9 m rw ρ π r 2 d 1 1 z h exp d 2 z h 1 where 10 d 1 0 918 e 0 468 l 0 155 e 0 015 l d 2 1 248 l 1 1194 2 156 here d 1 and d 2 are parameters obtained by fitting l 2r h which is called width depth ratio wang et al 2018b the distribution of m rw along the water depth is presented in fig 2 and the rigid structure method is calculated in the form of eq 9 in this paper 2 3 representation of method based on approximation of fundamental frequency hydrodynamic force is a function of an added mass if the water is treated as incompressible the added mass certainly changes the vibration frequencies of cylinder based on the changed ratio of the fundamental frequency and assuming the added mass to be uniformly distributed along the depth the magnitude of the added mass could be obtained based on the above considerations yang and li 2013a fitted an added mass formula of circular cylinders which is suitable for cylinders of which the diameter is from 1 m to 20 m and with a water depth from 20 m to 140 m the expression of the added mass is 11 m f ρ c π r 2 c m 2 where ρ c is the mass density of concrete c m 2 0 0133 ln h 0 112 ln 2 r 0 0002 h 0 4 the nomenclature for r and h is the same as that above 2 4 representation of morison method in 1950 the notable morison equation was developed to calculate the wave force on cylinder morison et al 1950 in the equation the wave force consists of two components a drag force proportional to the square of the velocity and an inertia force proportional to the horizontal acceleration and virtual mass the application range defined in wave field is d λ 0 15 where d is the width of the cylinder and λ is the wave length penzien and kaul 1972 applied the morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic force caused by earthquake the hydrodynamic force exerted at depth z in unit length can be expressed as 12 f m f d f i 1 2 ρ a c d v z u v z u ρ v 0 c m 1 v z u ρ v 0 v z where f d is the drag force f i is the inertia force a is the projected area of cylinder of unit length on the vertical direction of wave c d is the coefficient of drag v z is the horizontal velocity of a water particle at depth z u and u are the absolute velocity and acceleration of the cylinder at depth z respectively v 0 is the volume of water discharged by structure of unit length c m1 is the coefficient of added mass whose value is 1 for circular cylinders v z is the local acceleration of fluid since the initial condition of water is resting v z and v z in eq 12 is zero in addition yuan et al 2005 proved the fact that damping of fluid has little contribution to seismic response of the cylinders and it could be neglected therefore eq 12 can be simplified as 13 f m f i ρ v 0 c m 1 u the corresponding added mass has the following form 14 m m ρ v 0 c m 1 using the three simplified methods of added mass to form mass matrices and substituting to the corresponding matrices in eq 6 the dynamic equations of structure considering the hydrodynamic effect are obtained it should be noted that the added mass matrix obtained from the exact method is a non diagonal matrix while the matrices obtained from simplified methods are all diagonal furthermore the added mass of rigid structure method is unevenly distributed along the height while it is identical in both morison method and method based on approximation of fundamental frequency to compare the calculation accuracy of simplified methods a relative error of peak responses is defined in the following number of ground motion records is first confirmed based on stability of the relative error the mean values coefficient of variation and coefficient of skewness of errors are then described based on the mean values the influence of parameters is analyzed based on the coefficient of variation and skewness an appropriate estimation method is selected to evaluate probability density function for errors of different methods finally probability of each method is analyzed 3 numerical cases 3 1 cylinder parameter as shown in the four methods above the hydrodynamic force depends on the added mass while the added mass depends on the parameters r h or l for simplicity the depth of water h is taken as equal to the height of cylinder h s so l is twice the slenderness ratio and there are only two independent parameters actually finally h and l are selected as the parameters of the added mass cylinders with fourteen different values of the slenderness ratio r h s are considered the slenderness ratio varies from 0 025 to 0 35 with a step of 0 025 the height of cylinder h s varies from 20 m to 120 m with a step of 10 m the total number of cylinders with different dimensions is 154 the mechanical parameters for all cylinders are mass density 2500 kg m3 poisson s ratio 0 2 young s modulus of elasticity 33 5 gpa gb 50010 2010 and energy dissipation represented by a rayleigh damping ratio of 5 determined by the first and third natural frequencies of cylinder in the water to consider the effect of transverse shear deformation the timoshenko beam elements are selected to simulate cylinders 3 2 number of ground motions since maximum response in time domain is an important indicator when evaluating the structural dynamic safety the absolute maximum responses are extracted here then a relative error δ is presented to quantify the comparison results to obtain δ the responses obtained from the exact method is taken as the reference standard hence δ is defined as maximum response of exact method maximum response of other methods maximum response of exact method 100 in this comparison the displacement at the top of the cylinder shear force and bending moment at the base of cylinder are considered due to the randomness of ground motion the errors for simplified methods fluctuate with the input ground motions in addition analyzing the method accuracy from the perspective of probability also need a sufficient number of earthquake samples therefore the relative stability of the error is tested to determine the number of input ground motions firstly ground motion records are selected from the nga west2 ground motion database of pacific earthquake engineering research center peer center 2015 under the environmental conditions such as river bottom or seabed the site is mostly soft soil site hence the factor firstly accounted in record selection is the average shear wave velocity of top 30 m of the site denoted as vs30 m s the other three factors accounted include d5 95 sec magnitude and r rup km which stand for the significant duration moment magnitude and closest distance to rupture plane and the peak acceleration of all records is adjusted to 2 m s2 for a certain cylinder 2r h 0 35 h 70m the variation of mean error with the number of ground motions can be seen in fig 3 the mean errors have drastic changes when the number is small and have slight fluctuations at large numbers according to the law of large numbers for a random event the mean value of random variable tends to be unstable when sample size is small but with the increasing of sample size the mean value will converge to define stability quantitatively five records are set as the increment of a step then the mean error is inspected to vary within 5 values of following six steps if the inspection standard is satisfied the number of records guarantees the stability of mean error the number of records that satisfy the stability of every cylinder are presented in figs 4 6 it is apparent that the upper limit values are all 100 for responses of method 1 the caps are all 95 for method 2 for method 3 the caps are 100 for displacement error and 95 for shear force and bending moment error so the amount of input ground motion is determined as 100 the statistics of finally selected ground motions are summarized in table 1 4 results and discussion as the aims of the research are studying the accuracy of the three simplified methods from the perspective of probability and the application range of methods the results are presented as following ⅰ comparison of added mass of the three simplified method under partial cylinders ⅱ comparison of the mean values of errors under all cylinders ⅲ analysis the influence rule of parameters based on the mean errors ⅳ analysis the statistical characteristic values of the errors then obtainment of the probability distribution function of the error finally comparison of the probabilities 4 1 the difference of added mass as described earlier the added mass matrix of exact method is non diagonal matrix while the matrices obtained from simplified methods are diagonal so a comparison of the added mass along the depth of cylinder for simplified methods are carried out here fig 7 shows the comparison under certain cylinder cases an added mass coefficient which is defined as the ratio of the added mass to the mass of water discharged by cylinder of unit length is plotted on the horizontal axis as can be seen the added mass coefficients of method 1 are unevenly distributed along the height while the coefficients of method 2 and method 3 are uniformly distributed according to the fitting formula of method 1 the distribution of the coefficient along the height can be written in the following functional form x a 1 1 y e a 2 y 1 y 0 1 where x is the coefficient y is the relative height z h a 1 and a 2 is the constant with respect to l it can be seen that the distribution of coefficient is complex as vividly shown in fig 7 from the bottom to the water surface the added mass decreases gradually and the closer to the water surface the more dramatic change of the added mass if the added mass of the bottom node was taken as unit 1 the changes within 1 and 5 are considered stable for the added mass respectively the length of the region in which the added mass dramatically changes define as h r the change of h r with l is shown in fig 8 as l increases h r increases when l increases from 0 1 to 0 7 h r h ranges from 0 4 to 0 8 and 0 2 to 0 6 respectively for the same l the added mass obtained by method 2 is different for different h and the difference decreases with the increases of l for the same h the added mass decreases with the increases of l while for method 3 the coefficient stays constant in addition it can be seen from the figure that the coefficient of method 3 is the largest the coefficient of the bottom of method 1 is the second and the coefficient of method 2 is the smallest simply put the added mass of method 3 is constant and larger while the added mass of other methods decreases with the increase of l 4 2 mean values of errors cloud charts of displacement error under studied cylinders are presented in fig 9 the gray solid lines in figures are the isopleth lines the red solid line is the 15 isopleth line the black dashed lines circle region a and b representing the maximum and minimum area of error for method 1 the errors vary from 0 8 to 2 9 of which the maximum value is less than 5 for method 2 the errors are in the range of 1 4 5 3 of which the maximum value is less than 10 for method 3 the errors are in the range of 2 8 28 8 the maximum value is about 30 and the error of about half the cases is more than 15 the trends of isopleth lines are always changing for the three methods for region a the position in method 1 and method 2 is closer for region b the position in method 2 and method 3 is closer cloud chart of shear force error under cylinders are presented in fig 10 for method 1 the errors vary from 0 6 to 3 4 of which the maximum value is also less than 5 for method 2 the errors vary between 2 1 and 7 6 of which the maximum value is less than 10 for method 3 the errors are in the range of 3 1 21 8 of which the maximum value is slightly larger than 20 and the error of about a third of the cases is more than 15 the trend of isopleth line of method 3 is more regular while that of method 2 is complex the position of region a in each method is quite different while the position of region b in method 2 and 3 is closer cloud chart of bending moment error under cylinders are presented in fig 11 for method 1 the errors vary from 0 7 to 3 0 of which the maximum value is also less than 5 for method 2 the errors vary between 1 5 and 5 1 of which the maximum value is just nearly 5 for method 3 the errors are in the range of 3 1 27 3 of which the maximum value approaches 30 and the error of half of cases is more than 15 as with the shear force error the trend of isopleth line of method 3 is more regular while that of method 2 is complex the position of region a in each method is quite different while the position of region b in method 2 and 3 is closer it is evident that the errors are strongly related with structure parameters and method 1 has the smallest range of error furthermore the accuracy of different methods is compared under each cylinder for each cylinder the method corresponding to the relatively minimum error is shown in fig 12 for displacement error the occupation of method 1 is already 93 5 the remaining is occupied by method 2 for the shear force error the occupation of method 1 is 97 4 and method 2 also occupies the remaining zone for bending moment error the occupation of method 1 is 93 5 method 2 occupies the remaining it is apparent that the error of method 3 is always relatively larger the error of method 2 may be the smallest when l is less than 0 15 and the proportion of method 2 is larger when l is 0 05 that is to say the mean error of method 1 is the smallest under most studied cylinders even for some slender cylinders and method 2 may be more accurate for slender cylinders none of the relative minimum errors access from method 3 4 3 influence of two structural parameters on error through the irregular distribution of isopleth lines in the cloud graph it can be found that it is not so easy to describe how the errors is affected by the parameter hence based on the regression analysis this section will further discuss how parameters affect errors as demonstrated previously the errors are related to the parameters h and l and after several attempts it is found that the quadric polynomial regression model works better than commonly used models as linear logarithm exponential and power function regression the expression of the fitting formula can be written as 15 δ a 0 a 1 h a 2 l a 12 h l a 11 h 2 a 22 l 2 where δ the fitted value a 0 a 1 a 2 a 11 a 12 a 22 are the fitted coefficients the coefficients of the fitting formulas and values of two evaluation indexes of regression effect are listed in table 2 as shown in table 2 errors of the three methods are affected by h l and their coaction the regression coefficients of different methods vary greatly the coefficients for different responses of the same method are also different among them the difference of method 2 is larger and that of method 1 is smaller moreover the results of r 2 indicate that the formulas of method 3 are better fitted while method 2 are worse fitted to understand the fitting formulas easier the fitting surfaces obtained from the formulas are presented in figs 13 15 the yellow dots with red edge in the figures are the original errors the colored surfaces are the fitting surfaces for method 1 fig 13 the fitting surfaces of displacement error and bending moment error are similar and the errors are more affected by l and there is a negative correlation when l is small and a positive correlation when l is large for the shear force error the effect of l and h are both important the correlation between the error and h is positive while it is negative between the error and l for method 2 fig 14 the fitting surfaces of shear force error and bending moment error are similar while the surface of displacement error is different the correlations with h and l are both complicated for method 3 fig 15 the fitting surfaces of displacement error and bending moment error are more similar than the surface of shear force error there are significant negative correlations between the errors and l and there are slight positive correlations between the errors and h besides the shear force error is less affected by h for the studied cylinders the above results indicated that there is a more obvious linear correlation between the error of method 3 and the parameters while there is a more complicated correlation between the error of method 2 and the parameters if the 10 error which is commonly accepted in engineering is used as the evaluation method 1 and method 2 could be used in all the studied cylinders while method 3 could only be used in some cylinders which l is small less than 0 2 in addition it can be seen that the shear force error of method 2 is relatively larger compared with that of other responses while the shear force error of method 3 is relatively smaller 4 4 probability analysis in order to calculate the accuracy from the perspective of probability the probability density function of the error should be obtained to obtain the probability density functions a suitable method need be selected based on the statistical characteristic values of the error the characteristic values include the mean value which have been discussed in the previous section coefficients of variation c v and coefficients of skewness s k therefore c v and s k are analyzed firstly based on the analysis results an appropriate method is selected to fit the probability density functions of errors subsequently finally the probabilities of error for each structural case and each simplified method under various errors are presented 4 4 1 coefficients of variation of errors variation coefficient of errors of displacement c v d shear force c v f and bending moment c v m are demonstrated in figs 16 18 respectively as presented in fig 16 the maximum values of c v d are similar however the minimum values are noticeably different the minimum values of method 1 and method 3 are close to each other but the value of method 2 is obviously smaller than the formers for shear force error the maximum values of c v f are greatly different where the value of method 1 is the largest and the value of method 2 is the smallest for the minimum values of method 1 and method 3 are also close and value of method 2 is still much smaller for bending moment error there shows a similar regularity with displacement that is the maximum values are similar but the minimum values are noticeably different and the minimum values of method 1 and method 3 are close the value of method 2 is obviously smaller it can be found from the above results the influence of the randomness of ground motion on the precision of displacement and bending moment is similar but different from shear force furthermore the mean values of c v for 154 cylinder cases and the percentage of cases whose c v are less than the mean value are all summarized in table 3 the data indicates accuracy of method 2 is less affected by the randomness of ground motion hence it turns out that if the fundamental frequency accessed from the simplified method is close to the exact one the accuracy of the method is less affected by the randomness of earthquake 4 4 2 coefficients of skewness of errors skewness coefficient of errors of displacement s k d shear force s k f and bending moment s k m are demonstrated in figs 19 21 respectively the values of s k d of method 1 and method 3 are all positive while the values of that of method 2 has negative values moreover method 2 has the widest variation range of s k d the regularity of s k f and s k m are some consistent with s k d while a slight difference is that method 1 has a relatively larger range of s k f and s k m hence it is logical that the probability density function varies greatly among cases for method 2 there even have the right skewed distributions and left skewed distributions 4 4 3 probability analysis for each cylinder there are two types of methods to obtain the probability density function of the variable one is the parameter estimation and the other is non parameter estimation method in the parametric estimation it is assumed that the random variable obeys a certain probability distribution such as linear reducible linear or exponential etc and then fitting the parameters in the distribution according to the sample data so the probability density of the random variable is obtained however as subjective prior knowledge is needed in parameter estimation methods there is often a large gap between the certain distribution and the actual distribution so the results do not always achieve satisfactory gong and li 2009 different from parameter estimation non parameter estimation does not add any prior knowledge but fits the distribution according to the characteristics and properties of the data itself which can obtain a better model than the parameter estimation method kernel density estimation is a kind of non parametric estimation proposed by murray rosenblatt and emanuel parzen also known as parzen window ruppert and cline proposed a revised kernel density estimation method based on the clustering algorithm hjort and glad 1995 kernel density estimation makes full use of the information of the data and avoids bringing in the prior knowledge subjectively so a closer distribution to the data sample can be obtained mccloud and parmeter 2020 through the above analysis of the statistical characteristic values of the errors it is found that the probability distributions of errors for cylinder are quite different so it is necessary to use this non parameter estimation method to obtain the probability density function after the probability density function is obtained the probability distribution function of error can be obtained later on based on the distribution function the probability p r which includes the p r d probability of displacement p r f probability of shear force and p r m probability of bending moment are obtained the probabilities of the methods errors less than 5 are shown in the fig 22 as can be seen from the figure there are probability surfaces made up of discrete points which are probabilities of errors of corresponding cylinders from the probability surfaces of error less than 5 it can be observed that the surfaces of method 1 and method 3 are relatively smooth while that of method 2 are relatively rough furthermore the surface of method 1 is quite flat which means the probability of method 1 varies little with parameters the surface of method 3 is steep and the probability of method 3 decreases rapidly with the increase of parameter l the error of method 2 has relatively discontinuous fluctuation under cases to sum up the probabilities range between 0 74 1 00 0 01 1 00 and 0 06 0 82 for the three method respectively in addition in most studies cylinders the probabilities of method 1 are the largest even when l is small which means the structure is slender the probabilities of method 1 are only slightly less than those of method 2 in some cylinders then the results that the probabilities of the methods error are less than 10 are shown in the fig 23 comparing figs 22 and 23 shows that surfaces are all relatively smooth and the surface features of method 2 have the greatest difference furthermore the surface of method 1 and mehtod 2 are both flat while method 3 is still steep the probabilities range between 0 95 1 00 0 83 1 00 and 0 15 0 98 for the three method respectively whereas the probabilities of method 1 and method 2 are all near 1 00 when error is 10 so there only show the probabilities of method 3 that the error is less than 15 in fig 24 similar to figs 22 and 23 the probabilities of method 3 vary dramatically with parameter l the probabilities range between 0 26 1 00 apparently there are differences in the probability between different cylinders especially for method 3 the probability of method 1 is minimum in most studied cylinders even for some slender ones furthermore the probability assessment for a method by integrating all cylinders needs applied which provides a comprehensive view for the accuracy of methods 4 4 4 probability analysis for each method before obtaining the probability density function of error of the method it is necessary to determine the adequacy of sample size of structure the 154 cylinders in the previous articles are generated regularly then cylinders with sample size of 12 20 30 42 77 and 294 are generated in the same way the rate of change of error with respect to sample size is analyzed the rate focuses on the absolute value and is defined as the error under the previous samples the error under this samples the error under this samples therefore in the cases of 20 30 42 77 154 and 294 samples the rates of methods are shown in fig 25 a fluctuation of 5 is acceptable in the engineering so it can be seen that the sample size of 154 meets the requirements considering all designed 15400 cases which contain 154 cylinders excited by 100 ground motions the probability density functions of responses errors for each method are accessed the probability varying with error is obtained and demonstrated in fig 26 as shown in the figure the curves have a similar trend however the growth rates of the curves for the three methods are quite different method 1 has the noticeable growth rate and the probability of method 1 approaches 1 00 when the error is around 10 as shown in table 4 method 2 has a slighter growth rate than method 1 and the probability approaches 1 00 when the error is around 13 method 3 has a relatively slow growth rate the probability approaches 1 00 when the error is around 60 in addition some small details can be found in fig 26 the probability of method 1 is always the largest among all the three method on the other hand the probability of method 3 are the smallest except the p r f of error less than 5 consistent with the results obtained in figs 14 and 15 the shear force error of method 2 is relatively larger compared with that of other responses while the shear force error of method 3 is relatively small based on the above research results it could be concluded that the accuracy of method 1 is the best although the expression of the added mass is complex the accuracy and complexity of method 2 are both moderate method 3 has the simplest form and the maximum error 5 conclusions prior works have focused on developing more accurate or practical calculation methods for seismically induced hydrodynamic force while this paper compared and analyzed the accuracy of the existing representative simplified methods in this study we compared and studied the relative errors of structural peak elastic responses under extensive cylinder cases in addition the probability distributions of relative errors were accessed the main findings of this paper can be drawn as follows 1 the added mass of the rigid structure method varies along the water depth and is related to several structural parameters and this method has the highest accurate and the widest application scope in the three compared methods 2 the added mass of the method based on approximation of fundamental frequency is evenly distributed along the height as it obtained based on the fitting of fundamental frequency it is related to some structural parameters the accuracy of this method is suitable for most engineering applications 3 the added mass of the morrison method is even along the depth and related to only one structural parameter the formula of the morrison method is the simplest and the application is the most convenient meanwhile the accuracy is the worst in the three simplified method it is necessary to consider its applicable scope when use it these findings extend the acknowledge of the computational accuracy and application range of representative simplified methods for hydrodynamic force this study therefore indicates the following recommendations for the analysis of structure in water subjected to earthquake the magnitude of the added mass should relate to several structural parameters ignoring the change of the added mass along the height will bring error to method this error may be acceptable for engineering problems it may be an effective way to simplify the analytical hydrodynamics by assuming the structure is rigid however some limitations are worth noting we only considered the fully submerged cylinders but there are plenty of partially submerged structures this way how is the effect of the weakening of hydrodynamic effect on the accuracy of the methods additionally the influences of the structural nonlinearity superstructure or top mass and the effect of structure soil interaction are ignored therefore further work is needed including the above

20556,the assessment of corrosion defects to determine their effect on pipeline integrity is essential for pipe managers to develop a scientific maintenance strategy in this work a nonlinear finite element fe model coupled with multi physical fields was developed to study the mechano electrochemical m e synergistic effect at an external corrosion defect on x100 pipeline elbow the results indicated that bending radius has an apparent effect on the burst pressure of the corroded pipe elbow however anodic and cathodic reactions was insensitive to bending radius under normal working pressures pipes elbows with corrosion defects located in the intrados have a lower burst pressure than those in the extrados and central line crowns when the deformation or stress generated at the corrosion defect was elastic the synergistic mechano electrochemical interaction effect was insignificant however when the depth of the defect or the applied internal pressure of the elbow was sufficient to produce a local plastic strain in the corroded region the corrosion reaction of the local steel at the defect was remarkably enhanced under multiaxial stress the corrosive behaviour of steel in the defective area involved numerous local galvanic batteries with the anode located in the high stress zone and the cathode in the lower stress zone anodic polarisation was found to occur in high stress zone which accelerated local corrosion keywords pipeline elbow corrosion defects modelling integrity assessment mechano electrochemical effect 1 introduction steel pipelines are globally known as the most economical and efficient tool for long distance transportation of submarine oil and gas resources they play an important role in the development of society and their construction is a major lifeline project gao et al 2019 fekete and sowards 2015 witek 2015 zhou 2010 shuai et al 2020a the elbow is a common and key constituent of a pipeline system that plays an important role in changing the direction of a pipe s route owing to the bending curvature a non uniform stress distribution is usually generated at the pipe elbow under the action of operating internal pressure owing to this the coating on the elbow gets easily peeled off from the pipe s body compared to that of a straight pipe thereby exposing the pipe body to soil solution which eventually causes further corrosion khalaj et al 2015 lam and zhou 2016 cepa 2017 corrosion is a typical defect that causes the failure of submarine oil and gas pipelines cheng 2016 shuai et al 2020b 2021 qian and cheng 2019 nahal et al 2019 ma et al 2013 mokhtari and melchers 2020 in general a large concentration of stress is generated at local corrosion defects which causes rupture or leakage of the pipeline thus determining the impact of corrosion defects on pipe integrity and safety is of great significance recently several standards and codes have been used to predict the failure pressure of corrosion defects on pipelines such as asme b31g 2009 rstreng kiefner et al 1989 dnv rp f101 2004 pcorrc stephens and leis 2000 csa z662 2007 and cup model 2017 shuai et al 2017 however these models were developed by considering straight pipes only and therefore they are not suitable for pipe elbows moreover there are limited empirical models for calculating the burst pressure of corroded elbows goodall 1978 developed a model to predict the burst pressure of intact elbows subjected to a pipe s internal pressure based on this model several studies have proposed modified models to calculate the failure pressure of pressurised pipe elbows using full scale burst tests or finite element numerical methods kim et al 2009 2013 wang and zhou 2019 wang and zhou 2019 however the evaluation codes of such models are mainly focussed on the mechanical strength of the pipe elbow in fact the locally corroded regions of pipelines are also subjected to complex electrochemical action i e the pipes get affected by multi physical processes gutman s theory gutman 1998 suggests that the mechanical stress accelerates the corrosion of steel surface and the growth of corrosion defects in turn affects the mechanical stress of the structure which is referred to as the mechano electrochemical m e synergistic effect based on gutman s theory xu and cheng 2012a introduced the concept of the mechano electrochemical m e effect to the research and engineering applications of pipeline corrosion based on the electrochemical corrosion test of x100 pipe steel under uniaxial tensile the former study confirmed that the existence of stress and strain can improve the corrosion activity of steel and the anodic reaction rate especially the plastic stress strain subsequently xu and cheng 2012b xu and cheng 2013 and xu et al 2013 simulated the m e interaction during the corrosion growth of a pipeline using the finite element method of the multi physics field the studies found that the concentration of stress in short defects was more obvious than that in long defects under the same initial corrosion depth which led to the formation of microcracks in the defect centre owing to corrosion by stress in addition it was also observed that once hydrogen generated by the cathodic reaction penetrates the pipeline steel the electrochemical activity and corrosion rate of the pipe materials get enhanced and simultaneously the concentration of stress in the defective area is also increased numerous tests conducted on pipe steels have confirmed this conclusion xue and cheng 2010 yang and cheng 2016 sun and cheng 2019 studied the m e behaviour of double corrosion defects occurring longitudinally on an x46 pipe in a near neutral soil solution through three dimensional finite element fe simulation and proposed a method to assess the critical distance of multiple defects zhang et al 2020 investigated the shape effect of asymmetric ellipsoidal defects on the behaviour of mechanical stress and the anodic reaction of pressurised pipelines to date the m e interaction of pipe steel has been widely studied by scholars across the world it is widely accepted that mechanical stress or strain can degrade the resistance of pipe steel to corrosion however the above studies were all aimed at straight pipes and there are limited studies on the assessment of m e interaction for corroded pipe elbows generally the stress of a straight pipe is uniformly distributed under the action of internal pressure however the bending curvature of pipe elbows generates a differential pressurised area on the inner surface of the intrados and extrados thereby resulting in a non uniform distribution of stress in the elbow such a structure inevitably affects the residual strength and electrochemical reaction for corrosion in the pipe in this work a novel fe numerical model that includes multiple coupling fields of stress and electrochemical was established to determine the m e interaction of an x100 pipe elbow with a corrosion defect in near neutral ph solution the multi field coupling theoretical model of stress corrosion and the classical pipe hoop stress theory were adopted to determine the stress and anodic current density at a specific location of the elbow under various internal pressures theoretical calculations were used to verify the fe model to ensure the validity and reliability of the numerical results subsequently the influence of the bending radius defect dimension and internal pressure on m e effect were investigated the novelty of this work lies in the development of a new assessment method that considers the m e effect for compensating the deficiency of the currently used integrity evaluation model of pipe elbows with corrosion defects this study is expected to provide guidance for the integral management of oil and gas elbows in engineering 2 multi physical field coupled fe model 2 1 initial model parameters loads and boundaries the m e interaction numerical model of a 90 curved pipeline elbow with corrosion defects was generated using the commercial multi physical finite element software comsol 5 4 the pipe diameter d and the thickness of pipe wall t were considered to be 711 mm and 18 4 mm respectively which were selected based on a specific x100 industrial pipeline a corrosion defect with smooth edges to avoid excessive stress concentration was modelled on the outer surface of the pipeline by reducing the thickness of local wall the illustration of the dimensional parameters of corrosion defects including its depth d length l and width w is shown in fig 1 the toroidal coordinate system has been used to clearly illustrate the structure of the pipe elbow and the location of the defects in fig 2 where θ indicates the clock position of the defect ϕ represents the axial angle of the pipe r is the radial direction and r is the bending radius of the pipe to improve the modelling efficiency the defect dimension and the bending radius of the pipe were parameterized this work mainly focuses on the synergistic interaction between electrochemical corrosion and the mechanics of pipe elbows in a bicarbonate soil solution ns4 ph 6 8 which has been widely used to simulate electrolytes trapped under unbonded coatings in the field national energy board 1996 the solid mechanics and electrochemical boundary conditions were set accordingly and the nodes at both ends of the pipe were fully constrained the outer surface of the elbow was set as a free constraint and the other surfaces were set as electrical isolation generally oil and gas pipelines are kept in service under a certain operating pressure therefore a uniform press load with a value of p 0 was applied to the inner surface of the pipeline a second order tetrahedral element was used to mesh the model for simulating the three dimensional geometric deformation of the pipe and the distribution of electrochemical field simultaneously the mesh density in the locally corroded regions was refined to improve the simulation accuracy whereas the pipe body far away from the defective area was meshed at relatively sparse distance to improve the efficiency of calculation four layers of grids were divided through the wall thickness mumpa solver was adopted to solve the m e multi physical field interaction and the relative tolerance was set to 0 00001 to obtain a more accurate convergence solution finally a study of mesh sensitivity was conducted to obtain the optimal mesh size through several trial calculations as shown in fig 3 when the mesh density increased the calculated results remained almost unchanged indicating that the mesh had converged subsequently the case with the least number of elements was selected as the final optimal condition for this model the minimum and maximum element sizes were determined to be 1 5 mm and 12 mm respectively and a total of 60 504 elements were generated the fe numerical simulation was carried out in the stress field corrosion reaction field and coupling field of the m e interaction 2 2 constitutive model of steel pipe to simulate the stress corrosion behaviour of the elbow the stress strain constitutive relation of the pipe material was provided as input into the fe model the elastic modulus e of the steel was 208 gpa and the poisson s ratio υ was 0 33 the nonlinear plastic behaviour follows an isotropic

is current density of the anode or cathode i 0 k is the corresponding exchange current density φ k is the electrode potential φ k e q is the equilibrium electrode potential and b k is the tafel coefficient in our previous work the basic electrochemical parameters of pipe steel x100 in ns4 solution were tested including anodic and cathodic exchange current densities of 2 353e 3 a m2 and 1 457e 2 a m2 respectively xu and cheng 2012b 2013 the tafel coefficients of the anode and cathode were 0 118 v decade and 0 207 v decade respectively it is noted that these basic parameters are related to the pipe steel grade and the corrosive electrolyte which should be measured specifically by electrochemical tests according to the nernst equation the equilibrium electrode potentials can be written as follows bagotsky 2006 5 φ a e q φ a e q 0 r t 2 f ln a fe 2 6 φ c e q φ c e q 0 r t f ln a h where φ a e q is the anodic equilibrium potential φ c e q is the cathodic equilibrium potential

n 0 is the initial density of dislocations prior to plastic deformation 1 108 cm 2 ε pe is the effective plastic strain calculated by finite element theory and δ p is the excess stress that is approximately one third of the equivalent stress at the local plastic position of the pipe 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the fe model to investigate the behaviour of m e interaction at the corrosion defects of a pipeline a corrosion electrochemical test was conducted on a tensile specimen of pipe steel i e x100 in ns4 solution under uniaxial tension stress in our previous work xu and cheng 2012b 2013 the corrosion potential together with the net current density of the tensile specimen under various von mises stresses were obtained by the test the data were compared with the corresponding fe numerical results as shown in fig 4 it should be noted that the specimen used in this study was an intact uniaxially tensile standard specimen and the net current density here refers to the algebraic sum of current densities of the anode and cathode respectively fig 4 reflects that the corrosion potential shifts inversely with the increase in stress while the net current density has a positive correlation with the stress for elastic deformation the change of both corrosion potential and net current density with stress was negligible indicating that the effect of m e is not obvious however it was also observed that when stress on steel exceeds 806 mpa of the yield stress and the stage of plastic deformation is reached the negative shift rate of the corrosion potential and the variations in the net current density increased sharply with the increase in stress demonstrating that the m e effect is significant this could be due to the fact that the local plastic deformation enhances the corrosion reactivity of material which subsequently breaks the balance between the anodic and cathodic reactions of the steel resulting in an excess of current density in the anode compared to that in the cathode that is to say the m e effect significantly accelerates the corrosion process in the plastic zone furthermore the good agreement between numerical results and experimental data illustrates that the fe model is reliable for determining the m e synergistic interaction of pressurised pipelines in soil solutions oil and gas pipelines usually operate under internal pressure which requires high safety furthermore owing to the high cost and difficult experimental conditions tests for electrochemical corrosion of full scale pipelines are rarely adopted in laboratory therefore the m e numerical model for elbow pipe developed in this study was verified using a theoretical approach in general for an elbow the stress distribution is non uniform under the action of internal pressure owing to the difference in the stress area between the inner surface of intrados and extrados sides however there exists a special position i e the intersection node position p fig 5 between the symmetry plane o a b c and the central line m n which is located at the neutral layer in this position there is no additional deformation caused by non uniform distribution of stress such that the hoop stress on node p can be calculated using the classical theoretical model of a straight pressurised pipe using the following equation 8 σ θ p 0 d 2 t where σ θ is the hoop stress p 0 is the internal pressure of the pipe d and t are the outer diameter and wall thickness of the pipe respectively in addition the anodic current density i a of an elastically stressed steel in the field of electrochemical corrosion can be calculated by the following empirical model gutman 1998 9 i a i a o exp δ p v m r t where i a o is the anodic current density of the stress free steel table 1 shows a comparison between the numerical and theoretical results of hoop stress and anodic current density at position p of an x100 pipe elbow bending radius r 5d in ns4 solution under different internal pressures it can be seen that the numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical values and the discrepancy between numerical and theoretical values is less than 8 this indicates that the boundary conditions and mesh generation of the numerical model used to determine the m e effect of pipe elbows are reliable 3 2 effect of defect location on the burst pressure of pipe elbow the assessment of residual strength is an important and effective way to determine the safety state of pipelines with corrosion defects and it has been widely accepted as a key link for the integrity management of oil and gas pipelines to study the effect of defect location on the failure pressure of elbow fe models for corrosion defects located at the intrados θ 0 o central line θ 9 0 o and extrados θ 180 o were established the depth length and width of the corrosion defects were fixed at 10 mm 100 mm and 60 mm respectively and the position of the defect along the axial direction of the pipe was assigned as ϕ 45 o it is noted that we have adopted the failure criterion of bursts as the point when the maximum equivalent stress at the defect reaches the tensile stress of the pipe material as widely used and verified by several burst tests khalaj et al 2015 ma et al 2013 kiefner et al 1989 shuai et al 2017 fig 6 shows the relation of burst pressure of the elbow with corrosion defect at the three typical locations and bending radius r mentioned above it can be observed that with the increase in bending radius the failure pressure of the pipe with defects located at the intrados increases gradually for the pipe elbow with a defect located at the extrados the failure pressure decreases with an increase in the bending radius when the corrosion defect is located at the central line the bending radius displays no effect on the burst pressure of the elbow moreover when the corrosion defect is located at the intrados of the elbow the failure pressure is lower than that at the extrados and central line which significantly threatens the safety of the pipeline therefore in this work we have primarily studied the effect of m e interaction in the corrosion defects located on the intrados of the pipe elbow 3 3 effect of bending radius on mechanical and electrochemical interaction bending radius is an important parameter of a pipe elbow to investigate the effect of bending radius on the m e interaction of pipe elbows in ns4 solution various 3d fe models with a stress corrosion coupling field of pipe elbows under different bending radii were generated in these models the dimensions of the defect were kept the same as those in the model given in section 3 2 an internal pressure of 20 mpa was applied to the inner surface of the pipe elbow fig 7 illustrates the distribution of von mises stress along the path s s fig 8 of the pipe elbows with different bending radii it is obvious that a large amount of stress gets concentrated in the defective area unlike its effect on the burst pressure at the limiting state the peak stress in the defect region is almost independent of the bending radius as shown in fig 7 in the limiting state it is expected that the defective area of the pipe under the action of a larger internal pressure produces a large deformation thereby generating localised bending thus we can suggest that bending radius inevitably affects the local bending and the state of stress resulting in differences in the burst pressure however when the pipeline is in service the internal pressure is generally low and the stress is mostly elastic in such a scenario no or negligible plastic deformation occurs therefore the bending radius has a limited effect on the state of stress of the defective region fig 9 illustrates the distribution of anodic current density along the path s s of the elbow under various bending radii it was observed that the anodic current density in the defective region is always higher than that of the non defected area where the anodic current density in the non defective region was approximately 3 8051 μa cm2 the peak value of the anodic current density in the defect centre reached approximately 4 05 4 19 μa cm2 which implies that mechanical stress enhances corrosion reaction additionally the peak value of the anodic current density in the corroded zone was found to have increased at first which subsequently decreased with the increase of bending radius when the bending radius was d the anodic current density had the lowest value of 4 051 μa cm2 and when the bending radius was 4 5d the anodic current density exhibited the largest value of 4 19 μa cm2 which implies an enhancement by 3 4 overall the influence of the bending radius on the anodic current density can be suggested to be limited fig 10 demonstrates the distribution of cathodic current density along the path s s of the corroded pipe elbows with various bending radii it can be observed that the cathodic current density in the defective region with concentrated stress is always higher than that in the non defected area the maximum value of cathodic current density appeared in the defect centre which increased negatively from 3 8 μa cm2 in the non stress concentration area to about 4 1 μa cm2 moreover with the increase of bending radius the peak value of each pipeline in the defective area displayed negligible change which indicates that the cathodic current density of corrosive cathodic reaction is independent of the bending radius of the pipe fig 11 shows the relationship between the maximum von mises stress at the local corrosion defect and the bending radius under various internal pressures it can be seen that with the increase in internal pressure the maximum stress in the defective area increases sharply when the internal pressure reaches 15 mpa the maximum stress exceeds the yield strength of the pipe steel i e 806 mpa for x100 steel used in this study owing to the hardening effect of the material the rate of increase in stress was declined however under different internal pressure the maximum stress of the defective area remained almost unaffected by the bending radius of the elbow fig 12 shows the maximum anodic current density in the local corrosion defect as a function of bending radius under different internal pressures the modelling parameters used here are the same as those in fig 11 it can be seen that the maximum anodic current density increases with an increase of internal pressure however when the internal pressure was less than 15 mpa the increase in anodic current density was limited this is because when the internal pressure is small the stress produced in the defective area does not reach the yield strength of steel and its local deformation is elastic thus the change of anodic current density with internal pressure was found to be insignificant when the internal pressure exceeded 15 mpa the maximum von mises stress in the defective area exceeded the yield strength of the pipe steel as shown in fig 11 and area entered the stage of plastic deformation the maximum anodic current density increased significantly with the increase in internal pressure indicating that plastic deformation has a significant influence on the corrosion electrochemical behaviour of the pipe however the maximum anodic current density at the defect was found to be insensitive to the bending radius of the elbows under various internal pressure conditions 3 4 effect of corrosion depth on the m e interaction corrosion depth is an important parameter of pipeline corrosion defects which has a significant impact on pipeline safety fig 13 shows the distribution of anodic current density along the arc length of the axial central line of the corrosion defect on the pipe elbows at four corrosion depths in ns4 solution the assigned bending radius was a constant of 4 5d other parameters such as the corrosion length width and internal pressure of the pipe were the same as those used in section 3 3 fig 13 shows that the anodic current density of the corroded area had negligible difference at defect depths of 4 5 mm and 6 5 mm respectively however as the depth of the defect increased further to 10 mm and 12 mm the anodic current density at the defect centre displayed a significant increase with the increase in peak value to 4 18 μa cm2 and 4 50 μa cm2 respectively to explain the above phenomenon the von mises stress distribution and the effective plastic strain distribution of the defective area were obtained at different depths based on the results of numerical modelling as shown in figs 14 and 15 it was observed that as the defect depth increased the stress and plastic deformation in the defective area increased gradually when the depth was 4 5 mm the stress at local areas of the defect centre was low shown by lighter shade in fig 11 and the deformation was elastic i e the colour of the defect centre in the deformation nephogram of fig 15 was blue in the web version when the depth increased to 6 5 mm the stress gradually increased however it was still lower than the yield strength i e 806 mpa of the pipe steel therefore the local deformation was still elastic and the change in anodic current density was insignificant however as the defect depth further increased to 10 mm and 12 mm the stress in the defect centre increased significantly i e the red colour was darkened owing to the bulging effect the local area entered the plastic deformation stage which significantly enhanced the anodic reaction activity of iron dissolution and the anodic current density was also significantly improved fig 16 shows the distribution of cathodic current density along the arc length of the axial central line of the defect at different corrosion depths it can be observed that due to concentrated stress the cathodic current density in the defective zone was larger than that in the non defected area i e 3 8051 μa cm2 as shown in section 3 3 interestingly unlike the anodic current density the shallower and deeper defects had almost the same influence on cathodic current density of corrosion reaction i e the cathodic current density increased negatively as the depth of the defect increased which indicates that there is no remarkable difference between elastic and plastic deformation in promoting cathodic reaction moreover when the corrosion depth was increased from 4 5 mm to 12 mm the peak cathodic current density increased negatively from 3 9085 μa cm2 to 4 18134 μa cm2 with a variation of 6 98 which is significantly lesser than the 17 5 i e 4 50125 3 83108 3 83108 17 5 variation of anodic current density the observation indicates that the effect of corrosion depth on iron dissolution reaction is more obvious than that on hydrogen evolution reaction 3 5 effect of internal pressure on the m e interaction oil and gas pipelines usually work under internal pressure which is the motive power of oil gas transportation on the other hand it is also the primary source of stress applied to pipelines under working pressure the stress of an intact pipeline does not exceed the yield strength of the pipe steel however when corrosion defects occur in the pipeline the stress at the local defective area may exceed the yield limit of the material which is a threat to the integrity of the pipeline the internal pressure affects the level of stress concentration in the defective area which in turn affects the corrosion electrochemical behaviour of the material fig 17 shows the distribution of the anodic current density iron dissolution along the arc length of the axial central line of the defect on the elbows under different internal pressures it can be observed that when the pipe elbow was not pressurised i e when the pressure was at 0 mpa the anodic current density was constant at 3 69866 μa cm2 which indicated that the pipe steel of the defective zone was in a state of free corrosion as the pressure increased concentrated stress was generated in the defective area which resulted in an increase of the anodic current density interestingly when the internal pressure increased to 10 mpa and 15 mpa the anodic current density along the arc length had an almost uniform distribution however when the pressure continued to increase to 20 mpa and 25 mpa the peak value of the anodic current density increased significantly to 4 18917 μa cm2 and 4 59243 μa cm2 respectively and a slight decrease was observed on both sides of the centre of the defect fig 18 shows the von mises stress nephogram of the defective area under four different levels of internal pressure it can be observed that the stress in the defective area increases with increase in pressure under a low level of internal pressure i e 10 mpa and 15 mpa as considered in this study the stress at local zone of the defect centre was relatively smaller and lesser 806 mpa than that of the yield strength of the pipe which was in the domain of elastic stress when the internal pressure continued to increase to 20 mpa and 25 mpa the stress of the defect centre became larger than the yield strength and subsequently plastic deformation occurred which intensified the anodic reaction of corrosion in the defect centre thus the density of anodic current increased significantly fig 19 illustrates the distribution of cathodic current density along the arc length of the axial central line of the defect under various internal pressures when the pipe elbow was non pressurised i e at a pressure of 0 mpa the cathodic current density had a constant value of 3 69866 μa cm2 which is numerically equal to the anodic current density this was due to the fact that in the absence of stress the steel in the defective zone was under a condition of free corrosion when the internal pressure was increased to 10 25 mpa the defected areas generated stress concentration resulting in negative shift of cathodic current density moreover no obvious difference was observed between the effect of elastic stress and plastic stress on cathodic current density which is different from that on anodic current density where plastic stress has a more remarkable effect than elastic stress additionally when the internal pressure increased from 10 mpa to 25 mpa the peak cathodic current density increased negatively from 3 889 μa cm2 to 4 2195 μa cm2 the variation of 8 498 was significantly lesser than 20 8 variation of anodic current density i e 4 59 3 8 3 8 20 8 as obtained from fig 17 in other words the influence of internal pressure on anodic current density was found to be more sensitive compared to that on cathodic current density 3 6 implications of the effect of mechanical electrochemistry on corrosion reaction of pipe steel several experiments and simulations have confirmed that mechanical stress affects the corrosion reaction of pipe steel therefore it can be assumed that the defective area consists of numerous local galvanic batteries accompanied by multiaxial stress the higher stress zone was regarded as the anode and the lower stress region was regarded as the cathode the electrons were produced by flow from anode to the cathode through the external surface of the pipe wall and ferrous ions were aggregated at the cathode through the ns4 solution as a result the anodic dissolution of the pipe steel in the higher stress zone was further accelerated and it was slightly alleviated in areas with lower stress i e at both sides of the defect centre as shown in figs 13 and 17 simultaneously the hydrogen evolution process was also enhanced due to the effect of multiaxial stress the distribution of cathodic current density was affected by the local galvanic cell formed by the concentration of stress as shown in figs 16 and 19 due to the asymmetric effect of mechanical stress on the anodic and cathodic reaction the anodic current density and cathodic current density lost their balanced state the observation indicates that the high stress area was polarised more anodically under the interaction of mechano electrochemical effect i e under net current density of this work fig 20 and fig 21 show the distribution of net current density along the arc length of the axial central line of the defect under various depths and internal pressures the change in the net current density from negative to positive indicated that the defect centre underwent anodic polarisation with the increase in mechanical stress in addition both sides of the defect centre were subjected to cathodic polarisation owing to lower stress the electrochemical theory suggests that under such situation the current should flow from the centre of the corrosion defect through the ns4 solution to both sides of the defect thus corrosion at the local zone of the defect centre was accelerated while the sides were alleviated 3 7 implications on the integrity management of pipeline corrosion defects the evaluation of corrosion defect is a key step in the integrity management of pipeline since the inner surface areas of the intrados and extrados are different in pipe elbow the circumferential and axial stresses are not uniformly distributed under the action of internal pressure in an actual pipe elbow this is a limitation of the commonly used corrosion defect assessment codes i e asme b31g 2009 rstreng dnv rp f101 mop csa z662 2007 when applied to the elbow in this work we have proved that the failure pressures of corrosion defects at different positions i e intrados extrados and central line crown of a pipe elbow are different which is significantly different from that of a straight pipe therefore it is necessary to screen out the corrosion defects at elbows based on the ili i e inline inspection data for special evaluation and management additionally since most of the current burst tests on corroded pipelines have been carried out on straight pipes we suggest that a large number of burst tests on defective pipe elbows should be conducted to provide experimental data for further developing an empirical model to predict the failure pressures of corroded elbows furthermore a buried elbow in the field is usually subjected to multiaxial stress and is also affected by electrochemical action in soil solution the synergistic interaction between multiaxial stress and electrochemical corrosion should lead to the m e effect corrosion leads to a change in the defect size which leads to greater local stress and thereby promotes corrosion reaction if the pipe stress is elastic the m e effect is not appreciable and the enhancement of the corrosion reaction can be negligible in fact plastic deformation often occurs at the defects on pipe elbows which greatly enhances the corrosion activity in the high stress zone and affects the service life of the elbow it is thus clear that the concentration of local stress in the defective zone enhances corrosion which is a significant factor of m e effect that leads to perforation failure of pipe elbows however most of the codes for failure pressure of corroded pipes consider only the residual strength and not the m e effect the numerical model developed in this work with a stress corrosion coupled field can not only be used to calculate the failure pressure of elbow corrosion defects but also predict the future growth trend of the defect and its impact on pipeline integrity this assessment method should significantly improve the integrity management of pipeline corrosion defects such that pipe managers can make more reasonable decisions for maintenance 4 conclusions a novel finite element fe model coupled with multi physical fields i e stress field and electrochemical reaction field at the interface of steel bicarbonate soil ns4 solution would provide results of the synergistic effect between stress and electrochemical reaction at the corrosion defect and the prediction of the burst pressure of a pipe elbow the burst pressure of the pipeline elbow with corrosion defects located at the intrados was found to increase with increase in the bending radius contrarily the failure pressure and bending radius shown an inverse correlation when the defects were located at the extrados however the burst pressure remained unaffected by the bending radius when the defects were located at the central line crown of the elbow under normal operating pressures the bending radius had minor effect on the peak anodic cathodic current density at the defect centre the elastic deformation generated at the defective region of the pipe elbow exhibited an insignificant effect on m e interaction however when the corrosion depth or internal pressure further increased to produce plastic deformation the synergistic effect of the m e interaction remarkably enhanced the process of corrosion reaction owing to m e interaction anodic polarisation occurred in the higher stress zone which promoted the dissolution of the pipe steel subsequently the corrosion process at the relatively lower stress zone was slightly mitigated the local corrosion process was further enhanced with a

20556,the assessment of corrosion defects to determine their effect on pipeline integrity is essential for pipe managers to develop a scientific maintenance strategy in this work a nonlinear finite element fe model coupled with multi physical fields was developed to study the mechano electrochemical m e synergistic effect at an external corrosion defect on x100 pipeline elbow the results indicated that bending radius has an apparent effect on the burst pressure of the corroded pipe elbow however anodic and cathodic reactions was insensitive to bending radius under normal working pressures pipes elbows with corrosion defects located in the intrados have a lower burst pressure than those in the extrados and central line crowns when the deformation or stress generated at the corrosion defect was elastic the synergistic mechano electrochemical interaction effect was insignificant however when the depth of the defect or the applied internal pressure of the elbow was sufficient to produce a local plastic strain in the corroded region the corrosion reaction of the local steel at the defect was remarkably enhanced under multiaxial stress the corrosive behaviour of steel in the defective area involved numerous local galvanic batteries with the anode located in the high stress zone and the cathode in the lower stress zone anodic polarisation was found to occur in high stress zone which accelerated local corrosion keywords pipeline elbow corrosion defects modelling integrity assessment mechano electrochemical effect 1 introduction steel pipelines are globally known as the most economical and efficient tool for long distance transportation of submarine oil and gas resources they play an important role in the development of society and their construction is a major lifeline project gao et al 2019 fekete and sowards 2015 witek 2015 zhou 2010 shuai et al 2020a the elbow is a common and key constituent of a pipeline system that plays an important role in changing the direction of a pipe s route owing to the bending curvature a non uniform stress distribution is usually generated at the pipe elbow under the action of operating internal pressure owing to this the coating on the elbow gets easily peeled off from the pipe s body compared to that of a straight pipe thereby exposing the pipe body to soil solution which eventually causes further corrosion khalaj et al 2015 lam and zhou 2016 cepa 2017 corrosion is a typical defect that causes the failure of submarine oil and gas pipelines cheng 2016 shuai et al 2020b 2021 qian and cheng 2019 nahal et al 2019 ma et al 2013 mokhtari and melchers 2020 in general a large concentration of stress is generated at local corrosion defects which causes rupture or leakage of the pipeline thus determining the impact of corrosion defects on pipe integrity and safety is of great significance recently several standards and codes have been used to predict the failure pressure of corrosion defects on pipelines such as asme b31g 2009 rstreng kiefner et al 1989 dnv rp f101 2004 pcorrc stephens and leis 2000 csa z662 2007 and cup model 2017 shuai et al 2017 however these models were developed by considering straight pipes only and therefore they are not suitable for pipe elbows moreover there are limited empirical models for calculating the burst pressure of corroded elbows goodall 1978 developed a model to predict the burst pressure of intact elbows subjected to a pipe s internal pressure based on this model several studies have proposed modified models to calculate the failure pressure of pressurised pipe elbows using full scale burst tests or finite element numerical methods kim et al 2009 2013 wang and zhou 2019 wang and zhou 2019 however the evaluation codes of such models are mainly focussed on the mechanical strength of the pipe elbow in fact the locally corroded regions of pipelines are also subjected to complex electrochemical action i e the pipes get affected by multi physical processes gutman s theory gutman 1998 suggests that the mechanical stress accelerates the corrosion of steel surface and the growth of corrosion defects in turn affects the mechanical stress of the structure which is referred to as the mechano electrochemical m e synergistic effect based on gutman s theory xu and cheng 2012a introduced the concept of the mechano electrochemical m e effect to the research and engineering applications of pipeline corrosion based on the electrochemical corrosion test of x100 pipe steel under uniaxial tensile the former study confirmed that the existence of stress and strain can improve the corrosion activity of steel and the anodic reaction rate especially the plastic stress strain subsequently xu and cheng 2012b xu and cheng 2013 and xu et al 2013 simulated the m e interaction during the corrosion growth of a pipeline using the finite element method of the multi physics field the studies found that the concentration of stress in short defects was more obvious than that in long defects under the same initial corrosion depth which led to the formation of microcracks in the defect centre owing to corrosion by stress in addition it was also observed that once hydrogen generated by the cathodic reaction penetrates the pipeline steel the electrochemical activity and corrosion rate of the pipe materials get enhanced and simultaneously the concentration of stress in the defective area is also increased numerous tests conducted on pipe steels have confirmed this conclusion xue and cheng 2010 yang and cheng 2016 sun and cheng 2019 studied the m e behaviour of double corrosion defects occurring longitudinally on an x46 pipe in a near neutral soil solution through three dimensional finite element fe simulation and proposed a method to assess the critical distance of multiple defects zhang et al 2020 investigated the shape effect of asymmetric ellipsoidal defects on the behaviour of mechanical stress and the anodic reaction of pressurised pipelines to date the m e interaction of pipe steel has been widely studied by scholars across the world it is widely accepted that mechanical stress or strain can degrade the resistance of pipe steel to corrosion however the above studies were all aimed at straight pipes and there are limited studies on the assessment of m e interaction for corroded pipe elbows generally the stress of a straight pipe is uniformly distributed under the action of internal pressure however the bending curvature of pipe elbows generates a differential pressurised area on the inner surface of the intrados and extrados thereby resulting in a non uniform distribution of stress in the elbow such a structure inevitably affects the residual strength and electrochemical reaction for corrosion in the pipe in this work a novel fe numerical model that includes multiple coupling fields of stress and electrochemical was established to determine the m e interaction of an x100 pipe elbow with a corrosion defect in near neutral ph solution the multi field coupling theoretical model of stress corrosion and the classical pipe hoop stress theory were adopted to determine the stress and anodic current density at a specific location of the elbow under various internal pressures theoretical calculations were used to verify the fe model to ensure the validity and reliability of the numerical results subsequently the influence of the bending radius defect dimension and internal pressure on m e effect were investigated the novelty of this work lies in the development of a new assessment method that considers the m e effect for compensating the deficiency of the currently used integrity evaluation model of pipe elbows with corrosion defects this study is expected to provide guidance for the integral management of oil and gas elbows in engineering 2 multi physical field coupled fe model 2 1 initial model parameters loads and boundaries the m e interaction numerical model of a 90 curved pipeline elbow with corrosion defects was generated using the commercial multi physical finite element software comsol 5 4 the pipe diameter d and the thickness of pipe wall t were considered to be 711 mm and 18 4 mm respectively which were selected based on a specific x100 industrial pipeline a corrosion defect with smooth edges to avoid excessive stress concentration was modelled on the outer surface of the pipeline by reducing the thickness of local wall the illustration of the dimensional parameters of corrosion defects including its depth d length l and width w is shown in fig 1 the toroidal coordinate system has been used to clearly illustrate the structure of the pipe elbow and the location of the defects in fig 2 where θ indicates the clock position of the defect ϕ represents the axial angle of the pipe r is the radial direction and r is the bending radius of the pipe to improve the modelling efficiency the defect dimension and the bending radius of the pipe were parameterized this work mainly focuses on the synergistic interaction between electrochemical corrosion and the mechanics of pipe elbows in a bicarbonate soil solution ns4 ph 6 8 which has been widely used to simulate electrolytes trapped under unbonded coatings in the field national energy board 1996 the solid mechanics and electrochemical boundary conditions were set accordingly and the nodes at both ends of the pipe were fully constrained the outer surface of the elbow was set as a free constraint and the other surfaces were set as electrical isolation generally oil and gas pipelines are kept in service under a certain operating pressure therefore a uniform press load with a value of p 0 was applied to the inner surface of the pipeline a second order tetrahedral element was used to mesh the model for simulating the three dimensional geometric deformation of the pipe and the distribution of electrochemical field simultaneously the mesh density in the locally corroded regions was refined to improve the simulation accuracy whereas the pipe body far away from the defective area was meshed at relatively sparse distance to improve the efficiency of calculation four layers of grids were divided through the wall thickness mumpa solver was adopted to solve the m e multi physical field interaction and the relative tolerance was set to 0 00001 to obtain a more accurate convergence solution finally a study of mesh sensitivity was conducted to obtain the optimal mesh size through several trial calculations as shown in fig 3 when the mesh density increased the calculated results remained almost unchanged indicating that the mesh had converged subsequently the case with the least number of elements was selected as the final optimal condition for this model the minimum and maximum element sizes were determined to be 1 5 mm and 12 mm respectively and a total of 60 504 elements were generated the fe numerical simulation was carried out in the stress field corrosion reaction field and coupling field of the m e interaction 2 2 constitutive model of steel pipe to simulate the stress corrosion behaviour of the elbow the stress strain constitutive relation

coefficient in our previous work the basic electrochemical parameters of pipe steel x100 in ns4 solution were tested including anodic and cathodic exchange current densities of 2 353e 3 a m2 and 1 457e 2 a m2 respectively xu and cheng 2012b 2013 the tafel coefficients of the anode and cathode were 0 118 v decade and 0 207 v decade respectively it is noted that these basic parameters are related to the pipe steel grade and the corrosive electrolyte which should be measured specifically by electrochemical tests according to the nernst equation the equilibrium electrode potentials can be written as follows bagotsky 2006 5 φ a e q φ a e q 0 r t 2 f ln a fe 2 6 φ c e q φ c e q 0 r t f ln a h where φ a e q is the anodic equilibrium potential φ c e q is the cathodic equilibrium potential

approximately one third of the equivalent stress at the local plastic position of the pipe 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the fe model to investigate the behaviour of m e interaction at the corrosion defects of a pipeline a corrosion electrochemical test was conducted on a tensile specimen of pipe steel i e x100 in ns4 solution under uniaxial tension stress in our previous work xu and cheng 2012b 2013 the corrosion potential together with the net current density of the tensile specimen under various von mises stresses were obtained by the test the data were compared with the corresponding fe numerical results as shown in fig 4 it should be noted that the specimen used in this study was an intact uniaxially tensile standard specimen and the net current density here refers to the algebraic sum of current densities of the anode and cathode respectively fig 4 reflects that the corrosion potential shifts inversely with the increase in stress while the net current density has a positive correlation with the stress for elastic deformation the change of both corrosion potential and net current density with stress was negligible indicating that the effect of m e is not obvious however it was also observed that when stress on steel exceeds 806 mpa of the yield stress and the stage of plastic deformation is reached the negative shift rate of the corrosion potential and the variations in the net current density increased sharply with the increase in stress demonstrating that the m e effect is significant this could be due to the fact that the local plastic deformation enhances the corrosion reactivity of material which subsequently breaks the balance between the anodic and cathodic reactions of the steel resulting in an excess of current density in the anode compared to that in the cathode that is to say the m e effect significantly accelerates the corrosion process in the plastic zone furthermore the good agreement between numerical results and experimental data illustrates that the fe model is reliable for determining the m e synergistic interaction of pressurised pipelines in soil solutions oil and gas pipelines usually operate under internal pressure which requires high safety furthermore owing to the high cost and difficult experimental conditions tests for electrochemical corrosion of full scale pipelines are rarely adopted in laboratory therefore the m e numerical model for elbow pipe developed in this study was verified using a theoretical approach in general for an elbow the stress distribution is non uniform under the action of internal pressure owing to the difference in the stress area between the inner surface of intrados and extrados sides however there exists a special position i e the intersection node position p fig 5 between the symmetry plane o a b c and the central line m n which is located at the neutral layer in this position there is no additional deformation caused by non uniform distribution of stress such that the hoop stress on node p can be calculated using the classical theoretical model of a straight pressurised pipe using the following equation 8 σ θ p 0 d 2 t where σ θ is the hoop stress p 0 is the internal pressure of the pipe d and t are the outer diameter and wall thickness of the pipe respectively in addition the anodic current density i a of an elastically stressed steel in the field of electrochemical corrosion can be calculated by the following empirical model gutman 1998 9 i a i a o exp δ p v m r t where i a o is the anodic current density of the stress free steel table 1 shows a comparison between the numerical and theoretical results of hoop stress and anodic current density at position p of an x100 pipe elbow bending radius r 5d in ns4 solution under different internal pressures it can be seen that the numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical values and the discrepancy between numerical and theoretical values is less than 8 this indicates that the boundary conditions and mesh generation of the numerical model used to determine the m e effect of pipe elbows are reliable 3 2 effect of defect location on the burst pressure of pipe elbow the assessment of residual strength is an important and effective way to determine the safety state of pipelines with corrosion defects and it has been widely accepted as a key link for the integrity management of oil and gas pipelines to study the effect of defect location on the failure pressure of elbow fe models for corrosion defects located at the intrados θ 0 o central line θ 9 0 o and extrados θ 180 o were established the depth length and width of the corrosion defects were fixed at 10 mm 100 mm and 60 mm respectively and the position of the defect along the axial direction of the pipe was assigned as ϕ 45 o it is noted that we have adopted the failure criterion of bursts as the point when the maximum equivalent stress at the defect reaches the tensile stress of the pipe material as widely used and verified by several burst tests khalaj et al 2015 ma et al 2013 kiefner et al 1989 shuai et al 2017 fig 6 shows the relation of burst pressure of the elbow with corrosion defect at the three typical locations and bending radius r mentioned above it can be observed that with the increase in bending radius the failure pressure of the pipe with defects located at the intrados increases gradually for the pipe elbow with a defect located at the extrados the failure pressure decreases with an increase in the bending radius when the corrosion defect is located at the central line the bending radius displays no effect on the burst pressure of the elbow moreover when the corrosion defect is located at the intrados of the elbow the failure pressure is lower than that at the extrados and central line which significantly threatens the safety of the pipeline therefore in this work we have primarily studied the effect of m e interaction in the corrosion defects located on the intrados of the pipe elbow 3 3 effect of bending radius on mechanical and electrochemical interaction bending radius is an important parameter of a pipe elbow to investigate the effect of bending radius on the m e interaction of pipe elbows in ns4 solution various 3d fe models with a stress corrosion coupling field of pipe elbows under different bending radii were generated in these models the dimensions of the defect were kept the same as those in the model given in section 3 2 an internal pressure of 20 mpa was applied to the inner surface of the pipe elbow fig 7 illustrates the distribution of von mises stress along the path s s fig 8 of the pipe elbows with different bending radii it is obvious that a large amount of stress gets concentrated in the defective area unlike its effect on the burst pressure at the limiting state the peak stress in the defect region is almost independent of the bending radius as shown in fig 7 in the limiting state it is expected that the defective area of the pipe under the action of a larger internal pressure produces a large deformation thereby generating localised bending thus we can suggest that bending radius inevitably affects the local bending and the state of stress resulting in differences in the burst pressure however when the pipeline is in service the internal pressure is generally low and the stress is mostly elastic in such a scenario no or negligible plastic deformation occurs therefore the bending radius has a limited effect on the state of stress of the defective region fig 9 illustrates the distribution of anodic current density along the path s s of the elbow under various bending radii it was observed that the anodic current density in the defective region is always higher than that of the non defected area where the anodic current density in the non defective region was approximately 3 8051 μa cm2 the peak value of the anodic current density in the defect centre reached approximately 4 05 4 19 μa cm2 which implies that mechanical stress enhances corrosion reaction additionally the peak value of the anodic current density in the corroded zone was found to have increased at first which subsequently decreased with the increase of bending radius when the bending radius was d the anodic current density had the lowest value of 4 051 μa cm2 and when the bending radius was 4 5d the anodic current density exhibited the largest value of 4 19 μa cm2 which implies an enhancement by 3 4 overall the influence of the bending radius on the anodic current density can be suggested to be limited fig 10 demonstrates the distribution of cathodic current density along the path s s of the corroded pipe elbows with various bending radii it can be observed that the cathodic current density in the defective region with concentrated stress is always higher than that in the non defected area the maximum value of cathodic current density appeared in the defect centre which increased negatively from 3 8 μa cm2 in the non stress concentration area to about 4 1 μa cm2 moreover with the increase of bending radius the peak value of each pipeline in the defective area displayed negligible change which indicates that the cathodic current density of corrosive cathodic reaction is independent of the bending radius of the pipe fig 11 shows the relationship between the maximum von mises stress at the local corrosion defect and the bending radius under various internal pressures it can be seen that with the increase in internal pressure the maximum stress in the defective area increases sharply when the internal pressure reaches 15 mpa the maximum stress exceeds the yield strength of the pipe steel i e 806 mpa for x100 steel used in this study owing to the hardening effect of the material the rate of increase in stress was declined however under different internal pressure the maximum stress of the defective area remained almost unaffected by the bending radius of the elbow fig 12 shows the maximum anodic current density in the local corrosion defect as a function of bending radius under different internal pressures the modelling parameters used here are the same as those in fig 11 it can be seen that the maximum anodic current density increases with an increase of internal pressure however when the internal pressure was less than 15 mpa the increase in anodic current density was limited this is because when the internal pressure is small the stress produced in the defective area does not reach the yield strength of steel and its local deformation is elastic thus the change of anodic current density with internal pressure was found to be insignificant when the internal pressure exceeded 15 mpa the maximum von mises stress in the defective area exceeded the yield strength of the pipe steel as shown in fig 11 and area entered the stage of plastic deformation the maximum anodic current density increased significantly with the increase in internal pressure indicating that plastic deformation has a significant influence on the corrosion electrochemical behaviour of the pipe however the maximum anodic current density at the defect was found to be insensitive to the bending radius of the elbows under various internal pressure conditions 3 4 effect of corrosion depth on the m e interaction corrosion depth is an important parameter of pipeline corrosion defects which has a significant impact on pipeline safety fig 13 shows the distribution of anodic current density along the arc length of the axial central line of the corrosion defect on the pipe elbows at four corrosion depths in ns4 solution the assigned bending radius was a constant of 4 5d other parameters such as the corrosion length width and internal pressure of the pipe were the same as those used in section 3 3 fig 13 shows that the anodic current density of the corroded area had negligible difference at defect depths of 4 5 mm and 6 5 mm respectively however as the depth of the defect increased further to 10 mm and 12 mm the anodic current density at the defect centre displayed a significant increase with the increase in peak value to 4 18 μa cm2 and 4 50 μa cm2 respectively to explain the above phenomenon the von mises stress distribution and the effective plastic strain distribution of the defective area were obtained at different depths based on the results of numerical modelling as shown in figs 14 and 15 it was observed that as the defect depth increased the stress and plastic deformation in the defective area increased gradually when the depth was 4 5 mm the stress at local areas of the defect centre was low shown by lighter shade in fig 11 and the deformation was elastic i e the colour of the defect centre in the deformation nephogram of fig 15 was blue in the web version when the depth increased to 6 5 mm the stress gradually increased however it was still lower than the yield strength i e 806 mpa of the pipe steel therefore the local deformation was still elastic and the change in anodic current density was insignificant however as the defect depth further increased to 10 mm and 12 mm the stress in the defect centre increased significantly i e the red colour was darkened owing to the bulging effect the local area entered the plastic deformation stage which significantly enhanced the anodic reaction activity of iron dissolution and the anodic current density was also significantly improved fig 16 shows the distribution of cathodic current density along the arc length of the axial central line of the defect at different corrosion depths it can be observed that due to concentrated stress the cathodic current density in the defective zone was larger than that in the non defected area i e 3 8051 μa cm2 as shown in section 3 3 interestingly unlike the anodic current density the shallower and deeper defects had almost the same influence on cathodic current density of corrosion reaction i e the cathodic current density increased negatively as the depth of the defect increased which indicates that there is no remarkable difference between elastic and plastic deformation in promoting cathodic reaction moreover when the corrosion depth was increased from 4 5 mm to 12 mm the peak cathodic current density increased negatively from 3 9085 μa cm2 to 4 18134 μa cm2 with a variation of 6 98 which is significantly lesser than the 17 5 i e 4 50125 3 83108 3 83108 17 5 variation of anodic current density the observation indicates that the effect of corrosion depth on iron dissolution reaction is more obvious than that on hydrogen evolution reaction 3 5 effect of internal pressure on the m e interaction oil and gas pipelines usually work under internal pressure which is the motive power of oil gas transportation on the other hand it is also the primary source of stress applied to pipelines under working pressure the stress of an intact pipeline does not exceed the yield strength of the pipe steel however when corrosion defects occur in the pipeline the stress at the local defective area may exceed the yield limit of the material which is a threat to the integrity of the pipeline the internal pressure affects the level of stress concentration in the defective area which in turn affects the corrosion electrochemical behaviour of the material fig 17 shows the distribution of the anodic current density iron dissolution along the arc length of the axial central line of the defect on the elbows under different internal pressures it can be observed that when the pipe elbow was not pressurised i e when the pressure was at 0 mpa the anodic current density was constant at 3 69866 μa cm2 which indicated that the pipe steel of the defective zone was in a state of free corrosion as the pressure increased concentrated stress was generated in the defective area which resulted in an increase of the anodic current density interestingly when the internal pressure increased to 10 mpa and 15 mpa the anodic current density along the arc length had an almost uniform distribution however when the pressure continued to increase to 20 mpa and 25 mpa the peak value of the anodic current density increased significantly to 4 18917 μa cm2 and 4 59243 μa cm2 respectively and a slight decrease was observed on both sides of the centre of the defect fig 18 shows the von mises stress nephogram of the defective area under four different levels of internal pressure it can be observed that the stress in the defective area increases with increase in pressure under a low level of internal pressure i e 10 mpa and 15 mpa as considered in this study the stress at local zone of the defect centre was relatively smaller and lesser 806 mpa than that of the yield strength of the pipe which was in the domain of elastic stress when the internal pressure continued to increase to 20 mpa and 25 mpa the stress of the defect centre became larger than the yield strength and subsequently plastic deformation occurred which intensified the anodic reaction of corrosion in the defect centre thus the density of anodic current increased significantly fig 19 illustrates the distribution of cathodic current density along the arc length of the axial central line of the defect under various internal pressures when the pipe elbow was non pressurised i e at a pressure of 0 mpa the cathodic current density had a constant value of 3 69866 μa cm2 which is numerically equal to the anodic current density this was due to the fact that in the absence of stress the steel in the defective zone was under a condition of free corrosion when the internal pressure was increased to 10 25 mpa the defected areas generated stress concentration resulting in negative shift of cathodic current density moreover no obvious difference was observed between the effect of elastic stress and plastic stress on cathodic current density which is different from that on anodic current density where plastic stress has a more remarkable effect than elastic stress additionally when the internal pressure increased from 10 mpa to 25 mpa the peak cathodic current density increased negatively from 3 889 μa cm2 to 4 2195 μa cm2 the variation of 8 498 was significantly lesser than 20 8 variation of anodic current density i e 4 59 3 8 3 8 20 8 as obtained from fig 17 in other words the influence of internal pressure on anodic current density was found to be more sensitive compared to that on cathodic current density 3 6 implications of the effect of mechanical electrochemistry on corrosion reaction of pipe steel several experiments and simulations have confirmed that mechanical stress affects the corrosion reaction of pipe steel therefore it can be assumed that the defective area consists of numerous local galvanic batteries accompanied by multiaxial stress the higher stress zone was regarded as the anode and the lower stress region was regarded as the cathode the electrons were produced by flow from anode to the cathode through the external surface of the pipe wall and ferrous ions were aggregated at the cathode through the ns4 solution as a result the anodic dissolution of the pipe steel in the higher stress zone was further accelerated and it was slightly alleviated in areas with lower stress i e at both sides of the defect centre as shown in figs 13 and 17 simultaneously the hydrogen evolution process was also enhanced due to the effect of multiaxial stress the distribution of cathodic current density was affected by the local galvanic cell formed by the concentration of stress as shown in figs 16 and 19 due to the asymmetric effect of mechanical stress on the anodic and cathodic reaction the anodic current density and cathodic current density lost their balanced state the observation indicates that the high stress area was polarised more anodically under the interaction of mechano electrochemical effect i e under net current density of this work fig 20 and fig 21 show the distribution of net current density along the arc length of the axial central line of the defect under various depths and internal pressures the change in the net current density from negative to positive indicated that the defect centre underwent anodic polarisation with the increase in mechanical stress in addition both sides of the defect centre were subjected to cathodic polarisation owing to lower stress the electrochemical theory suggests that under such situation the current should flow from the centre of the corrosion defect through the ns4 solution to both sides of the defect thus corrosion at the local zone of the defect centre was accelerated while the sides were alleviated 3 7 implications on the integrity management of pipeline corrosion defects the evaluation of corrosion defect is a key step in the integrity management of pipeline since the inner surface areas of the intrados and extrados are different in pipe elbow the circumferential and axial stresses are not uniformly distributed under the action of internal pressure in an actual pipe elbow this is a limitation of the commonly used corrosion defect assessment codes i e asme b31g 2009 rstreng dnv rp f101 mop csa z662 2007 when applied to the elbow in this work we have proved that the failure pressures of corrosion defects at different positions i e intrados extrados and central line crown of a pipe elbow are different which is significantly different from that of a straight pipe therefore it is necessary to screen out the corrosion defects at elbows based on the ili i e inline inspection data for special evaluation and management additionally since most of the current burst tests on corroded pipelines have been carried out on straight pipes we suggest that a large number of burst tests on defective pipe elbows should be conducted to provide experimental data for further developing an empirical model to predict the failure pressures of corroded elbows furthermore a buried elbow in the field is usually subjected to multiaxial stress and is also affected by electrochemical action in soil solution the synergistic interaction between multiaxial stress and electrochemical corrosion should lead to the m e effect corrosion leads to a change in the defect size which leads to greater local stress and thereby promotes corrosion reaction if the pipe stress is elastic the m e effect is not appreciable and the enhancement of the corrosion reaction can be negligible in fact plastic deformation often occurs at the defects on pipe elbows which greatly enhances the corrosion activity in the high stress zone and affects the service life of the elbow it is thus clear that the concentration of local stress in the defective zone enhances corrosion which is a significant factor of m e effect that leads to perforation failure of pipe elbows however most of the codes for failure pressure of corroded pipes consider only the residual strength and not the m e effect the numerical model developed in this work with a stress corrosion coupled field can not only be used to calculate the failure pressure of elbow corrosion defects but also predict the future growth trend of the defect and its impact on pipeline integrity this assessment method should significantly improve the integrity management of pipeline corrosion defects such that pipe managers can make more reasonable decisions for maintenance 4 conclusions a novel finite element fe model coupled with multi physical fields i e stress field and electrochemical reaction field at the interface of steel bicarbonate soil ns4 solution would provide results of the synergistic effect between stress and electrochemical reaction at the corrosion defect and the prediction of the burst pressure of a pipe elbow the burst pressure of the pipeline elbow with corrosion defects located at the intrados was found to increase with increase in the bending radius contrarily the failure pressure and bending radius shown an inverse correlation when the defects were located at the extrados however the burst pressure remained unaffected by the bending radius when the defects were located at the central line crown of the elbow under normal operating pressures the bending radius had minor effect on the peak anodic cathodic current density at the defect centre the elastic deformation generated at the defective region of the pipe elbow exhibited an insignificant effect on m e interaction however when the corrosion depth or internal pressure further increased to produce plastic deformation the synergistic effect of the m e interaction remarkably enhanced the process of corrosion reaction owing to m e interaction anodic polarisation occurred in the higher stress zone which promoted the dissolution of the pipe steel subsequently the corrosion process at the relatively lower stress zone was slightly mitigated the local corrosion process was further enhanced with a

20557,three hybrid moorings are proposed for the station keeping of wave energy converters the hybrid mooring leg consists of top synthetic fibre rope nylon or polyester intermediate buoy and bottom

values keywords extreme mooring tension mooring fatigue damage synthetic fibre rope hydrodynamic model tests mixture rayleigh gamma weibull distribution snap loads 1 introduction the mooring system plays the role to keep the floating structure on station although for motion dependent wave energy converters wecs the mooring system can also affect the energy harvesting performance the mooring system design is a great challenge in shallow water both the catenary and taut mooring systems show some disadvantages in the application for shallow water the catenary effect is weakened since the length of the suspended segment is limited in shallow water xu et al 2019b in other words the lay down segment would be lifted quickly and the catenary mooring for shallow water floating structure is extremely long to prevent the lay down segment from being fully lifted as for the taut mooring it is too stiff for most wecs that take advantage of motion response to harvest wave energy besides expensive suction anchor is needed for the taut mooring in addition to the issues described above the snap load is another troublesome problem in the shallow water mooring design according to recent research the snap loads can occur in the catenary and slack mooring when the floating structure operates under survival wave condition in shallow water hsu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 2020b in general the snap loads need to be taken great care during the mooring design in shallow water as they can give rise to tremendous extreme mooring tension as well as mooring fatigue damage hsu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 2020b 2018 xu and guedes soares 2020 snap load is an important issue in the mooring design process as is characterized by a discontinuity in tension magnitude along mooring ropes dhanak and nikolaos 2016 it was concluded that the snap loads are generated in mooring ropes due to three main mechanisms palm et al 2017 namely the nonlinear stress deformation behaviour of the material tjavaras 1996 seabed contact mainly found in the catenary mooring gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 mooring configurations suddenly transition from slack to taut the third one is the most commonly seen the snap loads would give rise to tremendous spike tensions that could be greater than the breaking strength of mooring lines and cause mooring failure the mooring failure accidents were found in the wire ropes of the navion saga floating storage and ofﬂoading vessel kvitrud 2014 and the mooring ropes of floating oil production installations kvitrud 2014 ma et al 2019 the snap loads have been observed in various shallow water ocean activities such as the floating tunnel lu et al 2011 floating wind turbine hsu et al 2017 masciola et al 2013 wave energy converters hann et al 2015 harnois 2014 savin et al 2012 xu et al 2018 2020b the snap loads in mooring cables have been studied by experimental and numerical approaches a series of model tests were conducted in a towing tank to study the dynamics of a horizontally suspended submerged cable and the influences of excitation frequency and amplitude on snap loads were investigated vassalos et al 2004 vassalos and kourouklis 1998 non breaking focussed wave groups and a plunging breaking wave were generated in a wave basin to study the influence of wave steepness and wave breaking location on system dynamics of a point absorber moored single taut mooring hann et al 2015 it was found that the influence of breaking location on snap load amplitude is much greater than that of wave steepness a series of irregular wave model tests were conducted to study the dynamics of a point absorber moored by different mooring systems xu et al 2018 2020b it was found that the influence of wave height on snap loads is significant both the number and amplitude of snap loads were increased considerably in survival wave condition furthermore both the number and amplitude of snap loads of hybrid mooring systems were much smaller than that found in slack mooring a lumped mass method was developed to study mooring snap loads under different excitation conditions the time domain governing equations were solved by the modified euler method and the numerical results are compared with the experimental data huang and vassalos 1993 the numerical results were validated to be accurate enough and the snap events were observed under severe oscillation conditions i e high frequency and large amplitude oscillations a hp adaptive discontinuous galerkin method was applied to study the snap loads in mooring cables palm et al 2017 the shock wave propagated in mooring cables for the materials with linear and nonlinear mechanical properties were well captured by applying this method the accuracy of this method was validated by comparing the simulated dynamics of catenary mooring cables with the measured ones the finite element method was applied to study the snap loads of a deepwater taut mooring rope qiao et al 2020 the ultimate limit state uls design is one of the crucial steps of the mooring design process and the extreme mooring tension needs to be estimated accurately to ensure floating system safety an extensive review of extreme mooring tension analysis has been given by xu et al 2019b experimental tests were performed to study the dynamics of an fpso system moored by external turret mooring systems in deepwater and shallow water izadparast and duggal 2013 based on the measured data the rayleigh exponential three parameter weibull and three parameter rayleigh distributions were applied to fit the probability distributions of the peaks of fpso surge motion and mooring tension the extreme surge responses and mooring tensions were estimated based on these fitted probability distributions it was concluded that the three parameter rayleigh and three parameter weibull were flexible enough to fit the probability distribution of linear and nonlinear responses and extreme values were well fitted the peak distribution method was applied to study extreme mooring tension of fpso system under 100yr and 10 000yr conditions three different definitions of peak tensions were proposed and the influence of peak definitions on estimated extreme tension was discussed stanisic et al 2018 the weibull distribution was applied to fit the probability distributions of peak tensions and extreme mooring tension analysis and the accuracy of this method was verified by comparing the estimated extreme tensions with that predicted by the global maximum method the extrapolation methods including the acer method naess and gaidai 2009 optimal peak over threshold method by applying generalized pareto distribution gpd generalized extreme value distribution and three parameter weibull distribution to fit the statistical distributions of peaks were applied to study 3 h extreme mooring tension of a deepwater semisubmersible xu et al 2019a by comparing the results of extrapolation methods with the extreme mooring tension predicted by global maximum method it was concluded that the extrapolation methods were accurate enough the 20 min data were enough for obtaining 3 h extreme mooring tensions by applying the extrapolation methods snap loads have a significant influence on extreme mooring tension analysis since the snap loads follow different statistical properties from that of non snap loads hsu et al 2017 it was pointed out that the traditional weibull distribution introduced great error in estimating extreme mooring once the snap loads occur hsu et al 2017 because of this a composite weibull probability distribution was adopted to study the extreme dynamic mooring tension with the effects of snap events considered hsu et al 2014 2017 however this method is not easy to be implemented since the probability continuity at the transition point needs to be assured thus three parameter weibull and optimum pot methods were applied to study short term extreme dynamic mooring tension based on the tail data of measured mooring tension time series xu et al 2020b it was found that these two methods present good estimations to the extreme dynamic mooring tensions under the influence of snap events it is not easy to fit the parameters well for the distributions of tail data since the sample size is small besides the information of the bulk data is neglected a mixture gamma gpd distribution was proposed to study the extreme dynamic tensions of catenary and slack moorings for a point absorber under the effects of snap events xu and guedes soares 2021 the gamma distribution was applied to fit the bulk data and the gpd was used to fit the probabilistic distribution of tail data the parameters of the mixture gamma gpd distribution were fitted based on the bayesian inference method with the markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling procedure it was verified that this method shows good performance in estimating extreme dynamic mooring tension due to snap loads the fatigue limit state fls design is another considered design case for permanent mooring design the linear palmgren miner rule miner 1945 is widely used in estimating structural accumulated fatigue damage based on the linear palmgren miner rule the rainflow counting algorithm matsuishi and endo 1968 in conjunction with s n or t n curve is the main approach to study mooring fatigue damage huang et al 2011 xu et al 2020a yang et al 2016 2017 currently the time domain method is widely used to study mooring fatigue damage the fatigue damage is directly estimated from the measured or simulated mooring tension time series however the fully coupled dynamic analysis method is time consuming the quite efficient spectral methods provide a good solution to estimate mooring fatigue damage in preliminary design ocean waves are usually considered gaussian and the linear dynamic responses of offshore structures can be assumed as a narrow band gaussian process gao and moan 2008 as a consequence the stress load amplitude of structural dynamic responses can be described by the rayleigh distribution however the mooring tension is nonlinear due to the nonlinear hydrodynamic loads and geometric configuration furthermore the mooring tension is a wide band process gao and moan 2007 a probability density function was proposed to fit the peaks and troughs of non gaussian random processes ochi 1998 some wideband methods have been developed and show good performance in estimating structural fatigue damage dirlik 1985 proposed an empirical expression to predict structural fatigue damage under wideband load the probability density function of structural load amplitude is described by and hybrid exponential and two rayleigh distributions in another study a mixture model which combines two parameter weibull and a rayleigh distribution was used to describe the probability density function of rainflow load cycle amplitude zhao and baker 1992 based on the discrete markov chain approximation an approximation of probability densities of rainflow cycles was given by rychlik 1989 due to the low frequency and wave frequency loads generally the mooring tension is a bimodal process based on the gaussian assumption jiao and moan 1990 did pioneering work about the fatigue damage of the bimodal process by noticing there are two effects in the current bimodal methods which would underestimate fatigue damage a more sophisticated damage prediction approach was given to the bimodal process low 2010 the methods described above are under the gaussian assumption however the mooring tensions do not satisfy gaussian if the nonlinearities are high some spectral methods that focus on the non gaussian random processes have been developed åberg et al 2009 benasciutti and tovo 2005 ding and chen 2015 it is summarized that the snap loads induce tremendous spike tension which could endanger mooring rope safety as a consequence the extreme mooring tensions due to the snap events need to be estimated accurately it is difficult to present accurate estimations to the extreme mooring tension under the influence of snap events because the snap and non snap events follow different probability distributions the study of extreme mooring tension analysis due to snap loads is rare the current methods such as composite weibull and pot show some disadvantages in addition to the extreme tension it has been verified that the snap loads given rise to significant mooring fatigue damage xu and guedes soares 2020 however to the authors best knowledge there is still no study available to investigate the mooring fatigue damage under influence of snap loads by spectral methods it is noticed that one of the important steps of applying the spectral method to study fatigue damage is to accurately estimate the probability densities of load amplitude the model should be flexible enough since both the snap and non snap loads contribute to the mooring fatigue damage unfortunately these two components satisfy different statistical proprieties as a consequence the probability model for mooring fatigue damage analysis under the influence of snap loads needs to be flexible enough in this study a mixture rayleigh gamma weibull distribution is proposed to study the extreme mooring tension and mooring fatigue damage of three hybrid mooring configurations based on measured data the parameters of this model are fitted by the expectation maximization em algorithm the performance of this mixture model is compared with the results of other generally used models 2 probability distributions used in structural dynamics in this section the gaussian rayleigh weibull gamma and generalized extreme value distributions are introduced the gaussian weibull gamma and generalized extreme value models are applied to fit the exceedance probability of peak mooring tension the extreme mooring tension can be estimated once the parameters of these distributions are known besides the rayleigh weibull gamma distributions are applied to fit the probability density function of rainflow counting tension amplitude and the expected damage rate can be estimated according to the linear palmgren miner rule miner 1945 in addition to these conventional distribution models a mixture rayleigh gamma weibull model is developed to study the extreme mooring tension and mooring fatigue damage 2 1 commonly used probability distributions the gaussian distribution is widely used in modelling continuous wave elevations and linear structural dynamic responses the probability density function of a gaussian variable is given as 1 f x μ n σ n 1 σ n 2 π exp 0 5 x μ n σ n 2 where μ n and σ n are the mean value and standard deviation of variable x if the structural dynamic response is a narrow band gaussian process then the dynamic response amplitudes satisfy the rayleigh distribution under the gaussian assumption the rayleigh distribution is important in structural fatigue damage analysis and the probability density function of rayleigh is defined as 2 f r a y x σ r x σ r 2 exp x 2 2 σ r 2 x 0 σ r 0 where x is the amplitude of dynamic response and σ r is the scale parameter the weibull distribution is commonly used to describe statistics of load amplitudes of nonlinear responses and they have been extensively used in extreme mooring tension analysis the probability density function of the three parameter weibull distribution is defined as 3 f w b l x α β β α x μ w a β 1 exp x μ w α β α β 0 where α β and μ w are scale shape and location parameters respectively the two parameter weibull distribution is a special form of three parameter weibull distribution with the location parameter equal to zero the gamma distribution is very flexible and it is widely applied in meteorology and engineering recently it has been proved that the gamma distribution can successfully fit the dynamic response distribution of floating wind turbine dong et al 2011 according to the research of li et al 2016 the modified gamma distribution shows good performance in fitting the long term distribution of mooring tension amplitude the probability density function of gamma distribution is given as 4 f g a m x 1 β g α g γ α g x α g 1 exp x β g α g β g 0 where α g and β g is the shaper and scale parameters the gev is widely used in extreme value analysis its probability density function is defined as 5 f g e v x 1 σ exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ 1 ξ x μ σ 1 1 ξ ξ 0 1 σ exp exp x μ σ x μ σ ξ 0 where the parameters μ σ and ξ are the location scale and shape factor respectively 2 2 mixture rayleigh gamma weibull distribution it is noticed that structural fatigue damage can be well estimated by the rayleigh distribution if the loading process is narrow band furthermore the rayleigh distribution is usually acted as one of the components of mixture distribution for structural fatigue damage analysis of wide band loading process dirlik 1985 zhao and baker 1992 the weibull model has been widely used to study the statistical distribution of mooring tension and the gamma distribution is known for its high flexibility by noticing these features a mixture rayleigh gamma two parameter weibull distribution is given to combine the properties of these three model for extreme mooring tension and mooring fatigue damage analysis the probability density function of the mixture rayleigh gamma two parameter weibull distribution is then written as 6 f m i x x w 1 f r a y x σ r w 2 f g a m x α g β g 1 w 1 w 2 f w b l x α β as described above a total of seven parameters need to be estimated for this proposed mixture probabilistic model in this paper the em algorithm is applied to fit these unknown parameters the em algorithm is a powerful algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation for data containing missing data dempster et al 1977 an important feature of the em algorithm is that it is not merely a numerical technique but it also offers useful statistical insight em is a numerical technique that finds the posterior mode lee 2004 mclachlan and peel 2000 considering a set of observations x 1 x 2 x n and z 1 z 2 z 3 are the missing

bottom is studied in this work fig 1 shows the schematic and the 1 40 model of wec the height of the conical bottom is 7 5 cm the total height of the wec model is 50 cm the main parameters of wec are listed in table 1 where φ is the diameter δ is the free draft of wec without mooring lines being installed rxx ryy rzz are the gyration radius about x y and z axis respectively the height of the gravity centre is 16 3 cm where the baseline is located on the bottom of the model 3 2 hybrid mooring systems and power take off system it is troublesome to scale down the synthetic fibre mooring ropes for hydrodynamic model tests since the nonlinear axial stiffness and change in length properties of synthetic fibre ropes make them almost impossible to fully test their mechanical properties on a model scale wang et al 2019 2021 it is not a practical way to simply scale down the rope diameter which would give rise to overestimation of the axial stiffness of prototype rope however it needs to be noticed that the main purpose of this study is to obtain an insight into the dynamics of the nylon mooring ropes by hydrodynamic tests otherwise to predict the dynamic tensions of the prototype mooring system as a consequence the mooring systems used in this study are designed according to the dimension of the wec model if the main interest is the dynamic tensions of prototype mooring rope the axial stiffness must be scaled down accurately and the strategy by incorporating the o ring segment into the mooring model could simulate the nonlinear axial stiffness of nylon rope to some extent sheng et al 2010 as seen in fig 2 the mooring system consists of three mooring legs and the azimuth angle between each two mooring legs is 120 only the head sea condition is considered in this study and the 1m is the most loaded mooring the hybrid mooring is a two segment design which consists of top synthetic fibre rope and bottom chain besides a submerged buoy is installed on the connection point between these two segments the schematic diagrams of the hybrid mooring systems are given in fig 3 to investigate the influence of synthetic fibre rope material on floating system dynamics two kinds of materials were tested namely polyester and nylon hereafter the mooring system adopts polyester rope is named hyb while the one that uses nylon rope is called hnb furthermore another mooring concept hnbw is designed by installing two cylindrical clumped weights on the end of hnb mooring the mass of the buoy is 0 436 kg and its buoyancy is 10n the length of synthetic fibre rope and chain is 1 23m and 1 7m respectively the masses of clumped weights increase from top to the end and their masses in the air are 0 511 kg 1 229 kg respectively the distance between these two clumped weights is 10 cm and the distance between cm2 and anchor point is 10 cm the main parameters of the mooring rope are given in table 2 where w is per unit length mass in air r denotes mooring radius l e is the effective length of mooring rope both the nylon and polyester are braided 16 strand ropes and the nominal diameter is 3 mm pretensions of each mooring leg are listed in table 3 the original goal is to set the same pretension for each different mooring lines to exclude the differences of system dynamics caused by mooring pretension however it was difficult to implement due to the viscoelastic and viscoplastic properties and water absorbing phenomenon of synthetic ropes during the model tests the length of each mooring rope was adjusted slightly to ensure their pretensions as close as possible it is difficult to scale down the power take off pto system in the hydrodynamic model tests moura paredes et al 2016 in this study a linear spring and a square steel plate are used to simulate the stiffness and damping of the pto system as seen in fig 3 the heave plate is installed on the bottom of wec by a connection bar the length of the connection bar is 50 cm and the width and thickness of the steel plate is 10 cm and 1 mm respectively on the floor of the wave tank a load sensor is installed to measure the tension time series of the pto system a linear spring with stiffness equal to 29 22 n m is applied to connect the wire rope and the load sensor the length of the wire rope is 28 6 mm its nominal diameter and mass per unit length in air is 3 5 mm and 0 108 kg respectively 3 3 irregular wave test cases in this study three irregular wave tests including one operational op one heave resonance hr and one survival sv sea states were selected to study the dynamic mooring tensions in different sea states the random waves were simulated by the jonswap spectrum the main parameters are summarized in table 4 where t p is the peak period h s is the significant wave height γ is the peak enhancement factor the 1 40 model tests were performed in the towing tank of etsin universidad politécnica de madrid the length of the tank is 96m and the width and water depth is equal to 3 8m and 2 107m respectively it was pointed out that the sidewall has some influence on the second order hydrodynamic force of the freely ﬂoating body in the wave flume huang et al 2021 however in their study the maximum ratio of the flume width to the diameter of the floating body is 6 while in this study the ratio of the flume width to the diameter of the floating body is 15 2 in other words whether the sidewall of the wave tank could affect the hydrodynamics of the wec still needs to be discussed it is out of the scope of this study and will not be discussed here since our main concern is the extreme mooring tension and mooring fatigue damage the duration of each irregular wave mode test is 30 min which is longer than 3 h in full scale the natural heave periods of different systems are obtained by decay tests they are identical and equal to 7 39s xu et al 2021 three load sensors were installed on the top of mooring ropes to measure mooring tension time series and the sampling frequency is 50hz the measured data are converted to the full scale according to the froude similitude rule 4 short term extreme mooring tension the short term cumulative distribution function for independent and identically distributed iid variables is defined as f x and the distribution of extreme value f e x is then expressed as ochi 1981 razola et al 2016 13 f x n e f e x where f x is the cumulative distribution function of mooring tension peak n e is the number of tension peaks in the concerned time duration 3 h the most probable maximum extreme mpme has a 63 2 chance to be exceeded and it will be adopted as the characteristic extreme value in this study the extreme mooring tension is then calculated as 14 f x e 1 0 632 1 n e by considering that mooring line would give rise to significant peak tension when the floating structure operates in resonance and survival wave conditions then the main goal is to find suitable f x to fit the distribution of peak tensions and the extreme mooring tension can be calculated according to eq 14 in this study the extreme mooring tension analysis is conducted for these two test cases 4 1 most probable maximum extreme mooring tension analysis without de clustering following the study of hsu et al 2017 the snap loads are defined as 15 t s j t max j t max j t 0 t min j t l t l 0 1 t 0 where t s is the peak tension due to snap loads t max is maximum tension between two mean up crossings t min is the minimum tension between two mean up crossings t 0 is the pretension j is the label of identified peak tension the measured mooring tension time series of these studied mooring configurations in heave resonance are plotted in fig 4 and only 150s data within the maximum tension during 3 h are plotted to show results clearly it is seen that the snap event seldom occurs in the heave resonance wave condition the measured maximum mooring tension of nylon rope is similar to that of polyester rope and slightly greater than the maximum tension of nylon with clumped weights installed the reason is that the pretension of nylon rope with weights is slightly smaller than that of nylon mooring furthermore the attached clumped weights play the role to prevent the mooring rope from suddenly stretching to a certain extent which helps to reduce maximum tension correspondingly xu et al 2020b xu and guedes soares 2020 the gaussian two parameter and three parameter weibull gamma gev and mixture model proposed in this study is applied to fit the exceedance probability of extracted mooring peak tensions in heave resonance wave condition the parameters of two parameter weibull gamma and gaussian distributions are fitted by the maximum likelihood method and the parameters of three parameter weibull and gev models are fitted by the l moments method bílková 2014 goda et al 2010 xu et al 2019a some predicted results are compared with the empirical ones and the results are given in fig 5 where weib 2 and weib 3 denote the two parameter and three parameter weibull distributions respectively it is seen that the tail data follow a different statistical distribution to that of the bulk data which would induce difficulties in extreme mooring tension analysis the mixture model shows very good performance in estimating the statistical characteristics of mooring tensions it is found that all the empirical data follow the predicted exceedance probability curves of the mixture model for all mooring cases the three parameter weibull and gev distributions also have reasonable predictions of the exceedance probability of mooring tension it indicates that these three models can produce accurate estimations of short term mooring tensions in the heave resonance case as for the two parameter weibull model it is observed that the tail data is significantly different from the exceedance probability curve of the predicted one the exceedance probability of tail data is underestimated by the two parameter weibull which indicates that the extreme mooring tension will be underestimated according to eq 15 the 3 h extreme mooring tensions can be calculated the estimated 3 h extreme mooring tensions by different models are compared with the empirical one and the results are shown in table 5 it is seen that the mixture model shows excellent performance in extreme mooring tension analysis in heave resonance wave condition the difference between measured and predicted results are smaller than 0 5 for polyester and nylon with clumped weights cases besides the gev model also presents good estimations of extreme mooring tensions of these three mooring cases the mixture model overestimates the extreme tension of the nylon rope slightly the reason can be found in fig 5 a the mixture model tries to capture the exceedance probability of each peak tension while the interval between the second largest and third largest mooring tension is large which makes the tail of the exceedance curve to be flat however the mixture model is still able to present reasonable estimation the difference between the predicted and empirical extreme tension of nylon is 4 all the other models especially the three parameter weibull and gev distribution can present reasonable estimations to extreme mooring tensions for these mooring configurations this is understood that the nonlinearities of mooring tension in small wave heights are small as a consequence even the gaussian can present good estimations to extreme mooring tensions however the result of the two parameter weibull model for the nylon mooring is not satisfactory the error is around 11 the 150s mooring tension time series include the maximum peak tension in survival wave condition are plotted in fig 6 where the tremendous spike tensions are observed in all tested mooring configurations due to snap loads the number of snap events is considerable which frequently occur in the mooring time series the exceedance probabilities of the extracted mooring peak tensions in survival wave tests are shown in fig 7 furthermore the exceedance probability curves of snap and non snap tensions are also plotted it is seen that the statistic properties of snap and non snap tensions are divergent and the mooring tension is dominated by the snap loads it implies that the extreme mooring tension in survival wave condition is not easy to be predicted accurately furthermore the discontinuity is found in the tail peak tension a great gap between tail data is observed in each case i e tension which is greater than 1800 kn for nylon and polyester moorings greater than 1600 kn for the nylon mooring with clumped weights in other words these data make it difficult to accurately predict extreme mooring tension the distribution models described above are used to fit the exceedance probability of tension peaks in survival wave conditions and part of the results are shown in fig 8 it is observed that the mixture model shows the best performance in fitting exceedance probability for most of the data it tries to fit the exceedance probability of each data accurately and makes the tail of its exceedance probability curve to be flat which overestimates the exceedance probability of maximum mooring tension especially for the nylon mooring cases it indicates that the extreme tensions of nylon moorings would be overestimated by the mixture model on the contrary the two parameter weibull underestimates the exceedance probability of tail data significantly which implies that it fails to present accurate estimations of extreme mooring tensions as for the three parameter weibull and gev distributions the differences in the exceedance probabilities between empirical data and predicted values are acceptable it implies that these two models can give reasonable estimations to the extreme mooring tensions in survival wave condition the predicted extreme mooring tensions in the survival wave condition are compared with the empirical ones and the results are concluded in table 6 as expected the mixture model overestimates the extreme mooring tensions significantly except for the polyester case this is because for nylon mooring tensions the tails of exceedance probability curves are flat in other words the exceedance probability reduces extremely slowly in the tail part unfortunately the exceedance probability of mpme mooring tension is very small as a consequence the extreme mooring tensions of nylon moorings are overestimated significantly by the mixture model although the probabilities of most of the tail data are well predicted by the mixture model except for the last one however a small difference of exceedance probabilities in the tail data will give rise to great discrepancies in predicting high percentile for the model with a flat tail as for the three parameter weibull and gev distributions they can produce acceptable predictions of the extreme mooring tensions with the difference between empirical and measured ones being smaller than 10 the other models fail to give accurate estimations to the extreme mooring tensions due to the complicated statistical characteristic of peak tensions in survival wave conditions it is seen that there is a large quantity of snap and non snap events in the survival wave conditions which makes it difficult to estimate the extreme tensions discarding the non snap loads maybe a good solution for studying the extreme mooring since the number of snap events is the most important component in extreme tension analysis and the number of snap load is large enough for fitting the parameters of distribution models the estimated exceedance probabilities by different models are compared with the empirical ones and the results are shown in fig 9 it is seen that even considering only the snap tensions the statistical characteristics of the tail and bulk data are divergent overall the mixture model is the most preferable option for capturing the statistical properties of snap tensions almost all the data follow the exceedance probability curves of the mixture model including the tail data however the exceedance probability of the last data in fig 9 c is overestimated by the mixture model and the tail is going to be flat because the mixture model attempts to capture the exceedance probability of each data while the tail data is disordered it indicates that the extreme mooring tension of nylon with clumped weights will be overestimated by the mixture model similar to the results in fig 8 the three parameter weibull and gev models give reasonable prediction to the exceedance probability of the most important tension the greatest ones in the exceedance curves although the other tail data are not being estimated as good as the mixture model again the two parameter weibull underestimates the exceedance probability of tail snap tensions significantly which would induce considerable errors in extreme value analysis the predicted mpme mooring tension based on only the snap peak tensions are compared with the empirical one and the results are tabulated in table 7 it is observed that the mixture model presents precise estimations to the extreme mooring tensions of nylon and polyester ropes the differences between predictions and empirical ones are smaller than 3 however it fails to estimate the extreme tension of nylon with clumped weights due to the disturbance of the tail data the extreme mooring tensions estimated by three parameter weibull and gev distributions are reasonable the error is less than 13 for all discussed cases furthermore it is observed that the accuracy of estimated extreme tension is improved in most cases by removing the non snap events while the two parameter weibull gaussian and gamma underestimate the extreme mooring tension significantly and the greatest difference is found in the case of nylon mooring 4 2 discussion of the effect de cluster procedure on predicted extreme tension in survival wave condition it is found that the statistical properties of snap mooring tension are not unified the exceedance probabilities of tail data are not easy to be well predicted clusters could occur which makes the independent and identical distributed i i d assumption not be satisfied anymore and gives rise to the estimation bias the mixture model fails to present an accurate estimation of the nylon mooring with clumped weights the results of three parameter weibull and gev distributions are reasonable however they are not accurate enough as a consequence a de clustering procedure to select the iid data is needed in this study the de clustering procedure proposed by rødvei 2016 is applied to analyze extreme mooring tension in survival wave condition the cluster is defined as the tensions exceed threshold until n m consecutive points below the threshold are observed and the maximum values in each cluster are collected and acted as the sample after de clustering an illustrative schematic of de clustering when n m 3 is shown in fig 10 the selected samples are marked by triangle in this work the number of consecutive points below threshold n m is set as 3 and the threshold is determined as 16 u μ 0 5 γ where u is the threshold μ and γ are the mean and standard deviation of mooring tension time series in 3 h the parameters of different models are then fitted based on the de clustered data and the predicted exceedance probability curves are compared with the empirical ones the results are plotted in fig 11 it is seen that all the models present good estimations to the exceedance probabilities of peak tension after applying the de clustering procedure especially for the polyester mooring case among these models the mixture model is the preferred one which presents good estimations of exceedance probability to almost every data the predicted extreme mooring tensions and the number of observations n p in survival wave condition are then listed in table 8 where all the models present acceptable predictions after applying the de clustering procedure the two parameter weibull gaussian and gamma models underestimate the extreme mooring tension slightly however the other three model shows much better performance especially for the mixture model the difference of the extreme tension between empirical and predicted one is less than 1 for the polyester and nylon mooring with clumped weights however it is found that the sample size is reduced significantly once the de clustering procedure is applied the number of observations is 52 38 and 46 for cases of the nylon polyester and nylon with clumped weights respectively the small size sample would increase the uncertainties of fitted parameters as a consequence the uncertainties of estimated extreme mooring tension will be increased in the following study the influence of threshold and n m on sample size and extreme mooring tension analysis are discussed 4 2 1 influence of threshold to discuss the influence of threshold in extreme mooring tension analysis in survival wave condition three different thresholds are discussed i e u μ γ μ 1 4γ μ 2γ based on the peak tensions after the corresponding de clustering procedure the parameters of distribution models are fitted then the extreme mooring tensions are estimated the estimated extreme mooring tensions based on extracted peak tensions under these three thresholds are summarized in tables 9 11 it is seen that the influence of threshold on predicted extreme tension is clear the two parameter weibull gaussian and gamma distributions are not able to present accurate enough predictions to the extreme mooring tension of nylon moorings if a relatively high threshold is used it is found that the errors are greater than 10 on the contrary the gev fails to give an accurate estimation of the extreme tension of polyester mooring once u μ 1 4γ the mixture and weibull models are stable to the variation of threshold where it is found that extreme mooring tensions are well predicted in all discussed threshold cases furthermore it is concluded that the de clustering procedure with u μ γ is a good solution to extreme mooring tension analysis in this case most of the estimated extreme mooring tensions using this threshold are more accurate than those with high thresholds besides the sample sizes are large enough as a consequence the uncertainties of extreme mooring tensions due to an insufficient number of observations are avoided 4 2 2 influence of the number of peaks below the threshold the influence of the number of peaks below the threshold during the de clustering procedure on extreme mooring tension analysis in survival wave condition is discussed in this section three cases with n m 2 4 and 5 are studied and the threshold is setting as u μ γ the calculated extreme mooring tensions under these three de clustering strategies are tabulated in tables 12 14 the influence of n m on the performance of the extreme value analysis of different models can be identified in these tables for the case with n m 2 only the three parameter weibull gives accurate enough estimations to the extreme mooring tension the extreme tensions of nylon with clumped weights are overestimated by the mixture model the reason has been given above i e the highly correlated property of the bulk data and the disturbance of last several data make the tail of exceedance probability curve of the mixture model to be flat as seen in fig 8 however with the increase of n m the extreme tension analysis performance of different models can be improved and it is seen even the gaussian can give reasonable estimations to extreme mooring tensions of polyester and nylon with clumped weights however it should be noticed that the sample size reduces significantly with the increase of n m furthermore the influence of n m on the estimated extreme mooring tensions is limited once n m 4 as a consequence the n m 4 is preferable for the de clustering procedure used in the extreme mooring tension analysis in this study 5 short term distribution of rainflow cycle tension amplitude and mooring fatigue damage analysis the mooring fatigue damage is another important issue during mooring design that needs to be calculated accurately for the fatigue damage analysis of synthetic fibre mooring rope the t n approach is a general solution api 2014 dnvgl 2015 the t n curve is defined as 17 n k s m where k is the intercept parameter and m is the slope of the t n curve respectively which are determined according to the laboratory tests s is the ratio between mooring tension range to the minimum breaking load mbl based on the linear palmgren miner rule miner 1945 the accumulated structural fatigue damage is given as 18 d i 1 n c n i n i where n i is the number of cycle range s i during the loading process n i is the number of cycle ranges s i that leads to structural failure which is determined according to eq 17 and n c is the total number of all load cycles in this study the mooring tension cycles are extracted from the corresponding measured mooring tension time series by the rainflow counting cycling method matsuishi and endo 1968 the rainflow counting cycles method is implemented by using wafo brodtkorb et al 2000 once the mooring tension cycles are obtained the fatigue damage can be estimated directly from eq 18 in addition to the time domain method the fatigue damage can also be estimated by spectral methods by combining eqs 17 and 18 the expected damage rate can be calculated as 19 d 1 k e i 1 n c r i m n 0 k 0 2 r m f r r d r where n 0 is the mean number of tension cycles which is calculated as n 0 ν x p τ in a concerned time duration τ ν x p is the expected rate of occurrence of peaks r is the load amplitude if consider x t is considered as a narrow band process then the probability density function of tension amplitude can be depicted by the rayleigh distribution dnvgl 2015 by invoking eq 2 into eq 20 the structural expected damage rate can then be calculated in closed form 20 d n b v x p k 0 2 r m f r r d r v x p k 2 2 σ r m γ m 2 1 where r is the normalized tension amplitude ratio between tension amplitude to the mbl f r r is the tension amplitude probability density function which is described by the rayleigh distribution if the gamma function is adopted for analysing mooring expected fatigue damage the closed form expression of expected damage rate is 21 d g a v x p k 0 2 r m f r r d r v x p k 2 β g m γ m α g γ α g the structural expected damage rate estimated by the two parameter weibull model is calculated by substituting eq 3 into eq 20 and it is expressed as 22 d w b 2 v x p k 0 2 r m f r r d r v x p k 2 α m γ m β 1 the expected structural fatigue damage rate estimated by the three parameter weibull distribution is calculated by numerical integration by substituting eq 4 into eq 20 as for the mixture model the expected structural fatigue damage rate is expressed as 23 d m i x w 1 d n b w 2 d g a 1 w 1 w 2 d w b 2 where w i are the weights of each probability function component as seen in eq 10 in this study the rayleigh two parameter and three parameter weibull distributions gamma and mixture models are used to fit the probability densities of rainflow tension amplitudes in different wave conditions once the parameters of each model are determined the mooring fatigue damage can be estimated by applying the equations described above then the estimated mooring fatigue damages are compared with the time domain rainflow counting results 5 1 operational wave conditions the 1m suffers the greatest environmental loads under the head sea wave condition in this section only the fatigue damage of 1m is discussed the empirical and estimated probabilities of rainflow mooring tension amplitude in operational wave condition are compared in fig 12 where ray denotes the rayleigh distribution and its parameters are fitted by the maximum likelihood method in fig 12 it is found that the probability densities of mooring tension amplitude are very complicated generally two peaks can be observed it indicates that both the small tension amplitude and the tension amplitude close to 110 kn frequently occur in the operational wave condition this makes it difficult to accurately capture the probability densities of mooring tension amplitude by general distribution models it is observed that all the general distribution models fail to capture the global trend of mooring tension amplitude probability densities especially for the two parameter weibull and gamma distribution only the probability densities of mooring tension amplitude greater than 250 kn can be well fitted by these two models the probability densities of mooring tension amplitude greater than 150 kn are well estimated by the rayleigh distribution and the three parameter weibull distribution can capture the probability densities of mooring tension amplitude greater than 100 kn it indicates that the three parameter weibull model shows the best performance for estimating mooring fatigue damage among these general models however the mixture model shows excellent performance for fitting the probabilities of rainflow mooring tension amplitude it is seen that the probability density curves of the mixture model are in good agreement with the empirical ones for all discussed mooring cases the estimated fatigue damage in 3 h by different models in the operational wave condition is compared with the rainflow counting result and the results are summarized in table 15 where the rfc denotes the fatigue damage calculated by rainflow counting approach log d is the logarithm of the mooring fatigue damage to the base 10 as expected the mixture model is a powerful method in mooring fatigue damage analysis the relative error is less than 0 8 for all studied mooring cases the three parameter weibull model also presents good estimations to fatigue damage of all mooring cases despite overestimating the probability densities of the small tension amplitudes the reason is that the probability densities of most of the great tension amplitude are well represented by the three parameter weibull model since the great tension amplitudes contribute much greater damage than the small ones the rayleigh distribution also shows good performance in estimating mooring fatigue damage for the same reason however it is inferior to the three parameter weibull model as expected the estimated mooring fatigue damages by the two parameter weibull and gamma distributions are not as accurate as the results of other models the comparisons between estimated and empirical probability density curves of the rainflow mooring tension amplitudes in heave resonance wave condition are shown in fig 13 similarly to the results in operational wave condition the bimodal phenomenon is also found in the probability densities of mooring tension in heave resonance wave condition it is observed that only the mixture model can capture the probability densities of all observed tension amplitudes the estimated probability density curves match well with the empirical ones all the other models underestimate the probability densities of tension amplitude less than 10 kn more or less however the probability densities of tension amplitude greater than 110 kn are well captured by the three parameter weibull distribution as for the rayleigh model it is seen that it can present precise enough estimations to the probability densities of tension amplitude greater than 150 kn the differences between the probability density curves estimated by two parameter weibull gamma distributions and the corresponding empirical ones are clear for all observations the 3 h mooring fatigue damages of different mooring configurations in heave resonance wave condition are calculated by different methods and the results are summarized in table 16 it is seen that the mixture model is the preferred one for fitting the probability density of mooring tension amplitude for fatigue damage analysis the error is less than 0 2 for all studied mooring configurations on the contrary the gamma model is undesirable for mooring fatigue damage analysis the performance for fatigue damage analysis of three parameter weibull is comparable to the mixture model owning to its capability in capturing the probability densities of large tension amplitude in addition to the mixture and three parameter weibull models the rayleigh also gives good estimations to the mooring fatigue damage 5 2 survival wave conditions the rainflow counting method is applied to obtain the mooring load cycles and the models introduced above are applied to describe the statistical characteristics of rainflow tension amplitude fig 14 shows the probability densities of rainflow tension amplitude estimated by different models and the results are compared with the empirical ones it is observed that the mooring tension amplitude varies within a relatively large range due to the effects of snap loads furthermore two peaks can be identified in the probability density curves of mooring tension amplitude for all discussed mooring cases one is located in the range between 0 and 20 kn and the other one is near to 300 kn and the small peak is the one most frequently occur the generally used models fail to capture the overall probability densities of mooring tension amplitude and the greatest errors are found in the results of two parameter weibull and gamma distributions the three parameter weibull and rayleigh distributions can fit well the probability densities of amplitudes greater than 400 kn while the probability densities of amplitudes smaller than 100 kn are underestimated by these two models significantly consistently with the results of operational wave tests the mixture model shows excellent performance in fitting probability densities of rainflow cycle tension amplitude it is seen that the fitted probability density curves by mixture model are in good agreement with the empirical ones which indicates that the mixture model is also able to present accurate enough estimations to mooring fatigue damage in survival wave condition the estimated 3 h mooring fatigue damage in survival wave condition by different methods are compared in table 17 it is seen that the mixture model presents very good estimations to the mooring fatigue damage the error is smaller than 0 5 for all discussed cases besides the three parameter weibull distribution also shows good performance in mooring fatigue damage analysis it even presents a more accurate estimation of fatigue damage of nylon with weights than the mixture model the results of the rayleigh distribution are accurate enough however errors are slightly greater than that of the mixture and three parameter weibull models comparatively speaking the gamma and two parameter weibull distributions are not recommended for mooring fatigue damage analysis which given rise to the greatest errors among all discussed models especially for the polyester mooring cases the errors are greater than 12 6 conclusions in the heave resonance wave condition the snap events seldom occur it seems like all the discussed distributions are able to present reasonable estimations to the mpme mooring tension the mixture model gives the most accurate extreme tension estimations to the polyester and nylon with clumped weights moorings however it is also sensitive to the disturbance of tail data the three parameter weibull and gev models also show good performance for estimating extreme mooring tension in heave resonance wave condition snap events are frequently seen in the survival wave condition for all discussed mooring configurations the snap and non snap events follow different statistical properties considerable errors of the estimated mooring tension can be found in the results of two parameter weibull gamma and gaussian models the mixture model tries to fit well exceedance probabilities of each data and it is easily influenced by the disordered tail data the exceedance probability curves become flat in some cases which makes it overestimate extreme tensions in survival wave condition the three parameter weibull and gev distributions present reasonable estimations of the extreme mooring tensions the errors are smaller than 10 for all mooring cases in survival wave condition the extreme mooring tensions are significantly underestimated by the two parameter weibull gamma and gaussian distributions discarding the non snap events cannot significantly improve the accuracy of estimated extreme mooring tension while applying the de clustering procedure to the original data is a recommended method to analyze extreme mooring tension under the influence of snap loads the accuracy of estimated extreme mooring tensions are improved significantly for all models the u μ γ n m 4 are recommended for the de clustering setting overall the three parameter weibull and gev are recommended for extreme mooring tension analysis without de clustering when the number of snap events dominates the non snap loads the mixture model proposed in this study is the preferred one for predicting extreme tension if the de clustering procedure is applied the probability densities of the rainflow tension amplitude are the bimodal curves all the discussed models fail to capture this propriety except for the mixture model the mixture model can fit the probability densities of each mooring tension amplitude appropriately the thee parameter weibull and rayleigh show good performance in fitting the probability densities of large mooring tension amplitude the mixture and three parameter weibull models are the most recommended ones for mooring fatigue damage analysis furthermore it is seen that the nylon suffers much great fatigue damage than the polyester rope and the influence of clumped weights on fatigue damage of nylon rope is limited credit authorship contribution statement sheng xu

20557,three hybrid moorings are proposed for the station keeping of wave energy converters the hybrid mooring leg consists of top synthetic fibre rope nylon or polyester intermediate buoy and bottom chain with or without clumped weights attached the dynamic responses of the point absorber wave energy converter mooring system are experimentally studied in three irregular sea states a mixture rayleigh gamma weibull distribution is proposed for extreme mooring tension and mooring fatigue damage analysis and the parameters of this mixture model are estimated by the expectation maximization

values keywords extreme mooring tension mooring fatigue damage synthetic fibre rope hydrodynamic model tests mixture rayleigh gamma weibull distribution snap loads 1 introduction the mooring system plays the role to keep the floating structure on station although for motion dependent wave energy converters wecs the mooring system can also affect the energy harvesting performance the mooring system design is a great challenge in shallow water both the catenary and taut mooring systems show some disadvantages in the application for shallow water the catenary effect is weakened since the length of the suspended segment is limited in shallow water xu et al 2019b in other words the lay down segment would be lifted quickly and the catenary mooring for shallow water floating structure is extremely long to prevent the lay down segment from being fully lifted as for the taut mooring it is too stiff for most wecs that take advantage of motion response to harvest wave energy besides expensive suction anchor is needed for the taut mooring in addition to the issues described above the snap load is another troublesome problem in the shallow water mooring design according to recent research the snap loads can occur in the catenary and slack mooring when the floating structure operates under survival wave condition in shallow water hsu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 2020b in general the snap loads need to be taken great care during the mooring design in shallow water as they can give rise to tremendous extreme mooring tension as well as mooring fatigue damage hsu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 2020b 2018 xu and guedes soares 2020 snap load is an important issue in the mooring design process as is characterized by a discontinuity in tension magnitude along mooring ropes dhanak and nikolaos 2016 it was concluded that the snap loads are generated in mooring ropes due to three main mechanisms palm et al 2017 namely the nonlinear stress deformation behaviour of the material tjavaras 1996 seabed contact mainly found in the catenary mooring gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 mooring configurations suddenly transition from slack to taut the third one is the most commonly seen the snap loads would give rise to tremendous spike tensions that could be greater than the breaking strength of mooring lines and cause mooring failure the mooring failure accidents were found in the wire ropes of the navion saga floating storage and ofﬂoading vessel kvitrud 2014 and the mooring ropes of floating oil production installations kvitrud 2014 ma et al 2019 the snap loads have been observed in various shallow water ocean activities such as the floating tunnel lu et al 2011 floating wind turbine hsu et al 2017 masciola et al 2013 wave energy converters hann et al 2015 harnois 2014 savin et al 2012 xu et al 2018 2020b the snap loads in mooring cables have been studied by experimental and numerical approaches a series of model tests were conducted in a towing tank to study the dynamics of a horizontally suspended submerged cable and the influences of excitation frequency and amplitude on snap loads were investigated vassalos et al 2004 vassalos and kourouklis 1998 non breaking focussed wave groups and a plunging breaking wave were generated in a wave basin to study the influence of wave steepness and wave breaking location on system dynamics of a point absorber moored single taut mooring hann et al 2015 it was found that the influence of breaking location on snap load amplitude is much greater than that of wave steepness a series of irregular wave model tests were conducted to study the dynamics of a point absorber moored by different mooring systems xu et al 2018 2020b it was found that the influence of wave height on snap loads is significant both the number and amplitude of snap loads were increased considerably in survival wave condition furthermore both the number and amplitude of snap loads of hybrid mooring systems were much smaller than that found in slack mooring a lumped mass method was developed to study mooring snap loads under different excitation conditions the time domain governing equations were solved by the modified euler method and the numerical results are compared with the experimental data huang and vassalos 1993 the numerical results were validated to be accurate enough and the snap events were observed under severe oscillation conditions i e high frequency and large amplitude oscillations a hp adaptive discontinuous galerkin method was applied to study the snap loads in mooring cables palm et al 2017 the shock wave propagated in mooring cables for the materials with linear and nonlinear mechanical properties were well captured by applying this method the accuracy of this method was validated by comparing the simulated dynamics of catenary mooring cables with the measured ones the finite element method was applied to study the snap loads of a deepwater taut mooring rope qiao et al 2020 the ultimate limit state uls design is one of the crucial steps of the mooring design process and the extreme mooring tension needs to be estimated accurately to ensure floating system safety an extensive review of extreme mooring tension analysis has been given by xu et al 2019b experimental tests were performed to study the dynamics of an fpso system moored by external turret mooring systems in deepwater and shallow water izadparast and duggal 2013 based on the measured data the rayleigh exponential three parameter weibull and three parameter rayleigh distributions were applied to fit the probability distributions of the peaks of fpso surge motion and mooring tension the extreme surge responses and mooring tensions were estimated based on these fitted probability distributions it was concluded that the three parameter rayleigh and three parameter weibull were flexible enough to fit the probability distribution of linear and nonlinear responses and extreme values were well fitted the peak distribution method was applied to study extreme mooring tension of fpso system under 100yr and 10 000yr conditions three different definitions of peak tensions were proposed and the influence of peak definitions on estimated extreme tension was discussed stanisic et al 2018 the weibull distribution was applied to fit the probability distributions of peak tensions and extreme mooring tension analysis and the accuracy of this method was verified by comparing the estimated extreme tensions with that predicted by the global maximum method the extrapolation methods including the acer method naess and gaidai 2009 optimal peak over threshold method by applying generalized pareto distribution gpd generalized extreme value distribution and three parameter weibull distribution to fit the statistical distributions of peaks were applied to study 3 h extreme mooring tension of a deepwater semisubmersible xu et al 2019a by comparing the results of extrapolation methods with the extreme mooring tension predicted by global maximum method it was concluded that the extrapolation methods were accurate enough the 20 min data were enough for obtaining 3 h extreme mooring tensions by applying the extrapolation methods snap loads have a significant influence on extreme mooring tension analysis since the snap loads follow different statistical properties from that of non snap loads hsu et al 2017 it was pointed out that the traditional weibull distribution introduced great error in estimating extreme mooring once the snap loads occur hsu et al 2017 because of this a composite weibull probability distribution was adopted to study the extreme dynamic mooring tension with the effects of snap events considered hsu et al 2014 2017 however this method is not easy to be implemented since the probability continuity at the transition point needs to be assured thus three parameter weibull and optimum pot methods were applied to study short term extreme dynamic mooring tension based on the tail data of measured mooring tension time series xu et al 2020b it was found that these two methods present good estimations to the extreme dynamic mooring tensions under the influence of snap events it is not easy to fit the parameters well for the distributions of tail data since the sample size is small besides the information of the bulk data is neglected a mixture gamma gpd distribution was proposed to study the extreme dynamic tensions of catenary and slack moorings for a point absorber under the effects of snap events xu and guedes soares 2021 the gamma distribution was applied to fit the bulk data and the gpd was used to fit the probabilistic distribution of tail data the parameters of the mixture gamma gpd distribution were fitted based on the bayesian inference method with the markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling procedure it was verified that this method shows good performance in estimating extreme dynamic mooring tension due to snap loads the fatigue limit state fls design is another considered design case for permanent mooring design the linear palmgren miner rule miner 1945 is widely used in estimating structural accumulated fatigue damage based on the linear palmgren miner rule the rainflow counting algorithm matsuishi and endo 1968 in conjunction with s n or t n curve is the main approach to study mooring fatigue damage huang et al 2011 xu et al 2020a yang et al 2016 2017 currently the time domain method is widely used to study mooring fatigue damage the fatigue damage is directly estimated from the measured or simulated mooring tension time series however the fully coupled dynamic analysis method is time consuming the quite efficient spectral methods provide a good solution to estimate mooring fatigue damage in preliminary design ocean waves are usually considered gaussian and the linear dynamic responses of offshore structures can be assumed as a narrow band gaussian process gao and moan 2008 as a consequence the stress load amplitude of structural dynamic responses can be described by the rayleigh distribution however the mooring tension is nonlinear due to the nonlinear hydrodynamic loads and geometric configuration furthermore the mooring tension is a wide band process gao and moan 2007 a probability density function was proposed to fit the peaks and troughs of non gaussian random processes ochi 1998 some wideband methods have been developed and show good performance in estimating structural fatigue damage dirlik 1985 proposed an empirical expression to predict structural fatigue damage under wideband load the probability density function of structural load amplitude is described by and hybrid exponential and two rayleigh distributions in another study a mixture model which combines two parameter weibull and a rayleigh distribution was used to describe the probability density function of rainflow load cycle amplitude zhao and baker 1992 based on the discrete markov chain approximation an approximation of probability densities of rainflow cycles was given by rychlik 1989 due to the low frequency and wave frequency loads generally the mooring tension is a bimodal process based on the gaussian assumption jiao and moan 1990 did pioneering work about the fatigue damage of the bimodal process by noticing there are two effects in the current bimodal methods which would underestimate fatigue damage a more sophisticated damage prediction approach was given to the bimodal process low 2010 the methods described above are under the gaussian assumption however the mooring tensions do not satisfy gaussian if the nonlinearities are high some spectral methods that focus on the non gaussian random processes have been developed åberg et al 2009 benasciutti and tovo 2005 ding and chen 2015 it is summarized that the snap loads induce tremendous spike tension which could endanger mooring rope safety as a consequence the extreme mooring tensions due to the snap events need to be estimated accurately it is difficult to present accurate estimations to the extreme mooring tension under the influence of snap events because the snap and non snap events follow different probability distributions the study of extreme mooring tension analysis due to snap loads is rare the current methods such as composite weibull and pot show some disadvantages in addition to the extreme tension it has been verified that the snap loads given rise to significant mooring fatigue damage xu and guedes soares 2020 however to the authors best knowledge there is still no study available to investigate the mooring fatigue damage under influence of snap loads by spectral methods it is noticed that one of the important steps of applying the spectral method to study fatigue damage is to accurately estimate the probability densities of load amplitude the model should be flexible enough since both the snap and non snap loads contribute to the mooring fatigue damage unfortunately these two components satisfy different statistical proprieties as a consequence the probability model for mooring fatigue damage analysis under the influence of snap loads needs to be flexible enough in this study a mixture rayleigh gamma weibull distribution is proposed to study the extreme mooring tension and mooring fatigue damage of three hybrid mooring configurations based on measured data the parameters of this model are fitted by the expectation maximization em algorithm the performance of this mixture model is compared with the results of other generally used models 2 probability distributions used in structural dynamics in this section the gaussian rayleigh weibull gamma and generalized extreme value distributions are introduced the gaussian weibull gamma and generalized extreme value models are applied to fit the exceedance probability of peak mooring tension the extreme mooring tension can be estimated once the parameters of these distributions are known besides the rayleigh weibull gamma distributions are applied to fit the probability density function of rainflow counting tension amplitude and the expected damage rate can be estimated according to the linear palmgren miner rule miner 1945 in addition to these conventional distribution models a mixture rayleigh gamma weibull model is developed to study the extreme mooring tension and mooring fatigue damage 2 1 commonly used probability distributions the gaussian distribution is widely used in modelling continuous wave elevations and linear structural dynamic responses the probability density function of a gaussian variable is given as 1 f x μ n σ n 1 σ n 2 π exp 0 5 x μ n σ n 2 where μ n and σ n are the mean value and standard deviation of variable x if the structural dynamic response is a narrow band gaussian process then the dynamic response amplitudes satisfy the rayleigh distribution under the gaussian assumption the rayleigh distribution is important in structural fatigue damage analysis and the probability density function of rayleigh is defined as 2 f r a y x σ r x σ r 2 exp x 2 2 σ r 2 x 0 σ r 0 where x is the amplitude of dynamic response and σ r is the scale parameter the weibull distribution is commonly used to describe statistics of load amplitudes of nonlinear responses and they have been extensively used in extreme mooring tension analysis the probability density function of the three parameter weibull distribution is defined as 3 f w b l x α β β α x μ w a β 1 exp x μ w α β α β 0 where α β and μ w are scale shape and location parameters respectively the two parameter weibull distribution is a special form of three parameter weibull distribution with the location parameter equal to zero the gamma distribution is very flexible and it is widely applied in meteorology and engineering recently it has been proved that the gamma distribution can successfully fit the dynamic response distribution of floating wind turbine dong et al 2011 according to the research of li et al 2016 the modified gamma distribution shows good performance in fitting the long term distribution of mooring tension amplitude the probability density function of gamma distribution is given as 4 f g a m x 1 β g α g γ α g x α g 1 exp x β g α g β g 0 where α g and β g is the shaper and scale parameters the gev is widely used in extreme value analysis its probability density function is defined as 5 f g e v x 1 σ exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ 1 ξ x μ σ 1 1 ξ ξ 0 1 σ exp exp x μ σ x μ σ ξ 0 where the parameters μ σ and ξ are the location scale and shape factor respectively 2 2 mixture rayleigh gamma weibull distribution it is noticed that structural fatigue damage can be well estimated by the rayleigh distribution if the loading process is narrow band furthermore the rayleigh distribution is usually acted as one of the components of mixture distribution for structural fatigue damage analysis of wide band loading process dirlik 1985 zhao and baker 1992 the weibull model has been widely used to study the statistical distribution of mooring tension and the gamma distribution is known for its high flexibility by noticing these features a mixture rayleigh gamma two parameter weibull distribution is given to combine the properties of these three model for extreme mooring tension and mooring fatigue damage analysis the probability density function of the mixture rayleigh gamma two parameter weibull distribution is then written as 6 f m i x x w 1 f r a y x σ r w 2 f g a m x α g β g 1 w 1 w 2 f w b l x α β as described above a total of seven parameters need to be estimated for this proposed mixture probabilistic model in this paper the em algorithm is applied to fit these unknown parameters the em algorithm is a powerful algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation for data containing missing data dempster et al 1977 an important feature of the em algorithm is that it is not merely a numerical technique but it also offers useful statistical insight em is a numerical technique that finds the posterior mode lee 2004 mclachlan and peel 2000 considering a set of observations x 1 x 2 x n and z 1 z 2 z 3 are the missing observations the z values are defined as 7 z k i z k x i 1 x i belong to k t h component 0 the missing observations z i z 1i z 2i z 3i are estimated through the conditional expectation e z ki x i 8 z

al 2015 10 σ r i 1 n z 1 i x i 2 2 i 1 n z 1 i the maximum likelihood estimators of parameters of gamma distribution are expressed by erişoğlu et al 2011 11 α g r 1 α g r ln a g r ψ a g r ln i 1 n z 2

bottom is studied in this work fig 1 shows the schematic and the 1 40 model of wec the height of the conical bottom is 7 5 cm the total height of the wec model is 50 cm the main parameters of wec are listed in table 1 where φ is the diameter δ is the free draft of wec without mooring lines being installed rxx ryy rzz are the gyration radius about x y and z axis respectively the height of the gravity centre is 16 3 cm where the baseline is located on the bottom of the model 3 2 hybrid mooring systems and power take off system it is troublesome to scale down the synthetic fibre mooring ropes for hydrodynamic model tests since the nonlinear axial stiffness and change in length properties of synthetic fibre ropes make them almost impossible to fully test their mechanical properties on a model scale wang et al 2019 2021 it is not a practical way to simply scale down the rope diameter which would give rise to overestimation of the axial stiffness of prototype rope however it needs to be noticed that the main purpose of this study is to obtain an insight into the dynamics of the nylon mooring ropes by hydrodynamic tests otherwise to predict the dynamic tensions of the prototype mooring system as a consequence the mooring systems used in this study are designed according to the dimension of the wec model if the main interest is the dynamic tensions of prototype mooring rope the axial stiffness must be scaled down accurately and the strategy by incorporating the o ring segment into the mooring model could simulate the nonlinear axial stiffness of nylon rope to some extent sheng et al 2010 as seen in fig 2 the mooring system consists of three mooring legs and the azimuth angle between each two mooring legs is 120 only the head sea condition is considered in this study and the 1m is the most loaded mooring the hybrid mooring is a two segment design which consists of top synthetic fibre rope and bottom chain besides a submerged buoy is installed on the connection point between these two segments the schematic diagrams of the hybrid mooring systems are given in fig 3 to investigate the influence of synthetic fibre rope material on floating system dynamics two kinds of materials were tested namely polyester and nylon hereafter the mooring system adopts polyester rope is named hyb while the one that uses nylon rope is called hnb furthermore another mooring concept hnbw is designed by installing two cylindrical clumped weights on the end of hnb mooring the mass of the buoy is 0 436 kg and its buoyancy is 10n the length of synthetic fibre rope and chain is 1 23m and 1 7m respectively the masses of clumped weights increase from top to the end and their masses in the air are 0 511 kg 1 229 kg respectively the distance between these two clumped weights is 10 cm and the distance between cm2 and anchor point is 10 cm the main parameters of the mooring rope are given in table 2 where w is per unit length mass in air r denotes mooring radius l e is the effective length of mooring rope both the nylon and polyester are braided 16 strand ropes and the nominal diameter is 3 mm pretensions of each mooring leg are listed in table 3 the original goal is to set the same pretension for each different mooring lines to exclude the differences of system dynamics caused by mooring pretension however it was difficult to implement due to the viscoelastic and viscoplastic properties and water absorbing phenomenon of synthetic ropes during the model tests the length of each mooring rope was adjusted slightly to ensure their pretensions as close as possible it is difficult to scale down the power take off pto system in the hydrodynamic model tests moura paredes et al 2016 in this study a linear spring and a square steel plate are used to simulate the stiffness and damping of the pto system as seen in fig 3 the heave plate is installed on the bottom of wec by a connection bar the length of the connection bar is 50 cm and the width and thickness of the steel plate is 10 cm and 1 mm respectively on the floor of the wave tank a load sensor is installed to measure the tension time series of the pto system a linear spring with stiffness equal to 29 22 n m is applied to connect the wire rope and the load sensor the length of the wire rope is 28 6 mm its nominal diameter and mass per unit length in air is 3 5 mm and 0 108 kg respectively 3 3 irregular wave test cases in this study three irregular wave tests including one operational op one heave resonance hr and one survival sv sea states were selected to study the dynamic mooring tensions in different sea states the random waves were simulated by the jonswap spectrum the main parameters are summarized in table 4 where t p is the peak period h s is the significant wave height γ is the peak enhancement factor the 1 40 model tests were performed in the towing tank of etsin universidad politécnica de madrid the length of the tank is 96m and the width and water depth is equal to 3 8m and 2 107m respectively it was pointed out that the sidewall has some influence on the second order hydrodynamic force of the freely ﬂoating body in the wave flume huang et al 2021 however in their study the maximum ratio of the flume width to the diameter of the floating body is 6 while in this study the ratio of the flume width to the diameter of the floating body is 15 2 in other words whether the sidewall of the wave tank could affect the hydrodynamics of the wec still needs to be discussed it is out of the scope of this study and will not be discussed here since our main concern is the extreme mooring tension and mooring fatigue damage the duration of each irregular wave mode test is 30 min which is longer than 3 h in full scale the natural heave periods of different systems are obtained by decay tests they are identical and equal to 7 39s xu et al 2021 three load sensors were installed on the top of mooring ropes to measure mooring tension time series and the sampling frequency is 50hz the measured data are converted to the full scale according to the froude similitude rule 4 short term extreme mooring tension the short term cumulative distribution function for independent and identically distributed iid variables is defined as f x and the distribution of extreme value f e x is then expressed as ochi 1981 razola et al 2016 13 f x n e f e x where f x is the cumulative distribution function of mooring tension peak n e is the number of tension peaks in the concerned time duration 3 h the most probable maximum extreme mpme has a 63 2 chance to be exceeded and it will be adopted as the characteristic extreme value in this study the extreme mooring tension is then calculated as 14 f x e 1 0 632 1 n e by considering that mooring line would give rise to significant peak tension when the floating structure operates in resonance and survival wave conditions then the main goal is to find suitable f x to fit the distribution of peak tensions and the extreme mooring tension can be calculated according to eq 14 in this study the extreme mooring tension analysis is conducted for these two test cases 4 1 most probable maximum extreme mooring tension analysis without de clustering following the study of hsu et al 2017 the snap loads are defined as 15 t s j t max j t max j t 0 t min j t l t l 0 1 t 0 where t s is the peak tension due to snap loads t max is maximum tension between two mean up crossings t min is the minimum tension between two mean up crossings t 0 is the pretension j is the label of identified peak tension the measured mooring tension time series of these studied mooring configurations in heave resonance are plotted in fig 4 and only 150s data within the maximum tension during 3 h are plotted to show results clearly it is seen that the snap event seldom occurs in the heave resonance wave condition the measured maximum mooring tension of nylon rope is similar to that of polyester rope and slightly greater than the maximum tension of nylon with clumped weights installed the reason is that the pretension of nylon rope with weights is slightly smaller than that of nylon mooring furthermore the attached clumped weights play the role to prevent the mooring rope from suddenly stretching to a certain extent which helps to reduce maximum tension correspondingly xu et al 2020b xu and guedes soares 2020 the gaussian two parameter and three parameter weibull gamma gev and mixture model proposed in this study is applied to fit the exceedance probability of extracted mooring peak tensions in heave resonance wave condition the parameters of two parameter weibull gamma and gaussian distributions are fitted by the maximum likelihood method and the parameters of three parameter weibull and gev models are fitted by the l moments method bílková 2014 goda et al 2010 xu et al 2019a some predicted results are compared with the empirical ones and the results are given in fig 5 where weib 2 and weib 3 denote the two parameter and three parameter weibull distributions respectively it is seen that the tail data follow a different statistical distribution to that of the bulk data which would induce difficulties in extreme mooring tension analysis the mixture model shows very good performance in estimating the statistical characteristics of mooring tensions it is found that all the empirical data follow the predicted exceedance probability curves of the mixture model for all mooring cases the three parameter weibull and gev distributions also have reasonable predictions of the exceedance probability of mooring tension it indicates that these three models can produce accurate estimations of short term mooring tensions in the heave resonance case as for the two parameter weibull model it is observed that the tail data is significantly different from the exceedance probability curve of the predicted one the exceedance probability of tail data is underestimated by the two parameter weibull which indicates that the extreme mooring tension will be underestimated according to eq 15 the 3 h extreme mooring tensions can be calculated the estimated 3 h extreme mooring tensions by different models are compared with the empirical one and the results are shown in table 5 it is seen that the mixture model shows excellent performance in extreme mooring tension analysis in heave resonance wave condition the difference between measured and predicted results are smaller than 0 5 for polyester and nylon with clumped weights cases besides the gev model also presents good estimations of extreme mooring tensions of these three mooring cases the mixture model overestimates the extreme tension of the nylon rope slightly the reason can be found in fig 5 a the mixture model tries to capture the exceedance probability of each peak tension while the interval between the second largest and third largest mooring tension is large which makes the tail of the exceedance curve to be flat however the mixture model is still able to present reasonable estimation the difference between the predicted and empirical extreme tension of nylon is 4 all the other models especially the three parameter weibull and gev distribution can present reasonable estimations to extreme mooring tensions for these mooring configurations this is understood that the nonlinearities of mooring tension in small wave heights are small as a consequence even the gaussian can present good estimations to extreme mooring tensions however the result of the two parameter weibull model for the nylon mooring is not satisfactory the error is around 11 the 150s mooring tension time series include the maximum peak tension in survival wave condition are plotted in fig 6 where the tremendous spike tensions are observed in all tested mooring configurations due to snap loads the number of snap events is considerable which frequently occur in the mooring time series the exceedance probabilities of the extracted mooring peak tensions in survival wave tests are shown in fig 7 furthermore the exceedance probability curves of snap and non snap tensions are also plotted it is seen that the statistic properties of snap and non snap tensions are divergent and the mooring tension is dominated by the snap loads it implies that the extreme mooring tension in survival wave condition is not easy to be predicted accurately furthermore the discontinuity is found in the tail peak tension a great gap between tail data is observed in each case i e tension which is greater than 1800 kn for nylon and polyester moorings greater than 1600 kn for the nylon mooring with clumped weights in other words these data make it difficult to accurately predict extreme mooring tension the distribution models described above are used to fit the exceedance probability of tension peaks in survival wave conditions and part of the results are shown in fig 8 it is observed that the mixture model shows the best performance in fitting exceedance probability for most of the data it tries to fit the exceedance probability of each data accurately and makes the tail of its exceedance probability curve to be flat which overestimates the exceedance probability of maximum mooring tension especially for the nylon mooring cases it indicates that the extreme tensions of nylon moorings would be overestimated by the mixture model on the contrary the two parameter weibull underestimates the exceedance probability of tail data significantly which implies that it fails to present accurate estimations of extreme mooring tensions as for the three parameter weibull and gev distributions the differences in the exceedance probabilities between empirical data and predicted values are acceptable it implies that these two models can give reasonable estimations to the extreme mooring tensions in survival wave condition the predicted extreme mooring tensions in the survival wave condition are compared with the empirical ones and the results are concluded in table 6 as expected the mixture model overestimates the extreme mooring tensions significantly except for the polyester case this is because for nylon mooring tensions the tails of exceedance probability curves are flat in other words the exceedance probability reduces extremely slowly in the tail part unfortunately the exceedance probability of mpme mooring tension is very small as a consequence the extreme mooring tensions of nylon moorings are overestimated significantly by the mixture model although the probabilities of most of the tail data are well predicted by the mixture model except for the last one however a small difference of exceedance probabilities in the tail data will give rise to great discrepancies in predicting high percentile for the model with a flat tail as for the three parameter weibull and gev distributions they can produce acceptable predictions of the extreme mooring tensions with the difference between empirical and measured ones being smaller than 10 the other models fail to give accurate estimations to the extreme mooring tensions due to the complicated statistical characteristic of peak tensions in survival wave conditions it is seen that there is a large quantity of snap and non snap events in the survival wave conditions which makes it difficult to estimate the extreme tensions discarding the non snap loads maybe a good solution for studying the extreme mooring since the number of snap events is the most important component in extreme tension analysis and the number of snap load is large enough for fitting the parameters of distribution models the estimated exceedance probabilities by different models are compared with the empirical ones and the results are shown in fig 9 it is seen that even considering only the snap tensions the statistical characteristics of the tail and bulk data are divergent overall the mixture model is the most preferable option for capturing the statistical properties of snap tensions almost all the data follow the exceedance probability curves of the mixture model including the tail data however the exceedance probability of the last data in fig 9 c is overestimated by the mixture model and the tail is going to be flat because the mixture model attempts to capture the exceedance probability of each data while the tail data is disordered it indicates that the extreme mooring tension of nylon with clumped weights will be overestimated by the mixture model similar to the results in fig 8 the three parameter weibull and gev models give reasonable prediction to the exceedance probability of the most important tension the greatest ones in the exceedance curves although the other tail data are not being estimated as good as the mixture model again the two parameter weibull underestimates the exceedance probability of tail snap tensions significantly which would induce considerable errors in extreme value analysis the predicted mpme mooring tension based on only the snap peak tensions are compared with the empirical one and the results are tabulated in table 7 it is observed that the mixture model presents precise estimations to the extreme mooring tensions of nylon and polyester ropes the differences between predictions and empirical ones are smaller than 3 however it fails to estimate the extreme tension of nylon with clumped weights due to the disturbance of the tail data the extreme mooring tensions estimated by three parameter weibull and gev distributions are reasonable the error is less than 13 for all discussed cases furthermore it is observed that the accuracy of estimated extreme tension is improved in most cases by removing the non snap events while the two parameter weibull gaussian and gamma underestimate the extreme mooring tension significantly and the greatest difference is found in the case of nylon mooring 4 2 discussion of the effect de cluster procedure on predicted extreme tension in survival wave condition it is found that the statistical properties of snap mooring tension are not unified the exceedance probabilities of tail data are not easy to be well predicted clusters could occur which makes the independent and identical distributed i i d assumption not be satisfied anymore and gives rise to the estimation bias the mixture model fails to present an accurate estimation of the nylon mooring with clumped weights the results of three parameter weibull and gev distributions are reasonable however they are not accurate enough as a consequence a de clustering procedure to select the iid data is needed in this study the de clustering procedure proposed by rødvei 2016 is applied to analyze extreme mooring tension in survival wave condition the cluster is defined as the tensions exceed threshold until n m consecutive points below the threshold are observed and the maximum values in each cluster are collected and acted as the sample after de clustering an illustrative schematic of de clustering when n m 3 is shown in fig 10 the selected samples are marked by triangle in this work the number of consecutive points below threshold n m is set as 3 and the threshold is determined as 16 u μ 0 5 γ where u is the threshold μ and γ are the mean and standard deviation of mooring tension time series in 3 h the parameters of different models are then fitted based on the de clustered data and the predicted exceedance probability curves are compared with the empirical ones the results are plotted in fig 11 it is seen that all the models present good estimations to the exceedance probabilities of peak tension after applying the de clustering procedure especially for the polyester mooring case among these models the mixture model is the preferred one which presents good estimations of exceedance probability to almost every data the predicted extreme mooring tensions and the number of observations n p in survival wave condition are then listed in table 8 where all the models present acceptable predictions after applying the de clustering procedure the two parameter weibull gaussian and gamma models underestimate the extreme mooring tension slightly however the other three model shows much better performance especially for the mixture model the difference of the extreme tension between empirical and predicted one is less than 1 for the polyester and nylon mooring with clumped weights however it is found that the sample size is reduced significantly once the de clustering procedure is applied the number of observations is 52 38 and 46 for cases of the nylon polyester and nylon with clumped weights respectively the small size sample would increase the uncertainties of fitted parameters as a consequence the uncertainties of estimated extreme mooring tension will be increased in the following study the influence of threshold and n m on sample size and extreme mooring tension analysis are discussed 4 2 1 influence of threshold to discuss the influence of threshold in extreme mooring tension analysis in survival wave condition three different thresholds are discussed i e u μ γ μ 1 4γ μ 2γ based on the peak tensions after the corresponding de clustering procedure the parameters of distribution models are fitted then the extreme mooring tensions are estimated the estimated extreme mooring tensions based on extracted peak tensions under these three thresholds are summarized in tables 9 11 it is seen that the influence of threshold on predicted extreme tension is clear the two parameter weibull gaussian and gamma distributions are not able to present accurate enough predictions to the extreme mooring tension of nylon moorings if a relatively high threshold is used it is found that the errors are greater than 10 on the contrary the gev fails to give an accurate estimation of the extreme tension of polyester mooring once u μ 1 4γ the mixture and weibull models are stable to the variation of threshold where it is found that extreme mooring tensions are well predicted in all discussed threshold cases furthermore it is concluded that the de clustering procedure with u μ γ is a good solution to extreme mooring tension analysis in this case most of the estimated extreme mooring tensions using this threshold are more accurate than those with high thresholds besides the sample sizes are large enough as a consequence the uncertainties of extreme mooring tensions due to an insufficient number of observations are avoided 4 2 2 influence of the number of peaks below the threshold the influence of the number of peaks below the threshold during the de clustering procedure on extreme mooring tension analysis in survival wave condition is discussed in this section three cases with n m 2 4 and 5 are studied and the threshold is setting as u μ γ the calculated extreme mooring tensions under these three de clustering strategies are tabulated in tables 12 14 the influence of n m on the performance of the extreme value analysis of different models can be identified in these tables for the case with n m 2 only the three parameter weibull gives accurate enough estimations to the extreme mooring tension the extreme tensions of nylon with clumped weights are overestimated by the mixture model the reason has been given above i e the highly correlated property of the bulk data and the disturbance of last several data make the tail of exceedance probability curve of the mixture model to be flat as seen in fig 8 however with the increase of n m the extreme tension analysis performance of different models can be improved and it is seen even the gaussian can give reasonable estimations to extreme mooring tensions of polyester and nylon with clumped weights however it should be noticed that the sample size reduces significantly with the increase of n m furthermore the influence of n m on the estimated extreme mooring tensions is limited once n m 4 as a consequence the n m 4 is preferable for the de clustering procedure used in the extreme mooring tension analysis in this study 5 short term distribution of rainflow cycle tension amplitude and mooring fatigue damage analysis the mooring fatigue damage is another important issue during mooring design that needs to be calculated accurately for the fatigue damage analysis of synthetic fibre mooring rope the t n approach is a general solution api 2014 dnvgl 2015 the t n curve is defined as 17 n k s m where k is the intercept parameter and m is the slope of the t n curve respectively which are determined according to the laboratory tests s is the ratio between mooring tension range to the minimum breaking load mbl based on the linear palmgren miner rule miner 1945 the accumulated structural fatigue damage is given as 18 d i 1 n c n i n i where n i is the number of cycle range s i during the loading process n i is the number of cycle ranges s i that leads to structural failure which is determined according to eq 17 and n c is the total number of all load cycles in this study the mooring tension cycles are extracted from the corresponding measured mooring tension time series by the rainflow counting cycling method matsuishi and endo 1968 the rainflow counting cycles method is implemented by using wafo brodtkorb et al 2000 once the mooring tension cycles are obtained the fatigue damage can be estimated directly from eq 18 in addition to the time domain method the fatigue damage can also be estimated by spectral methods by combining eqs 17 and 18 the expected damage rate can be calculated as 19 d 1 k e i 1 n c r i m n 0 k 0 2 r m f r r d r where n 0 is the mean number of tension cycles which is calculated as n 0 ν x p τ in a concerned time duration τ ν x p is the expected rate of occurrence of peaks r is the load amplitude if consider x t is considered as a narrow band process then the probability density function of tension amplitude can be depicted by the rayleigh distribution dnvgl 2015 by invoking eq 2 into eq 20 the structural expected damage rate can then be calculated in closed form 20 d n b v x p k 0 2 r m f r r d r v x p k 2 2 σ r m γ m 2 1 where r is the normalized tension amplitude ratio between tension amplitude to the mbl f r r is the tension amplitude probability density function which is described by the rayleigh distribution if the gamma function is adopted for analysing mooring expected fatigue damage the closed form expression of expected damage rate is 21 d g a v x p k 0 2 r m f r r d r v x p k 2 β g m γ m α g γ α g the structural expected damage rate estimated by the two parameter weibull model is calculated by substituting eq 3 into eq 20 and it is expressed as 22 d w b 2 v x p k 0 2 r m f r r d r v x p k 2 α m γ m β 1 the expected structural fatigue damage rate estimated by the three parameter weibull distribution is calculated by numerical integration by substituting eq 4 into eq 20 as for the mixture model the expected structural fatigue damage rate is expressed as 23 d m i x w 1 d n b w 2 d g a 1 w 1 w 2 d w b 2 where w i are the weights of each probability function component as seen in eq 10 in this study the rayleigh two parameter and three parameter weibull distributions gamma and mixture models are used to fit the probability densities of rainflow tension amplitudes in different wave conditions once the parameters of each model are determined the mooring fatigue damage can be estimated by applying the equations described above then the estimated mooring fatigue damages are compared with the time domain rainflow counting results 5 1 operational wave conditions the 1m suffers the greatest environmental loads under the head sea wave condition in this section only the fatigue damage of 1m is discussed the empirical and estimated probabilities of rainflow mooring tension amplitude in operational wave condition are compared in fig 12 where ray denotes the rayleigh distribution and its parameters are fitted by the maximum likelihood method in fig 12 it is found that the probability densities of mooring tension amplitude are very complicated generally two peaks can be observed it indicates that both the small tension amplitude and the tension amplitude close to 110 kn frequently occur in the operational wave condition this makes it difficult to accurately capture the probability densities of mooring tension amplitude by general distribution models it is observed that all the general distribution models fail to capture the global trend of mooring tension amplitude probability densities especially for the two parameter weibull and gamma distribution only the probability densities of mooring tension amplitude greater than 250 kn can be well fitted by these two models the probability densities of mooring tension amplitude greater than 150 kn are well estimated by the rayleigh distribution and the three parameter weibull distribution can capture the probability densities of mooring tension amplitude greater than 100 kn it indicates that the three parameter weibull model shows the best performance for estimating mooring fatigue damage among these general models however the mixture model shows excellent performance for fitting the probabilities of rainflow mooring tension amplitude it is seen that the probability density curves of the mixture model are in good agreement with the empirical ones for all discussed mooring cases the estimated fatigue damage in 3 h by different models in the operational wave condition is compared with the rainflow counting result and the results are summarized in table 15 where the rfc denotes the fatigue damage calculated by rainflow counting approach log d is the logarithm of the mooring fatigue damage to the base 10 as expected the mixture model is a powerful method in mooring fatigue damage analysis the relative error is less than 0 8 for all studied mooring cases the three parameter weibull model also presents good estimations to fatigue damage of all mooring cases despite overestimating the probability densities of the small tension amplitudes the reason is that the probability densities of most of the great tension amplitude are well represented by the three parameter weibull model since the great tension amplitudes contribute much greater damage than the small ones the rayleigh distribution also shows good performance in estimating mooring fatigue damage for the same reason however it is inferior to the three parameter weibull model as expected the estimated mooring fatigue damages by the two parameter weibull and gamma distributions are not as accurate as the results of other models the comparisons between estimated and empirical probability density curves of the rainflow mooring tension amplitudes in heave resonance wave condition are shown in fig 13 similarly to the results in operational wave condition the bimodal phenomenon is also found in the probability densities of mooring tension in heave resonance wave condition it is observed that only the mixture model can capture the probability densities of all observed tension amplitudes the estimated probability density curves match well with the empirical ones all the other models underestimate the probability densities of tension amplitude less than 10 kn more or less however the probability densities of tension amplitude greater than 110 kn are well captured by the three parameter weibull distribution as for the rayleigh model it is seen that it can present precise enough estimations to the probability densities of tension amplitude greater than 150 kn the differences between the probability density curves estimated by two parameter weibull gamma distributions and the corresponding empirical ones are clear for all observations the 3 h mooring fatigue damages of different mooring configurations in heave resonance wave condition are calculated by different methods and the results are summarized in table 16 it is seen that the mixture model is the preferred one for fitting the probability density of mooring tension amplitude for fatigue damage analysis the error is less than 0 2 for all studied mooring configurations on the contrary the gamma model is undesirable for mooring fatigue damage analysis the performance for fatigue damage analysis of three parameter weibull is comparable to the mixture model owning to its capability in capturing the probability densities of large tension amplitude in addition to the mixture and three parameter weibull models the rayleigh also gives good estimations to the mooring fatigue damage 5 2 survival wave conditions the rainflow counting method is applied to obtain the mooring load cycles and the models introduced above are applied to describe the statistical characteristics of rainflow tension amplitude fig 14 shows the probability densities of rainflow tension amplitude estimated by different models and the results are compared with the empirical ones it is observed that the mooring tension amplitude varies within a relatively large range due to the effects of snap loads furthermore two peaks can be identified in the probability density curves of mooring tension amplitude for all discussed mooring cases one is located in the range between 0 and 20 kn and the other one is near to 300 kn and the small peak is the one most frequently occur the generally used models fail to capture the overall probability densities of mooring tension amplitude and the greatest errors are found in the results of two parameter weibull and gamma distributions the three parameter weibull and rayleigh distributions can fit well the probability densities of amplitudes greater than 400 kn while the probability densities of amplitudes smaller than 100 kn are underestimated by these two models significantly consistently with the results of operational wave tests the mixture model shows excellent performance in fitting probability densities of rainflow cycle tension amplitude it is seen that the fitted probability density curves by mixture model are in good agreement with the empirical ones which indicates that the mixture model is also able to present accurate enough estimations to mooring fatigue damage in survival wave condition the estimated 3 h mooring fatigue damage in survival wave condition by different methods are compared in table 17 it is seen that the mixture model presents very good estimations to the mooring fatigue damage the error is smaller than 0 5 for all discussed cases besides the three parameter weibull distribution also shows good performance in mooring fatigue damage analysis it even presents a more accurate estimation of fatigue damage of nylon with weights than the mixture model the results of the rayleigh distribution are accurate enough however errors are slightly greater than that of the mixture and three parameter weibull models comparatively speaking the gamma and two parameter weibull distributions are not recommended for mooring fatigue damage analysis which given rise to the greatest errors among all discussed models especially for the polyester mooring cases the errors are greater than 12 6 conclusions in the heave resonance wave condition the snap events seldom occur it seems like all the discussed distributions are able to present reasonable estimations to the mpme mooring tension the mixture model gives the most accurate extreme tension estimations to the polyester and nylon with clumped weights moorings however it is also sensitive to the disturbance of tail data the three parameter weibull and gev models also show good performance for estimating extreme mooring tension in heave resonance wave condition snap events are frequently seen in the survival wave condition for all discussed mooring configurations the snap and non snap events follow different statistical properties considerable errors of the estimated mooring tension can be found in the results of two parameter weibull gamma and gaussian models the mixture model tries to fit well exceedance probabilities of each data and it is easily influenced by the disordered tail data the exceedance probability curves become flat in some cases which makes it overestimate extreme tensions in survival wave condition the three parameter weibull and gev distributions present reasonable estimations of the extreme mooring tensions the errors are smaller than 10 for all mooring cases in survival wave condition the extreme mooring tensions are significantly underestimated by the two parameter weibull gamma and gaussian distributions discarding the non snap events cannot significantly improve the accuracy of estimated extreme mooring tension while applying the de clustering procedure to the original data is a recommended method to analyze extreme mooring tension under the influence of snap loads the accuracy of estimated extreme mooring tensions are improved significantly for all models the u μ γ n m 4 are recommended for the de clustering setting overall the three parameter weibull and gev are recommended for extreme mooring tension analysis without de clustering when the number of snap events dominates the non snap loads the mixture model proposed in this study is the preferred one for predicting extreme tension if the de clustering procedure is applied the probability densities of the rainflow tension amplitude are the bimodal curves all the discussed models fail to capture this propriety except for the mixture model the mixture model can fit the probability densities of each mooring tension amplitude appropriately the thee parameter weibull and rayleigh show good performance in fitting the probability densities of large mooring tension amplitude the mixture and three parameter weibull models are the most recommended ones for mooring fatigue damage analysis furthermore it is seen that the nylon suffers much great fatigue damage than the polyester rope and the influence of clumped weights on fatigue damage of nylon rope is limited credit authorship contribution statement sheng xu

20558,with the increasing interest for zero emission vehicles electric boats represent a growing area weight is a limiting factor for battery powered boats therefore the use of fuel cell battery systems is investigated the present study examines the power requirements the energy storage solutions and the sustainability assessment of a light and fast rescue boat operating in the swedish lake barken a weight optimized hybrid fuel cell battery system is presented the results show that if the hydrogen storage is wisely selected the weight of the hybrid system is significantly less than that of a battery system and can compete with an internal combustion engine system the sustainability assessment highlights and compares the impact in terms of cost and emissions of the different energy storage solutions the quantification of the emissions for the different energy systems under several scenarios shows a clear advantage for the electric solutions keywords fuel cell optimization carbon dioxide emissions cost 1 introduction in sweden boat traffic contributes to 9 increase of no2 and so2 in the atmosphere compared to background levels viana et al 2014 high speed boats such as rescue boats are usually energy intensive and require a large amount of power to reach high speeds e g 30 knots nowadays the majority of boats are powered by diesel internal combustion engines ice ice combined with diesel fuel is a very compact and light system however the use of fossil fuels has a negative impact on the environment due to pollution and faces issues of diminishing reserves with the increasing need for zero emission vehicles and the reduction of fossil fuel reserves electrical systems have become a suitable solution to reach environmental goals alfonsin et al 2015 the most common electrical storage technology consists of secondary batteries but the use of fuel cells is increasingly being investigated when comparing specific power and energy of different energy storage technologies the ragone plot fig 1 is very useful the ragone plot shows that fuel cells have high specific energy wh kg winter and brodd 2004 although it varies with the type of storage used for hydrogen needed in the fuel cell however fuel cells have a relatively low specific power w kg and show better performance when working at steady state batteries have a higher specific power and lower specific energy than fuel cells meaning that they can meet high power demands but cannot ensure long endurance the diesel ice system has high weight efficiency but should due to its negative environmental impacts be avoided pure rechargeable battery powered electric boats hereafter battery systems are in many aspects attractive but taking into account the high energy consumption the energy system becomes too large and it cannot compete with an equivalent ice in terms of onboard payload or endurance a hybrid fuel cell battery system hereafter hybrid system aggregates the specific energy of fuel cells with the specific power of batteries therefore such systems can satisfy the power demand of the vehicle store enough energy to run long driving cycles and carry a certain payload this approach is very interesting and has been demonstrated e g yazici 2011 hopwood 2012 cellkraft 2010 gmbh 2009 d amore domenech et al 2018 and power 2003 hydrogen is seen as a promising solution to decarbonize the transport sector renkel and lümmen 2018 garmsiri et al 2013 and park 2011 a number of fuel cell powered boat projects are ongoing showing promising results van biert et al 2016 the sf breeze project is a fuel cell powered aluminum catamaran sailing in the bay of san francisco klebanoff et al 2017a klebanoff et al 2017b its maximum capacity is 150 passengers it can store up to 1200 kg liquid hydrogen lh2 which corresponds to 4 h of operation and the fuel cell is a 4920kw proton exchange membrane fuel cell pemfc one more example is the energy observer project energy observer 2019 and cea liten 2016 a zero emission demonstration boat equipped with solar panels on the roof and wind turbines the renewable electrical energy is used to simultaneously power the boat charge the battery pack and power an electrolyzer which produces hydrogen the water needed for the electrolysis process comes from the sea and is desalinated before usage in the absence of wind and sun the battery pack powers the boat if the battery level of charge becomes critically low the stored hydrogen is released into the 22 kw pemfc which charges the battery the fuel cell is hence used as a range extender other projects such as the alsterwasser bassam et al 2017 han et al 2014 with a 2 x 48 kw pemfc and 360 ah lead acid gel battery pack or the 20 meter tourist boat project choi et al 2016 show that the use of fuel cells for boats is possible a study on the feasibility of the zero v a fuel cell powered research vessel was also conducted madsen et al 2020 the boat has a cruise speed of 10 knots and is equipped with a 1800kw fuel cell stack it was shown that with hydrogen coming from renewable sources the yearly emissions of the boat are dramatically lower than the emissions due to an equivalent system with a diesel engine the above cited examples correspond to large ships with a high power demand the use of fuel cells for small and fast duty boats e g rescue boats has not yet been deeply investigated in the literature and the industry the environmental impact and economic feasibility of such projects may vary from one country to another and needs to be estimated hörmandinger and lucas 1996 frey et al 2007 çabukoglu et al 2019 several factors e g the electricity generation and the specific utilization of the boat influence the final impact of the project the swedish government has set several targets in order to fulfill sweden s commitments under the paris agreement by 2040 the emissions of greenhouse gases should be 75 lower than emissions in 1990 government offices of sweden 2020 and moving toward low emission vehicles is a priority the swedish sea rescue society sjöräddningssällskapet the major association that performs sea rescue operations in swedish waters is evaluating the possibility of making their rescue boat fleet entirely carbon emission free hence more sustainable the present study is aiming at investigating the feasibility of a hybrid system for a light and fast rescue boat as well as to perform its sustainability assessment the considered boat should be used for regular lake inspections the designed system must compete in terms of weight with the ice system a comparative analysis is carried out considering the following competitive technologies diesel ice battery system and hybrid system the location chosen for the case study is the smedjebacken municipality and more especially the lake barken situated in the region dalarna in sweden the lake is narrow and 24 km long and the rescue station is located in the northern end this study case is presented in fig 2 where the map of the lake a picture of the actual boat a simple drawing of the boat and its main specifications can be found this study is divided into three parts the first part contains the description of the rescue boat and its specifications it describes the drive train of a hybrid system boat and gives a typical power profile of a mission performed by the rescue boat the second part is an estimation of the size of the energy system for the rescue boat using the created power profile a sizing tool previously presented by the authors chiche et al 2021 and updated for the rescue boat application in this study finds the optimum combination of the fuel cell and the battery pack in terms of weight in addition several ways to store hydrogen are compared and the hybrid system is also compared to a battery system and a conventional diesel ice system hereafter ice system the optimized hybrid system is also tested on two power profiles corresponding to critical rescue missions on the lake finally the third part quantifies the emissions and cost of such a rescue boat using the results from the previous parts a sustainability assessment considering the equivalent co2 hereafter co2eq emissions and the cost of the considered boat for different scenarios is carried out 2 boat description 2 1 boat specifications and drive train the boat of the study is 5 4 m long and 2 0 m wide and is usually carrying 2 persons this study concerns an updated version of the existing boat with some additional requirements from the swedish sea rescue society according to them the considered rescue boat has to fulfill the following requirements i be capable to reach a speed of 30 knots ii have a storage system that meets the energy and power demands of different rescue missions iii be equipped with a water jet motor since the boat needs to travel in shallow waters and debris could damage an outboard motor iv be small and agile in the case of a hybrid system drive train the system can be relatively complex fig 3 shows the configuration of the hybrid system for the battery system case the hydrogen the fuel cell and its inverter are not included the definitions used are listed in table 1 united states naval academy 2019 the product of efficiencies of the gear η g the motor η m the dc dcs converters and the inverter is 85 markowitz 2013 this value will be used in this study 2 2 power consumption the power consumption of the rescue boat is first estimated several ices from small and fast boats for private use fulfilling comparable requirements were previously compared by the authors andruetto 2019 the available data found correspond to boats slightly larger and with higher power demand than the rescue boat of this study case however a new fuel cell powered rescue boat with water jet will most likely be slightly larger than the boat they have today making the size of the power system in this study more relevant the relation between speed and internal combustion engine power was retrieved for small high speed boats powered by a water jet motor and an average curve used for this study was calculated fig 4a similarly the relation between the boat speed and the consumption of diesel l h by the internal combustion engine is assumed to be as in fig 4b andruetto 2019 neither power nor fuel consumption increases linearly but has different slopes in four different intervals of speed below 5 knots the increase is not significant between 5 and 10 knots the increase is steep at around 10 knots the boat starts planing causing a stabilization of resistance such curves are crucial when determining the set speeds at which the boat runs from fig 4a it is shown that an ice power of around 115 kw is required in order to reach 30 knots in addition the ice power needed to go at the low speed of 4 knots is close to 13kw 2 3 typical mission and motor sizing using the results from the previous subsection the power profile for the typical mission is created the mission is a tour of the lake barken during which the boat runs at high and low speeds at intervals of 10 min each the goal of the mission is duty coast guarding the boat runs at low speed to check a certain area and then moves at higher speed to another area it takes 80 min to do the entire round tour of the lake at maximum speed the boat alternates 8 cycles of 10 min at maximum speed and 10 min at low speed to go around the lake the length of the mission is 160 min andruetto 2019 using the average speed and the consumption curves fig 4 an internal combustion engine power profile simulating the described mission is created as shown in fig 5 the motor is selected based on the power profile and especially the maximum power needed p m a x which is close to 114 kw since the created power profile corresponds to the ice system it needs to be divided by the 85 efficiency mentioned earlier in order to size the electric motor the weight of the motor m m o t o r is then estimated using its specific power sp in w kg as shown in eq 1 the ice and the electric motor are assumed to have a specific power of 460w kg and 7000w kg with a motor density of 0 8kg l and 1kg l respectively andruetto 2019 1 m m o t o r p m a x s p 0 85 using eq 1 the total weight of the ice is equal to 296 kg whereas it is only 19 kg for the electric motor in addition the volume of the ice is 332 l and the volume of the electric motor is 19 l 3 design of the electric energy system and comparison with ice 3 1 general concept of fuel cell battery hybridization fuel cells and batteries are electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy into electricity the main difference between battery and fuel cell is that a battery is a closed system meaning that the energy storage is included in the electrode materials whereas a fuel cell is an open system in other words as long as the fuel cell is fed by reactants it can produce electricity in this case the energy storage and energy conversion do not occur at the same place there are two types of batteries primary batteries which are not rechargeable and secondary batteries which are rechargeable several types of secondary batteries with different chemistries are available on the market the lead acid the nickel cadmium or the nickel metal hydride batteries can however not compete with the lithium ion battery in terms of energy density and specific energy opitz et al 2017 in addition the lithium ion battery is considered as the best alternative for automotive applications and will therefore be the only battery considered in this study batteries are flexible in terms of power output reddy 2011 when a battery is being charged and discharged it is said it is cycling a secondary lithium ion battery can cycle around 5000 times before it reaches end of life scrosati et al 2013 the battery state of charge soc is the ratio between the energy left in the battery and its energy content when fully charged when the battery has lost around 20 of its initial ability to store energy it is considered to have reached end of life a charging rate crate of 1c means that it takes one hour to fully charge the battery 0 5c or c 2 that it takes two hours and 2c that it takes 30 min a high charging rate can have a negative impact on the lithium ion battery aging process mussa et al 2017 the proton exchange membrane fuel cell pemfc is currently the most developed fuel cell type the fuel cell industry benefits from the growing interest for zero emission power sources fuel cells are used for stationary and mobile applications they show better durability while running at steady state and can be degraded if they are wrongly used a pemfc consumes oxygen and hydrogen to produce electricity water and heat as shown in the following equation 2 o 2 2h 2 2 h 2 o h e a t e l e c t r i c i t y hybrid systems combine the flexibility of batteries in terms of power and the high energy density of hydrogen this characteristic makes such systems an increasingly common topic for both stationary and automotive applications and the market is growing efoy 2019 hybrid system cars and trucks already exist and show competitive performance symbio 2019 napoli et al 2017 casolari et al 2014 and feroldi et al 2009 nevertheless there is a major difference between an electric car and an electric boat when braking the car is not powered anymore and the kinetic energy from the movement can be used to charge the battery whereas this is not possible with a boat since it returns very little energy to the battery pack when designing a hybrid system for a boat there are two different alternatives the fuel cell is only used to charge the battery when that reaches a certain soc and maintains it at the desired soc the fuel cell is in this case called a range extender napoli et al 2017 casolari et al 2014 salman et al 2017 both the fuel cell and the battery are used to power the drive train the fuel cell delivers the base power while the battery is used and discharged during peak power demands and is recharged by the fuel cell at times of low power demand this usually means that the size of the battery pack is reduced it also means that the flexibility of the boat in terms of speed highly depends on the battery the undertaken sizing procedure will determine which configuration is selected 3 2 energy system optimization and design a sizing tool for hybrid pemfc battery systems originally developed by the authors for underwater vehicles and volume optimization chiche et al 2021 is adapted for a boat in this paper all the details about the optimization and sizing procedure are found in the cited study for this study case the storage of oxygen is not considered indeed the oxygen is taken from the ambient air in addition the optimization is made for weight instead of volume meaning that the targeted combination of fuel cell output power and battery size is now the lightest instead of the most compact moreover the estimation of the compensation needed to reach neutral buoyancy was removed the optimization principle is to implement a power profile in the tool and for each fuel cell nominal power in the power range the weights of the battery pack the fuel cell stack and amount of hydrogen needed are calculated furthermore the weight and volume of several systems are compared hybrid systems with different hydrogen storage battery system and ice system the assumptions for the hybrid system and the battery system are the same as used in the sizing and optimization study chiche et al 2021 i e 60 efficiency for the fuel cell η f c and 90 for the battery η b a t t the diesel fuel is assumed to have a specific energy of 11 6kwh kg and the ice an efficiency of 30 nektalova 2008 the created power profile based on the boat specifications was implemented in the described tool chiche et al 2021 the optimization was performed to estimate the total weight of a hybrid system with a pemfc stack varying from 50 kw to 110 kw see fig 6 results are that a nominal power of 75 kw for the fuel cell combined with a 11 5 kwh li ion battery is the optimum hybrid system in terms of weight giving a crate of 5 20 however with this hybrid system the flexibility of the boat in terms of power comes largely from the battery in other words the capacity of reaching high speeds depends on the battery pack thus in order to be able to stay at high speeds for a relatively long time the battery pack should be oversized in addition a crate higher than 1 can reduce the battery lifetime mussa et al 2017 aris and shabani 2017 saxena et al 2019 as a result the final battery pack designed after the optimization has to be the minimum battery pack battmin multiplied by the crate in order to reduce the degradation and ensure enough power flexibility to the boat table 2 shows the specifications of the final energy system the results from the optimization show that the lightest solution corresponds to a fuel cell power close to the average power demand combined with a relatively small battery pack used to reach peak power demands in other words the optimization shows that both the fuel cell and the battery are used to power the drive train the power profile was tested using the optimum configuration of fuel cell output power and the final size battery pack fig 7 shows the electric power profile and the evolution of the soc during the mission the initial soc is 0 6 and it varies between 0 6 and 0 75 meaning that the boat still has some flexibility in terms of power i e in terms of speed the ratio between fuel cell output power and the maximum power demand is 0 56 implying that the power is equally distributed between the fuel cell and the battery pack during peak power demands moreover the weight and volume of the hybrid system were estimated varying the hydrogen storage and compared to a battery system an ice system and a full primary battery system as shown in fig 8 the ice system remains the lightest one but with 700 bar compressed or liquid hydrogen the hybrid system can have a total weight comparable to the ice system additionally the hybrid system is lighter than the battery system for all the hydrogen storage alternatives hybridization is hence a suitable alternative in order to electrify vehicles without losing payload capacity the battery system is more than three times heavier than the ice system volume is also a key parameter when designing the energy system for a vehicle the ice system is very compact but the hybrid system can compete especially with the liquid hydrogen storage once again the volume of the battery system is higher than the volume of the ice system i e more than two times larger furthermore the competitive performance of the primary battery in terms of weight and volume is relative since the battery cannot be recharged and therefore needs to be changed after every mission and also have safety issues with high power such as overheating reddy 2011 thus primary batteries are considered as a reference more than a practical solution 3 3 energy system under critical missions other power profiles corresponding to critical missions such as rescue missions at very high speed must be handled by the rescue boat a checking procedure was made in order to verify if a given energy system amount of hydrogen stored fuel cell output power and battery pack can fulfill such missions it is assumed that when the battery soc is equal to 95 the battery cannot be charged anymore i e the fuel cell only powers the boat the amount of hydrogen left in the boat during the mission m h 2 t is estimated using the fuel cell power over time the hydrogen lower heating value l h v h 2 and the fuel cell system efficiency η f c as shown in eq 3 in addition the battery soc is estimated at any time of the mission using eq 4 where p o w e r t is the power demand 3 m h 2 t m h 2 0 0 t p f c t d t l h v h 2 η f c 4 s o c t s o c 0 0 t p o w e r t p f c t d t b a t t f i n a l two power profiles were created corresponding to two critical missions fig 9 mission 1 concerns a missing person fig 9a the rescue boat has to rush to the end of the lake which takes approximately 40 min at maximum speed using the motor at maximum power once arrived it looks for the person during the searching time here assumed to be 80 min the boat does not proceed at full speed but on the contrary at low speed after finding the person the boat goes back to the station at high speed hence again using full power for 40 min mission 2 applies to towing a boat fig 9b the boat to tow is located at the furthest point from the rescue station for the first 40 min the rescue boat proceeds at maximum speed once arrived at the accident it needs to get close to the boat in danger ensure that the passengers are safe and tow the boat to the shore for around 20 min the boat runs at low speed before actually towing the boat it takes around 20 min to tow the boat back to the shore the power used is the maximum power for another 20 min the rescue boat runs at low speed to ensure the boat is not in danger anymore but eventually the boat has to go back to the station running at cruise speed this last part takes around one hour results in fig 9 show that for both missions the optimized hybrid system can fulfill the mission as seen in figs 9a and 9c representing mission 1 when the power demand is below the nominal fuel cell power and the battery soc is 95 the battery is maintained at this soc and the fuel cell only delivers the power demand which leads to a lower hydrogen consumption this lower hydrogen consumption explains why there is around 1 8 kg of hydrogen left at the end of mission 1 mission 2 described in figs 9b and 9d starts with two high power and two low power peaks during these peaks the battery is discharged to 10 and charged to 45 twice after that the power demand is just above the fuel cell output power meaning that the battery is being more slowly discharged until the end of the mission the final battery soc is around 35 and since it never reaches 95 during the mission the fuel cell power is always its nominal one resulting in the constant hydrogen consumption seen in fig 9d 4 sustainability assessment sustainability is the capacity to exist continuously and at long term all aspects of a project and its impacts have to be taken into account when talking about sustainability assessment waas et al 2010 usually sustainable development refers to three major fields environmental economic and societal in this case the societal impact of the project is highly connected to the environmental field since the main goal is to reduce the emissions of the rescue boat therefore the co2eq emissions of the boat and cost under several scenarios are investigated 4 1 co2 footprint analysis the co2eq emissions of the boat when propelled by the ice system the battery system and the optimized hybrid system are investigated and compared two parts in the total co2eq emissions can be distinguished the fixed emissions efixed occurring only once in the life cycle due to the production of the product and the usage emissions eusage due to the utilization of the system calculated per unit of usage e g emissions per km matthews et al 2015 values for the co2eq emissions from each part of the system are presented in table 3 in this case study the influence of the production and decommissioning of the main components e g the motor either ice or electric motor the battery pack the inverter and the fuel cell has been taken into account the impact on the emissions of production and decommissioning can vary depending on different factors including technological development and site of production miller and keoleian 2015 that are also driving forces considered for future emission reductions to also account for the future evolution two scenarios are studied the current scenario corresponds to the co2eq emissions of each component of the energy system based on today s values the optimistic scenario is based on a future where technological development improves the production and decommissioning processes i e engineering and managerial improvements hence reducing the emissions corresponds to the co2eq emissions of each component of the energy system based on an optimistic future where technological development improves the production and decommissioning processes moreover from scale economies fixed emissions are likely to decrease gillingham and stock 2018 usage emissions differ for each case for the ice system case 1 the usage emissions are the well to propulsion emissions of diesel fuel case 2 refers to the battery systems in which the usage emissions are the emissions due to the charging of the battery from the swedish electric grid for the hybrid system in case 3 both the emissions due to the charging of the battery from the swedish electric grid and the emissions deriving from the production of hydrogen needed for fueling the fuel cell are regarded as usage emissions due to the very diverse technologies for the production of hydrogen two scenarios are considered here first the current scenario using the average value of emissions in the global production of hydrogen today second the optimistic scenario in which water electrolysis is assumed to be the only hydrogen production method the emissions of the boat co2eq are calculated using eq 5 the mission used is the typical one presented in fig 7 also used to run the optimization since in the hybrid system case and for the considered mission the battery soc at the beginning is the same as at the end the battery is not being recharged between two missions therefore the battery is being charged from the grid only for the first mission making that charging part of the fixed emissions 5 co 2 e q e f i x e d e u s a g e m i s s i o n s first of all results in fig 10 show that for both electric solutions hybrid system and battery system and for both the current and optimistic uses the fixed emissions represent an important part of the total co2eq emissions while the fixed emissions of the ice system are less significant for the battery system the usage emissions are very low and will hardly contribute to the total emissions not even after 250 missions secondly using current co2eq values the emissions from the optimized hybrid system become smaller than the emissions due to the ice system after 127 missions a similar shifting point appears after 166 missions when comparing emissions from the battery system and the ice system at last after 190 missions the battery system generates less emissions than the hybrid system once this last point is reached the hybrid system emits more tons of co2eq than the battery system and after 250 missions the hybrid system has emitted 6 more tons of co2eq corresponding to a 16 increase finally when considering the future optimistic values for emissions of co2eq the previously observed shifting points appear after fewer missions it takes only 16 missions for the hybrid system to generate less emissions than the ice system and 31 for the battery system the shifting point between the emissions from the hybrid system and the battery system happens after 151 missions furthermore in this case the two electric solutions emit at least 78 less co2eq than the ice system after 250 missions 4 2 cost forecasts for the evaluation of the different systems economy is an important aspect therefore the cost for the optimized hybrid system the ice system and battery system is estimated the cost is divided in two parts capex capital expenditure the investment cost for the material the capex represents a fixed cost paid only once at the beginning opex operational expenditure the exploitation cost of the system the opex represents the utilization cost of the system in this study the opex is multiplied by the number of missions run the cost of each part of the system was collected based on data regarding the current market e g statista 2019a kochhan et al 2017 and insideevs 2016 and targeted goals hydrogen europe 2020 and are presented in table 4 since the hydrogen and battery sectors are growing the cost of hydrogen fuel cell systems and battery packs has to be carefully investigated in europe the production cost of hydrogen produced from renewable sources varies between 5 and 11 kgh2 fuel cell and hydrogen joint undertaking fchju 2016 while the production cost in sweden is 5 3 kgh2 according to hydrogen europe hydrogen europe 2020 this value will be used for cost analysis but it is important to note that the total distribution cost is likely to be higher the cost of fuel cell systems has decreased in the last few years indeed it dropped from 500 kw to 100 kw between 2012 and 2017 for duty vehicles european energy research alliance 2020 it is supposed to be 60 kw in 2020 and the targeted goal is 40 kw by 2030 also the cost of battery packs is expected to decrease batteries europe stated that the for duty vehicles the cost of a battery pack will decrease from 200 kwh in 2020 to 85 kwh in 2030 batteries europe 2020 the capex is estimated once and the opex is estimated for the need of each mission the mission used here is once again the typical mission on which the optimization was based the cost is calculated using eq 6 similar to the co2eq analysis the charge of the battery only happens once for the hybrid system meaning that it becomes part of the capex 6 c o s t c a p e x o p e x m i s s i o n s results in fig 11 show that the capex investment for both electric systems hybrid system or battery system is more expensive than the one for the ice system since the opex is significantly lower for the electric systems after 1050 missions for the hybrid system and 2120 missions for the battery system it becomes cheaper to have an electric system rather than the ice system after 2500 missions the total cost for the optimized hybrid system is 21 lower than for the ice system and 17 lower than for the battery system it is interesting to highlight the fact that since this is a rescue boat there are no taxes on diesel for it in sweden for a privately owned boat considering taxes on diesel the shifting points for the cost between the ice system and the electric ones will appear after fewer missions in addition using 2030 targeted cost for the production of battery packs and the fuel cell stacks the same trend is observed it takes 825 missions for the hybrid system and 1170 missions for the battery system to become cheaper than the ice system after 2500 missions the hybrid system is 26 cheaper than the ice system 5 discussion the studied rescue boat needs to fulfill several demanding criteria and easily becomes energy intensive therefore the energy system has to be as compact as possible weight optimization of the hybrid system is a key step in order to design an electric system capable of both fulfilling the missions and compete in terms of weight with the ice system moreover the way hydrogen is stored is a crucial question since it changes the total weight and volume it seems that 700 bar compressed hydrogen or liquid hydrogen represents storage solutions enabling hybrid systems to compete in terms of weight and volume with the ice system the battery system is not suitable for such an application since its weight and volume are too high meaning that the onboard payload of the boat cannot be ensured with such a system the boat utilization number of missions per year needs to be discussed when analyzing the results of the sustainability assessment the main goal of the swedish sea rescue society is to reduce the global boat emissions which happens with the two electric solutions after relatively few missions if one mission per day is considered the emissions are reduced after roughly 6 months these two electric solutions do not become economically viable until after several years around 3 years for the hybrid system and 6 years for the battery system this highlights the need of financial support for projects like this one further regulations are likely to have an impact on the cost analysis and may lead to an earlier cost shifting point between the ice system and the hybrid system however it is clear that both electric systems i e hybrid system and battery system reduce dramatically the co2eq emissions over time thus are beneficial for the environment furthermore the low total cost of the ice system is mainly due to the fact that the considered mission is short i e less than 3 h as a result the opex for the ice system for this mission is not significantly higher than the opex for the two electric missions therefore if longer missions were considered the cost for the ice system would increase significantly whereas this increase would be less important for the opex of the electric solutions in other words longer missions might lead to shifting points in cost between the ice system and the electric ones after fewer missions in addition the high capex of the two electric solutions is likely to decrease if they mature in a near future and become mass produced on a level similar to ice system thus electric solutions for other boat applications e g long range ferry boats seem to be promising in the future when comparing the two electric systems the co2eq emissions and cost follow different trends on the one hand the hybrid system remains cheaper over time and on the other hand it emits more co2eq than the battery system after a certain number of missions figs 10 and 11 once again the boat utilization needs to be considered to interpret the described trends since this case study considers a rescue boat it is realistic to assume a small number of missions per year and the optimized hybrid system is a suitable solution nevertheless the presented sustainability assessment uses several values from the swedish electricity grid and market hence the results and trends mostly apply to sweden in another country where the electricity grid is more or less carbonized the total co2eq emissions might be different this highlights the importance of defining the context when performing a sustainability assessment besides the type of hydrogen storage is not considered in the sustainability assessment there will be some differences in cost and emissions between the different types of storage moreover the values used for the sustainability assessment are based on current data but also on target goals the latter highly depends on future policy in sweden and worldwide consequently they can change with policy and the trends can be different still it is realistic to assume that in the future more legislation and deployments of hybrid systems will decrease both the co2eq impact and the cost of each component of the system the final results are likely to change but the trend showing the relevance of such hybrid systems remains very strong safety represents one of the major challenges for the future deployment of hydrogen technologies the determination of the safety integrity level of a maritime fuel cell system showed that the highest risks are fire and explosion due to overflows of hydrogen or a control failure in the fuel cell system ahn et al 2019 risks assessment on fuel cell powered vehicles under different conditions is an ongoing research subject khalil 2015 ehrhart et al 2019 one major conclusion is that there is a serious need for workers in the transport sector to be trained for emerging risks in hydrogen and battery technologies especially for maintenance lópez arquillos et al 2015 last but not least some logistic aspects must be considered in the future indeed hydrogen supply is a crucial question since it is not fully developed yet questions about its logistics and its routing have to be answered on a practical level there is not yet any facilities for production of liquid hydrogen in scandinavia however with the multiplication of fuel cell projects worldwide and in sweden the hydrogen sector is likely to grow in a near future and overcome the cited issues 6 conclusion a rescue boat capable of performing both routine and emergency missions on lake barken in sweden was designed in this study electric solutions i e battery system and hybrid fuel cell battery systems were compared to an ice system by using an optimization and sizing tool a hybrid system with a 75 kw pem fuel cell stack combined with a 60 kwh lithium ion rechargeable battery pack and 10 kg of hydrogen was found to be the lightest electric system capable of fulfilling the intended missions the environmental impact of the rescue boat i e the co2eq emissions and the total cost were also estimated for several energy systems and scenarios the sustainability assessment shows that after many missions performed the hybrid system is more environmentally friendly and cheaper than an ice system the optimization and sizing tool ensures a hybrid system as light as possible and capable of fulfilling the given missions a battery system appears to be too heavy and therefore not suitable for such an application the total weight of the hybrid system highly depends on the way the hydrogen is stored some hydrogen storage solutions such as the 200 bar compressed storage are not light enough to compete with the ice system however other storage solutions e g 700 bar compressed hydrogen or liquid hydrogen are promising competitors to the ice system in addition the optimized hybrid system is always lighter than the battery system the co2eq emissions of the electric systems are lower than for the ice system in all the scenarios after a certain number of missions they also become cheaper however the shifting point in terms of cost happens after a high number of missions moreover the good performance in terms of co2eq emissions of the battery system is highly due to the fact that the swedish electric grid is almost carbon free this study shows the importance of performing such a sustainability assessment with clear boundaries and context in order to really quantify the benefits of a project in summary there is a growing societal interest for the electrification of the marine sector both for large and small vehicles this study investigated the feasibility of a small and fast fuel cell powered boat designed for rescue missions such a rescue boat is similar to privately owned boats in many aspects e g design size and speed since sweden is among the first countries in the world in terms of number of boats per capita sjofartsverket 2017 studying the feasibility and impact of implementing fuel cell stacks in such small and fast boats is important the good performance and applicability of the hybrid fuel cell battery system shown for the rescue boat in this case study together with its low environmental impact is very promising when reducing the total emissions of the transportation sector

20558,with the increasing interest for zero emission vehicles electric boats represent a growing area weight is a limiting factor for battery powered boats therefore the use of fuel cell battery systems is investigated the present study examines the power requirements the energy storage solutions and the sustainability assessment of a light and fast rescue boat operating in the swedish lake barken a weight optimized hybrid fuel cell battery system is presented the results show that if the hydrogen storage is wisely selected the weight of the hybrid system is significantly less than that of a battery system and can compete with an internal combustion engine system the sustainability assessment highlights and compares the impact in terms of cost and emissions of the different energy storage solutions the quantification of the emissions for the different energy systems under several scenarios shows a clear advantage for the electric solutions keywords fuel cell optimization carbon dioxide emissions cost 1 introduction in sweden boat traffic contributes to 9 increase of no2 and so2 in the atmosphere compared to background levels viana et al 2014 high speed boats such as rescue boats are usually energy intensive and require a large amount of power to reach high speeds e g 30 knots nowadays the majority of boats are powered by diesel internal combustion engines ice ice combined with diesel fuel is a very compact and light system however the use of fossil fuels has a negative impact on the environment due to pollution and faces issues of diminishing reserves with the increasing need for zero emission vehicles and the reduction of fossil fuel reserves electrical systems have become a suitable solution to reach environmental goals alfonsin et al 2015 the most common electrical storage technology consists of secondary batteries but the use of fuel cells is increasingly being investigated when comparing specific power and energy of different energy storage technologies the ragone plot fig 1 is very useful the ragone plot shows that fuel cells have high specific energy wh kg winter and brodd 2004 although it varies with the type of storage used for hydrogen needed in the fuel cell however fuel cells have a relatively low specific power w kg and show better performance when working at steady state batteries have a higher specific power and lower specific energy than fuel cells meaning that they can meet high power demands but cannot ensure long endurance the diesel ice system has high weight efficiency but should due to its negative environmental impacts be avoided pure rechargeable battery powered electric boats hereafter battery systems are in many aspects attractive but taking into account the high energy consumption the energy system becomes too large and it cannot compete with an equivalent ice in terms of onboard payload or endurance a hybrid fuel cell battery system hereafter hybrid system aggregates the specific energy of fuel cells with the specific power of batteries therefore such systems can satisfy the power demand of the vehicle store enough energy to run long driving cycles and carry a certain payload this approach is very interesting and has been demonstrated e g yazici 2011 hopwood 2012 cellkraft 2010 gmbh 2009 d amore domenech et al 2018 and power 2003 hydrogen is seen as a promising solution to decarbonize the transport sector renkel and lümmen 2018 garmsiri et al 2013 and park 2011 a number of fuel cell powered boat projects are ongoing showing promising results van biert et al 2016 the sf breeze project is a fuel cell powered aluminum catamaran sailing in the bay of san francisco klebanoff et al 2017a klebanoff et al 2017b its maximum capacity is 150 passengers it can store up to 1200 kg liquid hydrogen lh2 which corresponds to 4 h of operation and the fuel cell is a 4920kw proton exchange membrane fuel cell pemfc one more example is the energy observer project energy observer 2019 and cea liten 2016 a zero emission demonstration boat equipped with solar panels on the roof and wind turbines the renewable electrical energy is used to simultaneously power the boat charge the battery pack and power an electrolyzer which produces hydrogen the water needed for the electrolysis process comes from the sea and is desalinated before usage in the absence of wind and sun the battery pack powers the boat if the battery level of charge becomes critically low the stored hydrogen is released into the 22 kw pemfc which charges the battery the fuel cell is hence used as a range extender other projects such as the alsterwasser bassam et al 2017 han et al 2014 with a 2 x 48 kw pemfc and 360 ah lead acid gel battery pack or the 20 meter tourist boat project choi et al 2016 show that the use of fuel cells for boats is possible a study on the feasibility of the zero v a fuel cell powered research vessel was also conducted madsen et al 2020 the boat has a cruise speed of 10 knots and is equipped with a 1800kw fuel cell stack it was shown that with hydrogen coming from renewable sources the yearly emissions of the boat are dramatically lower than the emissions due to an equivalent system with a diesel engine the above cited examples correspond to large ships with a high power demand the use of fuel cells for small and fast duty boats e g rescue boats has not yet been deeply investigated in the literature and the industry the environmental impact and economic feasibility of such projects may vary from one country to another and needs to be estimated hörmandinger and lucas 1996 frey et al 2007 çabukoglu et al 2019 several factors e g the electricity generation and the specific utilization of the boat influence the final impact of the project the swedish government has set several targets in order to fulfill sweden s commitments under the paris agreement by 2040 the emissions of greenhouse gases should be 75 lower than emissions in 1990 government offices of sweden 2020 and moving toward low emission vehicles is a priority the swedish sea rescue society sjöräddningssällskapet the major association that performs sea rescue operations in swedish waters is evaluating the possibility of making their rescue boat fleet entirely carbon emission free hence more sustainable the present study is aiming at investigating the feasibility of a hybrid system for a light and fast rescue boat as well as to perform its sustainability assessment the considered boat should be used for regular lake inspections the designed system must compete in terms of weight with the ice system a comparative analysis is carried out considering the following competitive technologies diesel ice battery system and hybrid system the location chosen for the case study is the smedjebacken municipality and more especially the lake barken situated in the region dalarna in sweden the lake is narrow and 24 km long and the rescue station is located in the northern end this study case is presented in fig 2 where the map of the lake a picture of the actual boat a simple drawing of the boat and its main specifications can be found this study is divided into three parts the first part contains the description of the rescue boat and its specifications it describes the drive train of a hybrid system boat and gives a typical power profile of a mission performed by the rescue boat the second part is an estimation of the size of the energy system for the rescue boat using the created power profile a sizing tool previously presented by the authors chiche et al 2021 and updated for the rescue boat application in this study finds the optimum combination of the fuel cell and the battery pack in terms of weight in addition several ways to store hydrogen are compared and the hybrid system is also compared to a battery system and a conventional diesel ice system hereafter ice system the optimized hybrid system is also tested on two power profiles corresponding to critical rescue missions on the lake finally the third part quantifies the emissions and cost of such a rescue boat using the results from the previous parts a sustainability assessment considering the equivalent co2 hereafter co2eq emissions and the cost of the considered boat for different scenarios is carried out 2 boat description 2 1 boat specifications and drive train the boat of the study is 5 4 m long and 2 0 m wide and is usually carrying 2 persons this study concerns an updated version of the existing boat with some additional requirements from the swedish sea rescue society according to them the considered rescue boat has to fulfill the following requirements i be capable to reach a speed of 30 knots ii have a storage system that meets the energy and power demands of different rescue missions iii be equipped with a water jet motor since the boat needs to travel in shallow waters and debris could damage an outboard motor iv be small and agile in the case of a hybrid system drive train the system can be relatively complex fig 3 shows the configuration of the hybrid system for the battery system case the hydrogen the fuel cell and its inverter are not included the definitions used are listed in table 1 united states naval academy 2019 the product of efficiencies of the gear η g the motor η m the dc dcs converters and the inverter is 85 markowitz 2013 this value will be used in this study 2 2 power consumption the power consumption of the rescue boat is first estimated several ices from small and fast boats for private use fulfilling comparable requirements were previously compared by the authors andruetto 2019 the available data found correspond to boats slightly larger and with higher power demand than the rescue boat of this study case however a new fuel cell powered rescue boat with water jet will most likely be slightly larger than the boat they have today making the size of the power system in this study more relevant the relation between speed and internal combustion engine power was retrieved for small high speed boats powered by a water jet motor and an average curve used for this study was calculated fig 4a similarly the relation between the boat speed and the consumption of diesel l h by the internal combustion engine is assumed to be as in fig 4b andruetto 2019 neither power nor fuel consumption increases linearly but has different slopes in four different intervals of speed below 5 knots the increase is not significant between 5 and 10 knots the increase is steep at around 10 knots the boat starts planing causing a stabilization of resistance such curves are crucial when determining the set speeds at which the boat runs from fig 4a it is shown that an ice power of around 115 kw is required in order to reach 30 knots in addition the ice power needed to go at the low speed of 4 knots is close to 13kw 2 3 typical mission and motor sizing using the results from the previous subsection the power profile for the typical mission is created the mission is a tour of the lake barken during which the boat runs at high and low speeds at intervals of 10 min each the goal of the mission is duty coast guarding the boat runs at low speed to check a certain area and then moves at higher speed to another area it takes 80 min to do the entire round tour of the lake at maximum speed the boat alternates 8 cycles of 10 min at maximum speed and 10 min at low speed to go around the lake the length of the mission is 160 min andruetto 2019 using the average speed and the consumption curves fig 4 an internal combustion engine power profile simulating the described mission is created as shown in fig 5 the motor is selected based on the power profile and especially the maximum power needed p m a x which is close to 114 kw since the created power profile corresponds to the ice system it needs to be divided by the 85 efficiency mentioned earlier in order to size the electric motor the weight of the motor m m o t o r is then estimated using its specific power sp in w kg as shown in eq 1 the ice and the electric motor are assumed to have a specific power of 460w kg and 7000w kg with a motor density of 0 8kg l and 1kg l respectively andruetto 2019 1 m m o t o r p m a x s p 0 85 using eq 1 the total weight of the ice is equal to 296 kg whereas it is only 19 kg for the electric motor in addition the volume of the ice is 332 l and the volume of the electric motor is 19 l 3 design of the electric energy system and comparison with ice 3 1 general concept of fuel cell battery hybridization fuel cells and batteries are electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy into electricity the main difference between battery and fuel cell is that a battery is a closed system meaning that the energy storage is included in the electrode materials whereas a fuel cell is an open system in other words as long as the fuel cell is fed by reactants it can produce electricity in this case the energy storage and energy conversion do not occur at the same place there are two types of batteries primary batteries which are not rechargeable and secondary batteries which are rechargeable several types of secondary batteries with different chemistries are available on the market the lead acid the nickel cadmium or the nickel metal hydride batteries can however not compete with the lithium ion battery in terms of energy density and specific energy opitz et al 2017 in addition the lithium ion battery is considered as the best alternative for automotive applications and will therefore be the only battery considered in this study batteries are flexible in terms of power output reddy 2011 when a battery is being charged and discharged it is said it is cycling a secondary lithium ion battery can cycle around 5000 times before it reaches end of life scrosati et al 2013 the battery state of charge soc is the ratio between the energy left in the battery and its energy content when fully charged when the battery has lost around 20 of its initial ability to store energy it is considered to have reached end of life a charging rate crate of 1c means that it takes one hour to fully charge the battery 0 5c or c 2 that it takes two hours and 2c that it takes 30 min a high charging rate can have a negative impact on the lithium ion battery aging process mussa et al 2017 the proton exchange membrane fuel cell pemfc is currently the most developed fuel cell type the fuel cell industry benefits from the growing interest for zero emission power sources fuel cells are used for stationary and mobile applications they show better durability while running at steady state and can be degraded if they are wrongly used a pemfc consumes oxygen and hydrogen to produce electricity water and heat as shown in the following equation 2 o 2 2h 2 2 h 2 o h e a t e l e c t r i c i t y hybrid systems combine the flexibility of batteries in terms of power and the high energy density of hydrogen this characteristic makes such systems an increasingly common topic for both stationary and automotive applications and the market is growing efoy 2019 hybrid system cars and trucks already exist and show competitive performance symbio 2019 napoli et al 2017 casolari et al 2014 and feroldi et al 2009 nevertheless there is a major difference between an electric car and an electric boat when braking the car is not powered anymore and the kinetic energy from the movement can be used to charge the battery whereas this is not possible with a boat since it returns very little energy to the battery pack when designing a hybrid system for a boat there are two different alternatives the fuel cell is only used to charge the battery when that reaches a certain soc and maintains it at the desired soc the fuel cell is in this case called a range extender napoli et al 2017 casolari et al 2014 salman et al 2017 both the fuel cell and the battery are used to power the drive train the fuel cell delivers the base power while the battery is used and discharged during peak power demands and is recharged by the fuel cell at times of low power demand this usually means that the size of the battery pack is reduced it also means that the flexibility of the boat in terms of speed highly depends on the battery the undertaken sizing procedure will determine which configuration is selected 3 2 energy system optimization and design a sizing tool for hybrid pemfc battery systems originally developed by the authors for underwater vehicles and volume optimization chiche et al 2021 is adapted for a boat in this paper all the details about the optimization and sizing procedure are found in the cited study for this study case the storage of oxygen is not considered indeed the oxygen is taken from the ambient air in addition the optimization is made for weight instead of volume meaning that the targeted combination of fuel cell output power and battery size is now the lightest instead of the most compact moreover the estimation of the compensation needed to reach neutral buoyancy was removed the optimization principle is to implement a power profile in the tool and for each fuel cell nominal power in the power range the weights of the battery pack the fuel cell stack and amount of hydrogen needed are calculated furthermore the weight and volume of several systems are compared hybrid systems with different hydrogen storage battery system and ice system the assumptions for the hybrid system and the battery system are the same as used in the sizing and optimization study chiche et al 2021 i e 60 efficiency for the fuel cell η f c and 90 for the battery η b a t t the diesel fuel is assumed to have a specific energy of 11 6kwh kg and the ice an efficiency of 30 nektalova 2008 the created power profile based on the boat specifications was implemented in the described tool chiche et al 2021 the optimization was performed to estimate the total weight of a hybrid system with a pemfc stack varying from 50 kw to 110 kw see fig 6 results are that a nominal power of 75 kw for the fuel cell combined with a 11 5 kwh li ion battery is the optimum hybrid system in terms of weight giving a crate of 5 20 however with this hybrid system the flexibility of the boat in terms of power comes largely from the battery in other words the capacity of reaching high speeds depends on the battery pack thus in order to be able to stay at high speeds for a relatively long time the battery pack should be oversized in addition a crate higher than 1 can reduce the battery lifetime mussa et al 2017 aris and shabani 2017 saxena et al 2019 as a result the final battery pack designed after the optimization has to be the minimum battery pack battmin multiplied by the crate in order to reduce the degradation and ensure enough power flexibility to the boat table 2 shows the specifications of the final energy system the results from the optimization show that the lightest solution corresponds to a fuel cell power close to the average power demand combined with a relatively small battery pack used to reach peak power demands in other words the optimization shows that both the fuel cell and the battery are used to power the drive train the power profile was tested using the optimum configuration of fuel cell output power and the final size battery pack fig 7 shows the electric power profile and the evolution of the soc during the mission the initial soc is 0 6 and it varies between 0 6 and 0 75 meaning that the boat still has some flexibility in terms of power i e in terms of speed the ratio between fuel cell output power and the maximum power demand is 0 56 implying that the power is equally distributed between the fuel cell and the battery pack during peak power demands moreover the weight and volume of the hybrid system were estimated varying the hydrogen storage and compared to a battery system an ice system and a full primary battery system as shown in fig 8 the ice system remains the lightest one but with 700 bar compressed or liquid hydrogen the hybrid system can have a total weight comparable to the ice system additionally the hybrid system is lighter than the battery system for all the hydrogen storage alternatives hybridization is hence a suitable alternative in order to electrify vehicles without losing payload capacity the battery system is more than three times heavier than the ice system volume is also a key parameter when designing the energy system for a vehicle the ice system is very compact but the hybrid system can compete especially with the liquid hydrogen storage once again the volume of the battery system is higher than the volume of the ice system i e more than two times larger furthermore the competitive performance of the primary battery in terms of weight and volume is relative since the battery cannot be recharged and therefore needs to be changed after every mission and also have safety issues with high power such as overheating reddy 2011 thus primary batteries are considered as a reference more than a practical solution 3 3 energy system under critical missions other power profiles corresponding to critical missions such as rescue missions at very high speed must be handled by the rescue boat a checking procedure was made in order to verify if a given energy system amount of hydrogen stored fuel cell output power and battery pack can fulfill such missions it is assumed that when the battery soc is equal to 95 the battery cannot be charged anymore i e the fuel cell only powers the boat the amount of hydrogen left in the boat during the mission m h 2 t is estimated using the fuel cell power over time the hydrogen lower heating value l h v h 2 and the fuel cell system efficiency η f c as shown in eq 3 in addition the battery soc is estimated at any time of the mission using eq 4 where p o w e r t is the power demand 3 m h 2 t m h 2 0 0 t p f c t d t l h v h 2 η f c 4 s o c t s o c 0 0 t p o w e r t p f c t d t b a t t f i n a l two power profiles were created corresponding to two critical missions fig 9 mission 1 concerns a missing person fig 9a the rescue boat has to rush to the end of the lake which takes approximately 40 min at maximum speed using the motor at maximum power once arrived it looks for the person during the searching time here assumed to be 80 min the boat does not proceed at full speed but on the contrary at low speed after finding the person the boat goes back to the station at high speed hence again using full power for 40 min mission 2 applies to towing a boat fig 9b the boat to tow is located at the furthest point from the rescue station for the first 40 min the rescue boat proceeds at maximum speed once arrived at the accident it needs to get close to the boat in danger ensure that the passengers are safe and tow the boat to the shore for around 20 min the boat runs at low speed before actually towing the boat it takes around 20 min to tow the boat back to the shore the power used is the maximum power for another 20 min the rescue boat runs at low speed to ensure the boat is not in danger anymore but eventually the boat has to go back to the station running at cruise speed this last part takes around one hour results in fig 9 show that for both missions the optimized hybrid system can fulfill the mission as seen in figs 9a and 9c representing mission 1 when the power demand is below the nominal fuel cell power and the battery soc is 95 the battery is maintained at this soc and the fuel cell only delivers the power demand which leads to a lower hydrogen consumption this lower hydrogen consumption explains why there is around 1 8 kg of hydrogen left at the end of mission 1 mission 2 described in figs 9b and 9d starts with two high power and two low power peaks during these peaks the battery is discharged to 10 and charged to 45 twice after that the power demand is just above the fuel cell output power meaning that the battery is being more slowly discharged until the end of the mission the final battery soc is around 35 and since it never reaches 95 during the mission the fuel cell power is always its nominal one resulting in the constant hydrogen consumption seen in fig 9d 4 sustainability assessment sustainability is the capacity to exist continuously and at long term all aspects of a project and its impacts have to be taken into account when talking about sustainability assessment waas et al 2010 usually sustainable development refers to three major fields environmental economic and societal in this case the societal impact of the project is highly connected to the environmental field since the main goal is to reduce the emissions of the rescue boat therefore the co2eq emissions of the boat and cost under several scenarios are investigated 4 1 co2 footprint analysis the co2eq emissions of the boat when propelled by the ice system the battery system and the optimized hybrid system are investigated and compared two parts in the total co2eq emissions can be distinguished the fixed emissions efixed occurring only once in the life cycle due to the production of the product and the usage emissions eusage due to the utilization of the system calculated per unit of usage e g emissions per km matthews et al 2015 values for the co2eq emissions from each part of the system are presented in table 3 in this case study the influence of the production and decommissioning of the main components e g the motor either ice or electric motor the battery pack the inverter and the fuel cell has been taken into account the impact on the emissions of production and decommissioning can vary depending on different factors including technological development and site of production miller and keoleian 2015 that are also driving forces considered for future emission reductions to also account for the future evolution two scenarios are studied the current scenario corresponds to the co2eq emissions of each component of the energy system based on today s values the optimistic scenario is based on a future where technological development improves the production and decommissioning processes i e engineering and managerial improvements hence reducing the emissions corresponds to the co2eq emissions of each component of the energy system based on an optimistic future where technological development improves the production and decommissioning processes moreover from scale economies fixed emissions are likely to decrease gillingham and stock 2018 usage emissions differ for each case for the ice system case 1 the usage emissions are the well to propulsion emissions of diesel fuel case 2 refers to the battery systems in which the usage emissions are the emissions due to the charging of the battery from the swedish electric grid for the hybrid system in case 3 both the emissions due to the charging of the battery from the swedish electric grid and the emissions deriving from the production of hydrogen needed for fueling the fuel cell are regarded as usage emissions due to the very diverse technologies for the production of hydrogen two scenarios are considered here first the current scenario using the average value of emissions in the global production of hydrogen today second the optimistic scenario in which water electrolysis is assumed to be the only hydrogen production method the emissions of the boat co2eq are calculated using eq 5 the mission used is the typical one presented in fig 7 also used to run the optimization since in the hybrid system case and for the considered mission the battery soc at the beginning is the same as at the end the battery is not being recharged between two missions therefore the battery is being charged from the grid only for the first mission making that charging part of the fixed emissions 5 co 2 e q e f i x e d e u s a g e m i s s i o n s first of all results in fig 10 show that for both electric solutions hybrid system and battery system and for both the current and optimistic uses the fixed emissions represent an important part of the total co2eq emissions while the fixed emissions of the ice system are less significant for the battery system the usage emissions are very low and will hardly contribute to the total emissions not even after 250 missions secondly using current co2eq values the emissions from the optimized hybrid system become smaller than the emissions due to the ice system after 127 missions a similar shifting point appears after 166 missions when comparing emissions from the battery system and the ice system at last after 190 missions the battery system generates less emissions than the hybrid system once this last point is reached the hybrid system emits more tons of co2eq than the battery system and after 250 missions the hybrid system has emitted 6 more tons of co2eq corresponding to a 16 increase finally when considering the future optimistic values for emissions of co2eq the previously observed shifting points appear after fewer missions it takes only 16 missions for the hybrid system to generate less emissions than the ice system and 31 for the battery system the shifting point between the emissions from the hybrid system and the battery system happens after 151 missions furthermore in this case the two electric solutions emit at least 78 less co2eq than the ice system after 250 missions 4 2 cost forecasts for the evaluation of the different systems economy is an important aspect therefore the cost for the optimized hybrid system the ice system and battery system is estimated the cost is divided in two parts capex capital expenditure the investment cost for the material the capex represents a fixed cost paid only once at the beginning opex operational expenditure the exploitation cost of the system the opex represents the utilization cost of the system in this study the opex is multiplied by the number of missions run the cost of each part of the system was collected based on data regarding the current market e g statista 2019a kochhan et al 2017 and insideevs 2016 and targeted goals hydrogen europe 2020 and are presented in table 4 since the hydrogen and battery sectors are growing the cost of hydrogen fuel cell systems and battery packs has to be carefully investigated in europe the production cost of hydrogen produced from renewable sources varies between 5 and 11 kgh2 fuel cell and hydrogen joint undertaking fchju 2016 while the production cost in sweden is 5 3 kgh2 according to hydrogen europe hydrogen europe 2020 this value will be used for cost analysis but it is important to note that the total distribution cost is likely to be higher the cost of fuel cell systems has decreased in the last few years indeed it dropped from 500 kw to 100 kw between 2012 and 2017 for duty vehicles european energy research alliance 2020 it is supposed to be 60 kw in 2020 and the targeted goal is 40 kw by 2030 also the cost of battery packs is expected to decrease batteries europe stated that the for duty vehicles the cost of a battery pack will decrease from 200 kwh in 2020 to 85 kwh in 2030 batteries europe 2020 the capex is estimated once and the opex is estimated for the need of each mission the mission used here is once again the typical mission on which the optimization was based the cost is calculated using eq 6 similar to the co2eq analysis the charge of the battery only happens once for the hybrid system meaning that it becomes part of the capex 6 c o s t c a p e x o p e x m i s s i o n s results in fig 11 show that the capex investment for both electric systems hybrid system or battery system is more expensive than the one for the ice system since the opex is significantly lower for the electric systems after 1050 missions for the hybrid system and 2120 missions for the battery system it becomes cheaper to have an electric system rather than the ice system after 2500 missions the total cost for the optimized hybrid system is 21 lower than for the ice system and 17 lower than for the battery system it is interesting to highlight the fact that since this is a rescue boat there are no taxes on diesel for it in sweden for a privately owned boat considering taxes on diesel the shifting points for the cost between the ice system and the electric ones will appear after fewer missions in addition using 2030 targeted cost for the production of battery packs and the fuel cell stacks the same trend is observed it takes 825 missions for the hybrid system and 1170 missions for the battery system to become cheaper than the ice system after 2500 missions the hybrid system is 26 cheaper than the ice system 5 discussion the studied rescue boat needs to fulfill several demanding criteria and easily becomes energy intensive therefore the energy system has to be as compact as possible weight optimization of the hybrid system is a key step in order to design an electric system capable of both fulfilling the missions and compete in terms of weight with the ice system moreover the way hydrogen is stored is a crucial question since it changes the total weight and volume it seems that 700 bar compressed hydrogen or liquid hydrogen represents storage solutions enabling hybrid systems to compete in terms of weight and volume with the ice system the battery system is not suitable for such an application since its weight and volume are too high meaning that the onboard payload of the boat cannot be ensured with such a system the boat utilization number of missions per year needs to be discussed when analyzing the results of the sustainability assessment the main goal of the swedish sea rescue society is to reduce the global boat emissions which happens with the two electric solutions after relatively few missions if one mission per day is considered the emissions are reduced after roughly 6 months these two electric solutions do not become economically viable until after several years around 3 years for the hybrid system and 6 years for the battery system this highlights the need of financial support for projects like this one further regulations are likely to have an impact on the cost analysis and may lead to an earlier cost shifting point between the ice system and the hybrid system however it is clear that both electric systems i e hybrid system and battery system reduce dramatically the co2eq emissions over time thus are beneficial for the environment furthermore the low total cost of the ice system is mainly due to the fact that the considered mission is short i e less than 3 h as a result the opex for the ice system for this mission is not significantly higher than the opex for the two electric missions therefore if longer missions were considered the cost for the ice system would increase significantly whereas this increase would be less important for the opex of the electric solutions in other words longer missions might lead to shifting points in cost between the ice system and the electric ones after fewer missions in addition the high capex of the two electric solutions is likely to decrease if they mature in a near future and become mass produced on a level similar to ice system thus electric solutions for other boat applications e g long range ferry boats seem to be promising in the future when comparing the two electric systems the co2eq emissions and cost follow different trends on the one hand the hybrid system remains cheaper over time and on the other hand it emits more co2eq than the battery system after a certain number of missions figs 10 and 11 once again the boat utilization needs to be considered to interpret the described trends since this case study considers a rescue boat it is realistic to assume a small number of missions per year and the optimized hybrid system is a suitable solution nevertheless the presented sustainability assessment uses several values from the swedish electricity grid and market hence the results and trends mostly apply to sweden in another country where the electricity grid is more or less carbonized the total co2eq emissions might be different this highlights the importance of defining the context when performing a sustainability assessment besides the type of hydrogen storage is not considered in the sustainability assessment there will be some differences in cost and emissions between the different types of storage moreover the values used for the sustainability assessment are based on current data but also on target goals the latter highly depends on future policy in sweden and worldwide consequently they can change with policy and the trends can be different still it is realistic to assume that in the future more legislation and deployments of hybrid systems will decrease both the co2eq impact and the cost of each component of the system the final results are likely to change but the trend showing the relevance of such hybrid systems remains very strong safety represents one of the major challenges for the future deployment of hydrogen technologies the determination of the safety integrity level of a maritime fuel cell system showed that the highest risks are fire and explosion due to overflows of hydrogen or a control failure in the fuel cell system ahn et al 2019 risks assessment on fuel cell powered vehicles under different conditions is an ongoing research subject khalil 2015 ehrhart et al 2019 one major conclusion is that there is a serious need for workers in the transport sector to be trained for emerging risks in hydrogen and battery technologies especially for maintenance lópez arquillos et al 2015 last but not least some logistic aspects must be considered in the future indeed hydrogen supply is a crucial question since it is not fully developed yet questions about its logistics and its routing have to be answered on a practical level there is not yet any facilities for production of liquid hydrogen in scandinavia however with the multiplication of fuel cell projects worldwide and in sweden the hydrogen sector is likely to grow in a near future and overcome the cited issues 6 conclusion a rescue boat capable of performing both routine and emergency missions on lake barken in sweden was designed in this study electric solutions i e battery system and hybrid fuel cell battery systems were compared to an ice system by using an optimization and sizing tool a hybrid system with a 75 kw pem fuel cell stack combined with a 60 kwh lithium ion rechargeable battery pack and 10 kg of hydrogen was found to be the lightest electric system capable of fulfilling the intended missions the environmental impact of the rescue boat i e the co2eq emissions and the total cost were also estimated for several energy systems and scenarios the sustainability assessment shows that after many missions performed the hybrid system is more environmentally friendly and cheaper than an ice system the optimization and sizing tool ensures a hybrid system as light as possible and capable of fulfilling the given missions a battery system appears to be too heavy and therefore not suitable for such an application the total weight of the hybrid system highly depends on the way the hydrogen is stored some hydrogen storage solutions such as the 200 bar compressed storage are not light enough to compete with the ice system however other storage solutions e g 700 bar compressed hydrogen or liquid hydrogen are promising competitors to the ice system in addition the optimized hybrid system is always lighter than the battery system the co2eq emissions of the electric systems are lower than for the ice system in all the scenarios after a certain number of missions they also become cheaper however the shifting point in terms of cost happens after a high number of missions moreover the good performance in terms of co2eq emissions of the battery system is highly due to the fact that the swedish electric grid is almost carbon free this study shows the importance of performing such a sustainability assessment with clear boundaries and context in order to really quantify the benefits of a project in summary there is a growing societal interest for the electrification of the marine sector both for large and small vehicles this study investigated the feasibility of a small and fast fuel cell powered boat designed for rescue missions such a rescue boat is similar to privately owned boats in many aspects e g design size and speed since sweden is among the first countries in the world in terms of number of boats per capita sjofartsverket 2017 studying the feasibility and impact of implementing fuel cell stacks in such small and fast boats is important the good performance and applicability of the hybrid fuel cell battery system shown for the rescue boat in this case study together with its low environmental impact is very promising when reducing the total emissions of the transportation sector

20559,the present study analyzes the effect of incoming shear flow on the wake behind a wall mounted finite length square cylinder of aspect ratio a r 7 using large eddy simulation les all the simulations were performed at a reynolds number r e of 10000 based on cylinder width d and average inlet velocity u a v g with different shear parameters k 0 0 0 025 0 050 and 0 075 the shear improved smagorinsky model lévêque et al 2007 is used to account for the subgrid scale stress it is found that the incoming flow shear has a profound effect on the modes of shedding with increasing shear parameter anti symmetric modes of shedding tends to dominate along the cylinder height except close to the free end where both symmetric and anti symmetric modes of shedding co exist the incoming shear flow has also significant influence on the downwash flow from the free end the strength of which decreases with an increase in shear parameter the resolved turbulent kinetic energy tke associated with the cylinder wake is found to have maximum contribution from the transverse component of normal stress compared to the other components of normal stresses keywords finite cylinder large eddy simulation vortex shedding turbulent wake 1 introduction flow past wall mounted finite cylinders both circular and square have received a lot of attention over the last decade mostly due to their importance in engineering applications and fundamental research many engineering configurations such as heat exchangers pipelines and transmission lines can be modeled as flow past a finite size cylinder also the study of finite size cylinders got a lot of attention as several structures such as high rise buildings chimneys or stacks cooling towers and even offshore oil platforms can be modeled as finite length cylinders with free ends woyciekoski et al 2020 furthermore this particular flow configuration is also a problem of fundamental interest for researchers due to its very rich physics particularly its complex unsteady three dimensional features involving several interacting vortex systems a wall mounted finite cylinder generally has one of its ends fixed on the wall plate body junction wang et al 2006 while the other end is free hence these differential boundary conditions make the flow structures in the wake behind the finite cylinder more complicated than that of the two dimensional cylinder having identical boundary conditions at its two ends it is understood from the literature that the wake behind a wall mounted finite length cylinder is affected by various parameters such as a aspect ratio a r of the cylinder a r h d b the bottom wall boundary layer thickness δ c reynolds number r e d cross sectional shape of the cylinder and e inlet turbulence intensity to date most of the studies found in open literature have focused on the effect of the parameters mentioned above on the wake structures wang et al 2006 2012 2 literature review 2 1 previous experimental studies in the case of a wall mounted finite size square cylinder the approaching flow separates at the leading edge of the cylinder the separation phenomenon is independent of all the flow parameters this contrasts with the flow past wall mounted finite size circular cylinder where the separation angle depends on various parameters such as reynolds number aspect ratio and turbulent intensity the wake behind a higher aspect ratio h d cylinder for most of its span shows a vortex shedding similar to that observed in the case of an infinite cylinder due to the free end condition the vortex shedding seems to be suppressed near the top as the flow experiences downwash in this region palau salvador et al 2010 apart from this the wake of a finite size cylinder exhibits two different modes of shedding called the anti symmetric mode of shedding and symmetric mode of shedding which seems to be dependent on both the inflow conditions as well as the aspect ratio of the cylinder sakamoto and arie 1983 okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 wang and zhou 2009 sattari et al 2012 sakamoto and arie 1983 revealed that there is a critical value for aspect ratio a r c r i t i c a l beyond which the wake of a wall mounted finite length cylinder is altered and is dependent on inflow turbulence intensity bottom wall boundary layer thickness and reynolds number apart from separating at the leading side edges of the square cylinder the approaching flow is forced over to the cylinder top due to the higher pressure in front of the cylinder than in the region above the free end palau salvador et al 2010 the upward directed flow separates near the cylinder front edge develops into complex flow structures over the top surface which depends strongly on the characteristics of the approaching flow condition r e and the geometry of the cylinder for the finite size circular cylinder an owl face shaped structure is observed on the top free surface pattenden et al 2005 hain et al 2008 kawamura et al 1984 roh and park 2003 which is found to be absent in case of finite size square cylinder sumner et al 2017 the time averaged wake behind a finite cylinder has received considerable attention the formation of a dipole or quadrupole type vortices is controlled by the parameters such as the aspect ratio of the cylinder bottom wall boundary layer thickness wang and zhou 2009 sumner and heseltine 2008 hosseini et al 2013 studies showed that a pair of counter rotating streamwise vortex system is present throughout the wake when the aspect ratio of the cylinder a r is below a r c r i t i c a l wang and zhou 2009 sumner and heseltine 2008 sumner et al 2004 or the bottom wall boundary layer is very thin hosseini et al 2013 and was attributed to the strong downwash flow however for a r a r c r i t i c a l and thicker bottom wall boundary layer thickness a quadrupole wake is observed which is the combination of base vortices and tip vortices formed near the bottom wall and free end of the cylinder respectively both hosseini et al 2013 and bourgeois et al 2011 presented physical models for the square cylinder wake called the alternately shedding half loop structures and full loop structures respectively their investigation reveals that the former is due to a dipole type of wake while the latter model is related to a quadrupole type wake vortices although the effect of various parameters like a r r e δ cylinder shape and inlet turbulence intensity have been studied extensively in the past there is a dearth of study on the effect of inlet shear flow for a wall mounted finite size square cylinder the only references in this regard is found to be the studies of kumar and tiwari 2019 2020 who studied the effect of inlet shear on flow past finite size cylinder of cross section circular square and triangular at low reynolds number r e 150 250 apart from that most of the previous studies focused on the effect of inlet shear on infinitely long cylinders sohankar et al 2020 cheng et al 2005 lankadasu and vengadesan 2008 in the sheared flow past long cylinder cellular vortex shedding pattern was observed mair and stansby 1975 maull and young 1973 kappler et al 2005 where shedding takes place in the form of the spanwise cell having constant frequency over each cell also the frequency discontinuity is observed across two consecutive cells noack et al 1991 the spanwise size and the number of cells are also found to vary and depend on the aspect ratio of the cylinder and the end conditions mair and stansby 1975 a detailed review on shear flow past bluff bodies can be found in griffin griffin 1985 2 2 previous numerical studies in the context of the present study three different numerical modeling approaches can be considered namely reynolds averaged navier stokes methods rans large eddy simulation les and direct numerical simulation dns depending on the details and the accuracy of the flow field being investigated majumdar and rodi majumdar and rodi 1989 used the k ϵ turbulence model with a relatively coarser grid to study the flow over a wall mounted circular cylinder of finite size and extract the mean flow features it is quite a fact that the rans method cannot predict the turbulent fluctuating quantities as correctly as that of the les method therefore the les method is more suitable for wall bounded separated shear flow such as the flow around a wall mounted cube rodi 1997 the first les study on flow past wall mounted finite cylinder of h d 2 5 was performed by fröhlich and rodi 2004 who used both the standard smagorinsky model and the dynamics smagorinsky model and captured the associated complex flow features afgan et al 2007 performed the les study on flow past a wall mounted finite length circular cylinder and revealed that the downwash from the free end plays a significant role in the evolution of the flow downstream the flow around a finite circular cylinder of aspect ratio 6 was explored numerically using les by krajnović 2011 where a detailed flow topology near the free end and the formation of the two time mean tip vortices have been discussed palau salvador palau salvador et al 2010 carried out a combined numerical les and experimental study of the flow past wall mounted finite height cylinders of a r 2 5 and 5 for r e 22 000 and 43 000 their investigation revealed that the shedding occurs over most of the cylinder height for the higher aspect ratio cylinder for the smaller aspect ratio cylinder the shedding occurs mostly near the bottom wall the sub grid scale sgs effects in the case of les for a wall mounted finite size square cylinder were discussed in detail by saeedi and wang 2016 most recently da silva et al 2020 carried out an les study for flow past a wall mounted finite height square prism of a r 3 at r e 500 where the drag force and normal force coefficients are reported along with the mean flow structures apart from the rans and les studies dns studies are also gaining momentum in the research community but most of the dns studies on the wall mounted finite size cylinder are restricted to low reynolds number saha 2013 rastan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 behera and saha 2019 with saeedi et al 2014 being the exception recently kumar et al 2019 studied the effect of intensity of shear and aspect ratio on the wake of a wall mounted circular cylinder ar 1 5 at r e 300 using direct numerical simulations they reconfirmed the presence of symmetric shedding and the anti symmetric shedding for the wake region of a finite cylinder in their study the influence of intensity of shear on wake non linearity and frequency using the hilbert marginal spectra has also been discussed a detailed review of the literature indicates that most previous studies both experimental and numerical on wall mounted finite length cylinders considered a uniform or thin boundary layer type inlet condition but in engineering practice many structures such as high rise buildings offshore structure and pipelines near the seabed are submerged in boundary layer type flow and can be approximated by shear flow as the length scale of the structures can be very small compared to the length scale of the boundary layer therefore incoming shear flows with spanwise variations were considered in the present study it is to be noted that since the cylinder is placed vertically the vertical direction is termed spanwise direction as the span of the cylinder is aligned with the vertical direction as mentioned above the present study has many practical applications but the study here is not restricted to any applications and is more fundamental in nature thus the les method is considered in the present work to study the influence of velocity shear in the incoming flow on the wake of a wall mounted finite length square cylinder the simulations are carried out at a reynolds number of 10 000 where r e is defined based on the cylinder width d and average inlet velocity u a v g the aspect ratio of the cylinder is chosen as 7 with four different sheared incoming flow having shear parameters k k 0 0 0 025 0 050 and 0 075 respectively the case k 0 0 represents a uniform flow without any shear condition the details of the near wake and far wake behavior of the cylinder is described using instantaneous time averaged and turbulent statistics data 3 numerical methodology and simulation turbulent flows are generally associated with a wide range of spatial and temporal scales therefore the computation of turbulent flows requires numerical methodologies that could resolve these scales accurately among the various numerical techniques employed to study turbulent flows large eddy simulation les has emerged as one of the popular techniques which is computationally less expensive than the dns methods without compromising the accuracy with the advancement in high performance computing facilities it has also become popular compared to the rans methods owing to its higher accuracy the general procedure associated with the les method is the spatial filtering operation which leads to the decomposition of a flow variable as u i u i u i where u i is the resolved scale and u i is the subgrid scale sgs motion in the les method the resolved scale variable is computed directly on the computation grids while the subgrid scale effect on the resolved scale is suitably modeled the filtered governing equation for les is obtained after applying the spatial filtering operation on the navier stokes equation and are given as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j p x i 1 r e 2 u i x j 2 τ i j x j where τ i j u i u j u i u j is the sgs stress tensor in the present study the sgs stress tensor is modeled using a shear improved smagorinsky method where the anisotropic part of the sgs term is given as 3 τ i j 1 3 δ i j τ k k 2 ν t s i j the major difference between the standard smagorinsky model and the shear improved smagorinsky model is the way the turbulent eddy viscosity ν t is modeled in the standard smagorinsky model the turbulent viscosity is given by 4 ν t c s δ 2 s on the other hand in the shear improved smagorinsky model the turbulent eddy viscosity ν t is modeled as 5 ν t c s δ 2 s s where c s is the standard smagorinsky constant and δ is given as δ x δ y δ z 1 3 the s in the equation of ν t is given as s 2 s i j s i j 0 5 where s i j is the resolved strain rate tensor and the angle bracket denotes an ensemble average for more details about the shear improved smagorinsky model the readers are referred to the articles by lévêque et al 2007 and gohil et al 2014 the length scales and the velocity scales in eqs 1 and 2 are non dimensionalized by using the cylinder width d and average inlet velocity u a v g respectively similarly the time and pressure are non dimensionalized by d u a v g and ρ u a v g 2 respectively the marker and cell mac algorithm proposed by harlow and welch harlow and welch 1966 has been used in the present study for the time discretization of the convective terms a second order adams bashforth scheme is used while the crank nicolson scheme is used to discretize the diffusion terms the pressure correction poisson equation is solved iteratively using the gauss seidel method the present study employs a non uniform staggered grid arrangement to avoid the checkerboard problem the velocities are defined at the faces of the grid cell to which they are normal while the pressure is defined at the center of the cell the spatial discretization of the convective terms employs a weighted average of the second order central difference and third order upwind biased schemes a second order central difference scheme is used to spatially discretize the diffusion terms the typical time step used in the current simulations was 2 0 1 0 4 a time step independent study with time steps 2 1 0 4 and 9 1 0 5 was performed in the present study it was observed that the overall computational time increased as the time step was reduced from 2 1 0 4 to 9 1 0 5 without any change in the results therefore all the simulations in the present study were performed with time step 2 0 1 0 4 correspond to the time step used in the present study the maximum cfl number was found to be in the range of 0 063 0 139 the simulations are performed using an in house code based on the finite difference method with message passing interface mpi the code validation has been performed for flow past an infinite long square cylinder at re 21400 by comparing the results obtained using the present code with the results numerical and experimental available in the open literature the details of the code implementation and validation can be found in gohil et al 2014 and behera and saha 2020 fig 1 represents the computational domain where w 16 d h 20 d l u 7 5 d and l d 20 d are the dimensions related to the computational domain the dimensions of the finite size square cylinder is given by d h and the aspect ratio of the cylinder is taken as h d 7 in the current numerical simulation the boundary conditions used are given below 1 sheared velocity profiles having different shear strengths described by the shear parameter k have been prescribed at the inlet of the computational domain and are given by eq 6 as 6 u y 1 k 12 d l y s h e a r l n cosh 6 d y l y s h e a r 2 cosh 6 d y l y s h e a r 2 the shear parameter k is defined as k d u a v g u y y 10 l y s h e a r is defined as the length over which shear velocity extends and outside of it a constant velocity distribution prevails instead of a constant velocity gradient over the entire domain the equation of shear velocity profile given by eq 6 in the manuscript ensures that a free slip condition can be used at the top surface of the computational domain for a distance of 0 6 from the top surface of the domain a constant velocity was specified if a constant shear velocity had an extend over the entire domain it would be unphysical to mention a free slip condition at the top wall for more details about equation 6 one can refer to the paper of visakh et al 2016 and silvestrini and lamballais 2004 since a no slip boundary condition is employed on the bottom wall over which the cylinder is mounted a boundary layer type velocity profile is gradually developed along the stream wise direction the velocity profile at the position of the cylinder in the absence of the cylinder is shown in fig 2 for all the four cases of the shear parameter k investigated in the present work for k 0 i e uniform velocity inlet condition the flow develops into a boundary layer type profile at the wall the boundary layer thickness for k 0 at the location of the cylinder is found to be very small and its ratio to the cylinder height is found to be δ h 0 017 also the present study assumes that the incoming flow is smooth without any small scale turbulence the significant part of the turbulence in the present study is generated in the wake downstream of the cylinder 2 a convective outflow boundary condition given by eq 7 and proposed by orlanski orlanski 1976 has been defined at the outflow boundary of the computational domain 7 u i t u c u i x 0 here u i refers to the velocity vectors and u c 0 9 u a v g refers to the convective velocity at the outflow plane 3 the bottom wall and the cylinder surfaces are modeled as no slip and impermeable walls 4 the rest of the surfaces of the computational domain are modeled as free slip boundaries the typical computational grid used in the present investigation is shown in fig 3 non uniform grids in all three directions are created by clustering grid points near all the solid surfaces the details of the grid distribution grid independence test and domain dependence test are presented in the appendix section in general all the simulations were performed over a total time duration of 2000 non dimensional time units after the flow has reached a statistical stationary state the time history of the three velocity components both in the near wake and far wake and the lift force acting on the cylinder was used to monitor the statistical stationary state of the flow after an initial transient period of 60 80 non dimensional time units the flow was found to attain the statistical stationary state fig 4 shows the power spectra of the velocity signals for k 0 and k 0 075 probed at various spanwise locations in the near wake of the cylinder all the signals were probed on the symmetry plane z 0 d and streamwise location x 4 d it is noticed that the non dimensional frequency i e strouhal number remains constant with the height of the cylinder the strouhal number is defined as s t f d u a v g where f is the dimensional frequency the strouhal number correspond to various shear strengths k 0 0 025 0 050 and 0 075 considered in the present study are found to be 0 103 0 095 0 084 and 0 047 respectively and remains constant with the cylinder height the fixed frequency along the span of the cylinder indicates a strong coherent nature of the structures with the cylinder height suggesting that the base vortices tip vortices and spanwise vortices may be part of the same structure the power spectra plot reveals the 5 3 r d slope indicating that the wake of the cylinder is fully turbulent and suggests that the filtered large scales in the inertial sub range are resolved adequately by the grid adopted for the computations the power spectra plot also shows a proper dissipation which suggests that the les model used here is accurate enough to model sgs motion s effect on the filtered large scale motions the comparison of strouhal number at k 0 with similar studies of wang and zhou 2009 and sohankar et al 2018 is found to have a very good match wang and zhou 2009 for a wall mounted finite square cylinder of a r 7 and r e 9300 reported the dominant strouhal number to be s t 0 11 while sohankar et al 2018 for a r 7 and r e 1 1 1 0 4 reported the strouhal number to be s t 0 107 4 results and discussion the les results are analyzed in this section to give a comprehensive understanding of the effect of the inlet shear strength k on the wake dynamics of a wall mounted finite height square cylinder the investigations include the effect of shear parameters on the modes of shedding analyzed from instantaneous data associated vortical structures time averaged flow field near the cylinder surfaces and turbulent fluctuating fields 4 1 effect of shear parameter on modes of shedding the modes of shedding along the span of a solid surface mounted finite height square cylinder of a r 7 subjected to shear inflows with various strengths are analyzed using the instantaneous snapshots of the span wise vorticity ω y upon inspecting these instantaneous data two major types of shedding patterns were deduced for the wake of the solid surface mounted finite height square cylinder one of the shedding modes is found to be like the kármán type vortices referred to as an anti symmetric mode of shedding where the vortices of opposite sign are found to form and shed alternatively the other shedding mode in the present study is termed a symmetric mode of shedding where two opposite sign vortices are found to co exist in the formation or base region of the cylinder wake throughout the shedding cycle the contours of span wise vorticity on the plane y 3 5 d is plotted in fig 5 the left and right column in fig 5 shows the anti symmetric and symmetric mode of shedding respectively the authors interpretation of symmetric and anti symmetric mode of shedding is highlighted by faint black lines in fig 5 for high reynolds number flows r e 10 000 considered here the occurrence of symmetric and anti symmetric modes of shedding in the near wake of the cylinder is found to be closely related to the time varying amplitude of coefficient of lift force c l acting on the cylinder the coefficient of the lift force is defined as c l 0 5 f z ρ u a v g 2 where f z is the force acting on the cylinder in the transverse direction z the temporal variations of lift coefficient c l for all the cases of the shear parameter are shown in fig 6 for all shear parameters a noticeable period of high amplitudes with instances of low amplitudes is observed compared with the higher amplitudes the length and frequency of occurrence of lower amplitudes are found to be smaller during these cycles of the low amplitudes of c l symmetric mode of shedding seems to occur in the near wake flow or else anti symmetric mode of shedding is observed similar observations for the wake of a surface mounted finite height square cylinder of aspect ratio a r 4 and r e 12 000 were also made by sattari et al 2012 they reported that the modes of shedding associated with the cylinder wake are strongly coupled with the surface pressure coefficient and the high amplitude fluctuations and low amplitude fluctuations represent two different modes of shedding a and b respectively the mode a reported in their study was similar to the kármán type vortices for mode b they believed that it is not exactly a symmetric mode of shedding but a regime where two counter rotating vortices co exist in the near wake all through the shedding cycle but they shed alternatively fig 6 also highlights that at k 0 the occurrence of the symmetric mode of shedding is more frequent in contrast to the other cases this is quite expected as at k 0 the local reynolds number experienced by the cylinder along its span is almost uniform and higher compared to the other cases of shear flow considered in the present work as a result the flow becomes more turbulent than in other cases causing the symmetric mode of shedding frequently sakamoto and arie 1983 first reported the presence of anti symmetric vortices and symmetric type vortices in the near wake for a surface mounted circular cylinder and rectangular prism with h d 0 5 to 8 and r e d 270 to 920 they suggested that below a critical value of the aspect ratio h d c r the flow is dominated by the symmetric type of vortices and above it anti symmetric types of vortices dominate for the h d ratio close to the critical value they observed both the modes of shedding pattern and the symmetric mode of shedding occurring intermittently their findings were based upon flow visualization on the plane at the mid span of the cylinder later on wang et al 2006 wang and zhou 2009 also advocated the existence of both symmetric and anti symmetric modes of shedding in the near wake of a wall mounted square cylinder the authors of the present study suggest that the symmetric mode shedding observed in the near wake of a wall mounted finite size cylinder seen in the present study is not entirely a separate event however it is an interruption of the actual event i e the anti symmetric mode of shedding it is suggested that the phase difference between the anti symmetrically shed vortices about the plane of symmetry in case of the anti symmetric mode of shedding changes from period to period depending upon the strength of downwash flow experienced by the wake it is also suggested that when the wake experiences maximum downwash flow from the free end of the cylinder this phase difference between the anti symmetrically shed vortices becomes minimum giving the impression of symmetry shedding in the near wake behera and saha behera and saha 2019 also made similar observations for flow past a wall mounted finite size square cylinder at r e 250 they showed that when the wake encounters maximum downwash upwash the shedding mode changes from anti symmetric to symmetric shedding to show the downwash flow in the cylinder wake iso surface of the negative vertical velocity v is plotted in fig 7 the iso surface of the negative vertical velocity shows that the iso surface is quite dense in the near wake simultaneously away from the cylinder near wake it gets dispersed indicating the weakening of downwash flow as a result the entire wake never becomes symmetric and it is only the near wake region that switches between anti symmetric shedding and symmetric mode of shedding the streamwise distance from the rear surface of the cylinder after which the anti symmetric nature of the shed vortices is observed is a strong function of the shear parameter and height of the cylinder h moreover with the increase in shear strength parameter k the anti symmetric nature of the shed vortices is visibly closer to the cylinder the wake behind a surface mounted finite height cylinder is three dimensional owing to its end conditions such as cylinder free end and bottom wall with sheared flow as an inlet boundary condition the local reynolds number varies along the cylinder s span hence the near wake vorticity field and the shedding modes are expected to vary strongly with the cylinder s height or span the mode of shedding on three different horizontal planes y 0 7 d 3 5 d and 6 3 d is compared here for the different cases of shear strength k the mode of shedding on the plane y 3 5 d is already discussed earlier and was shown in fig 5 like the plane y 3 5 d the mode of shedding on the plane y 0 7 d plotted in fig 8 also shows the presence of symmetric and anti symmetric mode of shedding in the near wake but only for k 0 and 0 025 for k 0 050 and 0 075 the mode of shedding on the plane y 0 7 d is found to be anti symmetric only the absence of symmetric mode of shedding in the case of k 0 050 and 0 075 for the plane y 0 7 d is probably due to the weaker strength of downwash flow experienced by it compared to the mid span plane that may experience a higher strength of downwash it is noted that for shear parameter k 0 050 the near wake flow shows the only anti symmetric mode of shedding up to cylinder height of y 2 1 d while for k 0 075 the near wake flow shows the only anti symmetric mode of shedding up to cylinder height y 3 25 d the shedding pattern close to a free end plane of the cylinder y 6 3 d is shown in fig 9 it is observed that for k 0 and 0 025 the vortex shedding near the free end plane is suppressed by the strong downwash flow experienced by the wake near the free end but with the increase in shear parameter i e for k 0 050 and 0 075 only symmetric shedding is observed in the near wake wang and zhou 2009 also made a similar observation for the wake of a finite size square cylinder they reported that the probability of occurrence of the symmetric mode of shedding increases as one approaches the free end of a finite size cylinder the instantaneous iso surfaces of vortical structures obtained using λ 2 criterion and pressure perturbation p p p ρ u a v g 2 for k 0 025 0 050 0 075 are plotted in fig 10 a b and c respectively the vortical structures obtained using the λ 2 criterion show the horseshoe vortex system in front of the cylinder where the strength of the horseshoe vortex can be seen to decrease with an increase in the shear parameter the decrease in the strength of horseshoe vortex with an increase in shear parameter could be due to the lower value of the local reynolds number close to the bottom wall at higher shear parameter over the top region of the cylinder kelvin helmholtz induced small scale vortical structures forms due to the separation of the shear layer on the cylinder s top front edge they are swept downstream into the cylinder wake by the downwash flow the separating shear layers also appear to undergo a kelvin helmholtz type instability on the cylinder s side surfaces producing vortices that seem to stretch over the entire cylinder height kelvin helmholtz instability occurs when velocity shear exists in a continuous fluid which is what occurs here because of the sheared velocity inlet condition a strong velocity shear is developed across the cylinder height giving rising to the kelvin helmholtz induced vortices the cylinder wake shows large scale hairpin type structures and very small scale structures which adds to the complexity of the wake flow at k 0 025 smaller structures are found along the span of the cylinder compared to the higher values of k due to a small variation of the incoming flow velocity along the span of the cylinder however at k 0 075 more small scale structures are found close to the cylinder s tip region compared to the bottom wall as the incoming flow has a much higher velocity close to the tip region of the cylinder compared to the bottom wall palau salvador et al 2010 suggested that the visualization techniques such as λ 2 criterion or q criterion are not suitable for visualization of flow les data they argued that these criteria are not desirable for les data visualization as they extract structures of the scale similar to that of the grid size they further suggested that the large scale structures present in the flow field are better represented using pressure based quantities as discussed earlier the shedding seems to be suppressed in the zone near the top end of the cylinder and the large scale structures are found to be present in the lower part of the cylinder these large scale structures seem to develop into an arch type or bent elbow type structure at a lower value of shear parameter giving rise to the half loop structure suggested by bourgeois et al 2011 refer to fig 10 a but at higher values of the shear parameter i e for k 0 050 the large scale periodic motion reveals a full loop structure a similar full loop structure is also reported earlier by hosseini et al 2013 for a wall mounted finite size square cylinder with thicker bottom wall boundary layer thickness in case of full loop structure both the end seems to be connected to the principal core of the newly shed structure from the opposite side 4 2 time averaged flow field in this section time averaged quantities from the les simulations are presented the time mean and rms flow fields have been obtained by averaging over a total of 1600 and 1000 non dimensional time units respectively proper averaging time independency tests are also carried out to have confidence in all the results presented in this section and the section dealing with second order flow statistics it is also be noted that all the results mean velocity fields turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stresses presented in this section are grid resolved quantities unless mentioned otherwise 4 2 1 mean flow on the vertical symmetry plane fig 11 shows the time averaged streamlines at the mid transverse central plane z 0 d for different cases of shear parameters the top end shear layer separating at the top front edge of the cylinder rolls down towards the bottom wall for all cases the upwash flow near the bottom wall limits the free end shear layer to be reattached at the bottom wall leading to the saddle point s1 wang et al 2006 for a square cylinder of a r 5 showed that the position of saddle point s1 is a function of bottom wall boundary layer thickness they found that with the thickening of wall boundary layer thickness the upwash flow from the wall grows in size and hence pushes the saddle point s1 more towards the free end of the cylinder zhang et al 2017 through their dns results on a square cylinder of h d 4 showed that the position of the saddle point s1 is also a function of reynolds number they reported that with the increase in reynolds number the saddle point s1 moves closer to the bottom wall the present study shows that saddle point s1 is also a function of the shear parameter k in the present study it is observed that with the increase in the shear parameter k the saddle point s1 moves nearer to the free end of the cylinder with the increase in shear parameter an upward movement of the flow from the wall pushes the saddle point s1 towards the free end of the cylinder it is found that the vertical extent of downwash flow is maximum for k 0 and minimum for k 0 075 for k 0 075 the upwash flow moves to the top of the cylinder and creates a recirculation zone on the top of the cylinder for shear parameter k 0 025 the separating streamlines from the free end form a free end vortex called n f the formation of a free end vortex n f can be attributed to the growing size of the upward moving flow with increasing shear parameter the flow topology near the bottom wall shows base vortex n b a secondary flow vortex created as the flow gets entrapped between the cylinder rear wall bottom wall and forwarding moving flow it is observed that the base vortex moves closer to the cylinder wall as the shear parameter increases the flow topology reveals the presence of an unstable foci f1 for k 0 025 while an unstable node n is found closer to the bottom wall for k 0 025 krajnović 2011 also reported a similar finding for a tall circular cylinder a r 6 using les 4 2 2 mean flow on the side walls the flow pattern on the planes at a distance of 0 005 from the vertical walls of the cylinder is shown in fig 12 except for the front face all other faces show the flow separation to be three dimensional in all cases the front surfaces exhibit a vertical stagnation line from which the flow appears to diverge side wise implying two dimensionality of flow in front of the cylinder except near the two ends where end effects are observed although the flow looks visibly similar on the front face for all the shear parameter cases k specific differences are found to exist in the flow topology for k 0 the streamlines directed outward from the stagnation line have almost parallel movement throughout the cylinder span but as the shear strength k increases the streamlines have a downward movement except near the two ends of the cylinder where the upward movement of the streamlines still exists the downward movement of the streamlines at higher shear could be due to gradual increase of pressure along the cylinder height except close to the end regions the separating flow on the rear face for k 0 050 is complicated compared to the flow for k 0 050 the flow shows a saddle point on the rear surface where the vertical position of the saddle point increases with an increase in shear parameter k the variation in the position of this saddle point with k on the rear surface is found to be governed by the reverse flow zone behind the cylinder on the upper half of the cylinder for k 0 050 the flow seems to be originating from a source point that moves nearer to the free end of the cylinder as the shear parameter is increased close to the bottom wall a strong upward movement of flow can be noticed where the flow moves up and away from the center line towards the sides of the cylinder the limiting streamlines on the side faces reveal a very complex flow topology it is observed that the base suction pressure behind the cylinder is higher than the pressure near the side faces of the cylinder therefore a reverse flow from the wake of the cylinder to the side faces of the cylinder takes place and gives rise to the development of two recirculation bubbles one close to the leading edge and the other near to the trailing edge of the cylinder the presence of these two recirculation bubbles near the transverse surfaces of the cylinder gives rise to the complex flow topology on the side surfaces of the cylinder 4 2 3 mean streamwise vortices the time averaged streamwise vortices are a major part of the cylinder wake topology and have a strong dependency on the aspect ratio of the cylinder wang and zhou 2009 and wall boundary layer thickness δ hosseini et al 2013 the effect of inlet flow shear strength on the streamwise vortices is analyzed and plotted in fig 13 fig 13 depicts that for k 0 025 the wake at x 6 d shows only a pair of counter rotating vortices with the cylinder height referred as dipole type wake in the open literature as the strength of inlet shear increases i e for k 0 050 another pair of counter rotating vortices are observed close to the bottom wall and in general have strength lower than that of the pair of vortices found near the free end of the cylinder the lower strength of the pair of vortices near the bottom wall is due to the lower magnitude of the local velocity close to the bottom wall the presence of two pairs of counter rotating vortices in the finite cylinder wake is often referred to as quadrupole type wake in the open literature similar observations are also made at an axial location x 12 d but are not shown here for k 0 025 the downwash flow dominates almost the whole span of the cylinder and hence only a pair of counter rotating vorticity is observed across the entire height of the cylinder with the increase in inflow shear strength the dominance of downwash flow decreases while that of upwash flow increases as the influence of upwash flow becomes significant another pair of counter rotating streamwise vorticity is generated near the bottom wall and gives rise to the quadrupole type of wake the downwash upwash flow by induction modifies the spanwise vorticity content of the sidewall shear layers into streamwise vorticity and hence initiates the dipole quadrupole wake most recently zhang et al 2017 reported that the streamwise vorticity could be of six vortices type for a finite height square cylinder of a r 4 at r e 150 and 250 at r e 500 and 1000 they observed a dipole type wake while they observed a quadrupole type of wake at r e 50 and 100 the open literature suggests that various parameters like a r r e δ and k present study influence the type of wake for the streamwise vorticity but the authors of the present work believe that it is the strength of the upwash flow downwash flow and their mutual interaction that governs the type of wake for the streamwise vortices therefore it can be argued that all these parameters a r r e δ and k influence the downwash and upwash flow from the free end and bottom wall of the cylinder and in turn decides the type of wake for the streamwise vortices 4 2 4 mean velocity profiles fig 14 illustrates the lateral distribution of axial velocity at different spanwise locations y 0 7 d 3 5 d and 6 3 d the velocity deficit in the wake of the cylinder gradually decreases with an increase in downstream distance for all four cases this is quite natural as the wake spreads downstream due to diffusion and entrains fluid from the free stream lateral sides of the domain into the wake as a result of which the total momentum deficit decreases on the plane y 0 7 d the velocity deficit is found to be maximum for k 0 and minimum for k 0 075 suggesting a stronger wake for k 0 owing to the local reynolds number the velocity profile at x 2 d fig 14 g shows a negative velocity for k 0 suggesting the presence of a reverse flow zone in the near wake as we move away from the bottom surface towards the cylinder top the velocity deficit in the near wake zone gradually increases for k 0 025 fig 14 d a the increase in velocity deficit is attributed to a stronger wake due to the increase in reynolds number owing to the sheared inlet velocity profile for k 0 025 the velocity deficit decreases near the free end away from the recirculation zone as fluid is entrained from the top of the cylinder to the wake zone due to stronger downwash flow in general the lateral distribution of the streamwise velocity profile at various spanwise and streamwise locations is plotted in fig 14 it shows a velocity minimum at the center z 0 d except a few locations where two symmetrically positioned points away from the center plane show the velocity minimum this happens most probably due to the entrainment of fluid into the center of the wake zone the entrainment of fluid is mostly associated with the streamwise vortices induced flow see fig 13 which is very strong near the free end of the cylinder hence the velocity profiles distribution on the plane near the free end of the cylinder i e y 6 3 d shows the velocity minimum away from the center line the transverse variation of time averaged lateral velocity components at three different spanwise and streamwise locations are shown in fig 15 the velocity field in the wake of a wall mounted cylinder is highly three dimensional and depends strongly upon the upwash and downwash phenomenon therefore the type of lateral entrainment negative or positive that the wake experiences at different spanwise and axial locations are predicted by the transverse velocity magnitude which depends on both upwash and downwash flow a negative transverse velocity to the left of the symmetry plane and a positive transverse velocity to the symmetry plane s right indicates negative entrainment of flow the distribution of lateral velocity component close to the bottom wall is shown in fig 15 g h i from the plot in fig 15 g it is observed that close to the symmetry plane positive entrainment is encountered away from it negative entrainment of flow is observed this is mostly due to the strong three dimensional nature of the upwash and downwash flow around the cylinder wake for k 0 025 the positive entrainment close to the symmetry plane is largely due to an upwash flow induced by the initiation of the counter rotating vortex pair that grows downstream of the wake and forms a dipole type wake whereas for k 0 025 the positive entrainment near the symmetry plane is due to the downwash flow associated with the initiation of two pairs of counter rotating streamwise vortices which develop into a quadrupole type streamwise vorticity similar observations were also made in the near wake zone at the mid span of the cylinder fig 15 d but away from the bottom wall close to the free end fig 15 a only positive entrainment of flow is observed with the strength being much higher except for k 0 075 mostly due to the presence of downwash flow from the zone above the cylinder free end and upwash flow induced due to the initiation of streamwise vortices fig 15 h and i show the distribution away from the near wake and it is observed that negative entrainment largely dominates the flow for k 0 050 in contrast positive entrainment dominates the flow for k 0 075 away from the near wake the flow near the free end of the cylinder fig 15 b and c always shows positive entrainment of flow for all the cases of the shear parameter k in the form of a pair of counter rotating streamwise vortices seen near the free end induces an inward motion of fluid into the center wake the flow near the midspan of the cylinder away from the near wake fig 15 e and f experiences positive entrainment for k 0 and negative entrainment for k 0 4 2 5 comparison of integral quantities the effect of shear strength k on the integral quantities like strouhal number s t time mean drag coefficient c d the rms drag coefficient c d r m s and the rms lift coefficient c l r m s is discussed in this section due to the lack of available reference data for direct comparison a qualitative comparison of the integral quantities s t and c d is made with the published findings on the wall mounted finite size square cylinder but only for the shear parameter k 0 table 1 presents the comparison of strouhal number s t and the mean drag coefficient c d reported by various authors for the wall mounted finite length square cylinder a considerable variation in s t and c d in the literature is observed due to variation in aspect ratio ar and reynolds number r e the value of s t and c d from the present study for k 0 seems to be in close agreement with uffinger et al 2013 as their simulations were performed at similar conditions as the present study in terms of aspect ratio and reynolds number the comparison of the strouhal number s t for various shear strength parameters k is tabulated in table 2 it should be noted that the s t calculated from the fluctuating lift force acting on the cylinder fig 6 is found to be the same as the s t calculated from the fluctuating velocity field the variation of s t along the height of the cylinder is already presented in section 3 for k 0 and k 0 075 fig 4 table 2 shows that the s t value decreases with the increase in the shear parameter k this may be attributed to the increase in the reverse flow zone close to the free end of the cylinder with the increase in k the flow model for wall mounted finite size square cylinder suggests that the wake is characterized by a single vortical coherent structure where the base vortices tip vortices and spanwise vortices are part of this single vortical coherent structure wang and zhou 2009 hosseini et al 2013 bourgeois et al 2011 consequently although the recirculation length varies throughout the height of the cylinder the strouhal number remains constant similar to s t the time mean drag coefficient c d is found to decrease monotonically with an increase in the shear parameter k the friction drag contribution to the total drag coefficient was negligible compared to the pressure drag coefficient due to the high reynolds number associated with the flow the front face of the cylinder is found to be subjected to higher pressure drag force because it being the leading face that causes the stagnation of flow the rear face of the cylinder also seems to contribute significantly though less than the front face to the drag coefficient and is related to the strong base suction caused by the separated flow the decrease in the mean drag coefficient c d is due to the decrease in the total pressure force acting on the leading face of the cylinder the distribution of sectional drag coefficient is plotted in fig 16 fig 16 shows that for all the cases of shear parameter k the sectional drag coefficient varies across the height of the cylinder the variation of the sectional drag coefficient is primarily due to the variation of the pressure force across the front face of the cylinder it is also to be noted that the sectional drag coefficient increases across the height of the cylinder and close to the free end of the cylinder the value decreases the decrease in the value of the sectional drag coefficient near the free end of the cylinder is attributed to the lower pressure force near the free end than the rest of the cylinder height this is obvious because the low pressure near the free end of the cylinder causes the flow to deflect over the top surface of the cylinder ind addition table 2 reveals that similar to the mean drag coefficient the rms drag coefficient c d r m s also decreases monotonically with shear parameter k however the magnitude of the rms lift coefficient c l r m s is found to increase with the increase in shear parameter with k 0 075 being the exception where the value decreases 4 2 6 second order flow statistics fig 17 compares the spatial distribution of the resolved turbulent kinetic energy k 1 2 u i u i on the symmetry plane z 0 d for different shear parameters k hereafter the resolved turbulent kinetic energy is only referred to as turbulent kinetic energy tke in the paper from fig 17 it is clear that the highest tke levels are concentrated in the immediate near wake region of the cylinder due to the higher normal stresses in the near wake compared to the regions away from it as seen in fig 17 a in comparison with other shear cases the case with k 0 shows higher tke levels in the separating shear layer present above the free end of the cylinder fig 17 further shows that with the increase in shear parameter k the streamwise extent of the highest tke levels decreases this is because the streamwise extent beyond which the spanwise shedding vortices loses their strength and spreads due to diffusion decreases with an increase in the shear parameter further within the wake s recirculation zone the tke is found to be less than the highest tke in the flow field because the separating shear layers from the cylinder side walls lack mutual interaction with each other in this region however as the separating shear layers start interacting with each other away from the cylinder recirculation region the tke increases due to mutual momentum transfer among the separating shear layers to further investigate the effect of shear parameter on turbulence statistics fig 18 compares the profiles of reynolds normal stresses along the span of the cylinder as seen in fig 18 for all the cases the magnitude of w w is found to be significantly larger than the other components of reynolds normal stresses except near to the free end therefore one can conclude that among all the components of reynolds normal stresses w w makes the highest contribution to the tke for all the shear parameters the higher magnitude of w w compared to other normal stresses is due to the shedding of vortices that involves strong transverse fluctuations closer to the free end of the cylinder v v also becomes significantly higher due to strong downwash flow it is also observed that the reynolds normal stresses decrease gradually as the wake vortices lose their strength due to diffusion not shown here along with the downstream of the wake compared to the reynolds normal stress components the reynolds shear stress components are observed to be quite small not shown here along the span of cylinder except close to the free end region of the cylinder near the free end of the cylinder the reynolds shear stress component u v is found to be significant due to the associated downwash flow 5 conclusions a large eddy simulation was carried out in the present study to investigate the effect of incoming shear flow of four distinct shear strengths on the wake behind a surface mounted finite length square cylinder at r e 10 000 the wake behavior under the four different flow conditions are analyzed the main results obtained are summarized as follows 1 both anti symmetric and intermittently symmetric shedding patterns in wake of the cylinder have been observed it is also seen that with the increase in shear parameter k the extent of region from the bottom wall increases within which the anti symmetric mode of shedding is seen to persist therefore the incoming flow shear strength seems to have significant effect on the modes of the shedding 2 the region of domination of upwash flow gradually increases with the increase in shear parameter k but the strength of downwash flow from the free end of the cylinder is found to decrease with increase in shear parameter k 3 the reverse flow region becomes strongly three dimensional with shorter region near the bottom wall compared to the free end region the difference between two ends is seen to increase with increasing shear parameters 4 the mean streamwise wake shows a dipole type wake at k 0 0 and 0 025 while at higher shear parameter k 0 050 and 0 075 a quadrupole wake is observed 5 the time averaged drag coefficient c d and rms drag coefficient c d r m s are both found to decrease monotonically with increase in shear parameter k 6 the tke associated with the cylinder wake is found have its major contribution from the transverse component of normal stress for all the cases of

institute of technology kanpur for providing the high performance computational facilities for carrying out the simulations appendix grid grid independent and domain independent test as shown earlier in fig 3 a nonuniform grid system is used in the present investigation the nonuniform grids in all three directions are created by clustering grid points near all the solid surfaces it is to be noted that the grids are refined substantially in the region having higher velocity gradient such as wake and near wall regions in contrast moderate refining of grids is carried out in the region of the low velocity gradient the minimum grid spacing near the solid surfaces is kept as 0 005 d and the cells are then stretched with a maximum stretching ratio of 1 2 in each direction the nonuniform grid distribution in the three directions is shown in fig 19 in the vertical direction across the span of the cylinder the grids are distributed such that close to the bottom wall and near to the free end of the cylinder very fine nonuniform grid is generated but away from them a uniform grid of size 0 055 d is employed similarly the maximum grid size at the center of the cylinder in the x direction and z direction is seemed to be as big as 0 04 d far away from the cylinder surface a larger grid size is maintained as shown in fig 19 it is important to demonstrate that the computational results are independent of both grid size and physical domain therefore a grid independence study is performed using three different grid sizes namely 232 170 154 coarse 277 218 206 intermediate and 317 274 250 fine for the computational domain shown in fig 1 the minimum grid spacing near the solid walls for the three different grid sizes i e coarse medium and fine are chosen to be 0 0065 d 0 005 d and 0 0035 d respectively details of the grid independent study are shown by plotting the distribution of time mean streamwise velocity recovery along the centerline and the transverse variation of the time averaged normal stress component u u at the axial position x 3 d on the spanwise plane y 1 d fig 20 a and b for the three grids it is noticed that the forecasts by the intermediate and finest grid have a good match for the time average centerline velocity the average percentage difference between the coarser mesh and the intermediate mesh is found to be 2 8 while that between intermediate and fine mesh is found to be only 0 83 the dependency of the grid on global parameters like mean drag coefficient c d and rms lift coefficient c l r m s are compared in the present study the mean drag coefficient c d and the rms lift coefficient c l r m s is given in table 3 for the different grid size used in the study it is observed that the mean drag coefficient shows a percentage change of 3 92 between the coarse and the intermediate grid and a percentage change of 2 61 between the fine and the intermediate grid like the mean drag coefficient the rms lift coefficient also shows that the percentage difference between the coarse and medium grid is 5 05 while the fine and medium grid is 3 69 given the variations of the time averaged velocity field stress field mean drag coefficient and rms lift coefficient for the different mesh sizes all the computations have been carried out using a mesh of size 277 218 206 for wall bounded flow fröhlich and rodi 2002 suggested that the grid resolution with δ y 2 is good enough to simulate turbulent boundary layer attached motion using les the δ x δ y and δ z reported here are the wall coordinate values of the first cell of all solid surfaces in the wall normal direction respectively the wall coordinate values of the first cell on the front and rear face of the cylinder respectively are represented as δ x similarly the wall coordinate values of the first cell on the transverse face of the cylinder are represented as δ z the wall coordinate values of the first cell on the top surface of the cylinder are represented as δ y in the present study the chosen grid after the grid independent study used for all the simulations has the resolution δ x 0 10 3 8 δ y 0 08 1 97 and δ z 0 10 2 6 which is found to be in good agreement with the values reported in the open literature the flow field dependency on the domain height in the vertical direction is also tested in the present study where two different vertical heights h 16 d and 20 d are considered the original grid used for simulation i e the intermediate grid was used where only the grid in the vertical direction was reduced in number to reduce the domain size from 20 d to 16 d without altering the grid distribution in any other region of the computational domain the mean drag coefficient or rms lift coefficient for the two heights showed no difference in the values also the distribution of the time mean streamwise velocity profile along the transverse direction is plotted for the two vertical heights in fig 21 the comparison shows a good match between the two vertical heights though the domain independent study reveals that a domain height of 16 d is good enough to perform the simulations a domain height of 20 d has been chosen 
20559,the present study analyzes the effect of incoming shear flow on the wake behind a wall mounted finite length square cylinder of aspect ratio a r 7 using large eddy simulation les all the simulations were performed at a reynolds number r e of 10000 based on cylinder width d and average inlet velocity u a v g with different shear parameters k 0 0 0 025 0 050 and 0 075 the shear improved smagorinsky model lévêque et al 2007 is used to account for the subgrid scale stress it is found that the incoming flow shear has a profound effect on the modes of shedding with increasing shear parameter anti symmetric modes of shedding tends to dominate along the cylinder height except close to the free end where both symmetric and anti symmetric modes of shedding co exist the incoming shear flow has also significant influence on the downwash flow from the free end the strength of which decreases with an increase in shear parameter the resolved turbulent kinetic energy tke associated with the cylinder wake is found to have maximum contribution from the transverse component of normal stress compared to the other components of normal stresses keywords finite cylinder large eddy simulation vortex shedding turbulent wake 1 introduction flow past wall mounted finite cylinders both circular and square have received a lot of attention over the last decade mostly due to their importance in engineering applications and fundamental research many engineering configurations such as heat exchangers pipelines and transmission lines can be modeled as flow past a finite size cylinder also the study of finite size cylinders got a lot of attention as several structures such as high rise buildings chimneys or stacks cooling towers and even offshore oil platforms can be modeled as finite length cylinders with free ends woyciekoski et al 2020 furthermore this particular flow configuration is also a problem of fundamental interest for researchers due to its very rich physics particularly its complex unsteady three dimensional features involving several interacting vortex systems a wall mounted finite cylinder generally has one of its ends fixed on the wall plate body junction wang et al 2006 while the other end is free hence these differential boundary conditions make the flow structures in the wake behind the finite cylinder more complicated than that of the two dimensional cylinder having identical boundary conditions at its two ends it is understood from the literature that the wake behind a wall mounted finite length cylinder is affected by various parameters such as a aspect ratio a r of the cylinder a r h d b the bottom wall boundary layer thickness δ c reynolds number r e d cross sectional shape of the cylinder and e inlet turbulence intensity to date most of the studies found in open literature have focused on the effect of the parameters mentioned above on the wake structures wang et al 2006 2012 2 literature review 2 1 previous experimental studies in the case of a wall mounted finite size square cylinder the approaching flow separates at the leading edge of the cylinder the separation phenomenon is independent of all the flow parameters this contrasts with the flow past wall mounted finite size circular cylinder where the separation angle depends on various parameters such as reynolds number aspect ratio and turbulent intensity the wake behind a higher aspect ratio h d cylinder for most of its span shows a vortex shedding similar to that observed in the case of an infinite cylinder due to the free end condition the vortex shedding seems to be suppressed near the top as the flow experiences downwash in this region palau salvador et al 2010 apart from this the wake of a finite size cylinder exhibits two different modes of shedding called the anti symmetric mode of shedding and symmetric mode of shedding which seems to be dependent on both the inflow conditions as well as the aspect ratio of the cylinder sakamoto and arie 1983 okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 wang and zhou 2009 sattari et al 2012 sakamoto and arie 1983 revealed that there is a critical value for aspect ratio a r c r i t i c a l beyond which the wake of a wall mounted finite length cylinder is altered and is dependent on inflow turbulence intensity bottom wall boundary layer thickness and reynolds number apart from separating at the leading side edges of the square cylinder the approaching flow is forced over to the cylinder top due to the higher pressure in front of the cylinder than in the region above the free end palau salvador et al 2010 the upward directed flow separates near the cylinder front edge develops into complex flow structures over the top surface which depends strongly on the characteristics of the approaching flow condition r e and the geometry of the cylinder for the finite size circular cylinder an owl face shaped structure is observed on the top free surface pattenden et al 2005 hain et al 2008 kawamura et al 1984 roh and park 2003 which is found to be absent in case of finite size square cylinder sumner et al 2017 the time averaged wake behind a finite cylinder has received considerable attention the formation of a dipole or quadrupole type vortices is controlled by the parameters such as the aspect ratio of the cylinder bottom wall boundary layer thickness wang and zhou 2009 sumner and heseltine 2008 hosseini et al 2013 studies showed that a pair of counter rotating streamwise vortex system is present throughout the wake when the aspect ratio of the cylinder a r is below a r c r i t i c a l wang and zhou 2009 sumner and heseltine 2008 sumner et al 2004 or the bottom wall boundary layer is very thin hosseini et al 2013 and was attributed to the strong downwash flow however for a r a r c r i t i c a l and thicker bottom wall boundary layer thickness a quadrupole wake is observed which is the combination of base vortices and tip vortices formed near the bottom wall and free end of the cylinder respectively both hosseini et al 2013 and bourgeois et al 2011 presented physical models for the square cylinder wake called the alternately shedding half loop structures and full loop structures respectively their investigation reveals that the former is due to a dipole type of wake while the latter model is related to a quadrupole type wake vortices although the effect of various parameters like a r r e δ cylinder shape and inlet turbulence intensity have been studied extensively in the past there is a dearth of study on the effect of inlet shear flow for a wall mounted finite size square cylinder the only references in this regard is found to be the studies of kumar and tiwari 2019 2020 who studied the effect of inlet shear on flow past finite size cylinder of cross section circular square and triangular at low reynolds number r e 150 250 apart from that most of the previous studies focused on the effect of inlet shear on infinitely long cylinders sohankar et al 2020 cheng et al 2005 lankadasu and vengadesan 2008 in the sheared flow past long cylinder cellular vortex shedding pattern was observed mair and stansby 1975 maull and young 1973 kappler et al 2005 where shedding takes place in the form of the spanwise cell having constant frequency over each cell also the frequency discontinuity is observed across two consecutive cells noack et al 1991 the spanwise size and the number of cells are also found to vary and depend on the aspect ratio of the cylinder and the end conditions mair and stansby 1975 a detailed review on shear flow past bluff bodies can be found in griffin griffin 1985 2 2 previous numerical studies in the context of the present study three different numerical modeling approaches can be considered namely reynolds averaged navier stokes methods rans large eddy simulation les and direct numerical simulation dns depending on the details and the accuracy of the flow field being investigated majumdar and rodi majumdar and rodi 1989 used the k ϵ turbulence model with a relatively coarser grid to study the flow over a wall mounted circular cylinder of finite size and extract the mean flow features it is quite a fact that the rans method cannot predict the turbulent fluctuating quantities as correctly as that of the les method therefore the les method is more suitable for wall bounded separated shear flow such as the flow around a wall mounted cube rodi 1997 the first les study on flow past wall mounted finite cylinder of h d 2 5 was performed by fröhlich and rodi 2004 who used both the standard smagorinsky model and the dynamics smagorinsky model and captured the associated complex flow features afgan et al 2007 performed the les study on flow past a wall mounted finite length circular cylinder and revealed that the downwash from the free end plays a significant role in the evolution of the flow downstream the flow around a finite circular cylinder of aspect ratio 6 was explored numerically using les by krajnović 2011 where a detailed flow topology near the free end and the formation of the two time mean tip vortices have been discussed palau salvador palau salvador et al 2010 carried out a combined numerical les and experimental study of the flow past wall mounted finite height cylinders of a r 2 5 and 5 for r e 22 000 and 43 000 their investigation revealed that the shedding occurs over most of the cylinder height for the higher aspect ratio cylinder for the smaller aspect ratio cylinder the shedding occurs mostly near the bottom wall the sub grid scale sgs effects in the case of les for a wall mounted finite size square cylinder were discussed in detail by saeedi and wang 2016 most recently da silva et al 2020 carried out an les study for flow past a wall mounted finite height square prism of a r 3 at r e 500 where the drag force and normal force coefficients are reported along with the mean flow structures apart from the rans and les studies dns studies are also gaining momentum in the research community but most of the dns studies on the wall mounted finite size cylinder are restricted to low reynolds number saha 2013 rastan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 behera and saha 2019 with saeedi et al 2014 being the exception recently kumar et al 2019 studied the effect of intensity of shear and aspect ratio on the wake of a wall mounted circular cylinder ar 1 5 at r e 300 using direct numerical simulations they reconfirmed the presence of symmetric shedding and the anti symmetric shedding for the wake region of a finite cylinder in their study the influence of intensity of shear on wake non linearity and frequency using the hilbert marginal spectra has also been discussed a detailed review of the literature indicates that most previous studies both experimental and numerical on wall mounted finite length cylinders considered a uniform or thin boundary layer type inlet condition but in engineering practice many structures such as high rise buildings offshore structure and pipelines near the seabed are submerged in boundary layer type flow and can be approximated by shear flow as the length scale of the structures can be very small compared to the length scale of the boundary layer therefore incoming shear flows with spanwise variations were considered in the present study it is to be noted that since the cylinder is placed vertically the vertical direction is termed spanwise direction as the span of the cylinder is aligned with the vertical direction as mentioned above the present study has many practical applications but the study here is not restricted to any applications and is more fundamental in nature thus the les method is considered in the present work to study the influence of velocity shear in the incoming flow on the wake of a wall mounted finite length square cylinder the simulations are carried out at a reynolds number of 10 000 where r e is defined based on the cylinder width d and average inlet velocity u a v g the aspect ratio of the cylinder is chosen as 7 with four different sheared incoming flow having shear parameters k k 0 0 0 025 0 050 and 0 075 respectively the case k 0 0 represents a uniform flow without any shear condition the details of the near wake and far wake behavior of the cylinder is described using instantaneous time averaged and turbulent statistics data 3 numerical methodology and simulation turbulent flows are generally associated with a wide range of spatial and temporal scales therefore the computation of turbulent flows requires numerical methodologies that could resolve these scales accurately among the various numerical techniques employed to study turbulent flows large eddy simulation les has emerged as one of the popular techniques which is computationally less expensive than the dns methods without compromising the accuracy with the advancement in high performance computing facilities it has also become popular compared to the rans methods owing to its higher accuracy the general procedure associated with the les method is the spatial filtering operation which leads to the decomposition of a flow variable as u i u i u i where u i is the resolved scale and u i is the subgrid scale sgs motion in the les method the resolved scale variable is computed directly on the computation grids while the subgrid scale effect on the resolved scale is suitably modeled the filtered governing equation for les is obtained after applying the spatial filtering operation on the navier stokes equation and are given as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j p x i 1 r e 2 u i x j 2 τ i j x j where τ i j u i u j u i u j is the sgs stress tensor in the present study the sgs stress tensor is modeled using a shear improved smagorinsky method where the anisotropic part of the sgs term is given as 3 τ i j 1 3 δ i j τ k k 2 ν t s i j the major difference between the standard smagorinsky model and the shear improved smagorinsky model is the way the turbulent eddy viscosity ν t is modeled in the standard smagorinsky model the turbulent viscosity is given by 4 ν t c s δ 2 s on the other hand in the shear improved smagorinsky model the turbulent eddy viscosity ν t is modeled as 5 ν t c s δ 2 s s where c s is the standard smagorinsky constant and δ is given as δ x δ y δ z 1 3 the s in the equation of ν t is given as s 2 s i j s i j 0 5 where s i j is the resolved strain rate tensor and the angle bracket denotes an ensemble average for more details about the shear improved smagorinsky model the readers are referred to the articles by lévêque et al 2007 and gohil et al 2014 the length scales and the velocity scales in eqs 1 and 2 are non dimensionalized by using the cylinder width d and average inlet velocity u a v g respectively similarly the time and pressure are non dimensionalized by d u a v g and ρ u a v g 2 respectively the marker and cell mac algorithm proposed by harlow and welch harlow and welch 1966 has been used in the present study for the time discretization of the convective terms a second order adams bashforth scheme is used while the crank nicolson scheme is used to discretize the diffusion terms the pressure correction poisson equation is solved iteratively using the gauss seidel method the present study employs a non uniform staggered grid arrangement to avoid the checkerboard problem the velocities are defined at the faces of the grid cell to which they are normal while the pressure is defined at the center of the cell the spatial discretization of the convective terms employs a weighted average of the second order central difference and third order upwind biased schemes a second order central difference scheme is used to spatially discretize the diffusion terms the typical time step used in the current simulations was 2 0 1 0 4 a time step independent study with time steps 2 1 0 4 and 9 1 0 5 was performed in the present study it was observed that the overall computational time increased as the time step was reduced from 2 1 0 4 to 9 1 0 5 without any change in the results therefore all the simulations in the present study were performed with time step 2 0 1 0 4 correspond to the time step used in the present study the maximum cfl number was found to be in the range of 0 063 0 139 the simulations are performed using an in house code based on the finite difference method with message passing interface mpi the code validation has been performed for flow past an infinite long square cylinder at re 21400 by comparing the results obtained using the present code with the results numerical and experimental available in the open literature the details of the code implementation and validation can be found in gohil et al 2014 and behera and saha 2020 fig 1 represents the computational domain where w 16 d h 20 d l u 7 5 d and l d 20 d are the dimensions related to the computational domain the dimensions of the finite size square cylinder is given by d h and the aspect ratio of the cylinder is taken as h d 7 in the current numerical simulation the boundary conditions used are given below 1 sheared velocity profiles having different shear strengths described by the shear parameter k have been prescribed at the inlet of the computational domain and are given by eq 6 as 6 u y 1 k 12 d l y s h e a r l n cosh 6 d y l y s h e a r 2 cosh 6 d y l y s h e a r 2 the shear parameter k is defined as k d u a v g u y y 10 l y s h e a r is defined as the length over which shear velocity extends and outside of it a constant velocity distribution prevails instead of a constant velocity gradient over the entire domain the equation of shear velocity profile given by eq 6 in the manuscript ensures that a free slip condition can be used at the top surface of the computational domain for a distance of 0 6 from the top surface of the domain a constant velocity was specified if a constant shear velocity had an extend over the entire domain it would be unphysical to mention a free slip condition at the top wall for more details about equation 6 one can refer to the paper of visakh et al 2016 and silvestrini and lamballais 2004 since a no slip boundary condition is employed on the bottom wall over which the cylinder is mounted a boundary layer type velocity profile is gradually developed along the stream wise direction the velocity profile at the position of the cylinder in the absence of the cylinder is shown in fig 2 for all the four cases of the shear parameter k investigated in the present work for k 0 i e uniform velocity inlet condition the flow develops into a boundary layer type profile at the wall the boundary layer thickness for k 0 at the location of the cylinder is found to be very small and its ratio to the cylinder height is found to be δ h 0 017 also the present study assumes that the incoming flow is smooth without any small scale turbulence the significant part of the turbulence in the present study is generated in the wake downstream of the cylinder 2 a convective outflow boundary condition given by eq 7 and proposed by orlanski orlanski 1976 has been defined at the outflow boundary of the computational domain 7 u i t u c u i x 0 here u i refers to the velocity vectors and u c 0 9 u a v g refers to the convective velocity at the outflow plane 3 the bottom wall and the cylinder surfaces are modeled as no slip and impermeable walls 4 the rest of the surfaces of the computational domain are modeled as free slip boundaries the typical computational grid used in the present investigation is shown in fig 3 non uniform grids in all three directions are created by clustering grid points near all the solid surfaces the details of the grid distribution grid independence test and domain dependence test are presented in the appendix section in general all the simulations were performed over a total time duration of 2000 non dimensional time units after the flow has reached a statistical stationary state the time history of the three velocity components both in the near wake and far wake and the lift force acting on the cylinder was used to monitor the statistical stationary state of the flow after an initial transient period of 60 80 non dimensional time units the flow was found to attain the statistical stationary state fig 4 shows the power spectra of the velocity signals for k 0 and k 0 075 probed at various spanwise locations in the near wake of the cylinder all the signals were probed on the symmetry plane z 0 d and streamwise location x 4 d it is noticed that the non dimensional frequency i e strouhal number remains constant with the height of the cylinder the strouhal number is defined as s t f d u a v g where f is the dimensional frequency the strouhal number correspond to various shear strengths k 0 0 025 0 050 and 0 075 considered in the present study are found to be 0 103 0 095 0 084 and 0 047 respectively and remains constant with the cylinder height the fixed frequency along the span of the cylinder indicates a strong coherent nature of the structures with the cylinder height suggesting that the base vortices tip vortices and spanwise vortices may be part of the same structure the power spectra plot reveals the 5 3 r d slope indicating that the wake of the cylinder is fully turbulent and suggests that the filtered large scales in the inertial sub range are resolved adequately by the grid adopted for the computations the power spectra plot also shows a proper dissipation which suggests that the les model used here is accurate enough to model sgs motion s effect on the filtered large scale motions the comparison of strouhal number at k 0 with similar studies of wang and zhou 2009 and sohankar et al 2018 is found to have a very good match wang and zhou 2009 for a wall mounted finite square cylinder of a r 7 and r e 9300 reported the dominant strouhal number to be s t 0 11 while sohankar et al 2018 for a r 7 and r e 1 1 1 0 4 reported the strouhal number to be s t 0 107 4 results and discussion the les results are analyzed in this section to give a comprehensive understanding of the effect of the inlet shear strength k on the wake dynamics of a wall mounted finite height square cylinder the investigations include the effect of shear parameters on the modes of shedding analyzed from instantaneous data associated vortical structures time averaged flow field near the cylinder surfaces and turbulent fluctuating fields 4 1 effect of shear parameter on modes of shedding the modes of shedding along the span of a solid surface mounted finite height square cylinder of a r 7 subjected to shear inflows with various strengths are analyzed using the instantaneous snapshots of the span wise vorticity ω y upon inspecting these instantaneous data two major types of shedding patterns were deduced for the wake of the solid surface mounted finite height square cylinder one of the shedding modes is found to be like the kármán type vortices referred to as an anti symmetric mode of shedding where the vortices of opposite sign are found to form and shed alternatively the other shedding mode in the present study is termed a symmetric mode of shedding where two opposite sign vortices are found to co exist in the formation or base region of the cylinder wake throughout the shedding cycle the contours of span wise vorticity on the plane y 3 5 d is plotted in fig 5 the left and right column in fig 5 shows the anti symmetric and symmetric mode of shedding respectively the authors interpretation of symmetric and anti symmetric mode of shedding is highlighted by faint black lines in fig 5 for high reynolds number flows r e 10 000 considered here the occurrence of symmetric and anti symmetric modes of shedding in the near wake of the cylinder is found to be closely related to the time varying amplitude of coefficient of lift force c l acting on the cylinder the coefficient of the lift force is defined as c l 0 5 f z ρ u a v g 2 where f z is the force acting on the cylinder in the transverse direction z the temporal variations of lift coefficient c l for all the cases of the shear parameter are shown in fig 6 for all shear parameters a noticeable period of high amplitudes with instances of low amplitudes is observed compared with the higher amplitudes the length and frequency of occurrence of lower amplitudes are found to be smaller during these cycles of the low amplitudes of c l symmetric mode of shedding seems to occur in the near wake flow or else anti symmetric mode of shedding is observed similar observations for the wake of a surface mounted finite height square cylinder of aspect ratio a r 4 and r e 12 000 were also made by sattari et al 2012 they reported that the modes of shedding associated with the cylinder wake are strongly coupled with the surface pressure coefficient and the high amplitude fluctuations and low amplitude fluctuations represent two different modes of shedding a and b respectively the mode a reported in their study was similar to the kármán type vortices for mode b they believed that it is not exactly a symmetric mode of shedding but a regime where two counter rotating vortices co exist in the near wake all through the shedding cycle but they shed alternatively fig 6 also highlights that at k 0 the occurrence of the symmetric mode of shedding is more frequent in contrast to the other cases this is quite expected as at k 0 the local reynolds number experienced by the cylinder along its span is almost uniform and higher compared to the other cases of shear flow considered in the present work as a result the flow becomes more turbulent than in other cases causing the symmetric mode of shedding frequently sakamoto and arie 1983 first reported the presence of anti symmetric vortices and symmetric type vortices in the near wake for a surface mounted circular cylinder and rectangular prism with h d 0 5 to 8 and r e d 270 to 920 they suggested that below a critical value of the aspect ratio h d c r the flow is dominated by the symmetric type of vortices and above it anti symmetric types of vortices dominate for the h d ratio close to the critical value they observed both the modes of shedding pattern and the symmetric mode of shedding occurring intermittently their findings were based upon flow visualization on the plane at the mid span of the cylinder later on wang et al 2006 wang and zhou 2009 also advocated the existence of both symmetric and anti symmetric modes of shedding in the near wake of a wall mounted square cylinder the authors of the present study suggest that the symmetric mode shedding observed in the near wake of a wall mounted finite size cylinder seen in the present study is not entirely a separate event however it is an interruption of the actual event i e the anti symmetric mode of shedding it is suggested that the phase difference between the anti symmetrically shed vortices about the plane of symmetry in case of the anti symmetric mode of shedding changes from period to period depending upon the strength of downwash flow experienced by the wake it is also suggested that when the wake experiences maximum downwash flow from the free end of the cylinder this phase difference between the anti symmetrically shed vortices becomes minimum giving the impression of symmetry shedding in the near wake behera and saha behera and saha 2019 also made similar observations for flow past a wall mounted finite size square cylinder at r e 250 they showed that when the wake encounters maximum downwash upwash the shedding mode changes from anti symmetric to symmetric shedding to show the downwash flow in the cylinder wake iso surface of the negative vertical velocity v is plotted in fig 7 the iso surface of the negative vertical velocity shows that the iso surface is quite dense in the near wake simultaneously away from the cylinder near wake it gets dispersed indicating the weakening of downwash flow as a result the entire wake never becomes symmetric and it is only the near wake region that switches between anti symmetric shedding and symmetric mode of shedding the streamwise distance from the rear surface of the cylinder after which the anti symmetric nature of the shed vortices is observed is a strong function of the shear parameter and height of the cylinder h moreover with the increase in shear strength parameter k the anti symmetric nature of the shed vortices is visibly closer to the cylinder the wake behind a surface mounted finite height cylinder is three dimensional owing to its end conditions such as cylinder free end and bottom wall with sheared flow as an inlet boundary condition the local reynolds number varies along the cylinder s span hence the near wake vorticity field and the shedding modes are expected to vary strongly with the cylinder s height or span the mode of shedding on three different horizontal planes y 0 7 d 3 5 d and 6 3 d is compared here for the different cases of shear strength k the mode of shedding on the plane y 3 5 d is already discussed earlier and was shown in fig 5 like the plane y 3 5 d the mode of shedding on the plane y 0 7 d plotted in fig 8 also shows the presence of symmetric and anti symmetric mode of shedding in the near wake but only for k 0 and 0 025 for k 0 050 and 0 075 the mode of shedding on the plane y 0 7 d is found to be anti symmetric only the absence of symmetric mode of shedding in the case of k 0 050 and 0 075 for the plane y 0 7 d is probably due to the weaker strength of downwash flow experienced by it compared to the mid span plane that may experience a higher strength of downwash it is noted that for shear parameter k 0 050 the near wake flow shows the only anti symmetric mode of shedding up to cylinder height of y 2 1 d while for k 0 075 the near wake flow shows the only anti symmetric mode of shedding up to cylinder height y 3 25 d the shedding pattern close to a free end plane of the cylinder y 6 3 d is shown in fig 9 it is observed that for k 0 and 0 025 the vortex shedding near the free end plane is suppressed by the strong downwash flow experienced by the wake near the free end but with the increase in shear parameter i e for k 0 050 and 0 075 only symmetric shedding is observed in the near wake wang and zhou 2009 also made a similar observation for the wake of a finite size square cylinder they reported that the probability of occurrence of the symmetric mode of shedding increases as one approaches the free end of a finite size cylinder the instantaneous iso surfaces of vortical structures obtained using λ 2 criterion and pressure perturbation p p p ρ u a v g 2 for k 0 025 0 050 0 075 are plotted in fig 10 a b and c respectively the vortical structures obtained using the λ 2 criterion show the horseshoe vortex system in front of the cylinder where the strength of the horseshoe vortex can be seen to decrease with an increase in the shear parameter the decrease in the strength of horseshoe vortex with an increase in shear parameter could be due to the lower value of the local reynolds number close to the bottom wall at higher shear parameter over the top region of the cylinder kelvin helmholtz induced small scale vortical structures forms due to the separation of the shear layer on the cylinder s top front edge they are swept downstream into the cylinder wake by the downwash flow the separating shear layers also appear to undergo a kelvin helmholtz type instability on the cylinder s side surfaces producing vortices that seem to stretch over the entire cylinder height kelvin helmholtz instability occurs when velocity shear exists in a continuous fluid which is what occurs here because of the sheared velocity inlet condition a strong velocity shear is developed across the cylinder height giving rising to the kelvin helmholtz induced vortices the cylinder wake shows large scale hairpin type structures and very small scale structures which adds to the complexity of the wake flow at k 0 025 smaller structures are found along the span of the cylinder compared to the higher values of k due to a small variation of the incoming flow velocity along the span of the cylinder however at k 0 075 more small scale structures are found close to the cylinder s tip region compared to the bottom wall as the incoming flow has a much higher velocity close to the tip region of the cylinder compared to the bottom wall palau salvador et al 2010 suggested that the visualization techniques such as λ 2 criterion or q criterion are not suitable for visualization of flow les data they argued that these criteria are not desirable for les data visualization as they extract structures of the scale similar to that of the grid size they further suggested that the large scale structures present in the flow field are better represented using pressure based quantities as discussed earlier the shedding seems to be suppressed in the zone near the top end of the cylinder and the large scale structures are found to be present in the lower part of the cylinder these large scale structures seem to develop into an arch type or bent elbow type structure at a lower value of shear parameter giving rise to the half loop structure suggested by bourgeois et al 2011 refer to fig 10 a but at higher values of the shear parameter i e for k 0 050 the large scale periodic motion reveals a full loop structure a similar full loop structure is also reported earlier by hosseini et al 2013 for a wall mounted finite size square cylinder with thicker bottom wall boundary layer thickness in case of full loop structure both the end seems to be connected to the principal core of the newly shed structure from the opposite side 4 2 time averaged flow field in this section time averaged quantities from the les simulations are presented the time mean and rms flow fields have been obtained by averaging over a total of 1600 and 1000 non dimensional time units respectively proper averaging time independency tests are also carried out to have confidence in all the results presented in this section and the section dealing with second order flow statistics it is also be noted that all the results mean velocity fields turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stresses presented in this section are grid resolved quantities unless mentioned otherwise 4 2 1 mean flow on the vertical symmetry plane fig 11 shows the time averaged streamlines at the mid transverse central plane z 0 d for different cases of shear parameters the top end shear layer separating at the top front edge of the cylinder rolls down towards the bottom wall for all cases the upwash flow near the bottom wall limits the free end shear layer to be reattached at the bottom wall leading to the saddle point s1 wang et al 2006 for a square cylinder of a r 5 showed that the position of saddle point s1 is a function of bottom wall boundary layer thickness they found that with the thickening of wall boundary layer thickness the upwash flow from the wall grows in size and hence pushes the saddle point s1 more towards the free end of the cylinder zhang et al 2017 through their dns results on a square cylinder of h d 4 showed that the position of the saddle point s1 is also a function of reynolds number they reported that with the increase in reynolds number the saddle point s1 moves closer to the bottom wall the present study shows that saddle point s1 is also a function of the shear parameter k in the present study it is observed that with the increase in the shear parameter k the saddle point s1 moves nearer to the free end of the cylinder with the increase in shear parameter an upward movement of the flow from the wall pushes the saddle point s1 towards the free end of the cylinder it is found that the vertical extent of downwash flow is maximum for k 0 and minimum for k 0 075 for k 0 075 the upwash flow moves to the top of the cylinder and creates a recirculation zone on the top of the cylinder for shear parameter k 0 025 the separating streamlines from the free end form a free end vortex called n f the formation of a free end vortex n f can be attributed to the growing size of the upward moving flow with increasing shear parameter the flow topology near the bottom wall shows base vortex n b a secondary flow vortex created as the flow gets entrapped between the cylinder rear wall bottom wall and forwarding moving flow it is observed that the base vortex moves closer to the cylinder wall as the shear parameter increases the flow topology reveals the presence of an unstable foci f1 for k 0 025 while an unstable node n is found closer to the bottom wall for k 0 025 krajnović 2011 also reported a similar finding for a tall circular cylinder a r 6 using les 4 2 2 mean flow on the side walls the flow pattern on the planes at a distance of 0 005 from the vertical walls of the cylinder is shown in fig 12 except for the front face all other faces show the flow separation to be three dimensional in all cases the front surfaces exhibit a vertical stagnation line from which the flow appears to diverge side wise implying two dimensionality of flow in front of the cylinder except near the two ends where end effects are observed although the flow looks visibly similar on the front face for all the shear parameter cases k specific differences are found to exist in the flow topology for k 0 the streamlines directed outward from the stagnation line have almost parallel movement throughout the cylinder span but as the shear strength k increases the streamlines have a downward movement except near the two ends of the cylinder where the upward movement of the streamlines still exists the downward movement of the streamlines at higher shear could be due to gradual increase of pressure along the cylinder height except close to the end regions the separating flow on the rear face for k 0 050 is complicated compared to the flow for k 0 050 the flow shows a saddle point on the rear surface where the vertical position of the saddle point increases with an increase in shear parameter k the variation in the position of this saddle point with k on the rear surface is found to be governed by the reverse flow zone behind the cylinder on the upper half of the cylinder for k 0 050 the flow seems to be originating from a source point that moves nearer to the free end of the cylinder as the shear parameter is increased close to the bottom wall a strong upward movement of flow can be noticed where the flow moves up and away from the center line towards the sides of the cylinder the limiting streamlines on the side faces reveal a very complex flow topology it is observed that the base suction pressure behind the cylinder is higher than the pressure near the side faces of the cylinder therefore a reverse flow from the wake of the cylinder to the side faces of the cylinder takes place and gives rise to the development of two recirculation bubbles one close to the leading edge and the other near to the trailing edge of the cylinder the presence of these two recirculation bubbles near the transverse surfaces of the cylinder gives rise to the complex flow topology on the side surfaces of the cylinder 4 2 3 mean streamwise vortices the time averaged streamwise vortices are a major part of the cylinder wake topology and have a strong dependency on the aspect ratio of the cylinder wang and zhou 2009 and wall boundary layer thickness δ hosseini et al 2013 the effect of inlet flow shear strength on the streamwise vortices is analyzed and plotted in fig 13 fig 13 depicts that for k 0 025 the wake at x 6 d shows only a pair of counter rotating vortices with the cylinder height referred as dipole type wake in the open literature as the strength of inlet shear increases i e for k 0 050 another pair of counter rotating vortices are observed close to the bottom wall and in general have strength lower than that of the pair of vortices found near the free end of the cylinder the lower strength of the pair of vortices near the bottom wall is due to the lower magnitude of the local velocity close to the bottom wall the presence of two pairs of counter rotating vortices in the finite cylinder wake is often referred to as quadrupole type wake in the open literature similar observations are also made at an axial location x 12 d but are not shown here for k 0 025 the downwash flow dominates almost the whole span of the cylinder and hence only a pair of counter rotating vorticity is observed across the entire height of the cylinder with the increase in inflow shear strength the dominance of downwash flow decreases while that of upwash flow increases as the influence of upwash flow becomes significant another pair of counter rotating streamwise vorticity is generated near the bottom wall and gives rise to the quadrupole type of wake the downwash upwash flow by induction modifies the spanwise vorticity content of the sidewall shear layers into streamwise vorticity and hence initiates the dipole quadrupole wake most recently zhang et al 2017 reported that the streamwise vorticity could be of six vortices type for a finite height square cylinder of a r 4 at r e 150 and 250 at r e 500 and 1000 they observed a dipole type wake while they observed a quadrupole type of wake at r e 50 and 100 the open literature suggests that various parameters like a r r e δ and k present study influence the type of wake for the streamwise vorticity but the authors of the present work believe that it is the strength of the upwash flow downwash flow and their mutual interaction that governs the type of wake for the streamwise vortices therefore it can be argued that all these parameters a r r e δ and k influence the downwash and upwash flow from the free end and bottom wall of the cylinder and in turn decides the type of wake for the streamwise vortices 4 2 4 mean velocity profiles fig 14 illustrates the lateral distribution of axial velocity at different spanwise locations y 0 7 d 3 5 d and 6 3 d the velocity deficit in the wake of the cylinder gradually decreases with an increase in downstream distance for all four cases this is quite natural as the wake spreads downstream due to diffusion and entrains fluid from the free stream lateral sides of the domain into the wake as a result of which the total momentum deficit decreases on the plane y 0 7 d the velocity deficit is found to be maximum for k 0 and minimum for k 0 075 suggesting a stronger wake for k 0 owing to the local reynolds number the velocity profile at x 2 d fig 14 g shows a negative velocity for k 0 suggesting the presence of a reverse flow zone in the near wake as we move away from the bottom surface towards the cylinder top the velocity deficit in the near wake zone gradually increases for k 0 025 fig 14 d a the increase in velocity deficit is attributed to a stronger wake due to the increase in reynolds number owing to the sheared inlet velocity profile for k 0 025 the velocity deficit decreases near the free end away from the recirculation zone as fluid is entrained from the top of the cylinder to the wake zone due to stronger downwash flow in general the lateral distribution of the streamwise velocity profile at various spanwise and streamwise locations is plotted in fig 14 it shows a velocity minimum at the center z 0 d except a few locations where two symmetrically positioned points away from the center plane show the velocity minimum this happens most probably due to the entrainment of fluid into the center of the wake zone the entrainment of fluid is mostly associated with the streamwise vortices induced flow see fig 13 which is very strong near the free end of the cylinder hence the velocity profiles distribution on the plane near the free end of the cylinder i e y 6 3 d shows the velocity minimum away from the center line the transverse variation of time averaged lateral velocity components at three different spanwise and streamwise locations are shown in fig 15 the velocity field in the wake of a wall mounted cylinder is highly three dimensional and depends strongly upon the upwash and downwash phenomenon therefore the type of lateral entrainment negative or positive that the wake experiences at different spanwise and axial locations are predicted by the transverse velocity magnitude which depends on both upwash and downwash flow a negative transverse velocity to the left of the symmetry plane and a positive transverse velocity to the symmetry plane s right indicates negative entrainment of flow the distribution of lateral velocity component close to the bottom wall is shown in fig 15 g h i from the plot in fig 15 g it is observed that close to the symmetry plane positive entrainment is encountered away from it negative entrainment of flow is observed this is mostly due to the strong three dimensional nature of the upwash and downwash flow around the cylinder wake for k 0 025 the positive entrainment close to the symmetry plane is largely due to an upwash flow induced by the initiation of the counter rotating vortex pair that grows downstream of the wake and forms a dipole type wake whereas for k 0 025 the positive entrainment near the symmetry plane is due to the downwash flow associated with the initiation of two pairs of counter rotating streamwise vortices which develop into a quadrupole type streamwise vorticity similar observations were also made in the near wake zone at the mid span of the cylinder fig 15 d but away from the bottom wall close to the free end fig 15 a only positive entrainment of flow is observed with the strength being much higher except for k 0 075 mostly due to the presence of downwash flow from the zone above the cylinder free end and upwash flow induced due to the initiation of streamwise vortices fig 15 h and i show the distribution away from the near wake and it is observed that negative entrainment largely dominates the flow for k 0 050 in contrast positive entrainment dominates the flow for k 0 075 away from the near wake the flow near the free end of the cylinder fig 15 b and c always shows positive entrainment of flow for all the cases of the shear parameter k in the form of a pair of counter rotating streamwise vortices seen near the free end induces an inward motion of fluid into the center wake the flow near the midspan of the cylinder away from the near wake fig 15 e and f experiences positive entrainment for k 0 and negative entrainment for k 0 4 2 5 comparison of integral quantities the effect of shear strength k on the integral quantities like strouhal number s t time mean drag coefficient c d the rms drag coefficient c d r m s and the rms lift coefficient c l r m s is discussed in this section due to the lack of available reference data for direct comparison a qualitative comparison of the integral quantities s t and c d is made with the published findings on the wall mounted finite size square cylinder but only for the shear parameter k 0 table 1 presents the comparison of strouhal number s t and the mean drag coefficient c d reported by various authors for the wall mounted finite length square cylinder a considerable variation in s t and c d in the literature is observed due to variation in aspect ratio ar and reynolds number r e the value of s t and c d from the present study for k 0 seems to be in close agreement with uffinger et al 2013 as their simulations were performed at similar conditions as the present study in terms of aspect ratio and reynolds number the comparison of the strouhal number s t for various shear strength parameters k is tabulated in table 2 it should be noted that the s t calculated from the fluctuating lift force acting on the cylinder fig 6 is found to be the same as the s t calculated from the fluctuating velocity field the variation of s t along the height of the cylinder is already presented in section 3 for k 0 and k 0 075 fig 4 table 2 shows that the s t value decreases with the increase in the shear parameter k this may be attributed to the increase in the reverse flow zone close to the free end of the cylinder with the increase in k the flow model for wall mounted finite size square cylinder suggests that the wake is characterized by a single vortical coherent structure where the base vortices tip vortices and spanwise vortices are part of this single vortical coherent structure wang and zhou 2009 hosseini et al 2013 bourgeois et al 2011 consequently although the recirculation length varies throughout the height of the cylinder the strouhal number remains constant similar to s t the time mean drag coefficient c d is found to decrease monotonically with an increase in the shear parameter k the friction drag contribution to the total drag coefficient was negligible compared to the pressure drag coefficient due to the high reynolds number associated with the flow the front face of the cylinder is found to be subjected to higher pressure drag force because it being the leading face that causes the stagnation of flow the rear face of the cylinder also seems to contribute significantly though less than the front face to the drag coefficient and is related to the strong base suction caused by the separated flow the decrease in the mean drag coefficient c d is due to the decrease in the total pressure force acting on the leading face of the cylinder the distribution of sectional drag coefficient is plotted in fig 16 fig 16 shows that for all the cases of shear parameter k the sectional drag coefficient varies across the height of the cylinder the variation of the sectional drag coefficient is primarily due to the variation of the pressure force across the front face of the cylinder it is also to be noted that the sectional drag coefficient increases across the height of the cylinder and close to the free end of the cylinder the value decreases the decrease in the value of the sectional drag coefficient near the free end of the cylinder is attributed to the lower pressure force near the free end than the rest of the cylinder height this is obvious because the low pressure near the free end of the cylinder causes the flow to deflect over the top surface of the cylinder ind addition table 2 reveals that similar to the mean drag coefficient the rms drag coefficient c d r m s also decreases monotonically with shear parameter k however the magnitude of the rms lift coefficient c l r m s is found to increase with the increase in shear parameter with k 0 075 being the exception where the value decreases 4 2 6 second order flow statistics fig 17 compares the spatial distribution of the resolved turbulent kinetic energy k 1 2 u i u i on the symmetry plane z 0 d for different shear parameters k hereafter the resolved turbulent kinetic energy is only referred to as turbulent kinetic energy tke in the paper from fig 17 it is clear that the highest tke levels are concentrated in the immediate near wake region of the cylinder due to the higher normal stresses in the near wake compared to the regions away from it as seen in fig 17 a in comparison with other shear cases the case with k 0 shows higher tke levels in the separating shear layer present above the free end of the cylinder fig 17 further shows that with the increase in shear parameter k the streamwise extent of the highest tke levels decreases this is because the streamwise extent beyond which the spanwise shedding vortices loses their strength and spreads due to diffusion decreases with an increase in the shear parameter further within the wake s recirculation zone the tke is found to be less than the highest tke in the flow field because the separating shear layers from the cylinder side walls lack mutual interaction with each other in this region however as the separating shear layers start interacting with each other away from the cylinder recirculation region the tke increases due to mutual momentum transfer among the separating shear layers to further investigate the effect of shear parameter on turbulence statistics fig 18 compares the profiles of reynolds normal stresses along the span of the cylinder as seen in fig 18 for all the cases the magnitude of w w is found to be significantly larger than the other components of reynolds normal stresses except near to the free end therefore one can conclude that among all the components of reynolds normal stresses w w makes the highest contribution to the tke for all the shear parameters the higher magnitude of w w compared to other normal stresses is due to the shedding of vortices that involves strong transverse fluctuations closer to the free end of the cylinder v v also becomes significantly higher due to strong downwash flow it is also observed that the reynolds normal stresses decrease gradually as the wake vortices lose their strength due to diffusion not shown here along with the downstream of the wake compared to the reynolds normal stress components the reynolds shear stress components are observed to be quite small not shown here along the span of cylinder except close to the free end region of the cylinder near the free end of the cylinder the reynolds shear stress component u v is found to be significant due to the associated downwash flow 5 conclusions a large eddy simulation was carried out in the present study to investigate the effect of incoming shear flow of four distinct shear strengths on the wake behind a surface mounted finite length square cylinder at r e 10 000 the wake behavior under the four different flow conditions are analyzed the main results obtained are summarized as follows 1 both anti symmetric and intermittently symmetric shedding patterns in wake of the cylinder have been observed it is also seen that with the increase in shear parameter k the extent of region from the bottom wall increases within which the anti symmetric mode of shedding is seen to persist therefore the incoming flow shear strength seems to have significant effect on the modes of the shedding 2 the region of domination of upwash flow gradually increases with the increase in shear parameter k but the strength of downwash flow from the free end of the cylinder is found to decrease with increase in shear parameter k 3 the reverse flow region becomes strongly three dimensional with shorter region near the bottom wall compared to the free end region the difference between two ends is seen to increase with increasing shear parameters 4 the mean streamwise wake shows a dipole type wake at k 0 0 and 0 025 while at higher shear parameter k 0 050 and 0 075 a quadrupole wake is observed 5 the time averaged drag coefficient c d and rms drag coefficient c d r m s are both found to decrease monotonically with increase in shear parameter k 6 the tke associated with the cylinder wake is found have its major contribution from the transverse component of normal stress for all the cases of

institute of technology kanpur for providing the high performance computational facilities for carrying out the simulations appendix grid grid independent and domain independent test as shown earlier in fig 3 a nonuniform grid system is used in the present investigation the nonuniform grids in all three directions are created by clustering grid points near all the solid surfaces it is to be noted that the grids are refined substantially in the region having higher velocity gradient such as wake and near wall regions in contrast moderate refining of grids is carried out in the region of the low velocity gradient the minimum grid spacing near the solid surfaces is kept as 0 005 d and the cells are then stretched with a maximum stretching ratio of 1 2 in each direction the nonuniform grid distribution in the three directions is shown in fig 19 in the vertical direction across the span of the cylinder the grids are distributed such that close to the bottom wall and near to the free end of the cylinder very fine nonuniform grid is generated but away from them a uniform grid of size 0 055 d is employed similarly the maximum grid size at the center of the cylinder in the x direction and z direction is seemed to be as big as 0 04 d far away from the cylinder surface a larger grid size is maintained as shown in fig 19 it is important to demonstrate that the computational results are independent of both grid size and physical domain therefore a grid independence study is performed using three different grid sizes namely 232 170 154 coarse 277 218 206 intermediate and 317 274 250 fine for the computational domain shown in fig 1 the minimum grid spacing near the solid walls for the three different grid sizes i e coarse medium and fine are chosen to be 0 0065 d 0 005 d and 0 0035 d respectively details of the grid independent study are shown by plotting the distribution of time mean streamwise velocity recovery along the centerline and the transverse variation of the time averaged normal stress component u u at the axial position x 3 d on the spanwise plane y 1 d fig 20 a and b for the three grids it is noticed that the forecasts by the intermediate and finest grid have a good match for the time average centerline velocity the average percentage difference between the coarser mesh and the intermediate mesh is found to be 2 8 while that between intermediate and fine mesh is found to be only 0 83 the dependency of the grid on global parameters like mean drag coefficient c d and rms lift coefficient c l r m s are compared in the present study the mean drag coefficient c d and the rms lift coefficient c l r m s is given in table 3 for the different grid size used in the study it is observed that the mean drag coefficient shows a percentage change of 3 92 between the coarse and the intermediate grid and a percentage change of 2 61 between the fine and the intermediate grid like the mean drag coefficient the rms lift coefficient also shows that the percentage difference between the coarse and medium grid is 5 05 while the fine and medium grid is 3 69 given the variations of the time averaged velocity field stress field mean drag coefficient and rms lift coefficient for the different mesh sizes all the computations have been carried out using a mesh of size 277 218 206 for wall bounded flow fröhlich and rodi 2002 suggested that the grid resolution with δ y 2 is good enough to simulate turbulent boundary layer attached motion using les the δ x δ y and δ z reported here are the wall coordinate values of the first cell of all solid surfaces in the wall normal direction respectively the wall coordinate values of the first cell on the front and rear face of the cylinder respectively are represented as δ x similarly the wall coordinate values of the first cell on the transverse face of the cylinder are represented as δ z the wall coordinate values of the first cell on the top surface of the cylinder are represented as δ y in the present study the chosen grid after the grid independent study used for all the simulations has the resolution δ x 0 10 3 8 δ y 0 08 1 97 and δ z 0 10 2 6 which is found to be in good agreement with the values reported in the open literature the flow field dependency on the domain height in the vertical direction is also tested in the present study where two different vertical heights h 16 d and 20 d are considered the original grid used for simulation i e the intermediate grid was used where only the grid in the vertical direction was reduced in number to reduce the domain size from 20 d to 16 d without altering the grid distribution in any other region of the computational domain the mean drag coefficient or rms lift coefficient for the two heights showed no difference in the values also the distribution of the time mean streamwise velocity profile along the transverse direction is plotted for the two vertical heights in fig 21 the comparison shows a good match between the two vertical heights though the domain independent study reveals that a domain height of 16 d is good enough to perform the simulations a domain height of 20 d has been chosen
