5390,wrf hydro weather research and forecasting model hydrological modeling system as the core engine of the united states national water model nwm has now been used in many hydrometeorological applications throughout the world one important feature that wrf hydro introduced is to allow infiltration excess ponded water for subsequent lateral re distribution and soil re infiltration which is a major enhancement in terms of physical realism nonetheless how well wrf hydro models re infiltration is largely unknown because this process is difficult to be directly measured to gain an in depth understanding of re infiltration process under different hydrometeorological geographical conditions with model parameter settings we start conducting a series of idealized numerical experiments using 18 watersheds in north central texas as a testbed next the model is automatically calibrated to best quantify re infiltration amounts during two major storms 2010 tropical storm hermine and 2015 may event which is accomplished by coupling the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm with wrf hydro to achieve optimal calibration efficiency the results show that re infiltration has quite substantial impacts on streamflow simulation in wrf hydro especially for areas with flat terrains and soils with high clay content among all examined factors precipitation saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and runoff partition parameter refkdt are found to impose relatively higher impacts on both re infiltration ratio and runoff coefficient it is also found that the runoff coefficient and the re infiltration ratio are positively correlated based on results from both hypothetical and real events indicating re infiltration effects can become more pronounced as flood potential increases these findings collectively show the significance of representing the re infiltration process in flood forecasting models that do not incorporate this process may be over calibrated to compensate errors originated from the missing process keywords wrf hydro run on re infiltration calibration saturated hydraulic conductivity refkdt runoff coefficient 1 introduction flooding is the most frequent weather hazard that can cause serious fatalities and property damages morrs 2010 deb et al 2018 extreme weather and the impacts of climate change are expected to increase the frequency and severity of flood events globally ipcc 2014 to provide early warnings and improve the emergency response for floods the national water model nwm a continental scale high resolution hydrologic forecasting system for the united states has been brought into operations in august of 2016 noaa 2016 this hydrologic forecasting system simulates discharge for 2 7 million nhdplus national hydrography dataset plus stream reaches and extends the watershed hydrology to continental hydrology maidment 2017 lin et al 2017 the nwm is developed from the community based wrf hydro model gochis et al 2013 an architectural framework which couples the noah land surface model lsm with multi parameterization noah mp niu et al 2011 with atmospheric models and hydrological routing schemes since its operational use in the nwm wrf hydro has been tested and applied in different regions throughout the world for a range of applications in predicting runoff streamflow gochis et al 2015 senatore et al 2015 floods yucel et al 2015 lin et al 2018a lin et al 2018b and land atmosphere feedbacks arnault et al 2015 while the enclosed noah and noah mp components simulate the one dimensional 1 d soil vegetation atmosphere interactions between surface and atmosphere gochis and chen 2003 wrf hydro further extends the calculation of the surface overland flow saturated subsurface flow channel routing and baseflow processes on a 2 d gridded planar surface gochis et al 2013 prior to being transformed to overland flow surface runoff in wrf hydro is described as infiltration excess while subsurface runoff is the vertical drainage accumulated at the bottom of the soil column other hydrological components which are not the focus of this study include throughfall direct soil evaporation transpiration re evaporation of precipitation intercepted by the canopy vertical soil water movement and a simple lake reservoir routing scheme ek et al 2003 in this study we are particularly interested in one major enhancement that wrf hydro introduces which is to allow the infiltration excess to remain as ponded water for subsequent lateral re distribution in combination with precipitation in the following model time step yucel et al 2015 when ponded water starts to move downslope as overland flow an important process previously known as the run on effect smith and hebbert 1979 will occur the run on process can be defined as the surface water running from the upstream areas on downslope areas where moisture deficit has not yet been satisfied corradini et al 1998 nahar et al 2004 in addition to the direct infiltration caused by rainfall runoff process in the vertical direction this run on process can also be viewed as re infiltration due to the runoff re distribution g√ºntner and bronstert 2004 hereafter we use the word re infiltration to refer to this process for simplicity previous studies using field numerical experiments have observed that re infiltration can cause a decrease in unit area runoff as watershed size increases yair and kossovsky 2002 yair and raz yassif 2004 gomi et al 2008 heras et al 2010 woolhiser et al 1996 conducted numerical experiments and found that re infiltration has a major impact on runoff peaks volumes and time to peak as saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat increases downslope nahar et al 2004 examined the role of run on process on field scale infiltration and one dimensional overland flow using analytical models and monte carlo simulations they found that field scale mean of infiltration would increase in the presence of run on which in turn affects the hydrograph corradini et al 1998 2002 suggests the re infiltration process cannot be disregarded especially when the spatial randomness of soil properties is taken into account in hydrologic modeling as it produces a significant decrease in overland flow as an influencing factor to the re infiltration process ksat has been the focal point in numerous previous studies investigating its heterogeneous effect on this process e g smith and hebbert 1979 saghafian et al 1995 woolhiser et al 1996 nahar et al 2004 saghafian et al 1995 solved the diffusive wave equations and green ampt infiltration equation to examine the impacts of ksat spatial variability where they concluded strong sensitivity of runoff volume and peak to this parameter corradini et al 1998 2002 evaluated run on effects under conditions of horizontal heterogeneity of ksat using a model with kinematic wave approximation and conceptual infiltration approach where they found the level of spatial correlation in ksat is less important when the overland flow volume was appreciable nahar et al 2004 found re infiltration is less important when the ratio of rainfall intensity to ksat is large besides ksat and precipitation other hydrometeorological and geographic conditions such as soil moisture saturation degree terrain slope as influencing factors to re infiltration have been largely understudied as powerful remote sensors and computers became available hydrologic community developed complex distributed models that can represent the dominant hydrological processes and their interactions e g rigon et al 2006 qu and duffy 2007 lawrence et al 2011 niu et al 2011 like wrf hydro many incorporate re infiltration processes e g dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 tethys chloris fatichi et al 2012 ech2o maneta and silverman 2013 however wrf hydro has the option to disable re infiltration function which enables us to conduct numerical experiments with without re infiltration moreover as a community model wrf hydro is a platform for all users to share insights on hydrologic processes the improved understanding in the wrf hydro framework promises to enhance the performance of the national water model therefore we are motivated to comprehensively investigate the role of re infiltration with regard to streamflow simulation by leveraging wrf hydro as the ideal modeling platform in this paper the authors seek to systematically answer the following questions 1 how do different hydrometeorological conditions such as the intensity of precipitation soil moisture levels affect re infiltration 2 how do different geographic conditions such as digital elevation model dem terrain slope roughness soil type influence re infiltration 3 how do model parameters impact the re infiltration process 4 what is the role of re infiltration in real storm events and how important is it the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methodology in detail including the study area model configurations simulations and calibrations the results with discussions are presented in section 3 section 4 provides the conclusions and insights gained from this study 2 methodology 2 1 study area and model configurations the upper trinity river basin utrb is located in the north central texas with 16 602 km2 undeveloped portion of the land constitutes a large percentage of utrb fig 1 a which makes infiltration loss a vital component in the regional hydrologic cycle moreover sitting in a region of temperate mean climatological conditions usace 2013 utrb experiences occasional extremes of temperature and precipitation with relatively short duration the complexity of infiltration process and climate variability imposes challenges to water resources engineering practices like flow frequency analysis and flood forecasting fig 1 b shows the configuration of domain with digital elevation model dem and the locations of usgs stream gauges with corresponding contribution areas the complete description of the wrf hydro system version 5 0 can be found in gochis et al 2018 while the noah mp lsm provides several physical parameterizations the same surface runoff option free drainage adopted by the nwm is used where vertical surface runoff is calculated as excess water after precipitation supply infiltrates into the soil schaake et al 1996 within soil column 2 m deep richards equation is deployed for infiltration of four layers which have the thicknesses of 10 30 60 and 100 cm respectively other hydrological processes are described in niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 cai et al 2014 and zheng and yang 2016 a fully unsteady explicit diffusive wave formulation julien et al 1995 ogden 1997 with steepest descent approach is deployed to solve overland flow routing subsurface lateral flow is calculated prior to overland flow which allows exfiltration from fully saturated grid cells to be added to the infiltration excess calculated from the lsm senatore et al 2015 gochis et al 2018 in order to represent overland and subsurface flow processes on higher spatial resolution the subgrid disaggregation aggregation routines are used right after the main lsm loop and before the surface subsurface routing loop details are described in gochis and chen 2003 this study uses 1 km in total 159 259 grid cells and 100 m resolution for the lsm and hydrologic routing grids respectively with an aggregation factor of 10 channel routing is solved using a variable parameter muskingum cunge mc method see gochis et al 2018 for channel shape parameters used to allow for the flexibility to dismiss the re infiltration process and simplify the use of related parameters terrain routing can be turned off in wrf hydro as a namelist switching feature physically the terrain on and terrain off scenarios in the model are illustrated in fig 2 in terrain on case left water available for infiltration includes both precipitation and overland surface runoff from upslope areas while in terrain off scenario right infiltration is caused by precipitation alone hereafter this process is referred as local infiltration corradini et al 1998 to be differentiated from re infiltration with re infiltration switched off any infiltration excess is routed downstream without having chance to re enter the soil columns meaning local infiltration only while the terrain on scenario includes both local infiltration and re infiltration switching on off of this setting in wrf hydro allows us to perform a series of experiments to investigate and quantify re infiltration 2 2 model experiments we first conduct a series of idealized modeling experiments under different hydrometeorological geographical conditions and model parameters before each model run a 1 5 month spin up is conducted to achieve model equilibrium states which is considered appropriate for flood simulations with thin soils in texas lin et al 2018a lin et al 2018b except for the experiments focusing on precipitation other experiments all use 50 8 mm 2 in precipitation with 1 h duration the amount of precipitation is chosen because it is approximately equivalent to a five year storm as outlined in north central texas council of government integrated stormwater management technical hydrology manual nctcog iswm 2010 other forcing variables incoming shortwave and longwave radiation specific humidity air temperature surface pressure and near surface u and v wind are set to reflect idealized conditions which have either constant values in space and time or a fixed diurnal cycle gochis et al 2018 the detailed forcing information can be found in table 1 for each experiment we conduct a 48 h model run to ensure adequate time for water to flow from upstream to the outlet in total we conduct 9 sets of idealized modeling experiments with 150 runs 2 2 1 hydrometeorological conditions table 2 shows the experimental design for varying input precipitation values and initial soil moisture the precipitation is applied for a 1 h duration during the first hour of simulation with a total amount of 12 7 mm 0 5 in to 127 mm 5 in and the same precipitation is uniformly spread for the entire study area precipitation amount with 127 mm 5 in is approximately equivalent to a 500 year storm in the study region which is set as the upper limit to cover all possible precipitation scenarios for initial soil moisture different saturation levels are applied to the top three soil layers 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm based on each grid cell s soil type at the start of each model simulation changing the saturation of the fourth layer 100 200 cm is not included because saturating the fourth layer will lead to unrealistically high runoff amount not shown here due to the fact that texas is dominated by thin soils with less than 1 m furl et al 2018 lin et al 2018a therefore it would be physically unreasonable to investigate the model sensitivity to the saturation level in the fourth soil layer 2 2 2 geographical conditions the experimental design for varying terrain slope and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat is shown in table 3 terrain slope is modified by changing the digital elevation model dem underlying the model simulation the terrain slope of study basins ranges from 0 31 to 1 12 with an average of 0 64 and different multipliers were applied to change the terrain slope various multiplication factors are also uniformly applied for ksat in each grid cell 2 2 3 model parameters five empirical model parameters are selected for sensitivity analyses based on literature review senatore et al 2015 yucel et al 2015 silver et al 2017 kerandi et al 2018 which includes refkdt retdeprtfac lksatfac ovroughrtfac and slope these five parameters are unitless often with no interpretable physical meaning and are suggested to be adjusted through model calibration even in a physically based model like wrf hydro these physically insignificant parameters are also unavoidable which is resulted from our inability to model all processes wagener and montanari 2011 hampering our understanding on other physically based process components therefore these parameters are carefully studied here refkdt k dtref is a constant parameter used with refdk k ref which corresponds to the saturation hydraulic conductivity for silty clay loam niu 2011 documented that refkdt can significantly influence surface infiltration and partition of total runoff into surface and subsurface runoff where increasing refkdt leads to decrease in surface runoff schaake et al 1996 niu 2011 the equation involving refkdt k dtref is 1 k dt k dtref k sat k ref where k sat is saturated hydraulic conductivity k ref is saturated hydraulic conductivity for silty clay loam and k dt is a constant for calculating the maximum soil infiltration rate i max 2 i max p d tot 1 e k dt Œ¥ t p d tot 1 e k dt Œ¥ t Œ¥ t where p is the effective precipitation intensity d tot is the total soil water depth m and Œ¥ t is the duration of time step retdeprtfac lksatfac and ovroughrtfac are multipliers for surface retention depth lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity and overland roughness respectively slope is a coefficient for deep drainage they have been documented in previous studies as sensitive parameters for runoff simulation thus are chosen in this study table 4 shows the experiment values for the model parameters the default values of these parameters are globally uniform the experiments are conducted by varying one parameter while keeping the others as default values it should be noted that default parameters are the same as those used in the operational nwm compared to other random parameter sets they can reveal how wrf hydro would behave due to change of a single parameter or input which will provide benefits of improving nwm s performance in the study region in addition the experiments are helpful to common users of wrf hydro who would use these default parameter values as a starting point in hydrologic simulations 2 3 real case simulation and calibration wrf hydro is configured in an offline mode hydro components do not feedback to wrf for two real case simulations 2010 tropical storm hermine sep 8th 2010 and 2015 may storm may 28th 2015 to ensure adequate spin up time the model is initialized on july 1st 2010 and april 1st 2015 respectively leaving about 1 5 2 months for model to spin up the soil in texas is relatively thin up to 40 cm to 60 cm lin et al 2018a furl et al 2018 so 1 5 2 months spin up is considered appropriate for flood simulations using wrf hydro the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 forcing variables and the national centers for environmental prediction ncep quality controlled stage iv precipitation estimates are utilized as the input meteorological forcings fig 3 shows the spatial pattern of cumulative precipitation amounts for these two storm events by 4 km stage iv product to obtain the best estimates of the local infiltration and re infiltration amounts during the selected storm events wrf hydro is calibrated with terrain routing for 18 usgs stream gauges fig 1 b we utilize the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 for calibrations because it was demonstrated to be suitable for computationally expensive and spatially distributed models compared to other algorithms dds converges faster and can reach good global solutions within certain iterations tolson and shoemaker 2007 in a nutshell dds starts from a global search then switches to a more local search by dynamically adjusting the dimension of parameters the adjustment from global to local search is achieved by dynamically and probabilistically reducing the number of dimensions in the neighborhood tolson and shoemaker 2007 to further expedite calibration the simulation domain is reconfigured such that it is tailored to the 18 contributing basins towards all evaluation usgs gauges the reduced simulation domain significantly shortens runtime per iteration which allows us to assign a relatively large iteration number for improving calibration results lespinas et al 2018 presents that the improvements in minimizing objective function using dds are notable between 100 and 500 iterations and relatively moderate after 500 iterations in terms of the objective function root mean square error rmse indicates the magnitude of errors streamflow difference in time series between the simulated and observed hydrographs gupta et al 2009 based on the recommended information from previous studies 500 iterations of dds are used in the calibration with an objective function to minimize rmse 2 4 hydrologic metrics 2 4 1 re infiltration calculation re infiltration amount is not a direct output from wrf hydro but can be estimated by subtracting local infiltration value from total infiltration value eq 3 3 re infiltration mm total infiltration mm local infiltration mm based on the principle of water balance and considering negligible evapotranspiration during intense storm events total infiltration can be calculated by subtracting runoff volume from precipitation amount in terrain on simulation local infiltration can be calculated by subtracting runoff volume from precipitation amount in terrain off scenario it should be noted that this relationship is not hard coded into any part of wrf hydro thus the re infiltration is not calculated as residual of total infiltration subtracting local infiltration in the model this is simply a way to interpret the total infiltration as a composite effect of two processes local and re infiltration re infiltration ratio is defined as re infiltration amount divided by total infiltration in some occasions re infiltration ratio can be greater than one and this is interpreted as surface exfiltration occurring from saturated soil columns gochis et al 2018 2 4 2 runoff coefficient runoff coefficient has been widely used in hydrologic practices ranging from flood frequency analyses e g gottschalk and weingartner 1998 sivapalan et al 2005 to flood forecasting e g borga et al 2011 for a given storm event runoff coefficient is defined as the portion of precipitation that becomes direct runoff higher lower runoff coefficient indicates more less flood proneness and it is used to understand its relationship with re infiltration ratio 2 4 3 calibration statistics four statistics are used to evaluate the streamflow simulation results including pearson correlation coefficient cc nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and normalized bias nbias eqs 4 7 4 cc cov q obs q mod œÉ obs œÉ mod 5 nse 1 i 1 n q mod i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 6 rmse i 1 n q mod i q obs i 2 n 7 nbias i 1 n q mod i q obs i i 1 n q obs i where qmod and qobs denote the simulation and observation values cov is the covariance œÉ obs and œÉ mod represent standard deviation of the simulation and observation i 1 n means to sum up each time step from i 1 to n and n is the number of time steps each of these metrics is interpreted differently to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the model performance cc eq 4 measures how strong a co varying relationship is between the modeled results and the observation which cannot be used to assess model biases nse eq 5 and rmse eq 6 are two most commonly used criteria in hydrological evaluations and they measure both the variability of time series and the magnitude of errors gupta et al 2009 nse normalizes the squared model error using the variance of the observed data and thus a value of zero suggests that the model is only as good as the mean observed data while nse 1 suggests perfect model simulation and negative values indicate that the observation mean is a better predictor than the model gupta and kling 2011 nbias eq 7 is calculated to identify both the magnitude and the sign of errors as normalized by the mean of the observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 idealized numerical experiments fig 4 a shows the range interquartile range and median value of total infiltration at varying precipitation intensities the range shows the variability among 18 gauges across the study domain as the precipitation intensity becomes greater the median of total infiltration first increases rapidly and then becomes steady because the precipitation input is only applied at the first hour of the simulation so precipitation intensity is interchangeably used below as precipitation amount the one to one line in fig 4 a represents the situation where 100 of precipitation is infiltrated for lower precipitation intensities less than 25 4 mm hr precipitation in all tested catchments is completely infiltrated indicated by the total infiltration values aligning with the reference line for greater precipitation intensities variation in the catchments total infiltration starts to emerge as indicated by the increased range and interquartile range this is related to the combination of antecedent soil moisture soil properties geographical factors in various catchments starts to exhibit differences within increasing precipitation intensity nonetheless soils in some catchments still take in most of the precipitation even at high precipitation intensities as indicated by the upper limit of total infiltration values similar to fig 4 a fig 4 b and 4c show the same statistics range interquartile range and median value of local and re infiltration for various precipitation intensities in fig 4 b it is counterintuitive for some local infiltration values to get below zero which means that exfiltration occurred and runoff is thus greater than precipitation under the corresponding precipitation intensity and the terrain off routing option according to our approach of calculating re infiltration section 2 4 1 the exfiltration condition causes the corresponding re infiltration to be greater than total infiltration same as the case of total infiltration greater precipitation intensities give rise to variations or more precisely heterogeneities among the catchments in local and re infiltration processes fig 5 a to 5c show total infiltration local infiltration and re infiltration values at various saturation levels of initial soil moisture in the first soil layer 0 10 cm similarly fig 5 d to 5f and 5g to 5i show the trends of total local and re infiltration in the second 10 40 cm and third 40 100 cm soil layers respectively it can be found that in all three soil layers as initial soil moisture gets closer to saturation total infiltration and local infiltration both slowly decrease while re infiltration slightly increases this behavior of re infiltration seems counterintuitive because one may expect soil layers of higher saturation levels would result in smaller amount of re infiltration due to decreased soil storage for water to go in however it has to be understood that re infiltration is simulated as a secondary process to local infiltration where water routed from upstream cells being added to the excess runoff and then infiltrating higher antecedent soil moisture means decreased local infiltration which leaves more water available for going downstream over the hillslopes and re infiltrating subsequently overall local infiltration is still the dominant pathway for infiltration while re infiltration is a secondary effect it is also found that all three types of infiltration are most sensitive to change of soil moisture in the third layer of soil possibly because of its greater thickness storage compared to the upper two soil layers fig 6 a to 6c show the total infiltration local infiltration and re infiltration values at various terrain slope levels respectively while local infiltration is generally unaffected by terrain slope the total and re infiltration both first decrease and then become stable as terrain becomes steeper note that local infiltration is calculated by only considering water transfer in the vertical columns of soil plant and atmosphere in the noah mp lsm thus it does not change as terrain slope changes in comparison re infiltration is an augmented module by wrf hydro to describe the water loss during lateral water transfer pathways therefore it can be influenced by terrain slope and thereby further influencing total infiltration amount these results suggest that by neglecting re infiltration the effect of terrain slope on total infiltration may be underestimated this is especially important to study domains with lower terrain slopes the most obvious differences are seen for terrain slopes with smaller multipliers less than 5 for steeper terrain slope ranges multiplier greater than 5 faster overland flow rate is expected and therefore it gives less chance for water to re infiltrate which explains why limited effect is seen in steeper terrain slope conditions in addition to the above we also found that the ranges and interquartile ranges of the three types of infiltration are almost constant with varying terrain slopes across gauges this is in contrast with fig 4 and fig 5 where the ranges are generally larger indicating little interaction between terrain slope and other factors in affecting infiltration processes fig 7 a c show the trends of total local and re infiltration as saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat changes respectively first local infiltration is found to increase with greater ksat because soil with higher ksat is easier for water to pass through re infiltration decreases with higher ksat while total infiltration first increases rapidly and then becomes stable the reason is that higher ksat leads the majority of water to infiltrate locally leaving less water to be re distributed to downstream areas where re infiltration occurs in other words water has a higher tendency or priority to infiltrate locally than re infiltrate somewhere downstream this finding is consistent with niu et al 2014 that larger ksat facilitates surface water to infiltrate into deeper soils by gravity instead of flowing laterally however for soils with smaller ksat precipitation rate can readily exceed infiltration rate which leaves more surface water for re distribution and re infiltration in addition for the three types of infiltration the variation among tested catchments all decreases with greater ksat values as indicated by the decrease in the ranges as ksat increases precipitation in any catchment is more likely to fully infiltrate via either local infiltration or re infiltration or both in essence precipitation intensity as the upper limit of infiltration rate interacts with ksat in affecting infiltration processes after testing five model parameters retdeprtfac lksatfac slope refkdt and ovroughrtfac we found that infiltration processes are only sensitive to refkdt and ovroughrtfac as shown in figs 8 and 9 note that the refkdt essentially controls the partition between surface and subsurface runoff and greater refkdt means less more surface subsurface runoff such an effect is evident in fig 8 b where local infiltration increases with greater refkdt which is also consistent with findings from previous studies schaake et al 1996 niu 2011 contrary to local infiltration re filtration decreases with greater refkdt as seen previously in figs 5 and 7 re infiltration appears to be a secondary route for water to transfer into subsurface than local infiltration the increasing trend of total infiltration flattens when refkdt exceeds 3 ranging from 0 5 to 5 due to the complete infiltration of precipitation this is very similar to the case shown in fig 9 a greater ovroughrtfac slows down the water transfer over hillslopes and retains the runoff for infiltration to the point where 100 of precipitation seeps into soils in fig 9 b and 9c it is found that local infiltration is not affected by the ovroughrtfac values while re infiltration first increases rapidly and then slowly with greater ovroughrtfac the reason is that rougher surfaces cause slower overland flow rate further giving water more chance to re infiltrate in summary based on the experiments above a common finding is reached as follows local infiltration is a more direct route than re infiltration through which water transfers down into soils under the principle of mass conservation the changes in local and re infiltration due to a single factor can be opposite to each other as seen in the cases of precipitation intensity fig 4 initial soil moisture fig 5 ksat fig 7 and refkdt fig 8 more less water infiltrating locally means less more water to re distribute to downstream cells and re infiltrate such observation makes more sense when variations of the three types of infiltration are examined figs 7 and 8 among tested catchments as the factor ksat or refkdt increases total infiltration become less varied among the 18 catchments while variation of local and re infiltration remains steady the common explanation is that the increasing factor causes precipitation to fully infiltrate in many catchments via both local and re infiltration thus yielding the decreasing variation of total infiltration and in these catchments where total infiltration is constrained local and re infiltration yield the same sum though each bearing considerable variations among different catchments when a factor only affects water transfer over the hillslopes instead of vertically re infiltration changes independently from local infiltration as seen in fig 6 and fig 9 the experiments also highlight the factors that can lead to increased re infiltration while having no effect on or decreasing local infiltration for instance mild terrain slope and lower ksat results in more re infiltration while local infiltration is unaffected or even less figs 6 and 7 these results suggest that re infiltration play an important role in hydrological processes for areas with flat terrain and clayey soils and thus needs to be sufficiently represented in hydrologic simulations in order to better illustrate the portion of re infiltration in total infiltration while assessing its relationship with flood potential re infiltration ratios and the corresponding runoff coefficients are shown in fig 10 a to 10f in fig 10 results from one catchment are plotted as one dotted line in scenarios of varying precipitation intensities fig 10 a initial soil moisture conditions fig 10 b ksat values fig 10 c and refkdt values fig 10 d we can consistently see that re infiltration ratio increases with greater runoff coefficient although with varying terrain slopes fig 10 e and ovroughrtfac values fig 10 f re infiltration ratios show a decreasing trend with a magnitude much smaller than the other cases we further use box plots fig 11 a and 11b to summarize the variance of re infiltration ratios and variance of runoff coefficients in response to changing factors it is found that precipitation ksat and refkdt have higher impact on both re infiltration ratio and runoff coefficient compared to the other factors which confirms our earlier conclusions 3 2 real case simulation and calibration based on the above idealized modeling experiments we choose 6 parameters for model calibration using dds for the real event simulation which includes soil parameter ksat empirical runoff parameter refkdt scale factor of overland roughness ovroughrtfac and channel parameters bottom width btmwdth side slope chslp and manning s roughness n figs 12 and 13 show the comparisons of uncalibrated calibrated and observed hydrographs at different gauge locations for 2010 hermine and 2015 may storm respectively the default parameterization uncalibrated is used to benchmark the calibration results because it represents the current setting in the operational nwm note that there is no available discharge observations at two gauges id 08048800 08056500 during 2010 hermine and thus results from only 16 gauges are plotted in fig 12 after calibration we can see great improvements at most gauges fig 14 summarizes the cc nse rmse and nbias statistics with boxplot our model calibration strategy brings cc and nse much closer to 1 and rmse and nbias much closer to 0 improvement in rmse and nbias indicates that calibration effectively corrected the underestimation of flow rates in the default simulation the much narrower range of all four statistics also suggest that the calibration consistently improves the simulation performances at all tested gauges fig 14 the satisfactory calibration enables us to quantify the re infiltration amount with better assurance during different storm events and covering a wide range of locations which would be otherwise difficult to obtain due to a lack of existing observation techniques to calculate re infiltration in the calibrated simulation another set of terrain off simulations are conducted using the calibrated parameters in order to get values required by eq 3 fig 15 shows the relationship between runoff coefficients and re infiltration ratios from all the testing catchments it can be found that runoff coefficient and re infiltration ratio are positively correlated with the runoff coefficient ranging from 0 to 1 this is consistent with the idealized cases of varying precipitation ksat initial soil moisture and refkdt see fig 10 a to 10d compared to local infiltration re infiltration is simulated in wrf hydro as a secondary process where water routed from upstream cells being added to the runoff excess and then infiltrating however re infiltration can occur at a counter intuitively faster rate than local infiltration cases with re infiltration ratio 50 at basin scale and event scale this is probably due to the faster overland flow rate generated in these cases scenarios with re infiltration ratio being greater than one are noted which possibly indicates that exfiltration would occur under terrain off routing option however these six dots with seemingly unreasonable re infiltration ratio are all from 2015 may event to further investigate the possible reasons behind this we examined the antecedent soil moisture and soil types fig 16 where we found these exfiltration processes are generally occurred in sub basins with two common features i e clayey soils and high antecedent soil moisture 80 saturated in the top layer before our target event in may 2015 several storms occurred in north central texas which have almost saturated the soil lin et al 2018 these soil columns could very easily reach full saturation and thus exfiltration may occur with much water contained in the soil storage without considering the re infiltration process the added amount of runoff from exfiltration would have no chance to enter the soils but to directly become streamflow in the channel should a calibration be conducted under such a circumstance terrain off parameters could be wrongfully adjusted to compensate the missing re infiltration process in wrf hydro 4 conclusions in this study the authors leverage the physically based and distributed wrf hydro modeling framework to comprehensively assess the re infiltration process also referred to as the run on process in literature a process often missing in traditional hydrologic models in particular we investigate the effects of hydrometeorological geographical conditions and model parameters on re infiltration simulations aiming to provide a deeper understanding on re infiltration than existing studies additionally it is the first time that a detailed examination of the re infiltration module in wrf hydro with different parameterization was provided using utrb as the testbed a group of idealized numerical experiments are first conducted to focus on individual factors while holding the others constant the results not only reveal the pattern and magnitude of individual effects but also inform the sensitivities of infiltration to each factor providing guidance for the calibration effort in the subsequent analysis in light of the idealized numerical experiments two real storm events in utrb are simulated and calibrated dominant factors to re infiltration are identified from examining 18 sub basins across the study area during these two events in addition the role of re infiltration is investigated in relation with flood potential indicated by runoff coefficient to show the potential trade offs in modeling re infiltration for flood prediction purposes the main conclusions from this study are summarized as follows 1 compared to local infiltration re infiltration is by nature a secondary process because of the preceding overland routing process however re infiltration can occur at a counter intuitively faster rate than local infiltration cases with re infiltration ratio 50 at basin scale and event scale 2 under the principle of mass conservation the changes in local and re infiltration due to a single factor can be opposite to each other as seen in the cases of precipitation intensity initial soil moisture ksat and refkdt more less water infiltrating locally means less more water to re distribute to downstream cells and re infiltrate 3 the influence of re infiltration on streamflow simulation can be substantial for areas with flat terrain and soil with high clay content re infiltration ratio is 50 4 runoff coefficient and re infiltration ratio are positively correlated indicating that re infiltration effects are more pronounced as flood potential increases and subsequently may be more important in urban than in rural regions for wrf hydro users the insights gained from this study would be helpful for strategically choosing overland routing options based on the study domain s hydro meteorological and graphical conditions given the computational cost for the terrain on option and the complexity in considering related parameters in wrf hydro users could potentially save time and resources while achieving satisfactory simulation results if re infiltration is expected to be less influential for modelers studying hydrology and hydrology atmosphere feedbacks understanding how different factors synergize or counteract with each other to affect re infiltration is rewarding as re infiltration can play an indispensable role in the hydrologic cycle and in feeding back to the atmosphere for instance senatore et al 2015 concluded that accurate representation of re infiltration improves precipitation simulation when fully coupled with wrf suggesting the need to represent this important physical realism in the model for the community of flood emergency responders increasingly detailed and realistic representations of physical processes marks a shift in the paradigm of operational flood forecast from a past that heavily relies on human judgment adjustment towards a computationally expensive but more robust future although re infiltration was found significant for flood prediction in utrb it may prove to be a lesser process elsewhere however it is our emphasis that similar studies are imperative to elucidate the cost for missing or simplifying re infiltration credit authorship contribution statement jiaqi zhang conceptualization data curation

5390,wrf hydro weather research and forecasting model hydrological modeling system as the core engine of the united states national water model nwm has now been used in many hydrometeorological applications throughout the world one important feature that wrf hydro introduced is to allow infiltration excess ponded water for subsequent lateral re distribution and soil re infiltration which is a major enhancement in terms of physical realism nonetheless how well wrf hydro models re infiltration is largely unknown because this process is difficult to be directly measured to gain an in depth understanding of re infiltration process under different hydrometeorological geographical conditions with model parameter settings we start conducting a series of idealized numerical experiments using 18 watersheds in north central texas as a testbed next the model is automatically calibrated to best quantify re infiltration amounts during two major storms 2010 tropical storm hermine and 2015 may event which is accomplished by coupling the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm with wrf hydro to achieve optimal calibration efficiency the results show that re infiltration has quite substantial impacts on streamflow simulation in wrf hydro especially for areas with flat terrains and soils with high clay content among all examined factors precipitation saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and runoff partition parameter refkdt are found to impose relatively higher impacts on both re infiltration ratio and runoff coefficient it is also found that the runoff coefficient and the re infiltration ratio are positively correlated based on results from both hypothetical and real events indicating re infiltration effects can become more pronounced as flood potential increases these findings collectively show the significance of representing the re infiltration process in flood forecasting models that do not incorporate this process may be over calibrated to compensate errors originated from the missing process keywords wrf hydro run on re infiltration calibration saturated hydraulic conductivity refkdt runoff coefficient 1 introduction flooding is the most frequent weather hazard that can cause serious fatalities and property damages morrs 2010 deb et al 2018 extreme weather and the impacts of climate change are expected to increase the frequency and severity of flood events globally ipcc 2014 to provide early warnings and improve the emergency response for floods the national water model nwm a continental scale high resolution hydrologic forecasting system for the united states has been brought into operations in august of 2016 noaa 2016 this hydrologic forecasting system simulates discharge for 2 7 million nhdplus national hydrography dataset plus stream reaches and extends the watershed hydrology to continental hydrology maidment 2017 lin et al 2017 the nwm is developed from the community based wrf hydro model gochis et al 2013 an architectural framework which couples the noah land surface model lsm with multi parameterization noah mp niu et al 2011 with atmospheric models and hydrological routing schemes since its operational use in the nwm wrf hydro has been tested and applied in different regions throughout the world for a range of applications in predicting runoff streamflow gochis et al 2015 senatore et al 2015 floods yucel et al 2015 lin et al 2018a lin et al 2018b and land atmosphere feedbacks arnault et al 2015 while the enclosed noah and noah mp components simulate the one dimensional 1 d soil vegetation atmosphere interactions between surface and atmosphere gochis and chen 2003 wrf hydro further extends the calculation of the surface overland flow saturated subsurface flow channel routing and baseflow processes on a 2 d gridded planar surface gochis et al 2013 prior to being transformed to overland flow surface runoff in wrf hydro is described as infiltration excess while subsurface runoff is the vertical drainage accumulated at the bottom of the soil column other hydrological components which are not the focus of this study include throughfall direct soil evaporation transpiration re evaporation of precipitation intercepted by the canopy vertical soil water movement and a simple lake reservoir routing scheme ek et al 2003 in this study we are particularly interested in one major enhancement that wrf hydro introduces which is to allow the infiltration excess to remain as ponded water for subsequent lateral re distribution in combination with precipitation in the following model time step yucel et al 2015 when ponded water starts to move downslope as overland flow an important process previously known as the run on effect smith and hebbert 1979 will occur the run on process can be defined as the surface water running from the upstream areas on downslope areas where moisture deficit has not yet been satisfied corradini et al 1998 nahar et al 2004 in addition to the direct infiltration caused by rainfall runoff process in the vertical direction this run on process can also be viewed as re infiltration due to the runoff re distribution g√ºntner and bronstert 2004 hereafter we use the word re infiltration to refer to this process for simplicity previous studies using field numerical experiments have observed that re infiltration can cause a decrease in unit area runoff as watershed size increases yair and kossovsky 2002 yair and raz yassif 2004 gomi et al 2008 heras et al 2010 woolhiser et al 1996 conducted numerical experiments and found that re infiltration has a major impact on runoff peaks volumes and time to peak as saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat increases downslope nahar et al 2004 examined the role of run on process on field scale infiltration and one dimensional overland flow using analytical models and monte carlo simulations they found that field scale mean of infiltration would increase in the presence of run on which in turn affects the hydrograph corradini et al 1998 2002 suggests the re infiltration process cannot be disregarded especially when the spatial randomness of soil properties is taken into account in hydrologic modeling as it produces a significant decrease in overland flow as an influencing factor to the re infiltration process ksat has been the focal point in numerous previous studies investigating its heterogeneous effect on this process e g smith and hebbert 1979 saghafian et al 1995 woolhiser et al 1996 nahar et al 2004 saghafian et al 1995 solved the diffusive wave equations and green ampt infiltration equation to examine the impacts of ksat spatial variability where they concluded strong sensitivity of runoff volume and peak to this parameter corradini et al 1998 2002 evaluated run on effects under conditions of horizontal heterogeneity of ksat using a model with kinematic wave approximation and conceptual infiltration approach where they found the level of spatial correlation in ksat is less important when the overland flow volume was appreciable nahar et al 2004 found re infiltration is less important when the ratio of rainfall intensity to ksat is large besides ksat and precipitation other hydrometeorological and geographic conditions such as soil moisture saturation degree terrain slope as influencing factors to re infiltration have been largely understudied as powerful remote sensors and computers became available hydrologic community developed complex distributed models that can represent the dominant hydrological processes and their interactions e g rigon et al 2006 qu and duffy 2007 lawrence et al 2011 niu et al 2011 like wrf hydro many incorporate re infiltration processes e g dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 tethys chloris fatichi et al 2012 ech2o maneta and silverman 2013 however wrf hydro has the option to disable re infiltration function which enables us to conduct numerical experiments with without re infiltration moreover as a community model wrf hydro is a platform for all users to share insights on hydrologic processes the improved understanding in the wrf hydro framework promises to enhance the performance of the national water model therefore we are motivated to comprehensively investigate the role of re infiltration with regard to streamflow simulation by leveraging wrf hydro as the ideal modeling platform in this paper the authors seek to systematically answer the following questions 1 how do different hydrometeorological conditions such as the intensity of precipitation soil moisture levels affect re infiltration 2 how do different geographic conditions such as digital elevation model dem terrain slope roughness soil type influence re infiltration 3 how do model parameters impact the re infiltration process 4 what is the role of re infiltration in real storm events and how important is it the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methodology in detail including the study area model configurations simulations and calibrations the results with discussions are presented in section 3 section 4 provides the conclusions and insights gained from this study 2 methodology 2 1 study area and model configurations the upper trinity river basin utrb is located in the north central texas with 16 602 km2 undeveloped portion of the land constitutes a large percentage of utrb fig 1 a which makes infiltration loss a vital component in the regional hydrologic cycle moreover sitting in a region of temperate mean climatological conditions usace 2013 utrb experiences occasional extremes of temperature and precipitation with relatively short duration the complexity of infiltration process and climate variability imposes challenges to water resources engineering practices like flow frequency analysis and flood forecasting fig 1 b shows the configuration of domain with digital elevation model dem and the locations of usgs stream gauges with corresponding contribution areas the complete description of the wrf hydro system version 5 0 can be found in gochis et al 2018 while the noah mp lsm provides several physical parameterizations the same surface runoff option free drainage adopted by the nwm is used where vertical surface runoff is calculated as excess water after precipitation supply infiltrates into the soil schaake et al 1996 within soil column 2 m deep richards equation is deployed for infiltration of four layers which have the thicknesses of 10 30 60 and 100 cm respectively other hydrological processes are described in niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 cai et al 2014 and zheng and yang 2016 a fully unsteady explicit diffusive wave formulation julien et al 1995 ogden 1997 with steepest descent approach is deployed to solve overland flow routing subsurface lateral flow is calculated prior to overland flow which allows exfiltration from fully saturated grid cells to be added to the infiltration excess calculated from the lsm senatore et al 2015 gochis et al 2018 in order to represent overland and subsurface flow processes on higher spatial resolution the subgrid disaggregation aggregation routines are used right after the main lsm loop and before the surface subsurface routing loop details are described in gochis and chen 2003 this study uses 1 km in total 159 259 grid cells and 100 m resolution for the lsm and hydrologic routing grids respectively with an aggregation factor of 10 channel routing is solved using a variable parameter muskingum cunge mc method see gochis et al 2018 for channel shape parameters used to allow for the flexibility to dismiss the re infiltration process and simplify the use of related parameters terrain routing can be turned off in wrf hydro as a namelist switching feature physically the terrain on and terrain off scenarios in the model are illustrated in fig 2 in terrain on case left water available for infiltration includes both precipitation and overland surface runoff from upslope areas while in terrain off scenario right infiltration is caused by precipitation alone hereafter this process is referred as local infiltration corradini et al 1998 to be differentiated from re infiltration with re infiltration switched off any infiltration excess is routed downstream without having chance to re enter the soil columns meaning local infiltration only while the terrain on scenario includes both local infiltration and re infiltration switching on off of this setting in wrf hydro allows us to perform a series of experiments to investigate and quantify re infiltration 2 2 model experiments we first conduct a series of idealized modeling experiments under different hydrometeorological geographical conditions and model parameters before each model run a 1 5 month spin up is conducted to achieve model equilibrium states which is considered appropriate for flood simulations with thin soils in texas lin et al 2018a lin et al 2018b except for the experiments focusing on precipitation other experiments all use 50 8 mm 2 in precipitation with 1 h duration the amount of precipitation is chosen because it is approximately equivalent to a five year storm as outlined in north central texas council of government integrated stormwater management technical hydrology manual nctcog iswm 2010 other forcing variables incoming shortwave and longwave radiation specific humidity air temperature surface pressure and near surface u and v wind are set to reflect idealized conditions which have either constant values in space and time or a fixed diurnal cycle gochis et al 2018 the detailed forcing information can be found in table 1 for each experiment we conduct a 48 h model run to ensure adequate time for water to flow from upstream to the outlet in total we conduct 9 sets of idealized modeling experiments with 150 runs 2 2 1 hydrometeorological conditions table 2 shows the experimental design for varying input precipitation values and initial soil moisture the precipitation is applied for a 1 h duration during the first hour of simulation with a total amount of 12 7 mm 0 5 in to 127 mm 5 in and the same precipitation is uniformly spread for the entire study area precipitation amount with 127 mm 5 in is approximately equivalent to a 500 year storm in the study region which is set as the upper limit to cover all possible precipitation scenarios for initial soil moisture different saturation levels are applied to the top three soil layers 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm based on each grid cell s soil type at the start of each model simulation changing the saturation of the fourth layer 100 200 cm is not included because saturating the fourth layer will lead to unrealistically high runoff amount not shown here due to the fact that texas is dominated by thin soils with less than 1 m furl et al 2018 lin et al 2018a therefore it would be physically unreasonable to investigate the model sensitivity to the saturation level in the fourth soil layer 2 2 2 geographical conditions the experimental design for varying terrain slope and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat is shown in table 3 terrain slope is modified by changing the digital elevation model dem underlying the model simulation the terrain slope of study basins ranges from 0 31 to 1 12 with an average of 0 64 and different multipliers were applied to change the terrain slope various multiplication factors are also uniformly applied for ksat in each grid cell 2 2 3 model parameters five empirical model parameters are selected for sensitivity analyses based on literature review senatore et al 2015 yucel et al 2015 silver et al 2017 kerandi et al 2018 which includes refkdt retdeprtfac lksatfac ovroughrtfac and slope these five parameters are unitless often with no interpretable physical meaning and are suggested to be adjusted through model calibration even in a physically based model like wrf hydro these physically insignificant parameters are also unavoidable which is resulted from our inability to model all processes wagener and montanari 2011 hampering our understanding on other physically based process components therefore these parameters are carefully studied here refkdt k dtref is a constant parameter used with refdk k ref which corresponds to the saturation hydraulic conductivity for silty clay loam niu 2011 documented that refkdt can significantly influence surface infiltration and partition of total runoff into surface and subsurface runoff where increasing refkdt leads to decrease in surface runoff schaake et al 1996 niu 2011 the equation involving refkdt k dtref is 1 k dt k dtref k sat k ref where k sat is saturated hydraulic conductivity k ref is saturated hydraulic conductivity for silty clay loam and k dt is a constant for calculating the maximum soil infiltration rate i max 2 i max p d tot 1 e k dt Œ¥ t p d tot 1 e k dt Œ¥ t Œ¥ t where p is the effective precipitation intensity d tot is the total soil water depth m and Œ¥ t is the duration of time step retdeprtfac lksatfac and ovroughrtfac are multipliers for surface retention depth lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity and overland roughness respectively slope is a coefficient for deep drainage they have been documented in previous studies as sensitive parameters for runoff simulation thus are chosen in this study table 4 shows the experiment values for the model parameters the default values of these parameters are globally uniform the experiments are conducted by varying one parameter while keeping the others as default values it should be noted that default parameters are the same as those used in the operational nwm compared to other random parameter sets they can reveal how wrf hydro would behave due to change of a single parameter or input which will provide benefits of improving nwm s performance in the study region in addition the experiments are helpful to common users of wrf hydro who would use these default parameter values as a starting point in hydrologic simulations 2 3 real case simulation and calibration wrf hydro is configured in an offline mode hydro components do not feedback to wrf for two real case simulations 2010 tropical storm hermine sep 8th 2010 and 2015 may storm may 28th 2015 to ensure adequate spin up time the model is initialized on july 1st 2010 and april 1st 2015 respectively leaving about 1 5 2 months for model to spin up the soil in texas is relatively thin up to 40 cm to 60 cm lin et al 2018a furl et al 2018 so 1 5 2 months spin up is considered appropriate for flood simulations using wrf hydro the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 forcing variables and the national centers for environmental prediction ncep quality controlled stage iv precipitation estimates are utilized as the input meteorological forcings fig 3 shows the spatial pattern of cumulative precipitation amounts for these two storm events by 4 km stage iv product to obtain the best estimates of the local infiltration and re infiltration amounts during the selected storm events wrf hydro is calibrated with terrain routing for 18 usgs stream gauges fig 1 b we utilize the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 for calibrations because it was demonstrated to be suitable for computationally expensive and spatially distributed models compared to other algorithms dds converges faster and can reach good global solutions within certain iterations tolson and shoemaker 2007 in a nutshell dds starts from a global search then switches to a more local search by dynamically adjusting the dimension of parameters the adjustment from global to local search is achieved by dynamically and probabilistically reducing the number of dimensions in the neighborhood tolson and shoemaker 2007 to further expedite calibration the simulation domain is reconfigured such that it is tailored to the 18 contributing basins towards all evaluation usgs gauges the reduced simulation domain significantly shortens runtime per iteration which allows us to assign a relatively large iteration number for improving calibration results lespinas et al 2018 presents that the improvements in minimizing objective function using dds are notable between 100 and 500 iterations and relatively moderate after 500 iterations in terms of the objective function root mean square error rmse indicates the magnitude of errors streamflow difference in time series between the simulated and observed hydrographs gupta et al 2009 based on the recommended information from previous studies 500 iterations of dds are used in the calibration with an objective function to minimize rmse 2 4 hydrologic metrics 2 4 1 re infiltration calculation re infiltration amount is not a direct output from wrf hydro but can be estimated by subtracting local infiltration value from total infiltration value eq 3 3 re infiltration mm total infiltration mm local infiltration mm based on the principle of water balance and considering negligible evapotranspiration during intense storm events total infiltration can be calculated by subtracting runoff volume from precipitation amount in terrain on simulation local infiltration can be calculated by subtracting runoff volume from precipitation amount in terrain off scenario it should be noted that this relationship is not hard coded into any part of wrf hydro thus the re infiltration is not calculated as residual of total infiltration subtracting local infiltration in the model this is simply a way to interpret the total infiltration as a composite effect of two processes local and re infiltration re infiltration ratio is defined as re infiltration amount divided by total infiltration in some occasions re infiltration ratio can be greater than one and this is interpreted as surface exfiltration occurring from saturated soil columns gochis et al 2018 2 4 2 runoff coefficient runoff coefficient has been widely used in hydrologic practices ranging from flood frequency analyses e g gottschalk and weingartner 1998 sivapalan et al 2005 to flood forecasting e g borga et al 2011 for a given storm event runoff coefficient is defined as the portion of precipitation that becomes direct runoff higher lower runoff coefficient indicates more less flood proneness and it is used to understand its relationship with re infiltration ratio 2 4 3 calibration statistics four statistics are used to evaluate the streamflow simulation results including pearson correlation coefficient cc nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and normalized bias nbias eqs 4 7 4 cc cov q obs q mod œÉ obs œÉ mod 5 nse 1 i 1 n q mod i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 6 rmse i 1 n q mod i q obs i 2 n 7 nbias i 1 n q mod i q obs i i 1 n q obs i where qmod and qobs denote the simulation and observation values cov is the covariance œÉ obs and œÉ mod represent standard deviation of the simulation and observation i 1 n means to sum up each time step from i 1 to n and n is the number of time steps each of these metrics is interpreted differently to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the model performance cc eq 4 measures how strong a co varying relationship is between the modeled results and the observation which cannot be used to assess model biases nse eq 5 and rmse eq 6 are two most commonly used criteria in hydrological evaluations and they measure both the variability of time series and the magnitude of errors gupta et al 2009 nse normalizes the squared model error using the variance of the observed data and thus a value of zero suggests that the model is only as good as the mean observed data while nse 1 suggests perfect model simulation and negative values indicate that the observation mean is a better predictor than the model gupta and kling 2011 nbias eq 7 is calculated to identify both the magnitude and the sign of errors as normalized by the mean of the observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 idealized numerical experiments fig 4 a shows the range interquartile range and median value of total infiltration at varying precipitation intensities the range shows the variability among 18 gauges across the study domain as the precipitation intensity becomes greater the median of total infiltration first increases rapidly and then becomes steady because the precipitation input is only applied at the first hour of the simulation so precipitation intensity is interchangeably used below as precipitation amount the one to one line in fig 4 a represents the situation where 100 of precipitation is infiltrated for lower precipitation intensities less than 25 4 mm hr precipitation in all tested catchments is completely infiltrated indicated by the total infiltration values aligning with the reference line for greater precipitation intensities variation in the catchments total infiltration starts to emerge as indicated by the increased range and interquartile range this is related to the combination of antecedent soil moisture soil properties geographical factors in various catchments starts to exhibit differences within increasing precipitation intensity nonetheless soils in some catchments still take in most of the precipitation even at high precipitation intensities as indicated by the upper limit of total infiltration values similar to fig 4 a fig 4 b and 4c show the same statistics range interquartile range and median value of local and re infiltration for various precipitation intensities in fig 4 b it is counterintuitive for some local infiltration values to get below zero which means that exfiltration occurred and runoff is thus greater than precipitation under the corresponding precipitation intensity and the terrain off routing option according to our approach of calculating re infiltration section 2 4 1 the exfiltration condition causes the corresponding re infiltration to be greater than total infiltration same as the case of total infiltration greater precipitation intensities give rise to variations or more precisely heterogeneities among the catchments in local and re infiltration processes fig 5 a to 5c show total infiltration local infiltration and re infiltration values at various saturation levels of initial soil moisture in the first soil layer 0 10 cm similarly fig 5 d to 5f and 5g to 5i show the trends of total local and re infiltration in the second 10 40 cm and third 40 100 cm soil layers respectively it can be found that in all three soil layers as initial soil moisture gets closer to saturation total infiltration and local infiltration both slowly decrease while re infiltration slightly increases this behavior of re infiltration seems counterintuitive because one may expect soil layers of higher saturation levels would result in smaller amount of re infiltration due to decreased soil storage for water to go in however it has to be understood that re infiltration is simulated as a secondary process to local infiltration where water routed from upstream cells being added to the excess runoff and then infiltrating higher antecedent soil moisture means decreased local infiltration which leaves more water available for going downstream over the hillslopes and re infiltrating subsequently overall local infiltration is still the dominant pathway for infiltration while re infiltration is a secondary effect it is also found that all three types of infiltration are most sensitive to change of soil moisture in the third layer of soil possibly because of its greater thickness storage compared to the upper two soil layers fig 6 a to 6c show the total infiltration local infiltration and re infiltration values at various terrain slope levels respectively while local infiltration is generally unaffected by terrain slope the total and re infiltration both first decrease and then become stable as terrain becomes steeper note that local infiltration is calculated by only considering water transfer in the vertical columns of soil plant and atmosphere in the noah mp lsm thus it does not change as terrain slope changes in comparison re infiltration is an augmented module by wrf hydro to describe the water loss during lateral water transfer pathways therefore it can be influenced by terrain slope and thereby further influencing total infiltration amount these results suggest that by neglecting re infiltration the effect of terrain slope on total infiltration may be underestimated this is especially important to study domains with lower terrain slopes the most obvious differences are seen for terrain slopes with smaller multipliers less than 5 for steeper terrain slope ranges multiplier greater than 5 faster overland flow rate is expected and therefore it gives less chance for water to re infiltrate which explains why limited effect is seen in steeper terrain slope conditions in addition to the above we also found that the ranges and interquartile ranges of the three types of infiltration are almost constant with varying terrain slopes across gauges this is in contrast with fig 4 and fig 5 where the ranges are generally larger indicating little interaction between terrain slope and other factors in affecting infiltration processes fig 7 a c show the trends of total local and re infiltration as saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat changes respectively first local infiltration is found to increase with greater ksat because soil with higher ksat is easier for water to pass through re infiltration decreases with higher ksat while total infiltration first increases rapidly and then becomes stable the reason is that higher ksat leads the majority of water to infiltrate locally leaving less water to be re distributed to downstream areas where re infiltration occurs in other words water has a higher tendency or priority to infiltrate locally than re infiltrate somewhere downstream this finding is consistent with niu et al 2014 that larger ksat facilitates surface water to infiltrate into deeper soils by gravity instead of flowing laterally however for soils with smaller ksat precipitation rate can readily exceed infiltration rate which leaves more surface water for re distribution and re infiltration in addition for the three types of infiltration the variation among tested catchments all decreases with greater ksat values as indicated by the decrease in the ranges as ksat increases precipitation in any catchment is more likely to fully infiltrate via either local infiltration or re infiltration or both in essence precipitation intensity as the upper limit of infiltration rate interacts with ksat in affecting infiltration processes after testing five model parameters retdeprtfac lksatfac slope refkdt and ovroughrtfac we found that infiltration processes are only sensitive to refkdt and ovroughrtfac as shown in figs 8 and 9 note that the refkdt essentially controls the partition between surface and subsurface runoff and greater refkdt means less more surface subsurface runoff such an effect is evident in fig 8 b where local infiltration increases with greater refkdt which is also consistent with findings from previous studies schaake et al 1996 niu 2011 contrary to local infiltration re filtration decreases with greater refkdt as seen previously in figs 5 and 7 re infiltration appears to be a secondary route for water to transfer into subsurface than local infiltration the increasing trend of total infiltration flattens when refkdt exceeds 3 ranging from 0 5 to 5 due to the complete infiltration of precipitation this is very similar to the case shown in fig 9 a greater ovroughrtfac slows down the water transfer over hillslopes and retains the runoff for infiltration to the point where 100 of precipitation seeps into soils in fig 9 b and 9c it is found that local infiltration is not affected by the ovroughrtfac values while re infiltration first increases rapidly and then slowly with greater ovroughrtfac the reason is that rougher surfaces cause slower overland flow rate further giving water more chance to re infiltrate in summary based on the experiments above a common finding is reached as follows local infiltration is a more direct route than re infiltration through which water transfers down into soils under the principle of mass conservation the changes in local and re infiltration due to a single factor can be opposite to each other as seen in the cases of precipitation intensity fig 4 initial soil moisture fig 5 ksat fig 7 and refkdt fig 8 more less water infiltrating locally means less more water to re distribute to downstream cells and re infiltrate such observation makes more sense when variations of the three types of infiltration are examined figs 7 and 8 among tested catchments as the factor ksat or refkdt increases total infiltration become less varied among the 18 catchments while variation of local and re infiltration remains steady the common explanation is that the increasing factor causes precipitation to fully infiltrate in many catchments via both local and re infiltration thus yielding the decreasing variation of total infiltration and in these catchments where total infiltration is constrained local and re infiltration yield the same sum though each bearing considerable variations among different catchments when a factor only affects water transfer over the hillslopes instead of vertically re infiltration changes independently from local infiltration as seen in fig 6 and fig 9 the experiments also highlight the factors that can lead to increased re infiltration while having no effect on or decreasing local infiltration for instance mild terrain slope and lower ksat results in more re infiltration while local infiltration is unaffected or even less figs 6 and 7 these results suggest that re infiltration play an important role in hydrological processes for areas with flat terrain and clayey soils and thus needs to be sufficiently represented in hydrologic simulations in order to better illustrate the portion of re infiltration in total infiltration while assessing its relationship with flood potential re infiltration ratios and the corresponding runoff coefficients are shown in fig 10 a to 10f in fig 10 results from one catchment are plotted as one dotted line in scenarios of varying precipitation intensities fig 10 a initial soil moisture conditions fig 10 b ksat values fig 10 c and refkdt values fig 10 d we can consistently see that re infiltration ratio increases with greater runoff coefficient although with varying terrain slopes fig 10 e and ovroughrtfac values fig 10 f re infiltration ratios show a decreasing trend with a magnitude much smaller than the other cases we further use box plots fig 11 a and 11b to summarize the variance of re infiltration ratios and variance of runoff coefficients in response to changing factors it is found that precipitation ksat and refkdt have higher impact on both re infiltration ratio and runoff coefficient compared to the other factors which confirms our earlier conclusions 3 2 real case simulation and calibration based on the above idealized modeling experiments we choose 6 parameters for model calibration using dds for the real event simulation which includes soil parameter ksat empirical runoff parameter refkdt scale factor of overland roughness ovroughrtfac and channel parameters bottom width btmwdth side slope chslp and manning s roughness n figs 12 and 13 show the comparisons of uncalibrated calibrated and observed hydrographs at different gauge locations for 2010 hermine and 2015 may storm respectively the default parameterization uncalibrated is used to benchmark the calibration results because it represents the current setting in the operational nwm note that there is no available discharge observations at two gauges id 08048800 08056500 during 2010 hermine and thus results from only 16 gauges are plotted in fig 12 after calibration we can see great improvements at most gauges fig 14 summarizes the cc nse rmse and nbias statistics with boxplot our model calibration strategy brings cc and nse much closer to 1 and rmse and nbias much closer to 0 improvement in rmse and nbias indicates that calibration effectively corrected the underestimation of flow rates in the default simulation the much narrower range of all four statistics also suggest that the calibration consistently improves the simulation performances at all tested gauges fig 14 the satisfactory calibration enables us to quantify the re infiltration amount with better assurance during different storm events and covering a wide range of locations which would be otherwise difficult to obtain due to a lack of existing observation techniques to calculate re infiltration in the calibrated simulation another set of terrain off simulations are conducted using the calibrated parameters in order to get values required by eq 3 fig 15 shows the relationship between runoff coefficients and re infiltration ratios from all the testing catchments it can be found that runoff coefficient and re infiltration ratio are positively correlated with the runoff coefficient ranging from 0 to 1 this is consistent with the idealized cases of varying precipitation ksat initial soil moisture and refkdt see fig 10 a to 10d compared to local infiltration re infiltration is simulated in wrf hydro as a secondary process where water routed from upstream cells being added to the runoff excess and then infiltrating however re infiltration can occur at a counter intuitively faster rate than local infiltration cases with re infiltration ratio 50 at basin scale and event scale this is probably due to the faster overland flow rate generated in these cases scenarios with re infiltration ratio being greater than one are noted which possibly indicates that exfiltration would occur under terrain off routing option however these six dots with seemingly unreasonable re infiltration ratio are all from 2015 may event to further investigate the possible reasons behind this we examined the antecedent soil moisture and soil types fig 16 where we found these exfiltration processes are generally occurred in sub basins with two common features i e clayey soils and high antecedent soil moisture 80 saturated in the top layer before our target event in may 2015 several storms occurred in north central texas which have almost saturated the soil lin et al 2018 these soil columns could very easily reach full saturation and thus exfiltration may occur with much water contained in the soil storage without considering the re infiltration process the added amount of runoff from exfiltration would have no chance to enter the soils but to directly become streamflow in the channel should a calibration be conducted under such a circumstance terrain off parameters could be wrongfully adjusted to compensate the missing re infiltration process in wrf hydro 4 conclusions in this study the authors leverage the physically based and distributed wrf hydro modeling framework to comprehensively assess the re infiltration process also referred to as the run on process in literature a process often missing in traditional hydrologic models in particular we investigate the effects of hydrometeorological geographical conditions and model parameters on re infiltration simulations aiming to provide a deeper understanding on re infiltration than existing studies additionally it is the first time that a detailed examination of the re infiltration module in wrf hydro with different parameterization was provided using utrb as the testbed a group of idealized numerical experiments are first conducted to focus on individual factors while holding the others constant the results not only reveal the pattern and magnitude of individual effects but also inform the sensitivities of infiltration to each factor providing guidance for the calibration effort in the subsequent analysis in light of the idealized numerical experiments two real storm events in utrb are simulated and calibrated dominant factors to re infiltration are identified from examining 18 sub basins across the study area during these two events in addition the role of re infiltration is investigated in relation with flood potential indicated by runoff coefficient to show the potential trade offs in modeling re infiltration for flood prediction purposes the main conclusions from this study are summarized as follows 1 compared to local infiltration re infiltration is by nature a secondary process because of the preceding overland routing process however re infiltration can occur at a counter intuitively faster rate than local infiltration cases with re infiltration ratio 50 at basin scale and event scale 2 under the principle of mass conservation the changes in local and re infiltration due to a single factor can be opposite to each other as seen in the cases of precipitation intensity initial soil moisture ksat and refkdt more less water infiltrating locally means less more water to re distribute to downstream cells and re infiltrate 3 the influence of re infiltration on streamflow simulation can be substantial for areas with flat terrain and soil with high clay content re infiltration ratio is 50 4 runoff coefficient and re infiltration ratio are positively correlated indicating that re infiltration effects are more pronounced as flood potential increases and subsequently may be more important in urban than in rural regions for wrf hydro users the insights gained from this study would be helpful for strategically choosing overland routing options based on the study domain s hydro meteorological and graphical conditions given the computational cost for the terrain on option and the complexity in considering related parameters in wrf hydro users could potentially save time and resources while achieving satisfactory simulation results if re infiltration is expected to be less influential for modelers studying hydrology and hydrology atmosphere feedbacks understanding how different factors synergize or counteract with each other to affect re infiltration is rewarding as re infiltration can play an indispensable role in the hydrologic cycle and in feeding back to the atmosphere for instance senatore et al 2015 concluded that accurate representation of re infiltration improves precipitation simulation when fully coupled with wrf suggesting the need to represent this important physical realism in the model for the community of flood emergency responders increasingly detailed and realistic representations of physical processes marks a shift in the paradigm of operational flood forecast from a past that heavily relies on human judgment adjustment towards a computationally expensive but more robust future although re infiltration was found significant for flood prediction in utrb it may prove to be a lesser process elsewhere however it is our emphasis that similar studies are imperative to elucidate the cost for missing or simplifying re infiltration credit authorship contribution statement jiaqi zhang conceptualization data curation

5391,evaporation is one of the most important processes in the hydrologic cycle and is considered as one of the lead factors governing climate in terrestrial environments particularly in arid areas in natural open systems evaporation should be considered as a time dependent function and a cumulative process we applied and compared craig gordon isotopic model with the penman monteith physical evaporation model after a biannual hydrologic cycle characterization in a natural semi arid environment to determine annually reliable balance budgets and estimations our results show that isotopic evaporation rates reflect a sinusoidal behavior during isotopic fractioning rather than a lineal and constant evaporation rate this sinusoidal behavior exhibits the influence of solar radiation and other meteorological variables that have not yet been considered in the c g isotopic mass balance model the estimation of isotopic evaporation in natural environments are reliable during the dry season while estimations of isotopic loss fraction f in the wet season behave as an isotopic mixing model of evaporated water precipitation runoff physical and isotopic methodologies are difficult to relate due to basic fundamentals and development conceptualizations accordingly further work is required to enhance the craig gordon and gonfiantini evaporation model and its relationship with physical methodologies in order to improve the estimation of evaporation in natural semiarid environments keywords Œ¥2h Œ¥18o stable isotopes evaporation craig gordon model penman monteith equation semi arid areas 1 introduction the evolution of Œ¥2h Œ¥18o isotopic ratios throughout the water cycle are widely used to identify water sources recharge zones and hydrological processes caused by water mixing water rock interaction and evaporation thus providing insight into the dynamics of groundwater flow fritz and fontes 1986 gat 2002 1996 gat and levy 1978 gibson 2002 gibson and bursey 1993 gonfiantini 1986 issar et al 1984 tsujimura et al 2007 verma et al 2000 the characterization of isotopic composition in each isotopic reservoir namely atmospheric vapor precipitation runoff groundwater is essential to properly identify isotopic evolution and fractioning processes involved in each step of the hydrological cycle evaporation is one of the most important processes in the atmospheric part of the hydrological cycle in fact it is considered as one of the lead factors governing climate in terrestrial environments gonfiantini et al 2018 being also the most difficult parameter to estimate gat et al 1994 2005 physical estimations of evaporation are generally classified according to the way in which it is determined pan coefficient temperature and radiation mass transfer energy budget and combination methods alazard et al 2015 ali et al 2008 majidi et al 2015 several evaporation estimation methodologies have been compared concluding that the penman monteith method is the most robust and reliable physical method alazard et al 2015 ali et al 2008 majidi et al 2015 in contrast to the different available approaches to estimate physical evaporation the chemical methodologies are limited to the craig gordon and gonfiantini c g isotopic evaporation model the c g isotopic model is based on air vapor and liquid phase isotopic relationship in an open or closed isotopic system this model was successively improved by fontes and gonfiantini 1967 and zimmerman 1979 as an isotopic mass balance method which uses enrichment in isotopic composition to estimate the short term evaporated fraction f in lakes and hydrological basins fellman et al 2011 gat et al 1994 gibson 2002 gibson et al 2008 2016 skrzypek et al 2015 the craig and gordon 1965 and gonfiantini 1986 isotopic evaporation model is the most accepted chemical method and has recently been unified into a unique model that considers several environmental variables such as initial water composition atmospheric relative humidity environmental temperature atmospheric water vapor composition and water salinity fitting into almost all evaporation experiments gonfiantini et al 2018 despite these known limitations lakes ponds and other natural water bodies usually have enough water mass to ensure that isotopic averaging occurs while smoothing the impact of short term variations in the environmental variables in these cases the use of longer term average air temperature or relative humidity values may be feasible with some precautions gonfiantini et al 2018 in this work we present discuss and improve the acquisition and reliability of both physical and chemical data required to apply the c g model in agricultural pools located in a closed isotopic and semiarid environment finally we compare the monthly isotopic evaporation rate with the commonly used physical penman monteith evaporation model as an external validation 2 theory the evaporative loss fraction f of surface water is calculated following the model of craig gordon craig and gordon 1965 modified by gonfiantini 1986 gat et al 1994 gibson and reid 2010 and gonfiantini et al 2018 using non steady

of the water vapor condensation sampling collector the acquisition and validation of the data used is given in the methodology section 3 study area the san juan del rio basin lies in the southeastern corner of the mesa central geological province fig 1 regionally the san juan del rio basin is surrounded by the trans mexican volcanic belt tmvb in the south and sierra madre oriental smor on the east fig 1 locally it is an intermountain exorheic basin in queretaro state with an extension of 2 800 km2 and an altitude that varies from 1900 to 3200 m above sea level m a s l the san juan del rio basin sjrb is a semiarid area that receives humid air masses from both the atlantic and pacific oceans during a short rainy season period carrera hern√°ndez et al 2016 luna ni√±o and cavazos 2018 van der ent et al 2010 the san juan del rio basin is part of the upper watershed of the p√°nuco basin which drains into the gulf of mexico the sjrb has a dendritic drainage network formed by numerous ephemeral arroyos that flow mainly during the rainy season the two main water bodies in the study area are san ildefonso and constituci√≥n de 1917 with an estimated storage volume of 75 mm3 to sustain seasonal agriculture in this region numerous pools were built in the basin fig 1 which have small volumes 0 1 mm3 and are characterized by wide water areas with shallow water depths 5 m figs 1 and 2 4 materials and methods 4 1 atmospheric vapor rainwater and pool water sampling atmospheric water vapor samples Œ¥a were collected at the comite t√©cnico de aguas subterr√°neas cotas facility near san juan del rio fig 1 from june 2016 to november 2017 to collect the vapor samples we used the push and trap method to condense and collect moisture with a flow of 4 l min 1 into a kitazato flask connected to a graham condenser we used a 50 mixture of ethylene glycol water co2 s as refrigerant liquid with a temperature selected of 7 c 1 c to avoid freezing and further isotope fractioning due to vapor liquid solid phase changes of the collected sample it took 6 h to obtain a volume of 5 ml of each sample needed for analysis once the sample was condensed it was transferred to a test tube perfectly sealed and sent to the laboratorio universitario de geoquimica isotopica lugis of the universidad nacional aut√≥noma de mexico for analysis rainwater samples were collected in three different sites located throughout the san juan del rio basin fig 1 during the wet season of 2017 the rainwater collector design is comparable to that described by calva hern√°ndez 2011 and too prevent evaporation we added 1 cm of low density oil into the collector agricultural pool water was sampled during a three year period from may 2015 to october 2017 and the collecting sites n 3 were chosen to be agricultural perennial pools with a similar volume these sites are located near the towns of amealco 2600 m a s l lucia 2300 m a s l and galindo 2000 m a s l figs 1 and 2 after the water was collected it was filtered with a 0 45 Œºm millipore membrane filter and stored in a 125 ml nalgene hdpe bottle sealed with parafilm and preserved at 4 c to prevent evaporation before its analysis 4 2 meteorological data the meteorological data for this study were obtained from two automatic weather stations vantage pro 2 from davis instruments administrated by queretaro s water state commission located in the amealco and pedro escobedo municipalities fig 1 these stations record meteorological data every 10 min and the data between october 2015 and september 2017 were used in this work 4 3 stable isotope analysis isotopic ratios of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were analyzed with a high temperature conversion elemental analyzer tc ea coupled to a thermo finnigan delta plus xl continuous flow isotope ratio spectrometer at the laboratory laboratorio universitario de geoquimica isot√≥pica of the instituto de geolog√≠a universidad nacional aut√≥noma de m√©xico methodology and results were conducted and normalized and reported relative to vsmow coplen 1988 werner and brand 2001 the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h analytical uncertainties are calculated as 0 12 and 1 2 respectively 5 results 5 1 local meteorology annual relative air humidity ranges from 14 to 100 although it is usually larger than 40 during the wet season fig 3 a table ae 1 the annual air temperature ranges from 0 9 c to 33 9 c with an annual average of 17 c the daily mean air temperature data display a sinusoidal behavior with maximum daily mean temperatures from march to september and lowest daily mean temperatures than annual average from october to february fig 3b the solar radiation shows a long term sinusoidal behavior fig 3c the crests highs of the sinusoidal curve correspond to the summer solstice with maximum daily solar radiation of 1376 wm 2 in august 2016 and 1494 wm 2 in june 2017 minimum daily solar radiation intensities correspond to the winter solstice where maximum radiation intensity reaches 1085 and 854 wm 2 for february and december 2016 the annual accumulated precipitation in the sjrb was 612 mm in 2016 and 540 mm in 2017 precipitation during the wet season june september accounts for 80 of the total annual rainfall volume 420 and 435 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively in this region the intensity of precipitation can reach even 10 of the total annual value in a few hours as observed in may 28th 2017 the wind speed registered in the study area ranges from 0 31 ms 1 to 7 56 ms 1 with a frequency of calms from 9 64 to 23 6 fig 3d winds are classified from 0 to 3 or light to moderate breeze in the beaufort scale lindau 1995 wind speed and its direction in a rose plot reflects different conditions between winter spring and summer autumn fig 3d the atmospheric conditions in summer autumn season are stable with dominant calm periods 17 4 and 23 6 for 2016 and 2017 respectively and northeast dominant winds blowing between 2 1 and 5 7 ms 1 27 of the data points in contrast during winter spring season dominant winds 25 blow gently from the south under 3 6 ms 1 16 of the data points 5 2 evaporation estimates based on penman monteith method for open water to estimate the coherence of the isotopic evaporative loss fraction f we determined the physical evaporation rates through the penman monteith 1981 standard equation for water bodies that combines an aerodynamic and a radiative component cai et al 2007 6 e 0 r n l Œ≥ Œ¥ e a 1 Œ≥ Œ¥ where ea is evaporation calculated according to dalton rohwer equation eq 7 rn is net radiation mjm 2d 1 l is latent heat of evaporation l 2 45mjkg 1 Œ¥ the slope of the curve of saturation vapour pressure as a function of temperature kpa c 1 and Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant the rowher 1931 approach assumes that evaporation is a function of wind speed and of the difference between the vapour pressure of the water surface and the atmosphere it uses an empirical mass transfer coefficient to explain the relation between the different parameters through the wind function 7 e 0 0 4 e s e s 1 0 17 u 2 where u2 is the wind velocity measured at a height of 2 m ms 1 es is the pressure of saturated water vapour at the temperature of the water surface mbar and ea is the water vapour pressure above the evaporating surface mbar as a function of relative humidity rh and air temperature tair we used the term Œºu 2 as a linear wind function where Œº is the dalton empirical constant estimated for each study site multiplied by u 2 as has been done previously by other authors ali et al 2008 alazard et al 2015 the empirical constant Œº was computed using its relationship with water surface area proposed by harbeck 1962 we used wind atmospheric pressure relative humidity and air temperature data from the amealco municipality in fig 4 we present the time series evaporation estimates and accumulated evaporation based on amealco station fig 1 meteorological data calculated with dalton rohwer and penman monteith equations fig 4a both equations give a very similar daily and monthly evaporation estimates and accumulation patterns fig 4a b the penman monteith equation generally reaches larger evaporation values than the dalton s method as it integrates aerodynamic and radiative components that have not been considered in dalton s method with the penman monteith equation the daily evaporated volumes range from 0 13 to 5 39 mm day 1 with the bulk of the data distribution average of 1 8 œÉ 0 6 mm day 1 table ea6 the larger evaporation rates are observed during the hot and dry days while the lower evaporation rates correspond to the raining and winter periods to represent a comparable masse balance process both physic and isotopic data sets are present on a monthly basis fig 4b and precipitation is integrated in the penman monteith equation the data evolution in the diagram not only represents the monthly evaporation rate and accumulation but a hydrologic mass balance between evaporation and precipitation fig 4b in this case if the mass balance and evaporation patterns are comparable during the dry season the amplitude of the sinusoidal function increases during the wet season as is dominated by precipitation volumes fig 4b as previously shown the penman monteith evaporation estimations are larger than those calculated by the dalton rohwer equation the wet to dry season transition is highlighted in the annual evaporation accumulation curve by a changing slope point fig 4c the annual evaporation accumulation in amealco municipality reaches 531 0 mm in 2016 and 768 6 mm in 2017 table ea6 and fig 4b which is comparable to the annual precipitation accumulation normal in the region 1971 2000 565 mm carrera hernandez et al 2016 in the san juan basin fig 1 the amealco area hydrological balance is almost at equilibrium along the analyzed period 2016 2017 with a low precipitation excess 81 2 mm in 2016 and some precipitation deficit 226 1 mm in 2017 fig 4c 5 3 isotopic rainwater composition Œ¥2h Œ¥18o the san juan del rio basin is the upper watershed of the p√°nuco basin and rainwater is the only water input in the local hydrologic cycle thus making this basin suitable to estimate evaporation as a first step we setup the local meteoric water line lmwl as it is required to determine the initial isotopic composition of the water input and illustrates its evolution throughout the hydrological cycle twelve samples were collected monthly during the 2017 raining period 06 2017 09 2017 at three different locations and elevations 1 amealco 2620 m a s l 2 cotas facility near san juan del rio city 1920 m a s l and 3 colorado 1925 m a s l fig 1 the Œ¥2h Œ¥18o rainwater results are presented in table ea2 and fig 5 where it can be seen that the variation of Œ¥2h through the period shows a high dispersion varying from 108 8 to 12 9 with a mean value of 66 0 œÉ 31 6 in contrast Œ¥18o presents a lower dispersion ranging from 15 1 to 0 9 and a mean value of 9 5 œÉ 0 1 the lighter isotopic rainwater samples were collected from the amealco sites after intense precipitation events table ea2 to improve the local meteoric water line we added regional historical data to our dataset n 16 cort√©s et al 2000 and this study both collected and historical data display a unique linear dispersion to which the following linear relationship was adjusted Œ¥2h 7 61 Œ¥18o 5 89 r2 0 9927 fig 5 table ea2 the slope and intercept of the local meteoric water line in the san juan del rio basin are slightly lower than those defined for nearby basins Œ¥2h 8 18 Œ¥18o

meteorological conditions greater aridity and precipitation effect as humid air masses travel inland 5 4 atmospheric water vapor isotope composition Œ¥2h Œ¥18o the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor n 47 table ea3 was collected in a unique location cotas facilities fig 1 from june 2016 to november 2017 during this period the isotopic vapor composition varies from 157 7 to 25 7 with a mean value of 79 4 œÉ 24 3 for Œ¥2h and from 22 0 to 2 0 with a mean value of 13 2 œÉ 3 5 for Œ¥18o the time series of the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o ratios show that isotopic composition are sensitive to air temperature and the seasonal variation of humidity fig 6 the variation of Œ¥2h Œ¥18o composition is larger during wet œÉŒ¥2h 29 4 œÉŒ¥18o 4 2 than dry œÉŒ¥2h 15 6 œÉŒ¥18o 2 7 seasons the beginning of the wet season is highlighted by progressively decreases in the isotopic atmospheric vapor composition Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o ratios that is correlated with the intensification of precipitation fig 6 when the meteorological conditions during wet season are well established the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o isotopic atmospheric vapor ratios fluctuate as a result of the presence and intensity of rainfall events 5 5 composition of Œ¥2h Œ¥18o in pool water the isotopic composition of pool water n 78 was defined monthly in three different locations amealco 2600 m a s l lucia 2300 m a s l and galindo 2000 m a s l sites from may 2015 to october 2017 isotopic ratios of pool water in the lucia pool range from 82 6 to 17 3 for Œ¥2h and 11 5 to 6 0 for Œ¥18o while ratios in the galindo pool display variations from 88 4 to 13 1 for Œ¥2h and 12 3 to 6 5 for Œ¥18o fig 7 finally the isotopic ratios of pool water in the amealco site range from 57 0 to 13 0 for Œ¥2h and 7 6 to 0 6 for Œ¥18o displaying less variability in the isotopic composition of pool water relative to lucia 2300 m a s l and galindo 2000 m a s l sites over time all pools present a comparable sinusoidal isotopic evolution pattern fig 7 and a progressive heavy isotope enrichment of pool water is observed during the dry season from september to may june illustrating the evaporation process the changes in the evaporation pattern caused by the inputs of precipitation and runoff into the pools are highlighted by a rapid fall of the Œ¥2h Œ¥18o isotopic ratio values during may june to july the depletion in the isotopic ratios can be up to 100 in Œ¥2h and 18 in Œ¥18o such large depletion in the isotopic values illustrate the mixing process between the small amount of water from which evaporation has already occurred and the large volumes of rainwater rapidly added in the pools the pool water isotopic compositions for the amealco galindo and lucia pools are compared to gmwl and the previously defined lmwl this study in fig 8 the isotopic composition of pool water in the three sites present a common distribution along a local evaporation water line lel such distribution confirms that the only input to the shallow pools is the local precipitation and runoff rather than groundwater fellman et al 2011 furthermore it is possible to distinguish a proper regression line for each sampled pool fig 8 the equations for the amealco pool lel1 luc√≠a pool lel2 and galindo pool lel3 are Œ¥2h 5 91 Œ¥18o 11 08 r2 0 9648 Œ¥2h 5 73 Œ¥18o 14 96 r2 0 9796 and Œ¥2h 5 38 Œ¥18o 19 84 r2 0 9839 respectively which show a slight decrease with altitude fig 8 such variations are usually attributed to temperature relative humidity and the altitude gradient within the basin gonfiantini 1986 the intersections of the lels with the lmwl are considered representative of the initial Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o isotopic composition of pool water prior to evaporation these intersections also represent the local mean Œ¥2h Œ¥18o isotopic composition of rainwater only if the pool reacheas a complete desiccation during the dry season and is not connected to groundwater the lels lmwl intersections values are in amealco 2600 m a s l Œ¥2h 70 1 Œ¥18o 10 0 in luc√≠a 2300 m a s l Œ¥2h 76 6 Œ¥18o 11 1 and in galindo 2000 m a s l Œ¥2h 81 4 Œ¥18o 11 6 the differences in the compositions at the intersections were used to calculate the isotopic elevation gradients which are estimated to be 1 90 for Œ¥2h and 0 28 in Œ¥18o per 100 m these values are within those published s for mountainous tropical areas p√©rez quezadas et al 2015 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 6 isotopic evaporation model before solving the craig and gordon 1965 and gonfiantini 1986 evaporation models we need to calculate the isotopic local limiting composition Œ¥ the m parameter and the total isotopic fractioning factor table ea5 the isotopic local limiting composition Œ¥ represents the maximum Œ¥18o Œ¥2h isotopic ratio in the liquid fraction at which fractioning takes place above this value the isotopic composition would not reflect the evaporation process so the craig gordon isotopic model would no longer be applicable the calculated values of Œ¥ in all pools range from 0 29 to 33 06 for Œ¥18o and from 6 82 to 188 96 for Œ¥2h the Œ¥18o Œ¥2h isotopic enrichment in the three agricultural pools never reached these conditions table ea5 and thus it can be assumed that c g model is suitable and reliable the m parameter describes the relationship between Œ¥e and Œ¥l at any instant at measured air temperature and relative humidity the variation of the m value is comparable in all the studied pools and range from 0 65 to 4 49 for Œ¥18o and from 0 54 to 4 59 for Œ¥2h table ea5 the total isotopic fractioning factor Œµ is obtained solving horita and wesolowski 1994 equation monthly evaporated fraction f in values were estimated following the Œ¥18o Œ¥2h isotopic ratios throughout the 2015 2017 study period gonfiantini 1986 for each agricultural pool water fig 9 these estimations have the minimum value at the end of wet season and the maximum value at the end of the dry season for the amealco pool the evaporated fraction varies from 1 3 to 30 6 for Œ¥18o and from 0 0 to 36 9 for Œ¥2h for the lucia pool the monthly evaporation estimations range from 0 0 to 51 0 for Œ¥18o and 0 0 from to 52 3 for Œ¥2h finally in the galindo pool f ranges from 0 0 to 53 5 at the end of dry season for Œ¥18o and 0 0 from to 52 4 for Œ¥2h the obtained maximum f Œ¥18o Œ¥2h values are comparable to those reported for african and asian lakes in arid and semi arid environment alazard et al 2015 delalande et al 2008 liu et al 2016 poulin et al 2019 wen et al 2016 the negative f Œ¥18o Œ¥2h values are related to the input of depleted rainwater in the system table ea5 and are always within the error margin of f 0 showing equilibrium between precipitation and evaporation volumes monthly f Œ¥18o Œ¥2h exhibits a sinusoidal distribution through time fig 8 where the ascending section of the sinusoidal function represents the evolution of the estimated evaporated fraction f in the pool s water the slope represents the intensity variation of the instantaneous evaporation rate per unit of time at a given time the decreasing section of the sinusoidal function in may june corresponds to the wet season where the evaporated fraction f will no longer represent the monthly evaporation accumulated in a closed system but an isotopic mass balance process between both the precipitation and evaporation volumes fig 9 small behavior variations between the three pools illustrate the punctual meteoric and precipitation intensity variations such difference is highlighted by comparing the 2016 and 2017 wet seasons in the lucia and amealco pools the precipitation registered in 2017 is lower than in 2016 although the 2017 precipitation events were more intense in a single event the precipitation a runoff volume fills up both pools up to 100 fig 9 7 discussion the c g model is understood as a linear model that can be applied to a closed isotopic system lake figs 8 and 9a the c g model illustrates the equilibrium isotopic in the isotopic composition between two reservoirs 1 the water moisture in the atmosphere as relative humidity Œ¥a and 2 the pool water in liquid phase Œ¥l at a given time and air temperature accordingly the maximum evaporation rate and mean intensity will depend on the sampling period fig 9 in a semi arid environment such as the sjrb and under a monthly controlled monitoring the evaporation process has a sinusoidal response rather than the expected lineal behavior figs 8 and 9 the variations of the monthly f show that evaporation volumes throughout the year are not constant and cannot be considered as a single measurement in the annual mass balance water budget the f evolution during the wet season fig 9a and b does not represent a simple evaporation process but a competition between evaporation and multi reservoir isotopic mixing air vapor rainwater pool water as dry and wet season represent different isotopic processes evaporation and mixing they are explained by different functions fig 9a the monthly variation illustrates the relevance of punctual tracing of the isotopic composition in pool water and of the variation in the atmospheric isotopic conditions through time in order to allow us to determine 1 the breaking point of the maximum f value at the end of the dry season 2 the initial f value to estimate the lake volume recuperation and finally 3 to illustrate the variation of water loss by evaporation fig 9a and b the craig gordon model is controlled by the variation of air temperature relative humidity air vapor and the initial isotopic values at the water pool in arid to semi arid environments air temperature and relative humidity show large seasonal variations 0 9 c to 33 9 c and 14 to 100 respectively different authors have previously mentioned the sensitivity of the craig gordon model to relative humidity kumar and nachiappan 1999 wen et al 2016 and the impact of several variables such as air temperature relative humidity and water salinity on the water body isotopic fractioning were tested and integrated in the gonfiantini et al 2018 evaporation isotopic model majidi et al 2015 shows that the most important factors affecting the evaporation process are solar radiation and wind speed far ahead from air temperature and relative humidity used in the g c model bowen 1926 majidi et al 2015 penman 1948 priestley and taylor 1972 webb 1966 solar radiation is indirectly considered in the c g model through air temperature and relative humidity nevertheless the solar radiation might have a strong effect in isotopic fractioning as the energy states of molecule bonding are a result of the energy in the water molecule as described by the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator theory chabal 1988 in an high altitude semi arid environment the solar radiation is high up to 1500 wm 2 in particular the infrared range and the most energetic input in the air water boundary layer significantly increases the water molecule vibrational energy states favoring isotopic fractioning independently of air temperature chabal 1988 recently it has been noticed that wind speed has a comparable effect on kinetic air water equilibrium during evaporation at the water surface benetti et al 2014 the isotopic composition of air vapor Œ¥a is generally the least known constrained parameter introducing the largest uncertainty into the craig gordon model calculations as Œ¥a measurements are relatively rare and difficult to obtain it is commonly accepted to apply regional and or annual mean Œ¥a values or to estimate a theoretical Œ¥a value through an isotopic water vapor rain equilibrium equation gibson 2002 as previously shown local monthly Œ¥a variations show significant annual variation œÉŒ¥a 5 3 showing that water vapor atmospheric composition can not be represented by a punctual or annual mean Œ¥a value the commonly used theoretical Œ¥a estimation is validated by the assumption that Œ¥a is in isotopic equilibrium with the mean isotopic precipitation value in our case rain water sampling was limited to less than 60 days per year mostly during the wet season these conditions do not allow a reliable statistical representation of the Œ¥a annual variation hence the Œ¥a values should be interpreted in terms of regional climatology as a function of seasonal displacement of air masses and of the increase of convective activity during summer the theoretically estimated Œ¥a during the wet season can not represent the comparable isotopic system and the evaporation conditions occurring during the dry season the isotopic closed system representation of the air vapor isotopic reservoir during the wet or dry season is not realistic in a natural environment in addition to these synoptic effects atmospheric vapor may also contain a significant fraction of local recycling humidity from the lake evaporation gat et al 1994 all monitored water pools are considered closed systems because they are located on consolidated ignimbrite flows with low permeability and more than 200 m above the reported piezometric level during the dry season no lateral or upward flows alter the isotopic signature of these water reservoirs during the dry season when the volume decreases to a minimum level the evaporative loss fraction f should reflect the rayleigh distillation effect as the result of the isotopic enrichment in a closed pool water system the monthly variations of the input isotopic data of the liquid or atmospheric phase force us to take into account the physicochemical criteria and define the different periods of the process to carry out a representative sampling over time fig 9 during the rainy season the main isotopic process can be simplified as a multi components isotopic mixing equilibrium equation the main components are the remaining evaporated pool water air vapor and rainwater in an undersaturated or saturated humidity environment the isotopic composition of air vapor isotopic composition is controlled by isotopic composition of the rainwater reservoir poulin et al 2019 in this way equilibrium equation is resumed at two main components and f evolution illustrates their mixing process as rainwater and runoff inflow into each pool and with a progressive restoration of the initial pool water volume and isotopic signature figs 8 and 9 in a semi arid environment the time period is limited by changes between the dry and wet season sampling on a monthly basis allows us to illustrate and interpret a first order of evaporation and the pool refilling variation signal probably a weekly sampling will improve the evolution of the evaporation process and will likely show a second order of signal variation during wet season highlighting the role of the gentle evaporation process during the weeks without rain as previously shown the monthly monitoring deeply increases the scope of the c g model in this way the c g model is not just a method to estimate the punctual maximum evaporation but also a reliable tool to illustrate the lake s hydrodynamics through the years fig 9 various authors have tried to relate both isotopic and physical evaporation estimations with more or less significant success alazard et al 2015 blaney and criddle 1950 bowen 1926 gibson et al 1999 2016 gonfiantini 1986 hamon 1960 makkink 1957 penman 1948 1956 skrzypek et al 2015 valiantzas 2006 both isotopic and physical methodologies show a comparable evaporation process during the dry season when there is no precipitation or water input into the water body however during the rainy season this comparison is no longer representative to overcome this issue we included precipitation in the penman monteith estimation fig 4b in order to transform it to an evaporation precipitation mass balance allowing us to compare both methods the comparison between both physic and isotopic methods is illustrated in fig 10 the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o estimated f show a similar sinusoidal distribution with the maximum evaporation accumulation during the final stages of the dry season april 2016 and june 2017 and a progressive mixing of reservoirs during the wet season the low initial isotopic ratio suggests a hydraulic recuperation of the pool initial volume which is not possible to be estimated as isotopic estimations can not be negative on the contrary the penman monteith mass balance shows a similar biannual sinusoidal distribution however when precipitation exceeds evaporation a negative shift can be observed august and september 2016 indicating that this water volume is available to recharge the sjrb in 2017 the physic and isotopic estimations show different patterns particularly during june and july the isotopic method presents a rapid drop below the initial values while the physic method presents a smoother evolution this behavior difference can be explained by the geographic representation of both methods the physical method is representative of the punctual meteorological conditions obtained from the weather station while the craig gordon method is a mass balance between air vapor and remnant liquid phase from the pool water during the wet season the pool water is not only filed up by local precipitation but also with micro basin runoff which significantly increases the water input in the mass balance system finally the craig gordon method is an isotopic mass balance in which the estimate of the evaporated fraction f is calculated based on the initial and final isotopic composition of water in the reservoir the variation of this period daily monthly or annual has a significant impact of the f estimation fig 9a the evaporation estimates based on the penman monteith method are determined on daily basis and will not be affected by time sampling variation fig 4a the penman monteith and the c g evaporation methods were designed to illustrate an apparently simple process evaporation but by their intrinsic nature they really reflect different aspects of the same process the information obtained by both methods are not redundant and directly comparable but complementary and are useful to better illustrate the evaporation process in a hydrologic basin 8 conclusion this study revisits isotope mass balance concepts that have been developed and applied in various climatic regions over the past five decades however few detailed studies have been conducted in semiarid region environments the enhanced seasonality of the semiarid continental environment of our study site provided an ideal setting for natural experimental testing of basic field approaches for characterizing c g isotopic model within a highly variable atmospheric and hydrologic system we systematically report water isotopic signatures from rainfall atmospheric vapor and agricultural pools providing an integral framework to reliably solve the c g isotopic model we establish the first isotopic framework at a basin scale to guide the interpretation and monitoring of isotopic signatures in mexico we highlight the usage of monthly isotopic signatures to improve the representing and tracing water in the sjr semiarid basin it was found that in an environment with extreme seasonality the evaporation rates vary dramatically and the evaporation process is not well represented as a linear model the c g isotopic model represents the evaporation process only during the dry season when no other water sources such as rain atmospheric vapor and or groundwater perturb the pool isotopic variation during the wet season the c g isotopic model does not longer illustrate the evaporation process but the isotopic water balance in pools the c g isotopic model was applied in conjunction with a conventional physical evaporation model to constrain and compare short term monthly water balance variations in pools beyond a common objective of representing the evaporation rate and process the isotopic and physical models cannot be compared they are complementary approaches which are useful in the understanding of the evaporation process meaning in hydrologic basin declaration of competing interest the

5391,evaporation is one of the most important processes in the hydrologic cycle and is considered as one of the lead factors governing climate in terrestrial environments particularly in arid areas in natural open systems evaporation should be considered as a time dependent function and a cumulative process we applied and compared craig gordon isotopic model with the penman monteith physical evaporation model after a biannual hydrologic cycle characterization in a natural semi arid environment to determine annually reliable balance budgets and estimations our results show that isotopic evaporation rates reflect a sinusoidal behavior during isotopic fractioning rather than a lineal and constant evaporation rate this sinusoidal behavior exhibits the influence of solar radiation and other meteorological variables that have not yet been considered in the c g isotopic mass balance model the estimation of isotopic evaporation in natural environments are reliable during the dry season while estimations of isotopic loss fraction f in the wet season behave as an isotopic mixing model of evaporated water precipitation runoff physical and isotopic methodologies are difficult to relate due to basic fundamentals and development conceptualizations accordingly further work is required to enhance the craig gordon and gonfiantini evaporation model and its relationship with physical methodologies in order to improve the estimation of evaporation in natural semiarid environments keywords Œ¥2h Œ¥18o stable isotopes evaporation craig gordon model penman monteith equation semi arid areas 1 introduction the evolution of Œ¥2h Œ¥18o isotopic ratios throughout the water cycle are widely used to identify water sources recharge zones and hydrological processes caused by water mixing water rock interaction and evaporation thus providing insight into the dynamics of groundwater flow fritz and fontes 1986 gat 2002 1996 gat and levy 1978 gibson 2002 gibson and bursey 1993 gonfiantini 1986 issar et al 1984 tsujimura et al 2007 verma et al 2000 the characterization of isotopic composition in each isotopic reservoir namely atmospheric vapor precipitation runoff groundwater is essential to properly identify isotopic evolution and fractioning processes involved in each step of the hydrological cycle evaporation is one of the most important processes in the atmospheric part of the hydrological cycle in fact it is considered as one of the lead factors governing climate in terrestrial environments gonfiantini et al 2018 being also the most difficult parameter to estimate gat et al 1994 2005 physical estimations of evaporation are generally classified according to the way in which it is determined pan coefficient temperature and radiation mass transfer energy budget and combination methods alazard et al 2015 ali et al 2008 majidi et al 2015 several evaporation estimation methodologies have been compared concluding that the penman monteith method is the most robust and reliable physical method alazard et al 2015 ali et al 2008 majidi et al 2015 in contrast to the different available approaches to estimate physical evaporation the chemical methodologies are limited to the craig gordon and gonfiantini c g isotopic evaporation model the c g isotopic model is based on air vapor and liquid phase isotopic relationship in an open or closed isotopic system this model was successively improved by fontes and gonfiantini 1967 and zimmerman 1979 as an isotopic mass balance method which uses enrichment in isotopic composition to estimate the short term evaporated fraction f in lakes and hydrological basins fellman et al 2011 gat et al 1994 gibson 2002 gibson et al 2008 2016 skrzypek et al 2015 the craig and gordon 1965 and gonfiantini 1986 isotopic evaporation model is the most accepted chemical method and has recently been unified into a unique model that considers several environmental variables such as initial water composition atmospheric relative humidity environmental temperature atmospheric water vapor composition and water salinity fitting into almost all evaporation experiments gonfiantini et al 2018 despite these known limitations lakes ponds and other natural water bodies usually have enough water mass to ensure that isotopic averaging occurs while smoothing the impact of short term variations in the environmental variables in these cases the use of longer term average air temperature or relative humidity values may be feasible with some precautions gonfiantini et al 2018 in this work we present discuss and improve the acquisition and reliability of both physical and chemical data required to apply the c g model in agricultural pools located in a closed isotopic and semiarid environment finally we compare the monthly isotopic evaporation rate with the commonly used physical penman monteith evaporation model as an external validation 2 theory the evaporative loss fraction f of surface water is calculated following the model of craig gordon craig and gordon 1965 modified by gonfiantini 1986 gat et al 1994 gibson and reid 2010 and gonfiantini et al 2018 using non steady

corner of the mesa central geological province fig 1 regionally the san juan del rio basin is surrounded by the trans mexican volcanic belt tmvb in the south and sierra madre oriental smor on the east fig 1 locally it is an intermountain exorheic basin in queretaro state with an extension of 2 800 km2 and an altitude that varies from 1900 to 3200 m above sea level m a s l the san juan del rio basin sjrb is a semiarid area that receives humid air masses from both the atlantic and pacific oceans during a short rainy season period carrera hern√°ndez et al 2016 luna ni√±o and cavazos 2018 van der ent et al 2010 the san juan del rio basin is part of the upper watershed of the p√°nuco basin which drains into the gulf of mexico the sjrb has a dendritic drainage network formed by numerous ephemeral arroyos that flow mainly during the rainy season the two main water bodies in the study area are san ildefonso and constituci√≥n de 1917 with an estimated storage volume of 75 mm3 to sustain seasonal agriculture in this region numerous pools were built in the basin fig 1 which have small volumes 0 1 mm3 and are characterized by wide water areas with shallow water depths 5 m figs 1 and 2 4 materials and methods 4 1 atmospheric vapor rainwater and pool water sampling atmospheric water vapor samples Œ¥a were collected at the comite t√©cnico de aguas subterr√°neas cotas facility near san juan del rio fig 1 from june 2016 to november 2017 to collect the vapor samples we used the push and trap method to condense and collect moisture with a flow of 4 l min 1 into a kitazato flask connected to a graham condenser we used a 50 mixture of ethylene glycol water co2 s as refrigerant liquid with a temperature selected of 7 c 1 c to avoid freezing and further isotope fractioning due to vapor liquid solid phase changes of the collected sample it took 6 h to obtain a volume of 5 ml of each sample needed for analysis once the sample was condensed it was transferred to a test tube perfectly sealed and sent to the laboratorio universitario de geoquimica isotopica lugis of the universidad nacional aut√≥noma de mexico for analysis rainwater samples were collected in three different sites located throughout the san juan del rio basin fig 1 during the wet season of 2017 the rainwater collector design is comparable to that described by calva hern√°ndez 2011 and too prevent evaporation we added 1 cm of low density oil into the collector agricultural pool water was sampled during a three year period from may 2015 to october 2017 and the collecting sites n 3 were chosen to be agricultural perennial pools with a similar volume these sites are located near the towns of amealco 2600 m a s l lucia 2300 m a s l and galindo 2000 m a s l figs 1 and 2 after the water was collected it was filtered with a 0 45 Œºm millipore membrane filter and stored in a 125 ml nalgene hdpe bottle sealed with parafilm and preserved at 4 c to prevent evaporation before its analysis 4 2 meteorological data the meteorological data for this study were obtained from two automatic weather stations vantage pro 2 from davis instruments administrated by queretaro s water state commission located in the amealco and pedro escobedo municipalities fig 1 these stations record meteorological data every 10 min and the data between october 2015 and september 2017 were used in this work 4 3 stable isotope analysis isotopic ratios of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were analyzed with a high temperature conversion elemental analyzer tc ea coupled to a thermo finnigan delta plus xl continuous flow isotope ratio spectrometer at the laboratory laboratorio universitario de geoquimica isot√≥pica of the instituto de geolog√≠a universidad nacional aut√≥noma de m√©xico methodology and results were conducted and normalized and reported relative to vsmow coplen 1988 werner and brand 2001 the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h analytical uncertainties are calculated as 0 12 and 1 2 respectively 5 results 5 1 local meteorology annual relative air humidity ranges from 14 to 100 although it is usually larger than 40 during the wet season fig 3 a table ae 1 the annual air temperature ranges from 0 9 c to 33 9 c with an annual average of 17 c the daily mean air temperature data display a sinusoidal behavior with maximum daily mean temperatures from march to september and lowest daily mean temperatures than annual average from october to february fig 3b the solar radiation shows a long term sinusoidal behavior fig 3c the crests highs of the sinusoidal curve correspond to the summer solstice with maximum daily solar radiation of 1376 wm 2 in august 2016 and 1494 wm 2 in june 2017 minimum daily solar radiation intensities correspond to the winter solstice where maximum radiation intensity reaches 1085 and 854 wm 2 for february and december 2016 the annual accumulated precipitation in the sjrb was 612 mm in 2016 and 540 mm in 2017 precipitation during the wet season june september accounts for 80 of the total annual rainfall volume 420 and 435 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively in this region the intensity of precipitation can reach even 10 of the total annual value in a few hours as observed in may 28th 2017 the wind speed registered in the study area ranges from 0 31 ms 1 to 7 56 ms 1 with a frequency of calms from 9 64 to 23 6 fig 3d winds are classified from 0 to 3 or light to moderate breeze in the beaufort scale lindau 1995 wind speed and its direction in a rose plot reflects different conditions between winter spring and summer autumn fig 3d the atmospheric conditions in summer autumn season are stable with dominant calm periods 17 4 and 23 6 for 2016 and 2017 respectively and northeast dominant winds blowing between 2 1 and 5 7 ms 1 27 of the data points in contrast during winter spring season dominant winds 25 blow gently from the south under 3 6 ms 1 16 of the data points 5 2 evaporation estimates based on penman monteith method for open water to estimate the coherence of the isotopic evaporative loss fraction f we determined the physical evaporation rates through the penman monteith 1981 standard equation for water bodies that combines an aerodynamic and a radiative component cai et al 2007 6 e 0 r n l Œ≥ Œ¥ e a 1 Œ≥ Œ¥ where ea is evaporation calculated according to dalton rohwer equation eq 7 rn is net radiation mjm 2d 1 l is latent heat of

evaporation is a function of wind speed and of the difference between the vapour pressure of the water surface and the atmosphere it uses an empirical mass transfer coefficient to explain the relation between the different parameters through the wind function 7 e 0 0 4 e s e s 1 0 17 u 2 where u2 is the wind velocity measured at a height of 2 m ms 1 es is the pressure of saturated water vapour at the temperature of the water surface mbar and ea is the water vapour pressure above the evaporating surface mbar as a function of relative humidity rh and air temperature tair we used the term Œºu 2 as a linear wind function where Œº is the dalton empirical constant estimated for each study site multiplied by u 2 as has been done previously by other authors ali et al 2008 alazard et al 2015 the empirical constant Œº was computed using its relationship with water surface area proposed by harbeck 1962 we used wind atmospheric pressure relative humidity and air temperature data from the amealco municipality in fig 4 we present the time series evaporation estimates and accumulated evaporation based on amealco station fig 1 meteorological data calculated with dalton rohwer and penman monteith equations fig 4a both equations give a very similar daily and monthly evaporation estimates and accumulation patterns fig 4a b the penman monteith equation generally reaches larger evaporation values than the dalton s method as it integrates aerodynamic and radiative components that have not been considered in dalton s method with the penman monteith equation the daily evaporated volumes range from 0 13 to 5 39 mm day 1 with the bulk of the data distribution average of 1 8 œÉ 0 6 mm day 1 table ea6 the larger evaporation rates are observed during the hot and dry days while the lower evaporation rates correspond to the raining and winter periods to represent a comparable masse balance process both physic and isotopic data sets are present on a monthly basis fig 4b and precipitation is integrated in the penman monteith equation the data evolution in the diagram not only represents the monthly evaporation rate and accumulation but a hydrologic mass balance between evaporation and precipitation fig 4b in this case if the mass balance and evaporation patterns are comparable during the dry season the amplitude of the sinusoidal function increases during the wet season as is dominated by precipitation volumes fig 4b as previously shown the penman monteith evaporation estimations are larger than those calculated by the dalton rohwer equation the wet to dry season transition is highlighted in the annual evaporation accumulation curve by a changing slope point fig 4c the annual evaporation accumulation in amealco municipality reaches 531 0 mm in 2016 and 768 6 mm in 2017 table ea6 and fig 4b which is comparable to the annual precipitation accumulation normal in the region 1971 2000 565 mm carrera hernandez et al 2016 in the san juan basin fig 1 the amealco area hydrological balance is almost at equilibrium along the analyzed period 2016 2017 with a low precipitation excess 81 2 mm in 2016 and some precipitation deficit 226 1 mm in 2017 fig 4c 5 3 isotopic rainwater composition Œ¥2h Œ¥18o the san juan del rio basin is the upper watershed of the p√°nuco basin and rainwater is the only water input in the local hydrologic cycle thus making this basin suitable to estimate evaporation as a first step we setup the local meteoric water line lmwl as it is required to determine the initial isotopic composition of the water input and illustrates its evolution throughout the hydrological cycle twelve samples were collected monthly during the 2017 raining period 06 2017 09 2017 at three different locations and elevations 1 amealco 2620 m a s l 2 cotas facility near san juan del rio city 1920 m a s l and 3 colorado 1925 m a s l fig 1 the Œ¥2h Œ¥18o rainwater results are presented in table ea2 and fig 5 where it can be seen that the variation of Œ¥2h through the period shows a high dispersion varying from 108 8 to 12 9 with a mean value of 66 0 œÉ 31 6 in contrast Œ¥18o presents a lower dispersion ranging from 15 1 to 0 9 and a mean value of 9 5 œÉ 0 1 the lighter isotopic rainwater samples were collected from the amealco sites after intense precipitation events table ea2 to improve the local meteoric water line we added regional historical data to our dataset n 16 cort√©s et al 2000 and this study both collected and historical data display a unique linear dispersion to which the following linear relationship was adjusted Œ¥2h

meteorological conditions greater aridity and precipitation effect as humid air masses travel inland 5 4 atmospheric water vapor isotope composition Œ¥2h Œ¥18o the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor n 47 table ea3 was collected in a unique location cotas facilities fig 1 from june 2016 to november 2017 during this period the isotopic vapor composition varies from 157 7 to 25 7 with a mean value of 79 4 œÉ 24 3 for Œ¥2h and from 22 0 to 2 0 with a mean value of 13 2 œÉ 3 5 for Œ¥18o the time series of the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o ratios show that isotopic composition are sensitive to air temperature and the seasonal variation of humidity fig 6 the variation of Œ¥2h Œ¥18o composition is larger during wet œÉŒ¥2h 29 4 œÉŒ¥18o 4 2 than dry œÉŒ¥2h 15 6 œÉŒ¥18o 2 7 seasons the beginning of the wet season is highlighted by progressively decreases in the isotopic atmospheric vapor composition Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o ratios that is correlated with the intensification of precipitation fig 6 when the meteorological conditions during wet season are well established the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o isotopic atmospheric vapor ratios fluctuate as a result of the presence and intensity of rainfall events 5 5 composition of Œ¥2h Œ¥18o in pool water the isotopic composition of pool water n 78 was defined monthly in three different locations amealco 2600 m a s l lucia 2300 m a s l and galindo 2000 m a s l sites from may 2015 to october 2017 isotopic ratios of pool water in the lucia pool range from 82 6 to 17 3 for Œ¥2h and 11 5 to 6 0 for Œ¥18o while ratios in the galindo pool display variations from 88 4 to 13 1 for Œ¥2h and 12 3 to 6 5 for Œ¥18o fig 7 finally the isotopic ratios of pool water in the amealco site range from 57 0 to 13 0 for Œ¥2h and 7 6 to 0 6 for Œ¥18o displaying less variability in the isotopic composition of pool water relative to lucia 2300 m a s l and galindo 2000 m a s l sites over time all pools present a comparable sinusoidal isotopic evolution pattern fig 7 and a progressive heavy isotope enrichment of pool water is observed during the dry season from september to may june illustrating the evaporation process the changes in the evaporation pattern caused by the inputs of precipitation and runoff into the pools are highlighted by a rapid fall of the Œ¥2h Œ¥18o isotopic ratio values during may june to july the depletion in the isotopic ratios can be up to 100 in Œ¥2h and 18 in Œ¥18o such large depletion in the isotopic values illustrate the mixing process between the small amount of water from which evaporation has already occurred and the large volumes of rainwater rapidly added in the pools the pool water isotopic compositions for the amealco galindo and lucia pools are compared to gmwl and the previously defined lmwl this study in fig 8 the isotopic composition of pool water in the three sites present a common distribution along a local evaporation water line lel such distribution confirms that the only input to the shallow pools is the local precipitation and runoff rather than groundwater fellman et al 2011 furthermore it is possible to distinguish a proper regression line for each sampled pool fig 8 the equations for the amealco pool lel1 luc√≠a pool lel2 and galindo pool lel3 are Œ¥2h 5 91 Œ¥18o 11 08 r2 0 9648 Œ¥2h 5 73 Œ¥18o 14 96 r2 0 9796 and Œ¥2h 5 38 Œ¥18o 19 84 r2 0 9839 respectively which show a slight decrease with altitude fig 8 such variations are usually attributed to temperature relative humidity and the altitude gradient within the basin gonfiantini 1986 the intersections of the lels with the lmwl are considered representative of the initial Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o isotopic composition of pool water prior to evaporation these intersections also represent the local mean Œ¥2h Œ¥18o isotopic composition of rainwater only if the pool reacheas a complete desiccation during the dry season and is not connected to groundwater the lels lmwl intersections values are in amealco 2600 m a s l Œ¥2h 70 1 Œ¥18o 10 0 in luc√≠a 2300 m a s l Œ¥2h 76 6 Œ¥18o 11 1 and in galindo 2000 m a s l Œ¥2h 81 4 Œ¥18o 11 6 the differences in the compositions at the intersections were used to calculate the isotopic elevation gradients which are estimated to be 1 90 for Œ¥2h and 0 28 in Œ¥18o per 100 m these values are within those published s for mountainous tropical areas p√©rez quezadas et al 2015 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 6 isotopic evaporation model before solving the craig and gordon 1965 and gonfiantini 1986 evaporation models we need to calculate the isotopic local limiting composition Œ¥ the m parameter and the total isotopic fractioning factor table ea5 the isotopic local limiting composition Œ¥ represents the maximum Œ¥18o Œ¥2h isotopic ratio in the liquid fraction at which fractioning takes place above this value the isotopic composition would not reflect the evaporation process so the craig gordon isotopic model would no longer be applicable the calculated values of Œ¥ in all pools range from 0 29 to 33 06 for Œ¥18o and from 6 82 to 188 96 for Œ¥2h the Œ¥18o Œ¥2h isotopic enrichment in the three agricultural pools never reached these conditions table ea5 and thus it can be assumed that c g model is suitable and reliable the m parameter describes the relationship between Œ¥e and Œ¥l at any instant at measured air temperature and relative humidity the variation of the m value is comparable in all the studied pools and range from 0 65 to 4 49 for Œ¥18o and from 0 54 to 4 59 for Œ¥2h table ea5 the total isotopic fractioning factor Œµ is obtained solving horita and wesolowski 1994 equation monthly evaporated fraction f in values were estimated following the Œ¥18o Œ¥2h isotopic ratios throughout the 2015 2017 study period gonfiantini 1986 for each agricultural pool water fig 9 these estimations have the minimum value at the end of wet season and the maximum value at the end of the dry season for the amealco pool the evaporated fraction varies from 1 3 to 30 6 for Œ¥18o and from 0 0 to 36 9 for Œ¥2h for the lucia pool the monthly evaporation estimations range from 0 0 to 51 0 for Œ¥18o and 0 0 from to 52 3 for Œ¥2h finally in the galindo pool f ranges from 0 0 to 53 5 at the end of dry season for Œ¥18o and 0 0 from to 52 4 for Œ¥2h the obtained maximum f Œ¥18o Œ¥2h values are comparable to those reported for african and asian lakes in arid and semi arid environment alazard et al 2015 delalande et al 2008 liu et al 2016 poulin et al 2019 wen et al 2016 the negative f Œ¥18o Œ¥2h values are related to the input of depleted rainwater in the system table ea5 and are always within the error margin of f 0 showing equilibrium between precipitation and evaporation volumes monthly f Œ¥18o Œ¥2h exhibits a sinusoidal distribution through time fig 8 where the ascending section of the sinusoidal function represents the evolution of the estimated evaporated fraction f in the pool s water the slope represents the intensity variation of the instantaneous evaporation rate per unit of time at a given time the decreasing section of the sinusoidal function in may june corresponds to the wet season where the evaporated fraction f will no longer represent the monthly evaporation accumulated in a closed system but an isotopic mass balance process between both the precipitation and evaporation volumes fig 9 small behavior variations between the three pools illustrate the punctual meteoric and precipitation intensity variations such difference is highlighted by comparing the 2016 and 2017 wet seasons in the lucia and amealco pools the precipitation registered in 2017 is lower than in 2016 although the 2017 precipitation events were more intense in a single event the precipitation a runoff volume fills up both pools up to 100 fig 9 7 discussion the c g model is understood as a linear model that can be applied to a closed isotopic system lake figs 8 and 9a the c g model illustrates the equilibrium isotopic in the isotopic composition between two reservoirs 1 the water moisture in the atmosphere as relative humidity Œ¥a and 2 the pool water in liquid phase Œ¥l at a given time and air temperature accordingly the maximum evaporation rate and mean intensity will depend on the sampling period fig 9 in a semi arid environment such as the sjrb and under a monthly controlled monitoring the evaporation process has a sinusoidal response rather than the expected lineal behavior figs 8 and 9 the variations of the monthly f show that evaporation volumes throughout the year are not constant and cannot be considered as a single measurement in the annual mass balance water budget the f evolution during the wet season fig 9a and b does not represent a simple evaporation process but a competition between evaporation and multi reservoir isotopic mixing air vapor rainwater pool water as dry and wet season represent different isotopic processes evaporation and mixing they are explained by different functions fig 9a the monthly variation illustrates the relevance of punctual tracing of the isotopic composition in pool water and of the variation in the atmospheric isotopic conditions through time in order to allow us to determine 1 the breaking point of the maximum f value at the end of the dry season 2 the initial f value to estimate the lake volume recuperation and finally 3 to illustrate the variation of water loss by evaporation fig 9a and b the craig gordon model is controlled by the variation of air temperature relative humidity air vapor and the initial isotopic values at the water pool in arid to semi arid environments air temperature and relative humidity show large seasonal variations 0 9 c to 33 9 c and 14 to 100 respectively different authors have previously mentioned the sensitivity of the craig gordon model to relative humidity kumar and nachiappan 1999 wen et al 2016 and the impact of several variables such as air temperature relative humidity and water salinity on the water body isotopic fractioning were tested and integrated in the gonfiantini et al 2018 evaporation isotopic model majidi et al 2015 shows that the most important factors affecting the evaporation process are solar radiation and wind speed far ahead from air temperature and relative humidity used in the g c model bowen 1926 majidi et al 2015 penman 1948 priestley and taylor 1972 webb 1966 solar radiation is indirectly considered in the c g model through air temperature and relative humidity nevertheless the solar radiation might have a strong effect in isotopic fractioning as the energy states of molecule bonding are a result of the energy in the water molecule as described by the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator theory chabal 1988 in an high altitude semi arid environment the solar radiation is high up to 1500 wm 2 in particular the infrared range and the most energetic input in the air water boundary layer significantly increases the water molecule vibrational energy states favoring isotopic fractioning independently of air temperature chabal 1988 recently it has been noticed that wind speed has a comparable effect on kinetic air water equilibrium during evaporation at the water surface benetti et al 2014 the isotopic composition of air vapor Œ¥a is generally the least known constrained parameter introducing the largest uncertainty into the craig gordon model calculations as Œ¥a measurements are relatively rare and difficult to obtain it is commonly accepted to apply regional and or annual mean Œ¥a values or to estimate a theoretical Œ¥a value through an isotopic water vapor rain equilibrium equation gibson 2002 as previously shown local monthly Œ¥a variations show significant annual variation œÉŒ¥a 5 3 showing that water vapor atmospheric composition can not be represented by a punctual or annual mean Œ¥a value the commonly used theoretical Œ¥a estimation is validated by the assumption that Œ¥a is in isotopic equilibrium with the mean isotopic precipitation value in our case rain water sampling was limited to less than 60 days per year mostly during the wet season these conditions do not allow a reliable statistical representation of the Œ¥a annual variation hence the Œ¥a values should be interpreted in terms of regional climatology as a function of seasonal displacement of air masses and of the increase of convective activity during summer the theoretically estimated Œ¥a during the wet season can not represent the comparable isotopic system and the evaporation conditions occurring during the dry season the isotopic closed system representation of the air vapor isotopic reservoir during the wet or dry season is not realistic in a natural environment in addition to these synoptic effects atmospheric vapor may also contain a significant fraction of local recycling humidity from the lake evaporation gat et al 1994 all monitored water pools are considered closed systems because they are located on consolidated ignimbrite flows with low permeability and more than 200 m above the reported piezometric level during the dry season no lateral or upward flows alter the isotopic signature of these water reservoirs during the dry season when the volume decreases to a minimum level the evaporative loss fraction f should reflect the rayleigh distillation effect as the result of the isotopic enrichment in a closed pool water system the monthly variations of the input isotopic data of the liquid or atmospheric phase force us to take into account the physicochemical criteria and define the different periods of the process to carry out a representative sampling over time fig 9 during the rainy season the main isotopic process can be simplified as a multi components isotopic mixing equilibrium equation the main components are the remaining evaporated pool water air vapor and rainwater in an undersaturated or saturated humidity environment the isotopic composition of air vapor isotopic composition is controlled by isotopic composition of the rainwater reservoir poulin et al 2019 in this way equilibrium equation is resumed at two main components and f evolution illustrates their mixing process as rainwater and runoff inflow into each pool and with a progressive restoration of the initial pool water volume and isotopic signature figs 8 and 9 in a semi arid environment the time period is limited by changes between the dry and wet season sampling on a monthly basis allows us to illustrate and interpret a first order of evaporation and the pool refilling variation signal probably a weekly sampling will improve the evolution of the evaporation process and will likely show a second order of signal variation during wet season highlighting the role of the gentle evaporation process during the weeks without rain as previously shown the monthly monitoring deeply increases the scope of the c g model in this way the c g model is not just a method to estimate the punctual maximum evaporation but also a reliable tool to illustrate the lake s hydrodynamics through the years fig 9 various authors have tried to relate both isotopic and physical evaporation estimations with more or less significant success alazard et al 2015 blaney and criddle 1950 bowen 1926 gibson et al 1999 2016 gonfiantini 1986 hamon 1960 makkink 1957 penman 1948 1956 skrzypek et al 2015 valiantzas 2006 both isotopic and physical methodologies show a comparable evaporation process during the dry season when there is no precipitation or water input into the water body however during the rainy season this comparison is no longer representative to overcome this issue we included precipitation in the penman monteith estimation fig 4b in order to transform it to an evaporation precipitation mass balance allowing us to compare both methods the comparison between both physic and isotopic methods is illustrated in fig 10 the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o estimated f show a similar sinusoidal distribution with the maximum evaporation accumulation during the final stages of the dry season april 2016 and june 2017 and a progressive mixing of reservoirs during the wet season the low initial isotopic ratio suggests a hydraulic recuperation of the pool initial volume which is not possible to be estimated as isotopic estimations can not be negative on the contrary the penman monteith mass balance shows a similar biannual sinusoidal distribution however when precipitation exceeds evaporation a negative shift can be observed august and september 2016 indicating that this water volume is available to recharge the sjrb in 2017 the physic and isotopic estimations show different patterns particularly during june and july the isotopic method presents a rapid drop below the initial values while the physic method presents a smoother evolution this behavior difference can be explained by the geographic representation of both methods the physical method is representative of the punctual meteorological conditions obtained from the weather station while the craig gordon method is a mass balance between air vapor and remnant liquid phase from the pool water during the wet season the pool water is not only filed up by local precipitation but also with micro basin runoff which significantly increases the water input in the mass balance system finally the craig gordon method is an isotopic mass balance in which the estimate of the evaporated fraction f is calculated based on the initial and final isotopic composition of water in the reservoir the variation of this period daily monthly or annual has a significant impact of the f estimation fig 9a the evaporation estimates based on the penman monteith method are determined on daily basis and will not be affected by time sampling variation fig 4a the penman monteith and the c g evaporation methods were designed to illustrate an apparently simple process evaporation but by their intrinsic nature they really reflect different aspects of the same process the information obtained by both methods are not redundant and directly comparable but complementary and are useful to better illustrate the evaporation process in a hydrologic basin 8 conclusion this study revisits isotope mass balance concepts that have been developed and applied in various climatic regions over the past five decades however few detailed studies have been conducted in semiarid region environments the enhanced seasonality of the semiarid continental environment of our study site provided an ideal setting for natural experimental testing of basic field approaches for characterizing c g isotopic model within a highly variable atmospheric and hydrologic system we systematically report water isotopic signatures from rainfall atmospheric vapor and agricultural pools providing an integral framework to reliably solve the c g isotopic model we establish the first isotopic framework at a basin scale to guide the interpretation and monitoring of isotopic signatures in mexico we highlight the usage of monthly isotopic signatures to improve the representing and tracing water in the sjr semiarid basin it was found that in an environment with extreme seasonality the evaporation rates vary dramatically and the evaporation process is not well represented as a linear model the c g isotopic model represents the evaporation process only during the dry season when no other water sources such as rain atmospheric vapor and or groundwater perturb the pool isotopic variation during the wet season the c g isotopic model does not longer illustrate the evaporation process but the isotopic water balance in pools the c g isotopic model was applied in conjunction with a conventional physical evaporation model to constrain and compare short term monthly water balance variations in pools beyond a common objective of representing the evaporation rate and process the isotopic and physical models cannot be compared they are complementary approaches which are useful in the understanding of the evaporation process meaning in hydrologic basin declaration of competing interest the

5392,as the largest dry forest of the continent the south american chaco covers a broad latitudinal gradient 18 33 s with extremely flat topography homogeneous vegetation structure and similar summer rain regime despite high deforestation rates chaco is still dominated by native forests offering a unique opportunity to explore the role of biophysical controls dictated by latitudinal gradients on its hydrological functioning in this study we used grace derived satellite data climatic information and river flow records to analyse the seasonality of total water storage and its relationship with climatic factors and plant activity across the whole latitudinal gradient of the chaco region our results showed a strong reduction in the intensity and duration of the hydrological dry period towards the southern and more temperate portion in despite similar rainfall seasonality mean seasonal fluctuation of water storage was three times higher 119 1 46 0 vs 38 6 12 4 mm year 1 for the northern 26 s than for the southern chaco portion 26 s a pattern that matched the river flow seasonality of the main rivers of the region a higher temporal coupling of rainfall and actual evapotranspiration towards the south appears to drive the observed latitudinal hydrological shift highlighting the importance of atmospheric water demand and plant activity regulating the water cycle at chaco regional scale keywords hydrological seasonality grace total water storage potential and actual evapotranspiration south american chaco 1 introduction the south american chaco a vast plain of more than 1 million km2 hosts the second largest forest biome of the continent and one of the most biodiverse dry forests of the world bucher and huszar 1995 it extends from the subtropical lowlands of bolivia and paraguay to the temperate plains of central argentina despite its large latitudinal range the chaco has a uniform summer rain regime and forests with similar structure dominated by species of the genus aspidosperma and prosopis and it has been historically considered as a single biogeographical unit for these reasons gonz√°lez roglich et al 2012 maldonado et al 2006 morello and ad√°moli 1974 morello and hortt 1985 like in other dry forests of the world seasonal fluctuations in water availability shape multiple aspects of ecosystem structure and functioning ranging from their total biomass net primary productivity phenology to their albedo and energy balance gasparri and baldi 2013 gonz√°lez roglich et al 2012 houspanossian et al 2016 souza et al 2016 understanding how rainfall seasonality translates into water availability and more generally into hydrological seasonality is critical in the context of interactive changes in climate and land use also it requires a closer attention not just to water inputs but to water stocks and losses which are typically dominated by evapotranspirative fluxes in these type of ecosystems eagleson 1982 in addition while most of the focus of climatic controls on the functioning of water limited ecosystems like the chaco has been put on precipitation kumagai et al 2004 it remains unclear to what extent actual evapotranspiration may influence the water cycle the large latitudinal gradient of the chaco offers a unique opportunity to explore this issue in the spatial dimension which encompasses a broad range of solar radiation mean temperature and thermal seasonality under a similar rainfall regime and a relatively homogeneous geomorphology and forest structure these conditions offer an ideal scenario to explore the interplay between climate and vegetation regulating the water balance in dry regions through their influence on evapotranspiration regimes because of the large spatial extent of chaco one of the most cost effective ways to assess water balance at this scale is through remote sensing in the last decades the advance of remote sensing technology has remarkably helped to improve our knowledge on different ecosystem processes the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace can accurately determine the variations in earth s gravity field and correlate them with variations in water storage terrestrial water storage tws is a key variable captured by grace and it has been successfully used as indicator of groundwater depletion drought and flood conditions at regional scale and across the globe khaki and awange 2019 rodell et al 2009 syed et al 2008 grace is also a valuable tool to study water dynamics at large scales with a good temporal monthly resolution felfelani et al 2017 landerer and swenson 2012 tapley et al 2004 the chaco latitudinal span offers a suitable ground for applying grace to explore how biophysical gradients shape water storage dynamics in this study we analyse the seasonality of total water storage and the intensity and extent of the seasonal dry down cycles i e dry season in hydrological terms across the whole latitudinal chaco gradient 18 33 s the main objective was to explore if changes in hydrological seasonality through the latitudinal gradient are explained by the effects of climate driving potential evapotranspiration pet and its components or by the direct effect of vegetation activity through actual evapotranspiration aet this physical vs biophysical aspect of climate control over the water cycle has been poorly explored but may be critical to understand the water resources dynamics in dry subtropical to temperate regions like the chaco 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area encompasses the chaco region between latitudes 18 and 33 s and longitudes 68 and 59 w the region is a sedimentary plain that comprises part of argentina 62 paraguay 25 bolivia 12 and brazil 1 fig 1 two key environmental features shape the hydrology of the chaco region one is its negative climatic water balance potential evapotranspiration precipitation resulting from high temperatures and limited rainfall inputs and the second is the flat topography regional slopes 0 1 that limits runoff and horizontal groundwater fluxes at regional scales jobb√°gy et al 2009 weins 2013 in terms of geomorphology the whole region is covered by young soils developed on aeolian and alluvial sediments transported from the andes zarate 2003 beyond local differences the region is quite uniform formed by silty clay loess of medium coarse grain size with abundant quartz and volcanic glass sayago 1995 which differentiates from the southern neighbour the silty sand loess of the temperate pampas grain size and mineralogical differences are due mainly to post depositional processes regulated by local and regional climate sayago 1995 zarate 2003 all the rivers that cross the study area have their sources out of the plains on the eastern slopes of the andes or on isolated hill ranges towards the south with no tributaries originating in the studied areas iriondo et al 2000 fig 1 chaco rains are predominantly convective and determined by the south american monsoon circulation system which occurs mostly between november and april in the region vera et al 2006 annual precipitation ranges from 400 mm in the west to 1200 mm in the east and is mainly controlled by the south american low level jet sallj an important component of this monsoon system which determines the circulation and transport of warm and moist air along the oriental slope of the andes by strong surface winds from the atlantic ocean and the amazon region marengo et al 2004 pushing the monsoonal systems southward beyond the subtropical belt into temperate latitudes this region also experiences the passage of periodic cold fronts from the south which produce drastic drops in air temperature throughout the whole year espinoza et al 2013 garreaud and wallace 1998 mean annual temperatures decline from 30 to 20 c from north to south with monthly means ranges from 34 c in summer to 3 c in the winter diurnal thermal amplitudes are higher towards the dry west and during the winter dry season iriondo 1993 chaco vegetation shows a homogenous physiognomy being dominated by xerophytic trees of both evergreen aspidosperma quebracho blanco and schinopsis balansae and deciduous propopis spp leaf habit species accompanied by a closed shrub stratum and a less abundant herbaceous understory the chaco is currently subject to a rapid replacement of forests by annual crops soybean and maize and pastures which tend to expand in clusters or hotspots of large scale houspanossian et al 2016 the incorporation of new farming technologies and a growing global grain demand explain the accelerated expansion of farming over the chaco forests however and despite its rapid transformation the region is still dominated by large tracts of native forests which cover s percentage varies depending on the region ad√°moli et al 2011 mereles and rodas 2009 for the dry west part of chaco chaco seco and the espinal region the percentage of forest cover can reach up 70 of the territory mu√±oz garachana et al 2018 while for the more humid or eastern areas this value reaches only 30 40 ad√°moli et al 2011 in the west an overall continuous forest matrix is being perforated by agricultural hotspots whereas in the east the dominant matrix is cultivated and forest relicts of 7 330 ha are widespread mu√±oz garachana et al 2018 2 2 seasonality of terrestrial water storage terrestrial water storage tws which represents the total and integrated column of water above and below the earth surface was obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace landerer and swenson 2012 grace data from the three 1 1 grace level 2 data products the centre for space research at university of texas csr the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the german research centre for geosciences gfz were averaged to obtain a mean tws value for each grid cell kuppel et al 2014 tws from grace data have been previously used and successfully validated for south america especially for the amazonian region and other south american basins espinoza et al 2019 frappart et al 2012 2013 kuppel et al 2014 tws values were averaging correspondingly to each year month and season we estimated monthly annual and the mean seasonal range of tws for the latitudinal range 18 33 s and from april 2002 to december 2016 delta tws Œ¥tws for the whole series was estimated as the average of the differences between tws in november april the rainy season and tws in may october non rainy season this six month step in Œ¥tws captured the actual tws change between contrasting rainfall seasons while filtering out shorter term variability since chaco forests encompass a series of distinctive and widespread ecosystems oyarzabal et al 2018 we focus our analysis only on the chaco plains fig 1 where soils are similar regional slopes are less than 1 and the vegetation and forests structure are similar along the north south gradient fig 1 2 3 seasonality of chaco s river flows historic mean river flow data from the incoming and outcoming rivers of the chaco plains were used to assess the seasonality of river fluxes of the region river flow seasonality data were obtained from seven river gauge stations in the pilcomayo bermejo and salado rivers corresponding to the northern part of the chaco 20 26 and in the carcara√±a and its eastern tributaries saladillo ctalamochita and tortugas corresponding to the southern part of the chaco 32 33 fig 1 the mean values correspond to the period 1950 2013 argentine water resources office subsecretar√≠a de recursos h√≠dricos in order to analyse river flow independently of the basin size we considered relative seasonal anomalies of discharge with regard to mean annual values we estimated relative river flow seasonal dynamics by dividing each monthly value by the annual average value for the north 18 25 s and south 26 33 s section respectively we also compared the seasonal river flow differences along latitude by estimating for each gauge station the difference between the maximum monthly flow during the rainy season november to april and the minimum monthly flow during the non rainy season may to october river slopes were estimated based on a digital elevation model usgs 2004 2 4 seasonality of chaco s climate and vegetation we used the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b 42 product to obtain values of precipitation ppt for the whole region the 3b 42 has originally 0 25 0 25 and 3 h of spatial and temporal resolutions respectively but we subsequently merged the data to obtain a grid size of 1 1 on a monthly basis this global well known trmm product has shown disparate results depending of the target region of south america for some andean arid regions other satellites products or a combination of them with reanalysis have shown better performance rivera et al 2019 wongchuig correa et al 2017 satg√© et al 2017 however for the chaco plains a lower bias and a better spatial rainfall distribution has been found in comparison with other products such as the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap and or hydrological models maggioni et al 2016 zulkafli et al 2014 kuppel et al 2015 also found a good correlation between trmm and in situ precipitation data from this region actual evapotranspiration aet is an important variable in our analysis and usually high uncertainty is associated when it is estimated at large scale s√∂rensson and ruscica 2018 assessed the uncertainties of nine gridded et products for south america using land surface models reanalysis and remote sensing and they found an overestimation and underestimation of et for arid and wet regions respectively paca et al 2019 also analysed et products for the amazon basin showing good correlation and a lower bias between et estimated by remote sensing products and the energy balance residual method for this reasons we used two different sources of aet and a variable ppt Œ¥tws obtained by the difference between mean monthly precipitation and the mean monthly variation of tws aet was estimated for each month of the year 2002 2016 and for each grace grid cell with the following two approaches 1 we used the aet modis product from the mod16a2v006 aetmod16a2 and 2 the aet product from the monthly climate and climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces from university of idaho aetmcwb this last product was obtained by combining climatic data interpolation high spatial resolution climatological data from theworldclim dataset www worldclim org with coarser spatial resolution data fromcru ts4 0and thejapanese 55 year reanalysis jra55 the approach ppt Œ¥tws was compared with the two aet products by assuming that for chaco evapotranspiration is the main water output of this system and the rest of the water fluxes are negligible this assumption is based on the fact that native vegetation of chaco is able to evapotranspire all rainfall input leading to nil deep drainage contreras et al 2013 marchesini et al 2017 santoni et al 2010 and also by the fact that the extremely low slopes of the region 1 makes runoff very low these three different sources were comparable in magnitude and they showed similar seasonal and latitudinal tendencies and good agreement between them the ppt tws product versus the aetmcwb showed the best seasonal correlation r2 0 96 residual 6 6 mm month 1 followed by aet mcwb versus the aetmod16a2 r2 0 80 residual 10 8 mm month 1 and the ppt tws aetmod16a2 r2 0 71 residual 12 9 mm month 1 because the strong annual cycle we also performed correlations between these variables removing the seasonal trend on average the ppt tws vs aetmcwb showed the highest correlation r2 0 40 followed by aetmod16a2 versus ppt tws r2 0 30 and aet mcwb versus the aetmod16a2 r2 0 20 on the other hand annual correlations varied between 0 90 and 0 20 depending on the year considered as an important driver of the hydrological cycle we estimated potential evapotranspiration pet for each grid cell and then we correlate them with tws values observed with grace the pet used in this study was estimated on a monthly base for the period 2002 2016 following the fao pennman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the input variables for pet estimation were obtained from different sources net radiation data was obtained from the database of the clouds and the earth s radiant energy system ceres monthly air temperature mat wind speed wd and vapour pressure deficit vpd were obtained from the database of the climatic research unit cru cy v 4 01 and the psychrometric constant and the slope of vapour pressure from meteorological tables of fao allen et al 1998 in order to test our pet estimation we compared these values with the pet product from cru cy v 4 01 and observed a good agreement between them r2 0 97 residual 6 3 mm month 1 we analysed the seasonality of vegetation activity by using a satellite derived vegetation index for the same study period 2002 2016 based on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product from modis mod13c2v006 which was integrated to a monthly step for a 1 1 grid as a part of the discussion section we assessed if the changes observed in the hydrological seasonality along the latitudinal gradient could be explained by the replacement of forests by crops and pastures we used the modis product mdc12q1 to obtain the percentage of dry forest shrubland versus grassland pasture and annual cropland for each grid cell we correlated the fraction of each one of these three cover types with the tws seasonal range through the latitudinal chaco range mean monthly values of ndvi ppt and pet were calculated considering the series 2002 2016 then we estimated the seasonal rainy november to april and non rainy may to october components as the sum ppt pet or the average tws ndvi of each monthly variable considered before finally the conventional terms dry and wet season were replaced by the terms non rainy may to october and rainy november to april to differentiate the climatic dry period with no rain from the hydrological dry period with seasonal negative tws as they do not necessarily match due to the potential mismatch between seasonality of rains and tws 3 results 3 1 tws and river flow seasonality in spite of the homogeneous summer rain regime and forest structure terrestrial water storage tws dynamics in chaco showed a clear latitudinal shift in seasonality figs 2 3 5 and table 1 a strong tws seasonal fluctuation was observed in the northern and more subtropical chaco sub region 18 25 s but not in its southern and temperate counterpart 26 33 s fig 2 this latitudinal shift in tws determined a hydrological subdivision of the region that we called afterwards north and south chaco respectively the seasonal range of tws calculated as the difference between annual maxima and minima was 119 1 46 0 versus 38 6 12 4 mm year 1 temporal mean and its interannual standard deviation for the north and south chaco respectively the northern portion also presented a well defined period of five months august to december of negative tws evidencing a clear hydrological dry period compared to only one month of negative tws in the south fig 2 likewise the length of this period was shortened by one month per latitudinal degree becoming nil south of 26 latitude appendix fig a1 this latitudinal effect became clearly evidenced when the differences in Œ¥tws between the rainy and the non rainy season were compared between north and south chaco gradient table 1 for the north the average storage oscillation was 189 mm year 1 97 mm gains in the rainy season and 92 mm losses in the non rainy season while this value was only 12 mm year 1 for the southern chaco fig 5 table 1 in agreement with the seasonal results temporal scale the analysis at spatial scale pixel by pixel also showed a distinct pattern in Œ¥tws between the rainy and non rainy season across the latitudinal gradient fig 3a b when compared pixel by pixel those pixels from the south latitudes showed similar Œ¥tws between seasons on the contrary Œ¥tws for the north pixels were clearly contrasting between seasons latitudinal differences were less marked for ppt with homogeneous values for north south between seasons fig 3c d however when compared to north latitudes pet and ppt Œ¥tws were lower at south latitudes during the non rainy season for the rainy season instead these values were more uniform across the chaco fig 3 e g river flow seasonality differed between northern and southern watersheds and accompanied the trend observed for the tws seasonal range fig 4 the water flow in rivers of northern chaco showed a clear seasonality with maximum fluxes observed during february march and minimum during september october fig 4 by contrast the rivers of the south did not show such a clear seasonal behaviour and the annual fluxes were much lower than the north ones the ratio between the monthly maximum and minimum river flow declined from 40 6 in the northernmost watersheds to 3 3 in the group of southern watersheds fig 4 inset graph clearly evidencing the decreased river flow seasonality towards the south 3 2 evapotranspiration as a driver of hydrological seasonality the higher tws variation between the rainy and non rainy season in the north chaco 189 mm year compared to the almost negligible one found in the south chaco 12 mm year 1 table 1 fig 2 could be in part explained by climatic contrasts between both sub regions while in the whole chaco rainfall was more seasonal than pet these two variables became increasingly synchronous towards the south fig 5 table 1 the vertical water balance ppt pet was negative in both sub regions and seasons but displayed a stronger contrast between the rainy and non rainy season in the north compared to the south table 1 fig 5 observed net water losses in each sub region ppt Œ¥tws showed almost identical levels during the rainy season losses of 593 vs 580 mm but a stronger reduction in the non rainy season in the south 194 mm 67 compared to the north 339 mm 43 it is important to highlight that these contrasts between both regions during the non rainy season occurred under a similar climatic water balance ppt pet 497 and 440 mm for north and south respectively similar to ppt Œ¥tws aetmcbw values showed large differences between the rainy and non rainy season for south latitudes 431 vs 102 mm the aetmod16a2 product exhibited less differences than the other two products but also showed lower aet values for the south latitudes during the non rainy season 278 vs 207 mm for south and north respectively table 1 to summarize if north and south are compared during the rainy season a similar picture emerges in which both regions showed almost identical net water losses ppt tws 593 vs 580 mm table 1 besides small differences in rainfall 17 in the south and pet 8 in the south fig 5 table 1 in the non rainy season however a large latitudinal contrast unfolds with the south becoming relatively wetter with regard to the north fig 3 even though the south receives less rainfall than the north during this season 33 and has only a slightly lower pet 17 the lower observed net water losses ppt Œ¥tws 42 aet 34 aetmcwb and aetmmod16a2 29 suggest a more stable hydrological condition that could be explained by reduced vegetation activity during its cooler winter 3 3 ndvi and potential evapotranspiration components in chaco hydrological seasonality ndvi did not display strong seasonal differences along the north south gradient appendices a fig a2 for the south chaco however ndvi was 36 lower than in the north counterpart during the non rainy season indicating a larger decline in vegetation activity in the south compared to the north a sensitivity analysis of the atmospheric variables that drive pet indicated that lower solar radiation and lower vpd were the most important contributors to its slight decline towards the south in the non rainy season table 1 the effects of air temperature and wind speed seasonality over pet were lower however the lower mean temperature during the rainy season 26 2 vs 24 0 c and its sharper decline during the non rainy season 21 5 vs 15 5 c may limit water losses directly though reduced vegetation activity generating the strong drop observed in ppt Œ¥tws and aet 4 discussion given its uniform seasonal rain regime and forest structure the second biggest forest of the continent known as chaco has been traditionally studied as a uniform unit bucher and huszar 1995 kruck 1998 maldonado et al 2006 our results however revealed that this south american biome presents a contrasting hydrological behaviour between northern and southern latitudes with declining hydrological seasonality towards the more temperature south this latitudinal effect seems to be the result of both physical and biophysical influences of climate the physical influence of reduced potential evapotranspiration pet mainly explained by lower radiation and vapour pressure deficit in the non rainy season towards the south is complemented by an additional biophysical effect that limits actual evapotranspiration beyond the expected pet declines and may be the result of direct effects of temperature on vegetation activity our results agree with observations obtained by penatti et al 2015 for the pantanal region in brazil where northern areas showed intense and greatest anomalies in tws than the southern one the et in this area also exhibits a similar performance than in chaco with lower values in the south part of the region during the non rainy season for the pantanal however the cause of this north south tws differences is the existence of a massive surface flux of water running in the north south direction which determine the accumulation of water and floods in the south areas during the non rainy season and constrains productivity and et for chaco there is not such a connection since there is not river crossing the region from north to south so the tws differences across the gradient can only be explained by changes in the local water balances of each sub region others studies using grace also have found a strong spatial control of the tws by variables such as et and mainly ppt huang et al 2015 humphrey et al 2016 wang and li 2016 in our case the difference in precipitation between north and south seems unable per se to explain the large differences in seasonal terrestrial water storage shifts and supports previous regional scale findings highlighting the crucial role of mid latitude vegetation driving water storage changes throughout evapotranspiration syed et al 2008 tian et al 2018 the decline of aet and ppt Œ¥tws during the non rainy season in the south agree with eddy covariance data collected in southern chaco dry forests 33 464 s 66 459 w where measured evapotranspiration during the cold dry season was 73 less compared to the wet summer season 0 45 mm d 1 vs 1 7 mm d 1 garc√≠a et al 2017 also the gross ecosystem productivity gep during the dry season accounted for only 25 of the annual gross co2 uptake and ecosystem respiration was minimum during the winter season being less than 23 of the total annual flux garc√≠a et al 2017 two possible explanations for the southward evapotranspiration drop during the non rainy season include i lack of available water if water left over from the rainy season is precluded by a higher plant water demand in the southern summer of more temperate latitudes and ii lack of water consumption if water is available but its use is precluded by limited plant activity in the southern winter of more temperate latitudes on the one hand the complete use of rainfall by the vegetation in the south during the rainy season has been observed by the complete drying of soil profiles magliano et al 2017 marchesini et al 2013 supporting the first explanation i on the other hand the weak response of vegetation productivity to unusual large rainfall inputs during the non rainy season garc√≠a et al 2017 supports the second explanation in addition the low river flow seasonality fig 4 observed also support the last idea ii regarding to this moreira et al 2019 found for 50 basins in south america amazon la plata that et is regulated by a combination of rainfall and radiation but also by vegetation physiological activity rather than for one exclusive factor the possible connection between vegetation seasonality and the regulation of the water cycle at continental scale alerts about the possible consequences of the current widespread replacement of chaco native dry forest by croplands and pastures on the water transport through continental precipitation recycling and water buffering kuppel et al 2017 van der ent et al 2010 in this regard cultivation did not seem to have an important impact on the seasonal hydrological changes observed along the chaco latitudinal gradient appendices a fig a3 isolated north south grids with the same percentage of dry forest area showed similar tws range indicating no latitudinal effects of cultivation on tws range to understand this two factors need to be considered on one hand the region is still dominated by large areas of native forests 30 of the whole area is cultivated and on the other hand almost all cultivation in the chaco is non irrigated 99 siebert et al 2010 2007 subsecretar√≠a de recursos h√≠dricos 2004 implying a lower impact on tws strassberg et al 2009 noteworthy at present times the most clear effect of agriculture on terrestrial water storage have been associated with intense irrigation rodell et al 2018 while topographic lithological and geomorphological factors may play a role dictating regional contrasts in tws variation we do not consider them to be important in the latitudinal gradient of the chaco plains contrary to other regions of south america where tws variation can be linked to geomorphological traits alsdorf et al 2010 regional geomorphology is a homogenous variable across the chaco very low regional slopes between 0 1 and 0 6 fig 4 similar soil characteristics sayago 1995 zarate 2003 and origins iriondo 1993 are shared along the broad latitudinal gradient moreover and as it was mentioned in the methods section all those grace chaco s pixels belonging to areas with different eco hydro morphological characteristics from the plains were excluded from this analysis to conclude our findings highlight the importance of including a combination of variables such as pet and aet in the evaluation of ecosystems hydrological responses this is particularly relevant in regions like the chaco where vegetation plays a key role modulating large scale hydrological processes to that effect it is important to consider the value of combined approaches such as grace tws river flow and climatic analysis as regional water balance integrators 5 conclusions in this study we showed that despite its homogeneous vegetation structure and widespread summer rain regime the south american chaco presents a contrasting hydrological behaviour with a strong reduction in the intensity and duration of the hydrological dry period towards its southern temperate portion both grace derived satellite data and river flow records showed this decline of hydrological seasonality for the southern portion of the chaco 26 s we explain the lack of seasonality towards the south by the influence of reduced potential evapotranspiration explained by lower radiation and vapour pressure deficit complemented by an additional biophysical effect of limited actual evapotranspiration beyond the expected pet reduction this decline in aet and water losses ppt Œ¥tws may be the result of a direct reduction of vegetation activity by cooler winter temperatures in the south highlighting the key role of vegetation activity modulating large scale hydrological processes in these water limited ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement

5392,as the largest dry forest of the continent the south american chaco covers a broad latitudinal gradient 18 33 s with extremely flat topography homogeneous vegetation structure and similar summer rain regime despite high deforestation rates chaco is still dominated by native forests offering a unique opportunity to explore the role of biophysical controls dictated by latitudinal gradients on its hydrological functioning in this study we used grace derived satellite data climatic information and river flow records to analyse the seasonality of total water storage and its relationship with climatic factors and plant activity across the whole latitudinal gradient of the chaco region our results showed a strong reduction in the intensity and duration of the hydrological dry period towards the southern and more temperate portion in despite similar rainfall seasonality mean seasonal fluctuation of water storage was three times higher 119 1 46 0 vs 38 6 12 4 mm year 1 for the northern 26 s than for the southern chaco portion 26 s a pattern that matched the river flow seasonality of the main rivers of the region a higher temporal coupling of rainfall and actual evapotranspiration towards the south appears to drive the observed latitudinal hydrological shift highlighting the importance of atmospheric water demand and plant activity regulating the water cycle at chaco regional scale keywords hydrological seasonality grace total water storage potential and actual evapotranspiration south american chaco 1 introduction the south american chaco a vast plain of more than 1 million km2 hosts the second largest forest biome of the continent and one of the most biodiverse dry forests of the world bucher and huszar 1995 it extends from the subtropical lowlands of bolivia and paraguay to the temperate plains of central argentina despite its large latitudinal range the chaco has a uniform summer rain regime and forests with similar structure dominated by species of the genus aspidosperma and prosopis and it has been historically considered as a single biogeographical unit for these reasons gonz√°lez roglich et al 2012 maldonado et al 2006 morello and ad√°moli 1974 morello and hortt 1985 like in other dry forests of the world seasonal fluctuations in water availability shape multiple aspects of ecosystem structure and functioning ranging from their total biomass net primary productivity phenology to their albedo and energy balance gasparri and baldi 2013 gonz√°lez roglich et al 2012 houspanossian et al 2016 souza et al 2016 understanding how rainfall seasonality translates into water availability and more generally into hydrological seasonality is critical in the context of interactive changes in climate and land use also it requires a closer attention not just to water inputs but to water stocks and losses which are typically dominated by evapotranspirative fluxes in these type of ecosystems eagleson 1982 in addition while most of the focus of climatic controls on the functioning of water limited ecosystems like the chaco has been put on precipitation kumagai et al 2004 it remains unclear to what extent actual evapotranspiration may influence the water cycle the large latitudinal gradient of the chaco offers a unique opportunity to explore this issue in the spatial dimension which encompasses a broad range of solar radiation mean temperature and thermal seasonality under a similar rainfall regime and a relatively homogeneous geomorphology and forest structure these conditions offer an ideal scenario to explore the interplay between climate and vegetation regulating the water balance in dry regions through their influence on evapotranspiration regimes because of the large spatial extent of chaco one of the most cost effective ways to assess water balance at this scale is through remote sensing in the last decades the advance of remote sensing technology has remarkably helped to improve our knowledge on different ecosystem processes the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace can accurately determine the variations in earth s gravity field and correlate them with variations in water storage terrestrial water storage tws is a key variable captured by grace and it has been successfully used as indicator of groundwater depletion drought and flood conditions at regional scale and across the globe khaki and awange 2019 rodell et al 2009 syed et al 2008 grace is also a valuable tool to study water dynamics at large scales with a good temporal monthly resolution felfelani et al 2017 landerer and swenson 2012 tapley et al 2004 the chaco latitudinal span offers a suitable ground for applying grace to explore how biophysical gradients shape water storage dynamics in this study we analyse the seasonality of total water storage and the intensity and extent of the seasonal dry down cycles i e dry season in hydrological terms across the whole latitudinal chaco gradient 18 33 s the main objective was to explore if changes in hydrological seasonality through the latitudinal gradient are explained by the effects of climate driving potential evapotranspiration pet and its components or by the direct effect of vegetation activity through actual evapotranspiration aet this physical vs biophysical aspect of climate control over the water cycle has been poorly explored but may be critical to understand the water resources dynamics in dry subtropical to temperate regions like the chaco 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area encompasses the chaco region between latitudes 18 and 33 s and longitudes 68 and 59 w the region is a sedimentary plain that comprises part of argentina 62 paraguay 25 bolivia 12 and brazil 1 fig 1 two key environmental features shape the hydrology of the chaco region one is its negative climatic water balance potential evapotranspiration precipitation resulting from high temperatures and limited rainfall inputs and the second is the flat topography regional slopes 0 1 that limits runoff and horizontal groundwater fluxes at regional scales jobb√°gy et al 2009 weins 2013 in terms of geomorphology the whole region is covered by young soils developed on aeolian and alluvial sediments transported from the andes zarate 2003 beyond local differences the region is quite uniform formed by silty clay loess of medium coarse grain size with abundant quartz and volcanic glass sayago 1995 which differentiates from the southern neighbour the silty sand loess of the temperate pampas grain size and mineralogical differences are due mainly to post depositional processes regulated by local and regional climate sayago 1995 zarate 2003 all the rivers that cross the study area have their sources out of the plains on the eastern slopes of the andes or on isolated hill ranges towards the south with no tributaries originating in the studied areas iriondo et al 2000 fig 1 chaco rains are predominantly convective and determined by the south american monsoon circulation system which occurs mostly between november and april in the region vera et al 2006 annual precipitation ranges from 400 mm in the west to 1200 mm in the east and is mainly controlled by the south american low level jet sallj an important component of this monsoon system which determines the circulation and transport of warm and moist air along the oriental slope of the andes by strong surface winds from the atlantic ocean and the amazon region marengo et al 2004 pushing the monsoonal systems southward beyond the subtropical belt into temperate latitudes this region also experiences the passage of periodic cold fronts from the south which produce drastic drops in air temperature throughout the whole year espinoza et al 2013 garreaud and wallace 1998 mean annual temperatures decline from 30 to 20 c from north to south with monthly means ranges from 34 c in summer to 3 c in the winter diurnal thermal amplitudes are higher towards the dry west and during the winter dry season iriondo 1993 chaco vegetation shows a homogenous physiognomy being dominated by xerophytic trees of both evergreen aspidosperma quebracho blanco and schinopsis balansae and deciduous propopis spp leaf habit species accompanied by a closed shrub stratum and a less abundant herbaceous understory the chaco is currently subject to a rapid replacement of forests by annual crops soybean and maize and pastures which tend to expand in clusters or hotspots of large scale houspanossian et al 2016 the incorporation of new farming technologies and a growing global grain demand explain the accelerated expansion of farming over the chaco forests however and despite its rapid transformation the region is still dominated by large tracts of native forests which cover s percentage varies depending on the region ad√°moli et al 2011 mereles and rodas 2009 for the dry west part of chaco chaco seco and the espinal region the percentage of forest cover can reach up 70 of the territory mu√±oz garachana et al 2018 while for the more humid or eastern areas this value reaches only 30 40 ad√°moli et al 2011 in the west an overall continuous forest matrix is being perforated by agricultural hotspots whereas in the east the dominant matrix is cultivated and forest relicts of 7 330 ha are widespread mu√±oz garachana et al 2018 2 2 seasonality of terrestrial water storage terrestrial water storage tws which represents the total and integrated column of water above and below the earth surface was obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace landerer and swenson 2012 grace data from the three 1 1 grace level 2 data products the centre for space research at university of texas csr the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the german research centre for geosciences gfz were averaged to obtain a mean tws value for each grid cell kuppel et al 2014 tws from grace data have been previously used and successfully validated for south america especially for the amazonian region and other south american basins espinoza et al 2019 frappart et al 2012 2013 kuppel et al 2014 tws values were averaging correspondingly to each year month and season we estimated monthly annual and the mean seasonal range of tws for the latitudinal range 18 33 s and from april 2002 to december 2016 delta tws Œ¥tws for the whole series was estimated as the average of the differences between tws in november april the rainy season and tws in may october non rainy season this six month step in Œ¥tws captured the actual tws change between contrasting rainfall seasons while filtering out shorter term variability since chaco forests encompass a series of distinctive and widespread ecosystems oyarzabal et al 2018 we focus our analysis only on the chaco plains fig 1 where soils are similar regional slopes are less than 1 and the vegetation and forests structure are similar along the north south gradient fig 1 2 3 seasonality of chaco s river flows historic mean river flow data from the incoming and outcoming rivers of the chaco plains were used to assess the seasonality of river fluxes of the region river flow seasonality data were obtained from seven river gauge stations in the pilcomayo bermejo and salado rivers corresponding to the northern part of the chaco 20 26 and in the carcara√±a and its eastern tributaries saladillo ctalamochita and tortugas corresponding to the southern part of the chaco 32 33 fig 1 the mean values correspond to the period 1950 2013 argentine water resources office subsecretar√≠a de recursos h√≠dricos in order to analyse river flow independently of the basin size we considered relative seasonal anomalies of discharge with regard to mean annual values we estimated relative river flow seasonal dynamics by dividing each monthly value by the annual average value for the north 18 25 s and south 26 33 s section respectively we also compared the seasonal river flow differences along latitude by estimating for each gauge station the difference between the maximum monthly flow during the rainy season november to april and the minimum monthly flow during the non rainy season may to october river slopes were estimated based on a digital elevation model usgs 2004 2 4 seasonality of chaco s climate and vegetation we used the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b 42 product to obtain values of precipitation ppt for the whole region the 3b 42 has originally 0 25 0 25 and 3 h of spatial and temporal resolutions respectively but we subsequently merged the data to obtain a grid size of 1 1 on a monthly basis this global well known trmm product has shown disparate results depending of the target region of south america for some andean arid regions other satellites products or a combination of them with reanalysis have shown better performance rivera et al 2019 wongchuig correa et al 2017 satg√© et al 2017 however for the chaco plains a lower bias and a better spatial rainfall distribution has been found in comparison with other products such as the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap and or hydrological models maggioni et al 2016 zulkafli et al 2014 kuppel et al 2015 also found a good correlation between trmm and in situ precipitation data from this region actual evapotranspiration aet is an important variable in our analysis and usually high uncertainty is associated when it is estimated at large scale s√∂rensson and ruscica 2018 assessed the uncertainties of nine gridded et products for south america using land surface models reanalysis and remote sensing and they found an overestimation and underestimation of et for arid and wet regions respectively paca et al 2019 also analysed et products for the amazon basin showing good correlation and a lower bias between et estimated by remote sensing products and the energy balance residual method for this reasons we used two different sources of aet and a variable ppt Œ¥tws obtained by the difference between mean monthly precipitation and the mean monthly variation of tws aet was estimated for each month of the year 2002 2016 and for each grace grid cell with the following two approaches 1 we used the aet modis product from the mod16a2v006 aetmod16a2 and 2 the aet product from the monthly climate and climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces from university of idaho aetmcwb this last product was obtained by combining climatic data interpolation high spatial resolution climatological data from theworldclim dataset www worldclim org with coarser spatial resolution data fromcru ts4 0and thejapanese 55 year reanalysis jra55 the approach ppt Œ¥tws was compared with the two aet products by assuming that for chaco evapotranspiration is the main water output of this system and the rest of the water fluxes are negligible this assumption is based on the fact that native vegetation of chaco is able to evapotranspire all rainfall input leading to nil deep drainage contreras et al 2013 marchesini et al 2017 santoni et al 2010 and also by the fact that the extremely low slopes of the region 1 makes runoff very low these three different sources were comparable in magnitude and they showed similar seasonal and latitudinal tendencies and good agreement between them the ppt tws product versus the aetmcwb showed the best seasonal correlation r2 0 96 residual 6 6 mm month 1 followed by aet mcwb versus the aetmod16a2 r2 0 80 residual 10 8 mm month 1 and the ppt tws aetmod16a2 r2 0 71 residual 12 9 mm month 1 because the strong annual cycle we also performed correlations between these variables removing the seasonal trend on average the ppt tws vs aetmcwb showed the highest correlation r2 0 40 followed by aetmod16a2 versus ppt tws r2 0 30 and aet mcwb versus the aetmod16a2 r2 0 20 on the other hand annual correlations varied between 0 90 and 0 20 depending on the year considered as an important driver of the hydrological cycle we estimated potential evapotranspiration pet for each grid cell and then we correlate them with tws values observed with grace the pet used in this study was estimated on a monthly base for the period 2002 2016 following the fao pennman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the input variables for pet estimation were obtained from different sources net radiation data was obtained from the database of the clouds and the earth s radiant energy system ceres monthly air temperature mat wind speed wd and vapour pressure deficit vpd were obtained from the database of the climatic research unit cru cy v 4 01 and the psychrometric constant and the slope of vapour pressure from meteorological tables of fao allen et al 1998 in order to test our pet estimation we compared these values with the pet product from cru cy v 4 01 and observed a good agreement between them r2 0 97 residual 6 3 mm month 1 we analysed the seasonality of vegetation activity by using a satellite derived vegetation index for the same study period 2002 2016 based on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product from modis mod13c2v006 which was integrated to a monthly step for a 1 1 grid as a part of the discussion section we assessed if the changes observed in the hydrological seasonality along the latitudinal gradient could be explained by the replacement of forests by crops and pastures we used the modis product mdc12q1 to obtain the percentage of dry forest shrubland versus grassland pasture and annual cropland for each grid cell we correlated the fraction of each one of these three cover types with the tws seasonal range through the latitudinal chaco range mean monthly values of ndvi ppt and pet were calculated considering the series 2002 2016 then we estimated the seasonal rainy november to april and non rainy may to october components as the sum ppt pet or the average tws ndvi of each monthly variable considered before finally the conventional terms dry and wet season were replaced by the terms non rainy may to october and rainy november to april to differentiate the climatic dry period with no rain from the hydrological dry period with seasonal negative tws as they do not necessarily match due to the potential mismatch between seasonality of rains and tws 3 results 3 1 tws and river flow seasonality in spite of the homogeneous summer rain regime and forest structure terrestrial water storage tws dynamics in chaco showed a clear latitudinal shift in seasonality figs 2 3 5 and table 1 a strong tws seasonal fluctuation was observed in the northern and more subtropical chaco sub region 18 25 s but not in its southern and temperate counterpart 26 33 s fig 2 this latitudinal shift in tws determined a hydrological subdivision of the region that we called afterwards north and south chaco respectively the seasonal range of tws calculated as the difference between annual maxima and minima was 119 1 46 0 versus 38 6 12 4 mm year 1 temporal mean and its interannual standard deviation for the north and south chaco respectively the northern portion also presented a well defined period of five months august to december of negative tws evidencing a clear hydrological dry period compared to only one month of negative tws in the south fig 2 likewise the length of this period was shortened by one month per latitudinal degree becoming nil south of 26 latitude appendix fig a1 this latitudinal effect became clearly evidenced when the differences in Œ¥tws between the rainy and the non rainy season were compared between north and south chaco gradient table 1 for the north the average storage oscillation was 189 mm year 1 97 mm gains in the rainy season and 92 mm losses in the non rainy season while this value was only 12 mm year 1 for the southern chaco fig 5 table 1 in agreement with the seasonal results temporal scale the analysis at spatial scale pixel by pixel also showed a distinct pattern in Œ¥tws between the rainy and non rainy season across the latitudinal gradient fig 3a b when compared pixel by pixel those pixels from the south latitudes showed similar Œ¥tws between seasons on the contrary Œ¥tws for the north pixels were clearly contrasting between seasons latitudinal differences were less marked for ppt with homogeneous values for north south between seasons fig 3c d however when compared to north latitudes pet and ppt Œ¥tws were lower at south latitudes during the non rainy season for the rainy season instead these values were more uniform across the chaco fig 3 e g river flow seasonality differed between northern and southern watersheds and accompanied the trend observed for the tws seasonal range fig 4 the water flow in rivers of northern chaco showed a clear seasonality with maximum fluxes observed during february march and minimum during september october fig 4 by contrast the rivers of the south did not show such a clear seasonal behaviour and the annual fluxes were much lower than the north ones the ratio between the monthly maximum and minimum river flow declined from 40 6 in the northernmost watersheds to 3 3 in the group of southern watersheds fig 4 inset graph clearly evidencing the decreased river flow seasonality towards the south 3 2 evapotranspiration as a driver of hydrological seasonality the higher tws variation between the rainy and non rainy season in the north chaco 189 mm year compared to the almost negligible one found in the south chaco 12 mm year 1 table 1 fig 2 could be in part explained by climatic contrasts between both sub regions while in the whole chaco rainfall was more seasonal than pet these two variables became increasingly synchronous towards the south fig 5 table 1 the vertical water balance ppt pet was negative in both sub regions and seasons but displayed a stronger contrast between the rainy and non rainy season in the north compared to the south table 1 fig 5 observed net water losses in each sub region ppt Œ¥tws showed almost identical levels during the rainy season losses of 593 vs 580 mm but a stronger reduction in the non rainy season in the south 194 mm 67 compared to the north 339 mm 43 it is important to highlight that these contrasts between both regions during the non rainy season occurred under a similar climatic water balance ppt pet 497 and 440 mm for north and south respectively similar to ppt Œ¥tws aetmcbw values showed large differences between the rainy and non rainy season for south latitudes 431 vs 102 mm the aetmod16a2 product exhibited less differences than the other two products but also showed lower aet values for the south latitudes during the non rainy season 278 vs 207 mm for south and north respectively table 1 to summarize if north and south are compared during the rainy season a similar picture emerges in which both regions showed almost identical net water losses ppt tws 593 vs 580 mm table 1 besides small differences in rainfall 17 in the south and pet 8 in the south fig 5 table 1 in the non rainy season however a large latitudinal contrast unfolds with the south becoming relatively wetter with regard to the north fig 3 even though the south receives less rainfall than the north during this season 33 and has only a slightly lower pet 17 the lower observed net water losses ppt Œ¥tws 42 aet 34 aetmcwb and aetmmod16a2 29 suggest a more stable hydrological condition that could be explained by reduced vegetation activity during its cooler winter 3 3 ndvi and potential evapotranspiration components in chaco hydrological seasonality ndvi did not display strong seasonal differences along the north south gradient appendices a fig a2 for the south chaco however ndvi was 36 lower than in the north counterpart during the non rainy season indicating a larger decline in vegetation activity in the south compared to the north a sensitivity analysis of the atmospheric variables that drive pet indicated that lower solar radiation and lower vpd were the most important contributors to its slight decline towards the south in the non rainy season table 1 the effects of air temperature and wind speed seasonality over pet were lower however the lower mean temperature during the rainy season 26 2 vs 24 0 c and its sharper decline during the non rainy season 21 5 vs 15 5 c may limit water losses directly though reduced vegetation activity generating the strong drop observed in ppt Œ¥tws and aet 4 discussion given its uniform seasonal rain regime and forest structure the second biggest forest of the continent known as chaco has been traditionally studied as a uniform unit bucher and huszar 1995 kruck 1998 maldonado et al 2006 our results however revealed that this south american biome presents a contrasting hydrological behaviour between northern and southern latitudes with declining hydrological seasonality towards the more temperature south this latitudinal effect seems to be the result of both physical and biophysical influences of climate the physical influence of reduced potential evapotranspiration pet mainly explained by lower radiation and vapour pressure deficit in the non rainy season towards the south is complemented by an additional biophysical effect that limits actual evapotranspiration beyond the expected pet declines and may be the result of direct effects of temperature on vegetation activity our results agree with observations obtained by penatti et al 2015 for the pantanal region in brazil where northern areas showed intense and greatest anomalies in tws than the southern one the et in this area also exhibits a similar performance than in chaco with lower values in the south part of the region during the non rainy season for the pantanal however the cause of this north south tws differences is the existence of a massive surface flux of water running in the north south direction which determine the accumulation of water and floods in the south areas during the non rainy season and constrains productivity and et for chaco there is not such a connection since there is not river crossing the region from north to south so the tws differences across the gradient can only be explained by changes in the local water balances of each sub region others studies using grace also have found a strong spatial control of the tws by variables such as et and mainly ppt huang et al 2015 humphrey et al 2016 wang and li 2016 in our case the difference in precipitation between north and south seems unable per se to explain the large differences in seasonal terrestrial water storage shifts and supports previous regional scale findings highlighting the crucial role of mid latitude vegetation driving water storage changes throughout evapotranspiration syed et al 2008 tian et al 2018 the decline of aet and ppt Œ¥tws during the non rainy season in the south agree with eddy covariance data collected in southern chaco dry forests 33 464 s 66 459 w where measured evapotranspiration during the cold dry season was 73 less compared to the wet summer season 0 45 mm d 1 vs 1 7 mm d 1 garc√≠a et al 2017 also the gross ecosystem productivity gep during the dry season accounted for only 25 of the annual gross co2 uptake and ecosystem respiration was minimum during the winter season being less than 23 of the total annual flux garc√≠a et al 2017 two possible explanations for the southward evapotranspiration drop during the non rainy season include i lack of available water if water left over from the rainy season is precluded by a higher plant water demand in the southern summer of more temperate latitudes and ii lack of water consumption if water is available but its use is precluded by limited plant activity in the southern winter of more temperate latitudes on the one hand the complete use of rainfall by the vegetation in the south during the rainy season has been observed by the complete drying of soil profiles magliano et al 2017 marchesini et al 2013 supporting the first explanation i on the other hand the weak response of vegetation productivity to unusual large rainfall inputs during the non rainy season garc√≠a et al 2017 supports the second explanation in addition the low river flow seasonality fig 4 observed also support the last idea ii regarding to this moreira et al 2019 found for 50 basins in south america amazon la plata that et is regulated by a combination of rainfall and radiation but also by vegetation physiological activity rather than for one exclusive factor the possible connection between vegetation seasonality and the regulation of the water cycle at continental scale alerts about the possible consequences of the current widespread replacement of chaco native dry forest by croplands and pastures on the water transport through continental precipitation recycling and water buffering kuppel et al 2017 van der ent et al 2010 in this regard cultivation did not seem to have an important impact on the seasonal hydrological changes observed along the chaco latitudinal gradient appendices a fig a3 isolated north south grids with the same percentage of dry forest area showed similar tws range indicating no latitudinal effects of cultivation on tws range to understand this two factors need to be considered on one hand the region is still dominated by large areas of native forests 30 of the whole area is cultivated and on the other hand almost all cultivation in the chaco is non irrigated 99 siebert et al 2010 2007 subsecretar√≠a de recursos h√≠dricos 2004 implying a lower impact on tws strassberg et al 2009 noteworthy at present times the most clear effect of agriculture on terrestrial water storage have been associated with intense irrigation rodell et al 2018 while topographic lithological and geomorphological factors may play a role dictating regional contrasts in tws variation we do not consider them to be important in the latitudinal gradient of the chaco plains contrary to other regions of south america where tws variation can be linked to geomorphological traits alsdorf et al 2010 regional geomorphology is a homogenous variable across the chaco very low regional slopes between 0 1 and 0 6 fig 4 similar soil characteristics sayago 1995 zarate 2003 and origins iriondo 1993 are shared along the broad latitudinal gradient moreover and as it was mentioned in the methods section all those grace chaco s pixels belonging to areas with different eco hydro morphological characteristics from the plains were excluded from this analysis to conclude our findings highlight the importance of including a combination of variables such as pet and aet in the evaluation of ecosystems hydrological responses this is particularly relevant in regions like the chaco where vegetation plays a key role modulating large scale hydrological processes to that effect it is important to consider the value of combined approaches such as grace tws river flow and climatic analysis as regional water balance integrators 5 conclusions in this study we showed that despite its homogeneous vegetation structure and widespread summer rain regime the south american chaco presents a contrasting hydrological behaviour with a strong reduction in the intensity and duration of the hydrological dry period towards its southern temperate portion both grace derived satellite data and river flow records showed this decline of hydrological seasonality for the southern portion of the chaco 26 s we explain the lack of seasonality towards the south by the influence of reduced potential evapotranspiration explained by lower radiation and vapour pressure deficit complemented by an additional biophysical effect of limited actual evapotranspiration beyond the expected pet reduction this decline in aet and water losses ppt Œ¥tws may be the result of a direct reduction of vegetation activity by cooler winter temperatures in the south highlighting the key role of vegetation activity modulating large scale hydrological processes in these water limited ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement

5393,the performances of hydrological models in arid areas are significantly lower than other climates the reasons are numerous from the scales involved to specific processes and the lack of adequate measurements effective parameters have been often observed to change between runoff events limiting the predictive capacity of the models we look at the problems that can be found in an operational setting and present an analysis to improve the understanding of the errors our method characterizes the conditions where the model fails systematically and the conditions where the parameterization holds between floods we applied kineros2 to 24 years of radar rainfall and streamflow data in 6 arid catchments a glue probabilistic framework is used to characterize model performance and a method is developed to identify floods with similar calibration the analysis shows that uninformative conditions are difficult to generalize a basin specific analysis can help to identify conditions where the model fails and exclude them from calibration despite the large uncertainties similar catchments display groups of floods with similar parameterization in some basin we find that it is important to quantify antecedent moisture conditions hydrological models show some consistency within limited conditions these conditions however depend on the errors involved and are site specific there is some potential for parameter transfer but proximity alone might not be enough and other factors such as mean annual rainfall or storm type should be taken into account keywords rainfall runoff arid glue kineros2 uncertainty flash flood 1 introduction more than a third of the earth is covered by arid land where water has a critical importance both in terms of water resources and natural hazards mostly flash floods hirschboeck 1988 despite the extent of these areas low population density in these regions resulted in fewer scientific studies as compared to more densely populated areas characterized in temperate climates one of the main efforts to fill this gap was the g wadi initiative by unesco in 2005 that produced the book of wheater et al 2007 rainfall runoff modelling can help to develop informed water management and to reduce threats coming from extremes however in arid areas the performance of these models is significantly worse than temperate areas wheater et al 2007 in arid areas hydro meteorological processes are characterized by small spatial and temporal scales and the sparse monitoring networks have issues to accurately capture such variability marra and morin 2018 morin et al 2020 the essential controls of runoff in arid areas are similar to those of temperate areas but the differences in forcing mostly related with rainfall and surface characteristics cause large differences in runoff generation goodrich et al 1997 thornes 2009 in the following paragraph we outline the main characteristics of the components involved in runoff generation for a detailed description we refer to parsons and abrahams 2009 wheater et al 2007 rainfall in arid areas is often seasonal with irregular intervals and large inter annual variability compared to more humid areas single storms are characterized by smaller space and time scales often have higher precipitation intensities and deliver lower total amounts of precipitation zoccatelli et al 2019 because of the low soil development and large rock outcrops soil and geology have a high influence on water infiltration despite being scarce vegetation has an important role in shaping soil properties and increasing infiltration the dynamics of the unsaturated soil zone has a minor impact on infiltration compared with surface properties other factors influencing infiltration include stone disposition soil crust and faunal activity the spatial distribution of infiltration capacity is highly variable and overland flow moving along hillslopes can infiltrate before reaching the channel with hillslope connectivity driving runoff generation also during intense events yair and raz yassif 2004 during runoff propagation over alluvial areas a fraction of water can infiltrate this fraction of infiltrated runoff named transmission losses can be significant even during large floods and it is highly variable in space goodrich et al 1997 because of the high data requirements the presence of processes specific to this climate and the low data availability rainfall runoff models generally have poor performances in arid areas al qurashi et al 2008 bahat et al 2009 mcintyre and al qurashi 2009 yatheendradas et al 2008 yatheendradas et al 2008 pointed out that even in an experimental catchment no parameterization is able to represent all floods and that most uncertainties come from the inaccurate description of the inputs due to low runoff rainfall signal to input ratios the uncertainties noise in inputs can impart substantial error in predicted runoff high noise to signal ratio goodrich et al 2012 this has consequences on the identifiability of rainfall runoff models and strongly limits their predictive capacity additionally inaccuracies in the description of rainfall and runoff in arid areas increase epistemic errors creating disinformation not all the data are informative for model calibration and hypothesis testing beven and westerberg 2011 and this is particularly important for arid areas disinformative data create unsolvable problems in calibration causing the modelling to fail andr√©assian et al 2007 how to deal with epistemic errors and how to separate informative and disinformative data sets is still an open issue in hydrology beven and westerberg 2011 and it is essential to develop reliable rainfall runoff models in arid areas investing time on the analysis of negative results is not common in hydrology but as pointed out by andr√©assian et al 2010 we believe it is a fundamental step to improve the modelling process in arid areas in this study we want to characterize the performance of rainfall runoff modeling in arid areas with three main objectives identify conditions where the model has clear problems to reproduce the observations understand if with a specific calibration for each event the simulations are able to reproduce all the rainfall runoff properties derived from catchment scale observations identify conditions where the model calibration holds across multiple floods we apply the kineros2 physically based semi distributed rainfall runoff model specific for arid areas and use the glue probabilistic framework beven and binley 1992 to quantify predictive uncertainties multiple floods occurred over a 24 year period in six gauged arid catchments in the eastern mediterranean are examined using high resolution radar rainfall estimates 5 min 1 km2 large uncertainties are expected from operational discharge data and radar rainfall estimates over such a large spatial and temporal interval however such a dataset encompassing multiple catchments and floods is unique for arid areas and allows to characterize issues that are common during real applications compare results among multiple catchments and identify site specific issues 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area six catchments were selected for this study based on data availability from operational stream gauges the catchments are located in the dry areas of the eastern mediterranean region between the lee side of the judean mountains and the negev desert fig 1 table 1 mean annual precipitation map within the 3 northern catchments decreases sharply from west to east from 570 to 50 mm year 1 in the southern catchments the map within the catchments is more homogeneous close to or below 100 mm year 1 rain seasonality is very strong with precipitation between october and may and a dry hot summer rain is caused mostly by mid latitude cyclones over the eastern mediterranean connected with local convection belachsen et al 2017 kahana et al 2002 less frequently a low pressure trough extending along the red sea can bring significant localized precipitation kahana et al 2002 sharon and kutiel 1986 rarely subtropical jet related storms also known as tropical plumes can generate widespread and intense floods armon et al 2018 table 1 reports also the range of aridity index the relief ratio defined as the ratio between the total relief of a basin and its longest dimension parallel to the principal drainage line and the range of rainfall and runoff for the floods analyzed in this study more information about the hydro meteorology of these basins can be found in zoccatelli et al 2019 in the judean mountains cretaceous carbonate rocks are exposed forming narrow gorges draining east to the dead sea elevation ranges from roughly 1000 m a s l to 400 m a s l few cities and cultivated areas occupy the upper part mostly covered in luvisols while the lower part is characterized by low urbanization low vegetation cover and less developed lithosols the negev desert is a heterogeneous combination of several stratigraphic groups with different hydraulic properties shentsis et al 1999 large areas are covered by lithosols with long sections of the channel bed covered in alluviums urban areas are sporadic as well as vegetation cover 2 2 data availability and uncertainties streamflow data come from the hydrometric stations of the israel hydrological service israeli hydrological service 2016 radar data are from the shacham weather radar a c band system operational from the early 90s until 2014 corrections and gauge adjustments have been performed on precipitation estimates resulting in a homogeneous archive with 1 km2 and 5 min resolution from 1990 to 2014 marra and morin 2015 besides these adjustments owing to the large spatial variability of precipitation in desert areas we applied a further event based correction using a multiplicative mean field bias with daily rain gauges from the israel meteorological service within 20 km from the catchments fig 1 to ensure a minimum quality of the single flood events we have performed a selection based on multiple criteria as described more in detail by zoccatelli et al 2019 the criteria included availability of high quality radar data around the time of the flood and detection of clear inconsistencies between rainfall and runoff a hard threshold was used to exclude particularly small events runoff peak less than 0 5 m3 s 1 or mean catchment rainfall less than 3 mm because of their higher relative uncertainties during this analysis it became clear that observed runoff had timing errors sometimes in the order of hours that could undermine the analysis this is a known issue for the runoff data mostly due to the use of mechanical stream gauges morin et al 2009 because of these errors for each event we have calculated a temporal correction based on its maximum temporal correlation with an agwa automated geospatial watershed assessment tool goodrich et al 2012 miller et al 2007 calibrated kineros2 application this allowed to correct clear timing errors and not to base our evaluation only on hydrograph shape which can result in the inclusion of unrealistic propagation parameters observed runoff had also significant uncertainties in hydrograph recession due to sediment deposit and channel diversion in most of the floods recorded part of the recession is reconstructed during data validation in addition unfortunately no quantification of runoff uncertainty is provided with the data record for more details on the uncertainties related with the datasets used in this study we refer to zoccatelli et al 2019 2 3 rainfall runoff model 2 3 1 model setup kineros2 is a widely used physically based rainfall runoff model it was chosen for this study because it is specifically developed to represent the hydrological processes of arid areas it has many applications in literature and it is simplified enough to permit a probabilistic application more details of the model can be found in woolhiser et al 1990 goodrich et al 2012 and semmens et al 2007 or the web site https www tucson ars ag gov kineros the catchment is simplified into a sequence of hillslope overland flow elements planar or curvilinear and channels rain falls on the hillslope elements the generated runoff is routed with interactive infiltration to the downstream boundary of the element and propagated through the channel network also with interactive infiltration for a more realistic treatment of channel transmission losses to the outlet rainfall is averaged over each hillslope and can be retained by vegetation up to the total storm depth runoff can be generated either by infiltration excess and infiltration capacity is a function of soil parameters and infiltrated depth recovery of infiltration capacity between storms is related to the movement of the wetting front in the soil water is propagated over the hillslope to its bottom through a kinematic routing that allows for water infiltration even if unidimensional this representation of hillslope runoff allows to account for a change in runoff contributing areas during floods with different intensity channel flow propagation is also represented by the kinematic wave approximation and allows for infiltration into the channel bed the model has been applied with a temporal resolution of 5 min the division of the catchments into single elements and the definition of the initial parameter estimates on each element is done using the automated geospatial watershed assessment agwa tool semmens et al 2007 the initiation of first order channels occur when the upstream contributing area reaches 2 5 km2 we note that this area is a compromise between accuracy and model performance as in arid climates this area is usually lower however sensitivity analyses showed no significant change in results at higher spatial resolutions the resulting overland flow model elements have a median area of 1 1 km2 and maximum of 18 5 km2 agwa uses widely available datasets of land cover and soils to define the model parameters the land cover at 25 m resolution is from a national database maarag http www hamaarag org il while the soil comes from the dsmw database fao et al 2009 for hillslopes the estimated parameters include rock percent suction head porosity hydraulic conductivity surface roughness and canopy cover for channels the estimations include surface roughness channel width and hydraulic conductivity the woolhiser coefficient affects channel infiltration reducing the wetted channel perimeter during low flow and was set to 0 15 the initial parameter estimates were used as a base for the successive model calibration described in section 3 the estimated parameters are uniform over each element and for their calibration a multiplicative coefficient is used to preserve the relation between single elements as estimated from the geospatial data sets channel infiltration was activated only in channels on alluvial beds identified through a database from the geological survey of israel while elsewhere water does not infiltrate in channels the radar record used here has gaps due to operational problems and therefore is not reliable for a continuous simulation of soil moisture to partially account for rainfall in the days before the flood we started the model simulation 2 days before the peak discharge with constant uniform initial soil moisture conditions equal to field capacity kineros2 can simulate the reduction of soil moisture during intervals without rainfall but does not include evapotranspiration which can be a problem for long storms of several days however these are untypical to desert regions 2 3 2 model calibration and validation the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue framework beven and binley 2014 1992 has been applied to quantify the uncertainties in model prediction under this framework it is argued that many sets of parameters can provide acceptable simulations called behavioral each of these acceptable parameter sets is linked to a measure of how acceptable it is to simulate the system called likelihood which is computed following a performance measure the results from behavioral sets weighted on their likelihood provide a confidence interval for the model simulated runoff implicitly accounting for parameters interactions model and observation errors for calibration we have selected the five kineros2 parameters that yatheendradas et al 2008 found to explain most of the variance of model response a total of 2000 combinations of multipliers for these parameters called parameter sets from now on have been sampled within the parameter space using a latin hypercube method table 2 for each parameter set the multipliers are uniformly applied to the initial agwa estimated values of all channel or hillslope elements to preserve the differences between the basin elements since our model calibration is based on multipliers to ensure a good sampling of the parameter space the latin hypercube was applied in a logarithmic space the number of parameter sets was chosen to provide stable statistics across multiple tests to measure model performance we selected a modified version of the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 that we will call kgep kgep measures the performance of the model to reproduce the observed hydrograph of a single flood and it is defined as 1 kgep 1 r 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 p 1 2 the terms r and Œ≤ are calculated comparing the observed and simulated hydrographs and they are identical to the ones described in gupta et al 2009 the term r is the linear correlation coefficient between observed and simulated runoff while Œ≤ is the difference in runoff depth normalized by the standard deviation of the observed runoff a new term p is introduced describing the ratio between the simulated and observed runoff peak q peak s i m q peak o b s compared to the original kge the term describing the error of flow variability was replaced by the error on peak discharge in flash floods typical of the study area peak discharge is easier to verify in post event surveys amponsah et al 2016 and it is one of the most important variables to be captured for hydrological applications like flood frequency analysis explicitly including peak discharge in the efficiency increases its importance in model calibration values of kgep equal to 1 indicate an optimal fit to the observations within the glue framework a threshold of performance needs to be selected to identify the limits of acceptability of the simulations a threshold of kgep equal to zero is used to identify behavioral sets of parameters this threshold was selected as a tradeoff between on one hand the large errors involved in the system and on the other hand a meaningful selection of the behavioral sets the threshold was defined a priori and it is a subjective decision within the glue methodology to calculate the likelihood the values of kgep are rescaled so that their sum is equal to one 2 l k j kge p k j m k g e p m j 0 k g e p m j k g e p k j 0 l k j 0 k g e p k j 0 where kge p k j is the kgep for flood k using parameter set j in each of the six catchments floods have been divided into calibration and validation groups table 3 the division was made ensuring that both groups had a similar number of events and that they contain a similar range of flood magnitudes the combination of likelihood measures in calibration was calculated as a sum of the likelihood of single floods rescaled so that the sum is equal to one the sum is chosen instead of a multiplicative operation because of the large errors involved floods have different behavioral parameter sets and a multiplication would result in the discard of almost all sets the likelihood from the calibration floods is applied to the validation group to assess model performances multiple indexes have been calculated to evaluate the results of the probabilistic simulation table 3 the first two indexes evaluate the performances of all the parameter sets while the others evaluate the prediction bounds calculated with the likelihood maxkgep is the maximum of the flood averaged kgep index asr is the median across floods of the fraction of behavioral sets p90ci sometimes referred to as containing ratio is the median across floods of the ratio of the number of observed discharges enveloped by the 90 prediction bounds to the total number of the observed discharges expressed as a percentage xiong et al 2009 arbw is the median across floods of the average relative band width defined as the width of the 90 confidence interval of simulated runoff divided by the observations xiong et al 2009 p90ci and arbw use the likelihood calculated in calibration they can be used to evaluate the model performance in validation 2 4 statistics for data analysis the statistics that have been used to describe rainfall runoff properties through the analysis are rain intensity is the maximum 1 hour rainfall over a square window of 9 km2 moving inside the catchment it represents the intensity of the storm core runoff coefficient is calculated as the ratio between surface runoff volume separated with the filter of arnold and allen 1999 to be consistent with other studies and rainfall volume rain correlation distance is calculated as marra and morin 2018 on rainfall intensities over a 30 min moving window it characterizes the spatial concentration of the rainfall system that generated the flood lag time is the time between the center of mass of the generating rainfall and the runoff peak peak to volume ratio is the ratio between peak discharge and surface runoff volume a high value indicates a peaky hydrograph shape number of runoff peaks is calculated as runoff peaks higher than half of the main peak of the event and separated by at least 1 h hydrograph recession is the time between the main peak and when runoff returns below 0 1 m 3 s 1 it characterizes the processes involved in the slower part of runoff antecedent rain is rainfall over the catchment in the 10 days before the flood it is measured from radar and corrected with a multiplicative mean field bias with daily rain gauges similarly to what described in section 2 2 its value is related with the soil moisture conditions at the start of the flood 3 results table 3 indicates poor model results similar to what reported by yatheendradas et al 2008 but can give us an indication of the problems in our setup the negative maxkgep is associated with the fact that a single set of parameters has high variability of performance across multiple floods low asr and arbw are related to a significant number of floods having a very low fraction of behavioral sets the fact that no calibration has consistent results across all floods means that no set of parameters has acceptable performances for all floods despite the initial control on data quality the model clearly fails to represent some of the floods when no behavioral parameter sets are found within the parameter space or when their number is extremely limited the model is likely having significant difficulties to represent the observations this failed model performance can be related both to problematic model structure or inconsistencies in the data beven and binley 2014 even if it is difficult to evaluate single parameters in a glue framework we note that during calibration rahaf and zin waterfall are characterized by an extremely low saturated hydraulic conductivity about 0 2 mm h 1 about one order of magnitude lower than the other basins one of the factors that might explain this value is soil crusting which has been observed in the area by yair 1990 and it is not accounted for by the initial agwa parameterization in fig 2 we analyze the conditions where the model misrepresents the observations by looking at the floods with a limited number of behavioral parameter sets out of 134 floods analyzed the behavioral sets are less than 1 of the total for 49 of them a threshold of 1 on behavioral parameter sets was selected but depending on parameter space analyzed efficiency index used or other factors this threshold could change the results are presented with a division between the 3 northern catchments darga teqoa arugot and the three southern rahaf zin masos zin waterfall since these two groups appear to be consistent in the first group we have 72 floods with 30 having less than 1 behavioral sets and in the second group we have 62 floods with 19 having less than 1 behavioral sets in fig 2 we can see a clear difference between northern a and southern b catchments in the first group the model has difficulties to represent floods that have high rainfall and low peak discharge runoff coefficients for these floods are very low generally less than 1 these inconsistencies could be interpreted as difficulties to estimate high rainfall or low runoff in these catchments southern catchments show a similar behavior but the larger noise seems to prevent to have a significant separation the only exception is that low performances here are characterized by long flood durations within the floods that can be represented by the model 1 in fig 2 the consistency of model parameterization increases but it is still not good this means that no parameter set performs well for all floods even if they seem to be described well by the model because of the low signal to input ratio the noise related with input uncertainties is relevant in many floods and affects model calibration to see how rainfall runoff properties are captured by the model in fig 3 we compare simulated and observed properties for floods with more than 1 behavioral parameters and examine the distribution of their ratios the simulated properties reported for each event are a weighted average between behavioral sets using their likelihood as a weight because the focus is on the capacity of the model to represent properties of single events likelihood is calculated separately between events as presented in section 3 similar properties are analyzed by zoccatelli et al 2019 both for desert and mediterranean areas fig 3 shows that under an event specific calibration the underestimation on runoff volume and recession time can be significant as noted in section 2 2 the observed hydrograph recession is often reconstructed and the model underestimation could be related with the uncertainties in the observation the other main properties are generally well captured by the kgep statistic particularly the peak discharge as observed from yatheendradas et al 2008 and in section 3 the variability of behavioral sets between events of the same catchment is an issue in arid areas for this reason we have tried to identify events with similar parameterization by looking at the amount of shared behavioral parameter sets to measure the association between parameterization of different floods we treat behavioral sets as binary variables and use the coefficient of colligation yule 1912 3 y k 1 k 2 ad b c ad b c where y k 1 k 2 is a measure of the similarity between parameter sets of floods k 1 and k 2 and the variables a b c d come from the confusion matrix k 2 non behavioral behavioral k 1 non behavioral a b behavioral c d to find groups of floods with similar parameterization the inverse of the coefficient of colligation is used as distance metric for a hierarchical cluster analysis yule coefficient was chosen because its value is not strongly related with the number of behavioral sets the cluster analysis is performed independently on each catchment using a weighted average distance between clusters sokal 1958 and fixed cutoff threshold of 1 on the inconsistency coefficient jain and dubes 1988 clusters of floods that share behavioral parameter sets are formed clusters with less than 3 floods are merged into a fictitious cluster no containing floods whose parameterization is not consistent with most of the others the catchment of darga was excluded from this analysis because only 5 floods have more than 1 behavioral for the other five catchments table 4 reports the number of floods and the performance statistics of the model calibrated within those clusters the likelihood used to calculate the statistics in table 4 is the mean across floods within the cluster model performances within the clusters improved significantly compared to table 3 even if they are calibrated on small and selected sub groups of floods table 4 indicates that sub groups of floods with consistent parameterization do exist in fig 4 we report the characteristics of rainfall and runoff within these clusters note that values lower than 0 1 have been raised to 0 1 for clarity conditions with consistent parameterization are different between catchments in arugot we have three small groups with distinct parameterizations that seem to be characterized by different rainfall depth in the two zin catchments which interestingly seem to display similar characteristics consistent groups seem to be characterized by different antecedent soil moisture conditions in all catchments floods without a consistent parameterization cover a wide range of conditions we can also compare the similarity of behavioral sets between catchments and clusters by looking at the average yule distance between floods of the clusters presented in fig 4 in table 5 the mean yule distance between behavioral sets of floods in different clusters is presented the comparison between cluster parameterizations highlights a remarkable difference between wet and dry catchments arugot presents two clusters consistent with teqoa and one consistent with arid catchments this last cluster is characterized by localized rainfall systems similar to the more arid climates within arid catchments there seems to be higher inconsistency zin waterfall follows a slightly different parameterization from other catchments while rahaf has parameters similar to zin masos despite the difference in area 4 discussion a total of 134 floods from six arid catchments were grouped in calibration and validation to evaluate the model performance in all the catchments analyzed no parameter set was effective across all floods and predictive uncertainty arbw was wide this is very similar to what observed by al qurashi et al 2008 and yatheendradas et al 2008 who attributed the lack of parameter consistency between events to the insufficient rainfall data quality typical of arid areas our use of operational rainfall and streamflow data increases even more epistemic errors and the parameter inconsistency can be expected compared with most previous studies the analysis on multiple catchments confirmed that this is a common issue in arid climate the characterization of conditions where the model performs poorly shown in fig 2 is a first step in the identification of uninformative data data affected by significant epistemic uncertainty can compromise model calibration and should be excluded their identification independent from model simulations is an open issue beven and westerberg 2011 and clear methodologies are missing because of their large epistemic errors arid areas would benefit largely from a methodology able to identify uninformative data currently the main model independent methodology is to evaluate the consistency between input and outputs rainfall and runoff which in arid areas is simplified by the clear flood separation however the preselection done in section 2 3 was not enough to exclude all uninformative floods while our analysis is model dependent we think that the use of a model developed for arid areas within a probabilistic framework is a setup flexible enough to identify the most clearly uninformative data to identify floods where the model has the largest problem in simulating representative observations we looked at cases with none or a very low number of behavioral simulations these floods are usually on the edge of the parameter space where the model needs to compensate for inconsistencies in the data this does not imply that the model works well for the other conditions where a problem of parameter consistencies remains as we see in table 4 in fig 2 floods with a very low number of behavioral parameters are different between the northern and southern catchments in the wetter catchments misrepresented conditions seem to be related with inconsistencies in the data and specifically very low runoff coefficients this could have been perhaps partially identified with a stricter preselection but floods with a runoff coefficient of about 1 are plausible in this climate in the three dryer catchments floods with a low number of behavioral simulations are instead characterized by runoff durations longer than about 1 day this could indicate some issue of the model in representing prolonged floods in these environments where the redistribution of soil moisture could have a higher impact on the hydrological response before calibrating a hydrological model a preliminary analysis of this kind can help to identify where the model does not perform well and either change the setup or help to set criteria to remove these conditions from the calibration despite not being able to provide a consistent calibration across flood events in fig 3 we can see that the model setup when calibrated on single floods is able to represent the main flood properties the kgep index introduced in this paper shows good performances on peak discharge which is an important parameter in arid areas while still capturing the main flood parameters the model setup has some issue with runoff volume and recession time which could be worth analyzing if those variables are of interest for the application at hand the easiest solution would probably be to use an efficiency index that weights more the variables of interest the fact that with a specific calibration the model is able to represent most of the hydrograph properties can be seen as another clue that most inconsistencies in calibration come from the correct representation of the data as suggested by faur√®s et al 1995 and goodrich et al 1994 we have presented a method to quantify parameter similarity within a glue framework in fig 4 we can see clusters of floods with consistent parameterization and look at their hydro meteorological properties we note conclusive results are difficult to obtain given the low number of floods in each cluster the discriminating factors between clusters seem site specific in arugot the parameterization difference between group 1 and 2 seems to be related to the total rainfall volume and the peak runoff this division of parameterization between high and low flows is frequently observed in different climates oudin et al 2006 and can be related with problems both of model structure or of data it is common to have epistemic errors related with magnitude of both rainfall and runoff estimation harmel et al 2006 villarini and krajewski 2010 while the change of dominant hydrological processes often influences effective parameters in the two zin catchments the parameterization seems related to the antecedent soil moisture conditions this highlights the importance of the description of antecedent conditions in arid areas confirming the study of goodrich et al 1994 the estimation of antecedent moisture condition in this area is challenging because of the difficulties to continuously quantify sparse rainfall and the lack of data for soil moisture calibration the use soil moisture estimations from satellite or re analysis products could help improving simulations in arid areas rahmani et al 2016 group no in fig 4 represents floods with non consistent parameterization in some catchment such as the two zin catchments this group identifies floods with high runoff peaks pointing at specific problems however in most catchments inconsistent floods cover a wider variety of conditions this indicates that in arid areas data uncertainty and parameter inconsistency are likely to come from multiple factors we do not have enough data for a study on parameter transfer but looking at the consistency between cluster of floods within few catchments we can draw some interesting observations we have developed an indicator to calculate the distance between flood parameterization table 5 and used it to find similarities between catchments the results highlight a remarkable difference in calibration between the most arid catchments and the others this can be either due to biases in regional measurements or other differences between the two regions that are not represented by agwa the agwa parameterization does show a difference between the northern and the southern catchments mostly due to differences in the soil however in arugot a cluster of 7 floods has rainfall and parameterization similar to the drier areas this could indicate that for this case the initial parameterizations generated by agwa did capture the difference between the two areas and that the different parameters could be related with rainfall types on the other side the coherence between similar catchments is a sign of stability in the parameterization as noted by parajka et al 2013 and kennedy et al 2013 because of the high spatial heterogeneity and non linear processes parameter transfer by proximity alone in arid areas does not work properly similarity in climate as found by singh et al 2014 in arid areas of usa but also rainfall structure seem the main factors that govern a successful parameter transfer in this region 5 conclusions rainfall runoff modelling in arid areas is understudied and presents extreme challenges that are yet to be solved hydrological simulations typically have poor performances and optimal parameter sets are not consistent between floods the main reason is often identified in the small spatial and temporal scale of the hydro meteorological processes involved and consequently high data uncertainty in this study we want to take advantage of a unique operational flood database to study the issues related with rainfall runoff modelling in arid areas the representation of multiple catchments and the setup specific for arid basins allow to identify what issues are specific to single basins and what are common the aim is to present a methodology that helps to characterize conditions where the hydrological model fails and to understand how we can improve the consistency of simulations the main conclusions are large uncertainties from different sources prevent to have an optimal calibration that holds across all floods however consistent calibrations can be found across subgroups of floods conditions where the model clearly fails to represent the observations are site specific in the wetter catchments they seem to be related with low runoff coefficients and possibly inconsistency in the data in the more arid catchments the model seems to have problems simulating longer floods the analysis presented can help to identify clearly uninformative conditions to either correct them or remove them from the calibration when a single flood calibration is performed the proposed kgep efficiency index in conjunction with kineros2 is able to capture satisfactorily the targeted flood properties we introduce a methodology able to identify groups of floods with similar parameterization within a glue probabilistic framework the main factors influencing parameterization within an arid catchment are found to be rainfall volumes and antecedent moisture conditions antecedent moisture is confirmed to have an influence on runoff generation and a better description could improve the stability of model parameters despite large uncertainties a remarkable similarity of parameters has been found between groups of floods in different catchments parameter similarity seems to be related with similarities in climate as already found in the literature but also in rainfall properties rainfall runoff modelling in arid areas suffers from significant uncertainties particularly in operational conditions that are strongly limiting the predictive power monitoring strategies can be improved with the use of modern weather radar a higher number of stream gauges and more careful data handling a decrease of the uncertainties together with a better understanding of the error structure and the identification of the limits of the model predictive capacity would be the first steps toward an effective flood forecasting system in arid areas credit authorship contribution statement d zoccatelli conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis writing

5393,the performances of hydrological models in arid areas are significantly lower than other climates the reasons are numerous from the scales involved to specific processes and the lack of adequate measurements effective parameters have been often observed to change between runoff events limiting the predictive capacity of the models we look at the problems that can be found in an operational setting and present an analysis to improve the understanding of the errors our method characterizes the conditions where the model fails systematically and the conditions where the parameterization holds between floods we applied kineros2 to 24 years of radar rainfall and streamflow data in 6 arid catchments a glue probabilistic framework is used to characterize model performance and a method is developed to identify floods with similar calibration the analysis shows that uninformative conditions are difficult to generalize a basin specific analysis can help to identify conditions where the model fails and exclude them from calibration despite the large uncertainties similar catchments display groups of floods with similar parameterization in some basin we find that it is important to quantify antecedent moisture conditions hydrological models show some consistency within limited conditions these conditions however depend on the errors involved and are site specific there is some potential for parameter transfer but proximity alone might not be enough and other factors such as mean annual rainfall or storm type should be taken into account keywords rainfall runoff arid glue kineros2 uncertainty flash flood 1 introduction more than a third of the earth is covered by arid land where water has a critical importance both in terms of water resources and natural hazards mostly flash floods hirschboeck 1988 despite the extent of these areas low population density in these regions resulted in fewer scientific studies as compared to more densely populated areas characterized in temperate climates one of the main efforts to fill this gap was the g wadi initiative by unesco in 2005 that produced the book of wheater et al 2007 rainfall runoff modelling can help to develop informed water management and to reduce threats coming from extremes however in arid areas the performance of these models is significantly worse than temperate areas wheater et al 2007 in arid areas hydro meteorological processes are characterized by small spatial and temporal scales and the sparse monitoring networks have issues to accurately capture such variability marra and morin 2018 morin et al 2020 the essential controls of runoff in arid areas are similar to those of temperate areas but the differences in forcing mostly related with rainfall and surface characteristics cause large differences in runoff generation goodrich et al 1997 thornes 2009 in the following paragraph we outline the main characteristics of the components involved in runoff generation for a detailed description we refer to parsons and abrahams 2009 wheater et al 2007 rainfall in arid areas is often seasonal with irregular intervals and large inter annual variability compared to more humid areas single storms are characterized by smaller space and time scales often have higher precipitation intensities and deliver lower total amounts of precipitation zoccatelli et al 2019 because of the low soil development and large rock outcrops soil and geology have a high influence on water infiltration despite being scarce vegetation has an important role in shaping soil properties and increasing infiltration the dynamics of the unsaturated soil zone has a minor impact on infiltration compared with surface properties other factors influencing infiltration include stone disposition soil crust and faunal activity the spatial distribution of infiltration capacity is highly variable and overland flow moving along hillslopes can infiltrate before reaching the channel with hillslope connectivity driving runoff generation also during intense events yair and raz yassif 2004 during runoff propagation over alluvial areas a fraction of water can infiltrate this fraction of infiltrated runoff named transmission losses can be significant even during large floods and it is highly variable in space goodrich et al 1997 because of the high data requirements the presence of processes specific to this climate and the low data availability rainfall runoff models generally have poor performances in arid areas al qurashi et al 2008 bahat et al 2009 mcintyre and al qurashi 2009 yatheendradas et al 2008 yatheendradas et al 2008 pointed out that even in an experimental catchment no parameterization is able to represent all floods and that most uncertainties come from the inaccurate description of the inputs due to low runoff rainfall signal to input ratios the uncertainties noise in inputs can impart substantial error in predicted runoff high noise to signal ratio goodrich et al 2012 this has consequences on the identifiability of rainfall runoff models and strongly limits their predictive capacity additionally inaccuracies in the description of rainfall and runoff in arid areas increase epistemic errors creating disinformation not all the data are informative for model calibration and hypothesis testing beven and westerberg 2011 and this is particularly important for arid areas disinformative data create unsolvable problems in calibration causing the modelling to fail andr√©assian et al 2007 how to deal with epistemic errors and how to separate informative and disinformative data sets is still an open issue in hydrology beven and westerberg 2011 and it is essential to develop reliable rainfall runoff models in arid areas investing time on the analysis of negative results is not common in hydrology but as pointed out by andr√©assian et al 2010 we believe it is a fundamental step to improve the modelling process in arid areas in this study we want to characterize the performance of rainfall runoff modeling in arid areas with three main objectives identify conditions where the model has clear problems to reproduce the observations understand if with a specific calibration for each event the simulations are able to reproduce all the rainfall runoff properties derived from catchment scale observations identify conditions where the model calibration holds across multiple floods we apply the kineros2 physically based semi distributed rainfall runoff model specific for arid areas and use the glue probabilistic framework beven and binley 1992 to quantify predictive uncertainties multiple floods occurred over a 24 year period in six gauged arid catchments in the eastern mediterranean are examined using high resolution radar rainfall estimates 5 min 1 km2 large uncertainties are expected from operational discharge data and radar rainfall estimates over such a large spatial and temporal interval however such a dataset encompassing multiple catchments and floods is unique for arid areas and allows to characterize issues that are common during real applications compare results among multiple catchments and identify site specific issues 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area six catchments were selected for this study based on data availability from operational stream gauges the catchments are located in the dry areas of the eastern mediterranean region between the lee side of the judean mountains and the negev desert fig 1 table 1 mean annual precipitation map within the 3 northern catchments decreases sharply from west to east from 570 to 50 mm year 1 in the southern catchments the map within the catchments is more homogeneous close to or below 100 mm year 1 rain seasonality is very strong with precipitation between october and may and a dry hot summer rain is caused mostly by mid latitude cyclones over the eastern mediterranean connected with local convection belachsen et al 2017 kahana et al 2002 less frequently a low pressure trough extending along the red sea can bring significant localized precipitation kahana et al 2002 sharon and kutiel 1986 rarely subtropical jet related storms also known as tropical plumes can generate widespread and intense floods armon et al 2018 table 1 reports also the range of aridity index the relief ratio defined as the ratio between the total relief of a basin and its longest dimension parallel to the principal drainage line and the range of rainfall and runoff for the floods analyzed in this study more information about the hydro meteorology of these basins can be found in zoccatelli et al 2019 in the judean mountains cretaceous carbonate rocks are exposed forming narrow gorges draining east to the dead sea elevation ranges from roughly 1000 m a s l to 400 m a s l few cities and cultivated areas occupy the upper part mostly covered in luvisols while the lower part is characterized by low urbanization low vegetation cover and less developed lithosols the negev desert is a heterogeneous combination of several stratigraphic groups with different hydraulic properties shentsis et al 1999 large areas are covered by lithosols with long sections of the channel bed covered in alluviums urban areas are sporadic as well as vegetation cover 2 2 data availability and uncertainties streamflow data come from the hydrometric stations of the israel hydrological service israeli hydrological service 2016 radar data are from the shacham weather radar a c band system operational from the early 90s until 2014 corrections and gauge adjustments have been performed on precipitation estimates resulting in a homogeneous archive with 1 km2 and 5 min resolution from 1990 to 2014 marra and morin 2015 besides these adjustments owing to the large spatial variability of precipitation in desert areas we applied a further event based correction using a multiplicative mean field bias with daily rain gauges from the israel meteorological service within 20 km from the catchments fig 1 to ensure a minimum quality of the single flood events we have performed a selection based on multiple criteria as described more in detail by zoccatelli et al 2019 the criteria included availability of high quality radar data around the time of the flood and detection of clear inconsistencies between rainfall and runoff a hard threshold was used to exclude particularly small events runoff peak less than 0 5 m3 s 1 or mean catchment rainfall less than 3 mm because of their higher relative uncertainties during this analysis it became clear that observed runoff had timing errors sometimes in the order of hours that could undermine the analysis this is a known issue for the runoff data mostly due to the use of mechanical stream gauges morin et al 2009 because of these errors for each event we have calculated a temporal correction based on its maximum temporal correlation with an agwa automated geospatial watershed assessment tool goodrich et al 2012 miller et al 2007 calibrated kineros2 application this allowed to correct clear timing errors and not to base our evaluation only on hydrograph shape which can result in the inclusion of unrealistic propagation parameters observed runoff had also significant uncertainties in hydrograph recession due to sediment deposit and channel diversion in most of the floods recorded part of the recession is reconstructed during data validation in addition unfortunately no quantification of runoff uncertainty is provided with the data record for more details on the uncertainties related with the datasets used in this study we refer to zoccatelli et al 2019 2 3 rainfall runoff model 2 3 1 model setup kineros2 is a widely used physically based rainfall runoff model it was chosen for this study because it is specifically developed to represent the hydrological processes of arid areas it has many applications in literature and it is simplified enough to permit a probabilistic application more details of the model can be found in woolhiser et al 1990 goodrich et al 2012 and semmens et al 2007 or the web site https www tucson ars ag gov kineros the catchment is simplified into a sequence of hillslope overland flow elements planar or curvilinear and channels rain falls on the hillslope elements the generated runoff is routed with interactive infiltration to the downstream boundary of the element and propagated through the channel network also with interactive infiltration for a more realistic treatment of channel transmission losses to the outlet rainfall is averaged over each hillslope and can be retained by vegetation up to the total storm depth runoff can be generated either by infiltration excess and infiltration capacity is a function of soil parameters and infiltrated depth recovery of infiltration capacity between storms is related to the movement of the wetting front in the soil water is propagated over the hillslope to its bottom through a kinematic routing that allows for water infiltration even if unidimensional this representation of hillslope runoff allows to account for a change in runoff contributing areas during floods with different intensity channel flow propagation is also represented by the kinematic wave approximation and allows for infiltration into the channel bed the model has been applied with a temporal resolution of 5 min the division of the catchments into single elements and the definition of the initial parameter estimates on each element is done using the automated geospatial watershed assessment agwa tool semmens et al 2007 the initiation of first order channels occur when the upstream contributing area reaches 2 5 km2 we note that this area is a compromise between accuracy and model performance as in arid climates this area is usually lower however sensitivity analyses showed no significant change in results at higher spatial resolutions the resulting overland flow model elements have a median area of 1 1 km2 and maximum of 18 5 km2 agwa uses widely available datasets of land cover and soils to define the model parameters the land cover at 25 m resolution is from a national database maarag http www hamaarag org il while the soil comes from the dsmw database fao et al 2009 for hillslopes the estimated parameters include rock percent suction head porosity hydraulic conductivity surface roughness and canopy cover for channels the estimations include surface roughness channel width and hydraulic conductivity the woolhiser coefficient affects channel infiltration reducing the wetted channel perimeter during low flow and was set to 0 15 the initial parameter estimates were used as a base for the successive model calibration described in section 3 the estimated parameters are uniform over each element and for their calibration a multiplicative coefficient is used to preserve the relation between single elements as estimated from the geospatial data sets channel infiltration was activated only in channels on alluvial beds identified through a database from the geological survey of israel while elsewhere water does not infiltrate in channels the radar record used here has gaps due to operational problems and therefore is not reliable for a continuous simulation of soil moisture to partially account for rainfall in the days before the flood we started the model simulation 2 days before the peak discharge with constant uniform initial soil moisture conditions equal to field capacity kineros2 can simulate the reduction of soil moisture during intervals without rainfall but does not include evapotranspiration which can be a problem for long storms of several days however these are untypical to desert regions 2 3 2 model calibration and validation the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue framework beven and binley 2014 1992 has been applied to quantify the uncertainties in model prediction under this framework it is argued that many sets of parameters can provide acceptable simulations called behavioral each of these acceptable parameter sets is linked to a measure of how acceptable it is to simulate the system called likelihood which is computed following a performance measure the results from behavioral sets weighted on their likelihood provide a confidence interval for the model simulated runoff implicitly accounting for parameters interactions model and observation errors for calibration we have selected the five kineros2 parameters that yatheendradas et al 2008 found to explain most of the variance of model response a total of 2000 combinations of multipliers for these parameters called parameter sets from now on have been sampled within the parameter space using a latin hypercube method table 2 for each parameter set the multipliers are uniformly applied to the initial agwa estimated values of all channel or hillslope elements to preserve the differences between the basin elements since our model calibration is based on multipliers to ensure a good sampling of the parameter space the latin hypercube was applied in a logarithmic space the number of parameter sets was chosen to provide stable statistics across multiple tests to measure model performance we selected a modified version of the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 that we will call kgep kgep measures the performance of the model to reproduce the observed hydrograph of a single flood and it is defined as 1 kgep 1 r 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 p 1 2 the terms r and Œ≤ are calculated comparing the observed and simulated hydrographs and they are identical to the ones described in gupta et al 2009 the term r is the linear correlation coefficient between observed and simulated runoff while Œ≤ is the difference in runoff depth normalized by the standard deviation of the observed runoff a new term p is introduced describing the ratio between the simulated and observed runoff peak q peak s i m q peak o b s compared to the original kge the term describing the error of flow variability was replaced by the error on peak discharge in flash floods typical of the study area peak discharge is easier to verify in post event surveys amponsah et al 2016 and it is one of the most important variables to be captured for hydrological applications like flood frequency analysis explicitly including peak discharge in the efficiency increases its importance in model calibration values of kgep equal to 1 indicate an optimal fit to the observations within the glue framework a threshold of performance needs to be selected to identify the limits of acceptability of the simulations a threshold of kgep equal to zero is used to identify behavioral sets of parameters this threshold was selected as a tradeoff between on one hand the large errors involved in the system and on the other hand a meaningful selection of the behavioral sets the threshold was defined a priori and it is a subjective decision within the glue methodology to calculate the likelihood the values of kgep are rescaled so that their sum is equal to one 2 l k j kge p k j m k g e p m j 0 k g e p m j k g e p k j 0 l k j 0 k g e p k j 0 where kge p k j is the kgep for flood k using parameter set j in each of the six catchments floods have been divided into calibration and validation groups table 3 the division was made ensuring that both groups had a similar number of events and that they contain a similar range of flood magnitudes the combination of likelihood measures in calibration was calculated as a sum of the likelihood of single floods rescaled so that the sum is equal to one the sum is chosen instead of a multiplicative operation because of the large errors involved floods have different behavioral parameter sets and a multiplication would result in the discard of almost all sets the likelihood from the calibration floods is applied to the validation group to assess model performances multiple indexes have been calculated to evaluate the results of the probabilistic simulation table 3 the first two indexes evaluate the performances of all the parameter sets while the others evaluate the prediction bounds calculated with the likelihood maxkgep is the maximum of the flood averaged kgep index asr is the median across floods of the fraction of behavioral sets p90ci sometimes referred to as containing ratio is the median across floods of the ratio of the number of observed discharges enveloped by the 90 prediction bounds to the total number of the observed discharges expressed as a percentage xiong et al 2009 arbw is the median across floods of the average relative band width defined as the width of the 90 confidence interval of simulated runoff divided by the observations xiong et al 2009 p90ci and arbw use the likelihood calculated in calibration they can be used to evaluate the model performance in validation 2 4 statistics for data analysis the statistics that have been used to describe rainfall runoff properties through the analysis are rain intensity is the maximum 1 hour rainfall over a square window of 9 km2 moving inside the catchment it represents the intensity of the storm core runoff coefficient is calculated as the ratio between surface runoff volume separated with the filter of arnold and allen 1999 to be consistent with other studies and rainfall volume rain correlation distance is calculated as marra and morin 2018 on rainfall intensities over a 30 min moving window it characterizes the spatial concentration of the rainfall system that generated the flood lag time is the time between the center of mass of the generating rainfall and the runoff peak peak to volume ratio is the ratio between peak discharge and surface runoff volume a high value indicates a peaky hydrograph shape number of runoff peaks is calculated as runoff peaks higher than half of the main peak of the event and separated by at least 1 h hydrograph recession is the time between the main peak and when runoff returns below 0 1 m 3 s 1 it characterizes the processes involved in the slower part of runoff antecedent rain is rainfall over the catchment in the 10 days before the flood it is measured from radar and corrected with a multiplicative mean field bias with daily rain gauges similarly to what described in section 2 2 its value is related with the soil moisture conditions at the start of the flood 3 results table 3 indicates poor model results similar to what reported by yatheendradas et al 2008 but can give us an indication of the problems in our setup the negative maxkgep is associated with the fact that a single set of parameters has high variability of performance across multiple floods low asr and arbw are related to a significant number of floods having a very low fraction of behavioral sets the fact that no calibration has consistent results across all floods means that no set of parameters has acceptable performances for all floods despite the initial control on data quality the model clearly fails to represent some of the floods when no behavioral parameter sets are found within the parameter space or when their number is extremely limited the model is likely having significant difficulties to represent the observations this failed model performance can be related both to problematic model structure or inconsistencies in the data beven and binley 2014 even if it is difficult to evaluate single parameters in a glue framework we note that during calibration rahaf and zin waterfall are characterized by an extremely low saturated hydraulic conductivity about 0 2 mm h 1 about one order of magnitude lower than the other basins one of the factors that might explain this value is soil crusting which has been observed in the area by yair 1990 and it is not accounted for by the initial agwa parameterization in fig 2 we analyze the conditions where the model misrepresents the observations by looking at the floods with a limited number of behavioral parameter sets out of 134 floods analyzed the behavioral sets are less than 1 of the total for 49 of them a threshold of 1 on behavioral parameter sets was selected but depending on parameter space analyzed efficiency index used or other factors this threshold could change the results are presented with a division between the 3 northern catchments darga teqoa arugot and the three southern rahaf zin masos zin waterfall since these two groups appear to be consistent in the first group we have 72 floods with 30 having less than 1 behavioral sets and in the second group we have 62 floods with 19 having less than 1 behavioral sets in fig 2 we can see a clear difference between northern a and southern b catchments in the first group the model has difficulties to represent floods that have high rainfall and low peak discharge runoff coefficients for these floods are very low generally less than 1 these inconsistencies could be interpreted as difficulties to estimate high rainfall or low runoff in these catchments southern catchments show a similar behavior but the larger noise seems to prevent to have a significant separation the only exception is that low performances here are characterized by long flood durations within the floods that can be represented by the model 1 in fig 2 the consistency of model parameterization increases but it is still not good this means that no parameter set performs well for all floods even if they seem to be described well by the model because of the low signal to input ratio the noise related with input uncertainties is relevant in many floods and affects model calibration to see how rainfall runoff properties are captured by the model in fig 3 we compare simulated and observed properties for floods with more than 1 behavioral parameters and examine the distribution of their ratios the simulated properties reported for each event are a weighted average between behavioral sets using their likelihood as a weight because the focus is on the capacity of the model to represent properties of single events likelihood is calculated separately between events as presented in section 3 similar properties are analyzed by zoccatelli et al 2019 both for desert and mediterranean areas fig 3 shows that under an event specific calibration the underestimation on runoff volume and recession time can be significant as noted in section 2 2 the observed hydrograph recession is often reconstructed and the model underestimation could be related with the uncertainties in the observation the other main properties are generally well captured by the kgep statistic particularly the peak discharge as observed from yatheendradas et al 2008 and in section 3 the variability of behavioral sets between events of the same catchment is an issue in arid areas for this reason we have tried to identify events with similar parameterization by looking at the amount of shared behavioral parameter sets to measure the association between parameterization of different floods we treat behavioral sets as binary variables and use the coefficient of colligation yule 1912 3 y k 1 k 2 ad b c ad b c where y k 1 k 2 is a measure of the similarity between parameter sets of floods k 1 and k 2 and the variables a b c d come from the confusion matrix k 2 non behavioral behavioral k 1 non behavioral a b behavioral c d to find groups of floods with similar parameterization the inverse of the coefficient of colligation is used as distance metric for a hierarchical cluster analysis yule coefficient was chosen because its value is not strongly related with the number of behavioral sets the cluster analysis is performed independently on each catchment using a weighted average distance between clusters sokal 1958 and fixed cutoff threshold of 1 on the inconsistency coefficient jain and dubes 1988 clusters of floods that share behavioral parameter sets are formed clusters with less than 3 floods are merged into a fictitious cluster no containing floods whose parameterization is not consistent with most of the others the catchment of darga was excluded from this analysis because only 5 floods have more than 1 behavioral for the other five catchments table 4 reports the number of floods and the performance statistics of the model calibrated within those clusters the likelihood used to calculate the statistics in table 4 is the mean across floods within the cluster model performances within the clusters improved significantly compared to table 3 even if they are calibrated on small and selected sub groups of floods table 4 indicates that sub groups of floods with consistent parameterization do exist in fig 4 we report the characteristics of rainfall and runoff within these clusters note that values lower than 0 1 have been raised to 0 1 for clarity conditions with consistent parameterization are different between catchments in arugot we have three small groups with distinct parameterizations that seem to be characterized by different rainfall depth in the two zin catchments which interestingly seem to display similar characteristics consistent groups seem to be characterized by different antecedent soil moisture conditions in all catchments floods without a consistent parameterization cover a wide range of conditions we can also compare the similarity of behavioral sets between catchments and clusters by looking at the average yule distance between floods of the clusters presented in fig 4 in table 5 the mean yule distance between behavioral sets of floods in different clusters is presented the comparison between cluster parameterizations highlights a remarkable difference between wet and dry catchments arugot presents two clusters consistent with teqoa and one consistent with arid catchments this last cluster is characterized by localized rainfall systems similar to the more arid climates within arid catchments there seems to be higher inconsistency zin waterfall follows a slightly different parameterization from other catchments while rahaf has parameters similar to zin masos despite the difference in area 4 discussion a total of 134 floods from six arid catchments were grouped in calibration and validation to evaluate the model performance in all the catchments analyzed no parameter set was effective across all floods and predictive uncertainty arbw was wide this is very similar to what observed by al qurashi et al 2008 and yatheendradas et al 2008 who attributed the lack of parameter consistency between events to the insufficient rainfall data quality typical of arid areas our use of operational rainfall and streamflow data increases even more epistemic errors and the parameter inconsistency can be expected compared with most previous studies the analysis on multiple catchments confirmed that this is a common issue in arid climate the characterization of conditions where the model performs poorly shown in fig 2 is a first step in the identification of uninformative data data affected by significant epistemic uncertainty can compromise model calibration and should be excluded their identification independent from model simulations is an open issue beven and westerberg 2011 and clear methodologies are missing because of their large epistemic errors arid areas would benefit largely from a methodology able to identify uninformative data currently the main model independent methodology is to evaluate the consistency between input and outputs rainfall and runoff which in arid areas is simplified by the clear flood separation however the preselection done in section 2 3 was not enough to exclude all uninformative floods while our analysis is model dependent we think that the use of a model developed for arid areas within a probabilistic framework is a setup flexible enough to identify the most clearly uninformative data to identify floods where the model has the largest problem in simulating representative observations we looked at cases with none or a very low number of behavioral simulations these floods are usually on the edge of the parameter space where the model needs to compensate for inconsistencies in the data this does not imply that the model works well for the other conditions where a problem of parameter consistencies remains as we see in table 4 in fig 2 floods with a very low number of behavioral parameters are different between the northern and southern catchments in the wetter catchments misrepresented conditions seem to be related with inconsistencies in the data and specifically very low runoff coefficients this could have been perhaps partially identified with a stricter preselection but floods with a runoff coefficient of about 1 are plausible in this climate in the three dryer catchments floods with a low number of behavioral simulations are instead characterized by runoff durations longer than about 1 day this could indicate some issue of the model in representing prolonged floods in these environments where the redistribution of soil moisture could have a higher impact on the hydrological response before calibrating a hydrological model a preliminary analysis of this kind can help to identify where the model does not perform well and either change the setup or help to set criteria to remove these conditions from the calibration despite not being able to provide a consistent calibration across flood events in fig 3 we can see that the model setup when calibrated on single floods is able to represent the main flood properties the kgep index introduced in this paper shows good performances on peak discharge which is an important parameter in arid areas while still capturing the main flood parameters the model setup has some issue with runoff volume and recession time which could be worth analyzing if those variables are of interest for the application at hand the easiest solution would probably be to use an efficiency index that weights more the variables of interest the fact that with a specific calibration the model is able to represent most of the hydrograph properties can be seen as another clue that most inconsistencies in calibration come from the correct representation of the data as suggested by faur√®s et al 1995 and goodrich et al 1994 we have presented a method to quantify parameter similarity within a glue framework in fig 4 we can see clusters of floods with consistent parameterization and look at their hydro meteorological properties we note conclusive results are difficult to obtain given the low number of floods in each cluster the discriminating factors between clusters seem site specific in arugot the parameterization difference between group 1 and 2 seems to be related to the total rainfall volume and the peak runoff this division of parameterization between high and low flows is frequently observed in different climates oudin et al 2006 and can be related with problems both of model structure or of data it is common to have epistemic errors related with magnitude of both rainfall and runoff estimation harmel et al 2006 villarini and krajewski 2010 while the change of dominant hydrological processes often influences effective parameters in the two zin catchments the parameterization seems related to the antecedent soil moisture conditions this highlights the importance of the description of antecedent conditions in arid areas confirming the study of goodrich et al 1994 the estimation of antecedent moisture condition in this area is challenging because of the difficulties to continuously quantify sparse rainfall and the lack of data for soil moisture calibration the use soil moisture estimations from satellite or re analysis products could help improving simulations in arid areas rahmani et al 2016 group no in fig 4 represents floods with non consistent parameterization in some catchment such as the two zin catchments this group identifies floods with high runoff peaks pointing at specific problems however in most catchments inconsistent floods cover a wider variety of conditions this indicates that in arid areas data uncertainty and parameter inconsistency are likely to come from multiple factors we do not have enough data for a study on parameter transfer but looking at the consistency between cluster of floods within few catchments we can draw some interesting observations we have developed an indicator to calculate the distance between flood parameterization table 5 and used it to find similarities between catchments the results highlight a remarkable difference in calibration between the most arid catchments and the others this can be either due to biases in regional measurements or other differences between the two regions that are not represented by agwa the agwa parameterization does show a difference between the northern and the southern catchments mostly due to differences in the soil however in arugot a cluster of 7 floods has rainfall and parameterization similar to the drier areas this could indicate that for this case the initial parameterizations generated by agwa did capture the difference between the two areas and that the different parameters could be related with rainfall types on the other side the coherence between similar catchments is a sign of stability in the parameterization as noted by parajka et al 2013 and kennedy et al 2013 because of the high spatial heterogeneity and non linear processes parameter transfer by proximity alone in arid areas does not work properly similarity in climate as found by singh et al 2014 in arid areas of usa but also rainfall structure seem the main factors that govern a successful parameter transfer in this region 5 conclusions rainfall runoff modelling in arid areas is understudied and presents extreme challenges that are yet to be solved hydrological simulations typically have poor performances and optimal parameter sets are not consistent between floods the main reason is often identified in the small spatial and temporal scale of the hydro meteorological processes involved and consequently high data uncertainty in this study we want to take advantage of a unique operational flood database to study the issues related with rainfall runoff modelling in arid areas the representation of multiple catchments and the setup specific for arid basins allow to identify what issues are specific to single basins and what are common the aim is to present a methodology that helps to characterize conditions where the hydrological model fails and to understand how we can improve the consistency of simulations the main conclusions are large uncertainties from different sources prevent to have an optimal calibration that holds across all floods however consistent calibrations can be found across subgroups of floods conditions where the model clearly fails to represent the observations are site specific in the wetter catchments they seem to be related with low runoff coefficients and possibly inconsistency in the data in the more arid catchments the model seems to have problems simulating longer floods the analysis presented can help to identify clearly uninformative conditions to either correct them or remove them from the calibration when a single flood calibration is performed the proposed kgep efficiency index in conjunction with kineros2 is able to capture satisfactorily the targeted flood properties we introduce a methodology able to identify groups of floods with similar parameterization within a glue probabilistic framework the main factors influencing parameterization within an arid catchment are found to be rainfall volumes and antecedent moisture conditions antecedent moisture is confirmed to have an influence on runoff generation and a better description could improve the stability of model parameters despite large uncertainties a remarkable similarity of parameters has been found between groups of floods in different catchments parameter similarity seems to be related with similarities in climate as already found in the literature but also in rainfall properties rainfall runoff modelling in arid areas suffers from significant uncertainties particularly in operational conditions that are strongly limiting the predictive power monitoring strategies can be improved with the use of modern weather radar a higher number of stream gauges and more careful data handling a decrease of the uncertainties together with a better understanding of the error structure and the identification of the limits of the model predictive capacity would be the first steps toward an effective flood forecasting system in arid areas credit authorship contribution statement d zoccatelli conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis writing

5394,quantitatively describing complex natural systems and their processes is a challenging task additionally the random nature of these processes adds more difficulty to this problem this paper considers fracture networks as a system and the concepts of percolation theory and fractal geometry are combined to define the conductivity characteristics of such structures correlations between fracture network properties and network permeability are searched using the fractal dimensions box counting mass correlation dimensions of different fracture network features density length orientation connectivity distribution anisotropy the conditions of a strong relationship with different fractal characteristics and scale dependency of correlations are addressed the results will be useful in defining universal constants in scaling equations used to model transport processes in complex fracture network systems keywords fracture networks continuum percolation network permeability fractal dimensions underground reservoirs 1 introduction many phenomena in nature are complex and cannot be easily quantified using simple correlations this is more critical in geological occurrences due to the high degree of uncertainty emerging from the accessibility to subsurface data and difficulties in data collection natural fracture systems are one of these geological occurrences that are difficult to quantitatively describe for engineering applications a mathematical description of fracture systems is needed to define their mechanical and hydraulic characteristics to be eventually used in practical applications such as energy production from subsurface sources oil gas geothermal excavations mining tunnels dam and building construction earthquakes and contamination of underground aquifers although pure research constitutes an essential element of phenomena related to natural occurrences and processes in them quantification of the systems is needed for practical applications such quantification is also crucial to facilitate the research to both understand the phenomena and scrutinize the processes as lord william thomson kelvin put when you cannot express it in numbers your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind often practical applications require a single or set of equations correlations or a single number to be used in simulation studies this however may not be easy for even simple systems descriptive models using a single number such as fractal dimension mandelbrot 1982 golden ratio sinuosity and lacunarity could be useful in identifying complexities to some extent but more numbers are needed for better accuracy when describing complex systems and processes involved in high risk and big investments fracture systems are identified and modeled as a network using lines barton and larsen 1985 la pointe 1988 babadagli 2001 2d and discs hestir and long 1990 mourzenko et al 2005 adler et al 2013 3d or as a single fracture huitt 1956 witherspoon et al 1980 tsang 1984 develi and babadagli 1998 2015 sometimes even both li and li 2015 fig 1 this paper s focus is natural rock fracture networks mainly 2d and the universalization of correlations used for the permeability of these systems two theories were used in resolving the complexity of fracture networks fractal and percolation considerable work has been done on the fractal and percolation aspects of fracture network systems we begin with the review of these two approaches in sections 3 4 and 5 after the next section describing the problem and objective of this paper 2 statement of the problem objective of this review paper many different science and engineering disciplines deal with characterization of and applications on complex network systems specific interest in earth science and related disciplines leads to exploring the natural fracture systems embedded in rocks of which bring more difficulty compared to synthetic networks e g electrical circuits power lines it systems etc due to their random nature and lack of tangible data understanding the topological and geometrical characteristics of these natural fracture networks in quantitative terms and relating them to the mechanical and hydraulic behaviors also displayed is crucial conductivity of the fracture network is a critical parameter in many engineering applications including oil gas and geothermal fluid productions groundwater contamination and waste deposition in underground reservoirs the deterministic estimation of conductivity is technically and computationally difficult as well as time consuming due to the lack of data available for characterization and the random nature of the networks with this reality many different models have been proposed to estimate fracture network permeability as it is essential data for modeling any type of transport process in any underground reservoir one may classify these models for network permeability as deterministic or stochastic two issues are prominent in this practice 1 a well defined and validated typically empirical equation s b in conjunction with this independent parameters representing the characteristics of the networks to be used in said equations for the former percolation theory a stochastic approach was suggested in the 80 s requiring a correct definition of the percolation constants and exponents although this is theoretically possible for ordered systems if one uses ordinary percolation to describe the fracture network continuum percolation models that are more realistic make it highly challenging to describe the random nature of fracture network permeability no unique solutions with universal percolation constants have been proposed for these types of continuum models yet there are however different approaches to define them with specific geometrical and statistical fracture network descriptions one option is to correlate these constants or exponents to the fractal characteristics of fracture networks the objective of this paper is to provide both a summary and critical review of these approaches to guide researchers in their attempts to develop new correlations for fracture network permeability although this is a review paper an exercise on fractal characteristics of natural fracture networks is provided at the end the use of different fractal models or dimensions and measurement techniques have been tested for use in correlating the constants of continuum percolation equations used to estimate fracture network permeability 3 background of fracture network permeability models the simplest model of fracture permeability is based on the assumption of a single fracture described by two parallel plates the flow relationship the cubic law is described by huitt 1956 as follows idea first introduced much earlier by boussinesq in 1868 1 q 1 b 3 l 12 Œº Œ¥ p l where Œ¥ p is the pressure drop in the direction of flow l is the length of the fracture where the pressure drop occurs l is the width of the fracture perpendicular to the flow direction and Œº is the viscosity of fluid the aperture is b and volumetric rate q is proportional to b 3 from this relationship one may obtain the permeability kf by the following equation also known as the muskat equation 2 k f b 2 12 a single flat surface fracture model can be extended to a network model by adding multiple fractures parallel to each other which could be assumed as the simplest fracture network model 3 k f 4 54 10 6 w 3 i f if the width w is in inches if is the number of fractures per feet eq 3 in this form is useful for practical applications as fracture density can be readily obtained from well data cores or image logs it is a multiplication of single fracture permeability that can be estimated if the fracture width w is determined assuming that it is the same for all fractures by the fracture density number of fractures per feet hence the higher the density of fractures the higher the permeability of the fracture system composed of non intersecting multiple parallel fractures parsons 1966 considered a set of tilted but parallel fractures described by angle Œ± also incorporating the matrix permeability km 4 k fm k m e 1 3 c o s 2 Œ± 1 12 d 1 e n 3 c o s 2 Œ± n 12 d n f o r 1 n f r a c t u r e s e t s here k is permeability e is fracture width d is fracture spacing Œ± is the angle between axis of pressure gradient and fracture planes m f and fm are the indices for matrix fracture and fracture matrix combined respectively note however that fracture systems are naturally more complex and they need to be represented as a network model rather than systematically ordered single fracture systems in this case parameters other than aperture should be considered as independent variables therefore one step ahead is to introduce the values representing the characteristic network properties into fracture network permeability correlations quantification of fracture density length size connectivity orientation distribution type and aperture which makes the problem more complex is needed in this attempt for the quantification process the fractal characteristics of these properties can be used in several attempts analog models created for porous media were applied to estimate the permeability of fracture networks xu 2015 and babadagli and al salmi 2004 listed permeability correlations for porous media using fractal dimensions sahimi 1995 provided an extensive review of methods used to estimate the permeability of different porous structures here we take two of the most recent approaches as examples miao et al 2015 developed the following equation using the cubic law concept given in eq 1 and correlated the network permeability kf to the fractal dimension d f for the fracture length distribution 5a k f Œ≤ 3 d 128 1 d f 4 d f l max 3 1 cos 2 Œ± sin 2 Œ∏ 1 1 d f 2 d f this equation shows that the permeability is also a function of the structural parameters it includes maximum fracture length l max fracture density d fracture azimuth Œ± and facture dip angle Œ∏ as well as fracture porosity œï of the fracture network Œ≤ is a proportionality constant in a similar fashion wei and xia 2017 evaluated fracture network permeabilities correlated to fractal properties including the following relationship derived from xu et al 2006 5b k f d 0 2 32 1 n 1 d l 1 n m 1 d l 1 n 4 d d 1 d l 1 1 n 4 d d 1 d l 1 m 1 1 2 1 n 1 d l 1 n m d l 1 n 1 d l cos Œ∏ where d 0 is the diameter of the 0th branching level n is the branching number d l is the fractal dimension of channel length distribution d d is the fractal dimension for diameter distribution and m is the total branching level the fractal dimensions in eqs 5a and 5b are for the distributions of geometric network properties length and diameter respectively other tools for determining fractal dimensions to be used in a similar exercise are the ones representing the topological and geometrical features such as box counting bc sand box sb or scanning lines sl thus one step forward is relating the permeability to fractal characteristics of geometrical fracture properties derived from the above listed approaches a comprehensive exercise was performed by jafari and babadagli 2009 2011 by testing 12 characteristic values covering all fracture properties such as fracture density length connectivity orientation and aperture on synthetic random fracture networks they showed that four out of 12 parameters were sufficient to present a correlation for the network permeability and the following type of equation was found to be the most accurate jafari and babadagli 2009 6 l n k x 25 008 e x p 0 046 x 1 2 895 l n x 2 1 705 l n x 3 l n x 4 34 675 where kx denotes equivalent fracture network permeability in the x direction x1 is the box counting dimension of intersection points x2 is the maximum touch with scanning lines in the x direction x3 is the maximum touch with scanning lines in y direction and x4 is the box counting dimension of fracture lines furthermore they repeated the same procedure on 2d natural fracture patterns from different sources jafari and babadagli 2011 the following equation was created for natural patterns 7 k x 2 16 10 10 exp 13 720 x 1 41 779 l n x 2 37 779 l n x 3 41 658 l n x 4 1 262 l n x 5 10 116 where kx denotes equivalent fracture network permeability in the x direction x1 is the box counting dimension of intersection points x2 the connectivity index x3 is the maximum touch with scanning lines in the x direction x4 is the maximum touch with scanning lines in y direction and x5 is the box counting dimension of fracture lines these models could be useful to simplify the complex systems but miss the probabilistic or stochastic nature of fractures percolation theory as described in the following section will cover these characteristics probabilistic nature and scaling of the fracture network the combination of these two theories i e percolation and fractal geometry would yield a more universal and practical solution this paper deals with this problem clarifies what fractal parameters to use in this exercise and explains how this process should be done to cover as many characteristics as possible of complex natural fracture networks 4 ordinary percolation theory and its relation to fracture permeability and fractal geometry fracture networks are composed of fractures of different sizes lengths and orientations and have different types of connectivity varying medium by medium and rock by rock therefore they are both highly disordered and random systems which is not possible to model using the simple approaches discussed above the stochastic nature is not included in the above summarized deterministic models so one of the approaches used to describe fracture network s hydraulic characteristics mainly conductivity considering the stochastic nature is the percolation model stauffer and aharony 1985 aharony 1986 sahimi 1995 adler and thovert 1999 adler et al 2013 for an infinitely large system the probability p p for a selected site to belong to a spanning cluster is given by the following equation 8 p p p p c Œ≤ p p c where p is the probability of a site being occupied and pc is the critical threshold value the exponent Œ≤ is a universal exponent which is independent of the lattice characteristics but dependent of the dimensionality of space fig 2 a shows an ordinary conventional percolation system with different probability situations at a critical threshold value pc the system starts percolating and this is determined by the network type for example pc 0 59 for 2d square networks of site percolation the selected percolation thresholds for various lattices are shown in table 1 for site and bond percolation types many percolation properties obey scaling laws near the percolation threshold value pc this critical parameter depends on the euclidean dimension d 2 or d 3 of the system whereas pc is determined by the geometry of the network type the exponent Œ≤ is universally defined at 0 138 and 0 41 for 2d and 3d networks sahimi 1995 small clusters of connected fractures exist for small values of p for higher values of p the typical linear size of clusters and thereby the density of fractures in each cluster increases at the percolation threshold value pc they converge to infinity and the typical linear size of the cluster is defined as follows 9 Œæ p p c ŒΩ Œæ is known as the correlation length typical radius of percolation cluster for p pc i e below the percolation threshold the exponent ŒΩ is 1 33 and 0 89 for 2d and 0 89 for 3d networks table 2 above the threshold value pc a spanning cluster an open channel exists making the fluid percolate and thus yielding a conductive system if the mass of this percolating system spanning cluster is distributed uniformly aharony 1986 related the mass in a volume of finite size m to linear size l length with this relationship for l Œæ 10 m l d m dm is the mass fractal dimension it is related to the exponents in eqs 8 and 9 see these values in table 2 through the following equation 11 d m d Œ≤ ŒΩ where d is the euclidean dimension and Œ≤ and ŒΩ are the universal constants as described in table 2 dm defined in eq 11 is a universal value 1 9 for 2d and 2 5 for 3d systems if there is a spanning cluster above the percolation threshold pc the system percolates and the conductivity permeability k of the sample can be defined as follows 12 k p p c Œº p p c permeability can be related to the correlation length as follows if l Œæ homogeneous regime 13 k p p c Œº Œæ Œº ŒΩ on the other hand the permeability depends on the size of the sample l in the fractal regime l Œæ through the following relationship 14 k l l Œº ŒΩ the exponent Œº is given as 1 and 1 75 clerc et al 1983 for both 2d and 3d systems respectively and universal sahimi 1995 table 2 in a similar attempt bottger and bryskin 1985 reported an exponent value for conductivity of a 2d network system as 1 2 for lattice percolation fig 2 in the regime of l Œæ where the percolation cluster is fractal there are strong geometrical constraints on the physical processes occurring in fractures in fact the fractures show a more irregularly ordered medium and appear more random fig 2b compared to pore structures which could be represented suitably by regular lattice network geometries fig 2a then there are deviations from the universality of the exponents for the irregularly ordered medium and this constitutes the main objective of this paper these systems shown in fig 2b are called the continuum models and they are evaluated in the next section 5 continuum objects percolation model and its relation to fracture permeability and fractal geometry as opposed geometrically regular and statistically well defined lattice models fig 2a continuum models were suggested for representing and modeling fracture systems in nature fig 2b this makes the problem more complicated to reach the universal definition of the exponents and constants in the percolation models one of the most critical issues in this type of model is to quantify the connectivity which does not obey a universal rule as it does in the regular lattice model it is also a function of topological parameters such as fracture length density orientation and their distribution in the system the main problem of this type of ordering is connectivity in order to develop a percolating cluster berkowitz 1995 defined the connectivity for a fracture network system similar to the one seen in fig 2b with exponentially distributed constant length by the following relationship 15 p n n c Œ≤ where n is the total number of fractures in the domain and nc is the critical number of objects fractures at threshold he found that eq 15 is valid the exponent Œ≤ is equal to 0 138 for a limited range 0 05 n nc nc 0 5 meaning that in the finite samples of constant length near nc large fluctuations in the probability of connectivity interconnection may occur as the fracture density increases the probability of interconnection approaches unity and the finite size clusters start connecting to the percolating cluster thus this scaling relationship is useful to describe connectivity probability at higher densities however n nc nc 0 5 the probability of connectivity approaches unity quickly this indicates that more studies are needed to consider all possibilities of fracture network properties to reach a universal exponent to describe conductivity charlaix et al 1986 proposed the following equation replacing the probability in eq 15 with permeability 16 k n n c t they reported the exponent t in eq 16 for fractured rocks and found it to be 1 3 and 2 in 2d and 3d models respectively based on the work of guyon et al 1984 in which measurements were performed for different geometries of networks square triangular hexagonal and diamond in 2d and 3d halperin et al 1985 compared the exponents for discrete lattice percolation with their 3d swiss cheese randomly distributed system model and found that the exponent Œº in eq 12 is larger for their model than that of the discrete model the exponent Œº is geometry dependent and their suggested Œº values varied between 1 7 and 2 7 depending on the aperture of each network element single fracture which is apparently higher than the accepted value of 1 2 for 2d nolte et al 1989 hestir and long 1990 reported that the critical threshold pc is between 0 35 and 0 65 depending on the lattice type see table 1 and the exponent in the following relationship for permeability normalized with respect to the permeability at p 1 is independent of the lattice universal and about 1 1 guyon et al 1984 17 k k p 1 p p c t zallen 1983 suggested that the exponent could be as high as 1 3 but in general one may assume that t 1 hestir and long 1990 extended their work to examine the exponents for fractures of different sizes and orientations fixed density distributed with a poisson process in a 2d plane they validated the value of t 1 1 testing eq 17 for different and random length and density systems in the above exercises typically one type of geometry constant length was applied alternative representations for eqs 9 and 12 were presented by koudina et al 1998 and the constants and exponents were determined for different geometries as a range of values 18 Œæ œÅ œÅ c ŒΩ 19 k œÅ œÅ c Œº where œÅ is the number of fractures in the domain and œÅ c is the critical number of fractures per excluded volume 5 1 can œÅ c and Œº in eq 19 be universally defined as seen in the above summarized review a wide range of values of œÅ c and ¬µ were suggested for different geometries or statistics of fracture network systems one may need to converge these numbers into a single value for any given system to obtain a universal relationship more specifically the two parameters in eq 19 œÅ c and Œº are to be determined to estimate the permeability of continuum type fracture networks fig 2b several authors estimated a range of values for different geometries as mentioned above in a limited number of studies these values were formulated by correlating to relevant parameters fracture network and geometrical properties œÅ c is beyond the scope of this paper and efforts made for the quantification of œÅ c values will be summarized in the next section afterwards the correlation approaches for the exponent Œº will be discussed in detail 5 2 universal values for œÅ c mourzenko et al 2005 studied the effects domain size power law exponent and fracture shape on the percolation threshold of random fracture networks œÅ c they described the values varying between 1 53 and 3 02 for different domain shape and sizes and size length of fractures balberg et al 1984 and balberg 1985 suggested the following range for this quantity 3 2 œÅ c 4 5 for the 2d model and 0 7 œÅ c 2 8 for the 3d model huseby et al 1997 determined œÅ c to be 2 26 for equally sized triangles interestingly for square hexagon octagon and 20 gon of equal size fracture 3d systems the values were very close between 2 22 and 2 30 later the œÅ c values were reported to be highly geometry dependent as tabulated in table 3 a range of œÅ c values were defined by adler and thovert 1999 for different 2d and 3d fracture network geometries table 3 5 3 universal correlations for Œº the exponent Œº is more difficult to determine compared to œÅ c but it was shown that it can be correlated to fracture network properties and their representative fractal characteristics jafari and babadagli 2013 li and li 2015 yet a universal formulation covering all critical parameters and all possible systems considering the randomicity has not been proposed as opposed to universal values for the exponents defined for lattice models ŒΩ 0 88 Œº 2 0 stauffer and aharony 1985 in continuum percolation the exponent Œº might depend on the geometrical model which is highly random and typically complex fig 2b the interconnection of the bonds and thereby conductivity in a continuous network is determined by the geometry in other words ¬µ is a dependent on geometrical model and therefore yields a non universal behavior koudina et al 1998 determined the ratio of ¬µ ŒΩ for 3d random networks of regular hexagonal fractures the results are as follows for four different conditions 1 at the percolation threshold it is ¬µ ŒΩ 2 22 which is in agreement with the universal value of 2 3 estimated by stauffer and aharony 1985 2 at intermediate and high densities it is obtained to be ¬µ 1 57 their test for different bigger densities œÅ length to radius l r ratios r to be different disk radii in which different length l of fractures were embedded then l r to be number of fractures per unit volume showed deviations from ¬µ 1 57 koudina et al 1998 the first attempt to correlate the exponent to fracture network permeability was done by berkowitz and balberg 1993 they considered a simple backbone illustration texaslike farm and assumed that overall permeability decreases as the length of flow path increases hence the permeability k Œæ will drop sharply as the correlation length Œæ will diverge as the system approaches the percolation threshold then the conductivity exponent is defined as follows 20 k Œæ p p c Œ∂ k for the permeability of the entire system for a system of dimensionality d the following equation can be written for a square geometry texaslike farm as described by them 21 k k Œæ l Œæ d 2 combining eqs 9 20 and 21 the exponent Œº in eq 12 can be determined by the following relationship 22 Œº Œ∂ k d 2 ŒΩ these exponents are easy to determine for simple systems and this was an interesting attempt to bring an approach to describe the exponent yet it is not universal berkowitz and balberg 1993 further questioned what geometrical properties were relevant to connectivity what would be the threshold for percolations and what is the exponent ¬µ that describes the permeability next to the critical threshold they also noted that many systems have the same exponent ¬µ much later two attempts were made to describe the exponent ¬µ for a more general system jafari and babadagli 2013 proposed the following relationship for randomly distributed variable length variable size and variable orientation fracture networks for one type of geometry by fixing œÅ c as 3 6 as suggested in table 3 for the geometry they used 23 k 88 41 œÅ œÅ c 0 46 zhang and sanderson 2002 measured the exponent in eq 19 for different geometries and obtained values for 2d networks with different densities and distribution types orthogonal or random obtaining values between 1 05 and 1 37 which are not universal and are geometry dependent li and li 2015 also used fractal dimensions to obtain a correlation for the exponent ¬µ they began with describing the term connectivity f and showed that connectivity around the percolation threshold can be represented by 24 f œÅ œÅ c ŒΩ 3 d c Œ≤ where Œ≤ and ŒΩ are defined in eqs 8 and 9 respectively conductivity k can be represented as a function of connectivity f tortuosity fracture density and fracture aperture 25 k k o œÅ œÅ c Œº where the exponent is defined by 26 Œº 3 d c Œ≤ 2 d œÑ ŒΩ dc and dœÑ are fractal dimensions and ŒΩ and Œ≤ are to be determined for different fracture lengths constant and lognormal li and li 2015 stated that the fractal dimension dc defines the connectivity and dœÑ is the fractal dimension for the most probable flow path dopt or the most probable traveling time db lee et al 1999 they were defined as dopt 1 21 and db 1 64 for spanning clusters of random networks sheppard et al 1999 exponent ¬µ in eq 26 was found to be 0 924 for constant length and uncorrelated networks which has a fractal dimension of dc 2 0 this exponent is 1 122 1 257 and 0 919 for the constant length with dc 1 75 constant length with dc 1 62 and log normally distributed length with dc 2 0 respectively li and li 2015 compared the ¬µ values with others 1 6 by mourzenko et al 2005 0 46 by jafari and babadagli 2013 and 1 1 by yazdi et al 2011 attributing the difference to the fact that these studies neglected the contribution of non percolating clusters and the simulation ranges were above the percolation threshold all these attempts summarized above generated results for different geometries but limited the research to case specific even though some of them cover many different combinations of fracture length size for 3d models distribution orientation difficult to quantify usually random distribution and densities mourzenko et al 2005 jafari and babadagli 2013 li and li 2015 adler and thovert 1999 concluded that there is no characteristic fractal dimension with different fracture network patterns also referring to berkowitz and hadad 1997 based on these approaches one may observe that it is plausible to use fracture network characteristics mainly fractal dimensions to propose a universal correlation defining œÅ c and ¬µ but what should be considered is which fractal dimensions and which network properties 6 parameters controlling the permeability of a fracture network and their relationship to fractal geometry one step ahead of previous attempts towards the improvement of the correlations for the exponent ¬µ is to include a more optimal number of variables that directly control the permeability of networks this practice consists of three steps which are listed below in the form of questions 1 which network properties what are the fracture network properties to be considered in these correlations 2 which network characteristics of these network properties critical fractal parameters how are the network properties quantified measure using fractal and possibly other non fractal methods 3 which fractal methods for these network properties are these fractal methods consistent in representing the specific effect of the network property in the permeability correlations these three steps will be described further in this section 6 1 which network properties the following geometrical parameters control the conductivity of fracture networks 1 density spacing 2 length 3 connectivity 4 orientation anisotropy 5 distribution type of fractures location homogenous or heterogeneous distribution 6 aperture not a network property 7 shape for 3d systems tools to quantify those properties are fractals power laws scaling and resolution and percolation theory berkowitz 2002 the secondary parameters are rock types and stress condition causing fracture development which directly control the above listed primary characteristics of fracture networks many of these parameters e g fracture length and density can be the same but the distribution of fractures in space can be in many different forms e g homogenous log normal power law etc this is controlled by rock type fracture cause stress and history secondary and tertiary fractures may develop over time deviating from the original shape these different forms add more complexity therefore relating the network characteristics to physical processes rock type is avoided meaning fracture systems are taken as a geometric structure and evaluations are made based on this definition even this simplification has not been sufficient for accurate mathematical descriptions as multiple characteristics play a role at the same time therefore stochastic probabilistic models such as percolation are considered to better represent the systems the above listed fracture network parameters should be described and subsequently the exponent or the constants in eq 19 should be correlated to these parameters fractal characteristics have been shown to be one of the most useful options as they may inherently cover many of these parameters the next question is which parameters or characteristics represent these geometrical characteristics of the fracture network 6 2 which network characteristics of these network properties critical fractal parameters after describing all possible fracture network properties playing a role on the fracture network permeability one has to quantify them using fractal techniques hence we begin with the question of which parameters represent these geometrical characteristics of the fracture network or which characteristics of the network represent the phenomenon here is the list of characteristics for each network property to be determined their distribution fractal characteristics etc 1 density spacing fractures lines or shapes and their mid points 2 length fractures lines or shapes 3 connectivity fractures lines or shapes and intersection points 4 orientation anisotropy scanning lines 5 distribution type of fractures location homogenous or heterogeneous distribution 6 aperture not a network property 7 shape for 3d systems fractal characteristics of these properties can be found in many different resources individually but a comprehensive review of different techniques to measure the fractal characteristics of these properties can be found in research done by kruhl 2013 the next question is which fractal measurements represent which one of these seven parameters to be included in the correlation studies 6 3 which fractal method for these network properties after all one should define which characteristics of fracture networks play a critical role to be included in an expression created for the exponent ¬µ to universally define the permeability value based on the percolation theory this can be questioned as which fractal dimension s and any other quantification parameters would describe all the characteristics of these properties in other words which characteristics are best represented by which fractal dimension the fractal methods to describe the above listed parameters are discussed below 6 3 1 density and length two methods that are commonly applied to measure the fractal dimensions are the box counting bc and sand box sb mass dimension methods the bc method is based on measuring the number of object fractures as a line mid point or intersection points filled with boxes of different sizes fig 3 a and plotting the number of boxes against the size of the box barton and larsen 1985 roy et al 2007 when plotted on a log log scale the slope yields the bc fractal dimension through the following relationship 27 n r r d bc where n r is the number of the filled boxes and r is the box sizes and dbc is the bc fractal dimension the sb method is based on counting the number of features fractures as a line mid point or intersection points in a circle fig 3b the process is repeated with different sizes of uni centered circles and plotting the number of counts against the size of the circle the mass or sb fractal dimension dm is obtained applying the following relationship 28 m r r d m the number of counts m r is plotted against the size of circle r on a log log scale and the slope of the straight line yields sb i e mass fractal dimension bunde and havlin 1995 babadagli 2001 and jafari and babadagli 2009 2011 measured different characteristics mid point intersection point using different methods such as sb and bc it was concluded that the strongest correlation with fracture network permeability was obtained by the bc fractal dimension of intersection points and fracture lines as fractal properties along with certain non fractal measures such as connectivity index maximum number of intersections between fractures and imaginary scanning lines in the x and y directions jafari and babadagli 2009 2011 sb dimension did not show a strong correlation with fracture network permeability la pointe 1988 studied the relationship between the network permeability and fractal dimension for 3d systems the method that he followed to measure the fractal dimension was reminiscent of the bc method later la pointe 1997 noted that the flow is linearly proportional to the mass fractal dimension for the compartmentalized 3d fracture network systems zhang and sanderson 2002 measured the fractal dimensions of 2d synthetic fracture network s different densities and orientations using the bc method to determine the critical fractal dimension at which the system percolates they found a value of 1 3 on average it varied between 1 22 and 1 38 for different fracture density systems according to the following equation 29 d f a f d d c f df is the fractal dimension of the largest cluster it describes connectivity but interestingly it is determined by the bc method d is fracture density and dc is the threshold value at which the system starts percolating f is the exponent determining the universal law barton 1995 heuristically observed that the threshold fractal dimension determined by the box counting method on different natural fracture patterns is 1 35 which is coincidently consistent with zhang and sanderson s 2002 numerical models the exponent describing the connectivity was obtained to be very close to each other for different geometries of 2d fracture networks and averaged around 1 2 which could be considered applicable to a wide range of network systems as it did not vary significantly for the geometries they considered a group of works used mass fractal dimension to be used in correlations with permeability chang and yortsos 1990 presented a formulation for single phase flow in a fracture network system based on the following assumption for fracture network permeability kf as a function of distance r 30 k f r r d m d Œ∏ Œ∏ is an exponent defined from the object s structure d is the euclidean dimension and dm is the mass sb fractal dimension later li and li 2015 defined correlation dimension dc as shown in eq 26 which is a mass dimension of the fracture center distribution determined using the sand box method this dimension describes connectivity of the network as mentioned earlier la pointe 1997 observed that the flow thereby permeability is linearly proportional to the mass fractal dimension for the compartmentalized 3 d systems hence a controversial issue emerges as to which fractal dimension represents which feature of fracture networks this point needs further clarifications and will be discussed in the next section box counting vs sand box mass dimensions we begin with comparing the box counting bc and sand box sb fractal dimensions for a wide variety of random systems generated by jafari and babadagli 2009 the first comparison was done for the fractal dimension of the mid points mp and intersection points ip determined by the sb method a k a mass dimension against the bc fractal dimension of the fracture lines there are 20 different densities and fracture lengths and each case was run for different realizations using different random numbers yielding a total of 1000 runs jafari and babadagli 2009 no strong correlation was observed between the sb fractal dimension of mid points and the bc fractal dimension of fracture lines except the cases with low density and short length fractures fig a1 for the intersection points ip in the same plot only a few cases of high density fractures showed a relatively good correlation with the bc fractal dimension of fracture lines in fig a2 the fractal dimensions of mp and ip obtained by different methods bc and sb were compared the ips yielded a better correlation than the mp cases although no typical trend was observed for the mp cases only four cases yielded an agreement in fractal dimensions but some of them were high density long fracture and the two others were low density ones high density fracture networks showed consistent fractal dimensions similarly no consistent trends between the sb and bc dimensions were observed for other types of fracture networks figs a3 and a4 as seen the bc and sb fractal dimensions may converge above a certain threshold these observations led to test the natural fracture patterns in a similar manner and seek a trend between sb and bc fractal dimensions of the same properties fig a5 shows the results and as seen the inconsistency between the sb and bc dimensions are even worse than the random and synthetic patterns given in fig a4 the pattern s circle with a solid line showed consistency as displayed in fig a6 similar to the random cases they are well connected near or above the percolation threshold presumably high œÅ c consisting of a densely and relatively systematically distributed fracture system another characteristic of the networks is to have a single backbone that spreads over the network thus contributing to the conductivity a group of fracture patterns did not show consistency circled by dotted line and these patterns are displayed in fig a7 characteristically they are not well connected even non percolating such as the pattern in fig a7c more irregularly distributed compared to the ones in fig a6 and consist of unconnected multi clusters and dangling bonds fig a7b c d as seen in the above analysis although the same property fracture density and distribution is measured the methodology used to determine the fractal nature is different in these two methods yielding different fractal dimensions and trends this evokes the following question should we consider both fractal dimensions in permeability correlations also could both fractal dimensions be related to the hydraulic conductivity of fracture networks which one of these fractal dimensions is more related to the conductivity of a network in this case do we need more than one fractal dimension or fractal method fracture property for the same fracture characteristics mainly length density and connectivity controlling the permeability of the network which fractal dimension bc or sb is related to network conductivity rangriz shokri et al 2016 indicated that the permeability of the network is dependent on the backbone of the cluster this backbone cluster should spread over the network in order for the system to percolate and the bc method fracture lines to give a better estimate of the spatial coverage of the backbone cluster the sb method on the other hand detects local variations unconnected multi clusters and dangling bonds which has no or minimal effect on the control of the permeability of fracture network this in fact was shown by tuia and kanevski 2008 through a systematic exercise fig b1 displays two networks which are statistically the same number of fracture intersection points and geometrically topologically the same distribution identical except a small cluster at the center of fig b1a this small change in the local density is detected by the sb dimension indicated by a big difference in the value 1 67 and 1 98 for the pattern in fig b1a and b respectively this type of small change in the system is expected to have an insignificant effect on the permeability of the network and interestingly the bc dimensions are very close to each other the two patterns given in fig b2 reflect different pattern characteristics these patterns contain the same number of intersection points but different spatial distributions such two separate systems yielded very different bc dimensions 2 and 1 79 for fig b2a and b respectively but quite similar sb dimensions 1 91 and 1 86 for fig b2a and b respectively this means sb methods did not detect any change in the local density of this type there are empty parts in the pattern in fig b2b such difference in these two patterns significantly changes the permeability of the fracture network and this can be detected by the bc fractal dimension also covering the anisotropic nature of it as will be discussed later in 6 3 3 orientation a final support to this idea could be to conduct a similar test on a different type of data stalgorova and babadagli 2014 modeled tracer injection through a well structured fractured media with two mutually perpendicular fracture sets with equal lengths by random walk particle tracking simulations fig 4 after obtaining the production curves for different r values distance between injection and production wells as shown in fig 4 they generated the plots of the probability of a particle p t against traveling time t to reach the particle production well for scaling purpose the plots of p t rŒ≤ vs t rŒ± were created and the exponents Œ± and Œ≤ satisfying the scaling overlapped curves for five different r values were obtained they found that Œ± 1 81 and Œ≤ 1 66 for the particular fracture network type shown in fig 4 and identified the dependencies of these exponents on the fractal dimensions of the network the Œ≤ is the exponent related to the most probable traveling time p t the probability of the particle to have traveling time t whereas Œ± is related to the travelling time quicker for r1 than others and the latest for r4 in fig 4 hence the Œ≤ exponent has to do with distribution of the particle within the system which has to do with permeability interestingly Œ± was strongly correlated to sb fractal dimension and Œ≤ was strongly dependent on the bc fractal dimension as concluded by stalgorova and babadagli 2014 6 3 2 connectivity one of the most critical fracture network characteristics to satisfy a conductive system is connectivity it does not obey a universal rule as it does in regular lattice type percolation models and therefore it is the most difficult network characteristics to quantify and include in the correlations one approach to quantify the connective nature of the network is non fractal methods i e number of fractures per area to represent density or distribution of fracture intersection points jafari and babadagli 2009 defined a non fractal entity called the connectivity index and used it in their correlations connectivity index was reported to be the second most powerful parameter in the improvement of the correlation coefficient after the bc dimension table 4 connectivity can also be represented implicitly indirectly by other characteristics for example fracture lines length and intersection points density or the combination of those the longer the fracture lengths and the denser the fractures the higher the connectivity and percolation constants œÅ c in eq 19 incorporate the connectivity of the networks and other specific parameters might not be needed to represent it as also shown earlier the bc fractal dimension of fracture lines could even be sufficient for certain cases to include the connectivity nature of the networks in correlations in fact barton 1995 analyzed many different natural fracture networks and heuristically concluded that the systems percolate become conductive if the bc fractal dimension is above 1 35 which in a sense represents a threshold number to represent the connectivity to some extent there are however fractal approaches defining connectivity directly connectivity is quantified by the number of intersections per fractures with others adler and thovert 1999 and can be represented by different ways such as number of intersections per number of fractures babadagli 2001 scanline approaches babadagli 2002 could be an option to indirectly cover the connectivity or simply define the number of intersection points per unit area jafari and babadagli 2013 li and li 2015 used two fractal dimensions dc and dœÑ in eq 26 which are derived as follows dc this is the correlation dimension introduced by li and li 2015 as the spatial correlation of the fracture using two point correlation function defined by darcel et al 2003 which depicts the probability of two cracks within a distance r of the same cluster 31 c r n r n t where nt is the total crack center number of all cracks and n r is the number of crack centers within a distance r with the following scaling relationship one may obtain the fractal dimension dc 32 c r r d c this fractal dimension dc defines the connectivity through the relationship given in eqs 24 and 26 li and li 2015 estimated dc values for different densities and apertures varying between 1 62 and 2 0 for constant and 2 0 for log normally distributed fracture lengths dœÑ this is the fractal dimension for the most probable flow path li and li 2015 related this fractal dimension to a tortuosity œÑ term for random fracture networks if l Œæ is the cumulative fracture length in the backbone cluster and ls is its straight line length the tortuosity is œÑ l Œæ ls for a measurement increment Œµ dœÑ can be obtained by the following relationship 33 l Œæ Œµ l s Œµ 1 d œÑ lee et al 1999 stated that dt is equivalent to the fractal dimension for the most probable flow path dopt or the most probable traveling time db they were defined as dopt 1 21 and db 1 64 by sheppard et al 1999 for the spanning cluster of 2d random networks permeability is related to tortuosity œÑ fracture density œÅ fracture aperture b and crack connectivity f i e k k km f œÑ œÅ b where km is the permeability of the solid matrix but addition of aperture and relating the fractal dimension to connectivity is a critical step and these fractal properties were used to generate a correlation for the exponent ¬µ eq 32 despite these recent efforts on quantification of connectivity though fractal approaches we are far from a universal relationship the two fractal dimensions described above are functions of many fracture properties connectivity density and even aperture but not orientation even though the tortuosity concept may include the orientation effect to some extent that means this term should be incorporated in a correlation for the exponent ¬µ eq 26 and further tested for different geometries for validation 6 3 3 orientation fracture network systems may exhibit an anisotropic nature and therefore the orientation of fractures emerges as another critical parameter to be quantitatively included in permeability correlations non fractal scanline methods could be a practical approach in this attempt and as can be inferred from eqs 6 and 7 the scanning lines maximum touch in x and y and z directions could be useful in incorporating the orientation effect in the permeability correlations jafari and babadagli 2009 2011 in these correlations after the fractal dimension of intersection points and fracture lines using the bc method two non fractal indicators showed a strong correlation with permeability 1 maximum touch with scanning lines in the x direction and 2 maximum touch with scanning lines in the y direction these indicators cover the orientation effect on fracture network permeability for more fine tuned correlation jafari and babadagli 2009 2011 suggested adding the connectivity index connectivity was covered by the fractal dimension of intersection points implicitly connectivity index however did not improve the correlation but adding well test permeability was more useful for this thus the critical and controlling parameters to develop a correlation were the bc fractal dimension of the fracture lines or ips as well as scanning lines covering density orientation connectivity and length on natural patterns jafari and babadagli 2011 tested these parameters on natural patterns they observed that three parameters namely the bc fractal dimensions of fracture intersection points fractal dimensions of fracture lines and lacunarity yielded a reasonably good correlation for different types of rocks and regions in a geothermal region the correlation significantly improved when lacunarity is excluded and connectivity index maximum number of intersection points between fracture lines and the imaginary scanning lines in the and y directions are added as for the fractal methods several attempts have been made adler and thovert 1999 used 2d fracture networks to quantify intersection connectivity and orientation and showed that the probability p l that a fracture intersection occurs in an interval with length l along the scanline show the following scaling rule is expressed as follows 34 p l l d b db is the bc fractal dimension and it was observed that it depends on orientation of fractures led√©sert et al 1993 scanline fractal dimension approaches babadagli 2001 could be an option to directly cover the orientation an improved version of this method was proposed by babadagli 2002 based on a method developed by katz and thompson 1985 and applied by krohn and thompson 1986 on 2d images of porous rocks babadagli 2001 defined the following relationship for fractal behavior 35 n l l 2 d sl where dsl is called scanline fractal dimension l is the feature size distance between two intersecting points between the scanning line and fracture indicated by circles in fig 3c and n l is the number features counted through the imaginary scanlines indicated by the dashed lines in fig 3c this fractal dimension has not been tested on any permeability correlations or for the exponent correlations the fractal dimensions obtained from these methods were not tested to include the orientation effect in a correlation for the exponent ¬µ a critical question at this point is to what extent the bc dimension of fracture lines representing primarily density or the bc dimension of intersection points primarily representing connectivity and lines are sufficient to cover all these fracture properties reviewed so far length density connectivity and orientation rangriz shokri et al 2016 showed that the fractal dimension of fracture lines box counting as proposed by barton and larsen in 1985 was by far the most critical parameter correlated to the exponent ¬µ in eq 19 if other non fractal parameters connectivity index fracture wellbore intersection well test permeability fracture spacing maximum touch in the x and y directions are included along with the bc dimensions of the fracture lines no other fractal parameter is needed this is in line with jafari and babadagli s 2013 observations as given in table 4 they considered all possible configurations except the distribution their study was for the systems at the percolation threshold the exponent ¬µ in eq 19 is strongly correlated to the bc fractal dimension of fracture lines but the bc dimension of intersection points also showed a good correlation 6 3 4 distribution type anisotropy fracture distribution determines the anisotropic nature of fracture networks meaning it could be a useful tool in estimating the permeability in other words it how they are located in the network system indicates whether fractures are distributed homogenously or heterogeneously two different distribution types are illustrated in fig 5 a uncorrelated and 5b correlated by li and li 2015 although both network types contain the same number and size of fractures the distribution type controls the connectivity and orientation anisotropy if the fractures are distributed heterogeneously the distribution type should be included directly by assigning the type of distribution e g log normal power law etc or using indirect measurements in permeability correlations for example miao et al 2015 and wei and xia 2017 used the fractal dimension of fracture length and size distribution only in permeability correlations whereas jafari and babadagli 2009 included non fractal parameters such as scanning lines in different directions in their correlations eqs 6 and 7 as an indirect representation of distribution type li and li 2015 showed that dc as defined in eq 32 can be used to incorporate the distribution type connectivity and orientation in the fracture network permeability correlations the dc for the purely random system is close to the euclidean dimension which is 2 decreasing as the system generated a more clustered network this fractal dimension was used in developing the correlation for ¬µ shown in eq 19 if the distribution type is not identified and the estimation is purely based on the statistical data for the fracture length and number one may not be able to capture the conductive nature of the network accurately for the flow in the x and y directions which are similar in the case of fig 5a but totally different in the case of fig 5b another approach to cover the distribution type was tested by jafari and babadagli 2009 2011 fig 5c and 5d show similar discrepancies to the cases in fig 5a and 5b the distribution type effect could be covered in the bc fractal dimension or bc fractal dimension could help to cover the anisotropy effect as well implicitly which is justified by the significant different in the bc fractal dimensions for both network type consisting of the same number of fracture intersection points fig b2 despite close values of the sb fractal dimension for further improvement jafari and babadagli 2013 suggested adding the connectivity index as a non fractal parameter and this could be replaced by dc introduced by li and li 2015 to cover the distribution type directly affecting the connectivity and anisotropic nature orientation of the network 6 3 5 aperture aperture is the only non network property of fractures and in most of the studies covered in this paper it is ignored to a great extent this could be a reasonable approach as the aperture effect could be negligible compared to the other network properties such as density length and connectivity jafari and babadagli 2009 showed that the aperture of the fracture dominates only for a special case of low density short fractures and extremely high conductivity of all fractures high aperture this is usually not the case for systems above percolation threshold which is a requirement for a conductive network system on the other hand studies considering the aperture of single fractures exist li and li 2015 incorporated aperture affect in the permeability correlation eq 19 6 3 6 shape this paper mostly considered 2d fracture network system cases rather than 3d models the parameters tested and evaluated in this study could then be extended to 3d systems considering shapes instead of lines using a similar methodology in relating the fractal properties in correlations for permeability substantial work was performed to define the percolation characteristics œÅ c and ¬µ in eq 19 as a function of fracture shapes and their distributions for 3d models huseby et al 1997 koudina et al 1998 mourzenko et al 2005 these studies considered different geometrical shapes and the distribution types to develop a range of values for different 3d geometries the data generated could be used in a single correlation by relating the constant and exponent values to ¬µ in eq 19 in an effort for universalization 7 conclusions and remarks in general this paper sought an answer for this question can fractal geometry and percolation theories be combined to obtain a universal correlation for hydraulic conductivity of complex fracture systems more specifically the attempt was to test different fractal characteristics of fracture network properties using different methods to be used in an expression for the exponent in eq 19 the approach used was to first critically review and evaluate the concepts and correlations proposed previously next suitable techniques to obtain the fractal characteristics of the network properties were analyzed the evaluation and fractal analyses were based on 2d models but could be extended to 3d using the same approach it is critical to analyze if the inter correlations among those fractal characteristics should be searched to improve the quality of the expression developed for the exponent ¬µ in eq 19 for example using bc of mp representing the density of the fractures rather than ip representing the connectivity of the fractures could be useful in reducing the numbers of fracture parameters to be measured density length and connectivity of fracture networks are interrelated and the expectation was that the bc of the fracture lines for 2d fracture systems and ip points could be sufficient to cover these three characteristics although bc of ips is expected to primarily cover the connectivity nature of the networks interestingly the bc of the lines could be itself sufficient to incorporate the effects of all three properties that directly control the network permeability in this case one may question how many additional fractal characteristics are needed to improve the universal nature of the expression and if we can reduce the number of those to minimize the efforts for estimation measuring of the fractal characteristics of the networks another critical fracture network characteristic orientation can be represented by scanning lines at least in the x and y directions if not multifractal by scanning lines spectra in 180 or even 360 although this non fractal measure was tested and included in correlations eq 6 and 7 as well as the correlation for the exponent in eq 19 as seen in table 4 the fractal dimension of the scanning lines as proposed by babadagli 2002 eq 35 and eq 34 led√©sert et al 1993 adler and thovert 1999 could be another option specific efforts were made on the comparison of the sb and bc fractal dimensions of fracture lines ips and mps no correlations between these methods were observed with some exceptions such as well connected and homogeneously distributed networks with no significant number of dangling clusters in summary the bc dimension was shown to be the most powerful fractal tool to cover many aspects of fracture network conductivity related properties even including connectivity eq 29 although non fractal options exist newly proposed fractal dimension such as dc dœÑ and db as defined in eqs 32 33 and 34 respectively could be used to improve the correlations for the percolation exponent ¬µ given in eqs 22 23 and 26 an alternative way to generate correlation for the exponent in eq 19 is using the fractal dimension of property distributions i e the statistical characteristics like dc defined in eq 32 rather than the geometrical characteristics such as bc fractal dimension obtained by applying the measurements on actual fracture patterns the combination of both options could improve the accuracy and universality of correlations for the percolation exponents like ¬µ in eq 19 covering four essential characteristics length density connectivity and orientation and be an alternative to the geometrical fractal dimension only a final comment could be made on the other value in eq 19 œÅ c in eq 19 has a pure connectivity property but its description is not as simple as in the ordinary systems fig 2a for the continuum models fig 2b as listed in table 3 the values of œÅ c are functions of geometric characteristic of the fractures shape size type etc in general the higher the connectivity and the density and size in line with this the higher the œÅ c hu et al 2018 whether this description is sufficient for all possible geometries and fracture networks jafari and babadagli 2013 could be tested this was not investigated in this study but based on the outcome of this work one may intuitively state that fracture network characteristics and quantification tools through fractal characteristics showing correlations to the exponent ¬µ can be used to obtain correlations and improve the numbers suggested by adler and thovert 1999 as listed in table 3 for œÅ c as well in conclusion this paper moves the efforts on the universalization of eq 19 one step ahead all possible configuration and geometrical topological characteristics were discussed and the possibilities for the inclusion of them in the correlations were listed it is hoped that the quantities and fractal properties methods analyzed in this paper will shed light on generating more accurate and practical

5394,quantitatively describing complex natural systems and their processes is a challenging task additionally the random nature of these processes adds more difficulty to this problem this paper considers fracture networks as a system and the concepts of percolation theory and fractal geometry are combined to define the conductivity characteristics of such structures correlations between fracture network properties and network permeability are searched using the fractal dimensions box counting mass correlation dimensions of different fracture network features density length orientation connectivity distribution anisotropy the conditions of a strong relationship with different fractal characteristics and scale dependency of correlations are addressed the results will be useful in defining universal constants in scaling equations used to model transport processes in complex fracture network systems keywords fracture networks continuum percolation network permeability fractal dimensions underground reservoirs 1 introduction many phenomena in nature are complex and cannot be easily quantified using simple correlations this is more critical in geological occurrences due to the high degree of uncertainty emerging from the accessibility to subsurface data and difficulties in data collection natural fracture systems are one of these geological occurrences that are difficult to quantitatively describe for engineering applications a mathematical description of fracture systems is needed to define their mechanical and hydraulic characteristics to be eventually used in practical applications such as energy production from subsurface sources oil gas geothermal excavations mining tunnels dam and building construction earthquakes and contamination of underground aquifers although pure research constitutes an essential element of phenomena related to natural occurrences and processes in them quantification of the systems is needed for practical applications such quantification is also crucial to facilitate the research to both understand the phenomena and scrutinize the processes as lord william thomson kelvin put when you cannot express it in numbers your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind often practical applications require a single or set of equations correlations or a single number to be used in simulation studies this however may not be easy for even simple systems descriptive models using a single number such as fractal dimension mandelbrot 1982 golden ratio sinuosity and lacunarity could be useful in identifying complexities to some extent but more numbers are needed for better accuracy when describing complex systems and processes involved in high risk and big investments fracture systems are identified and modeled as a network using lines barton and larsen 1985 la pointe 1988 babadagli 2001 2d and discs hestir and long 1990 mourzenko et al 2005 adler et al 2013 3d or as a single fracture huitt 1956

correlations used for the permeability of these systems two theories were used in resolving the complexity of fracture networks fractal and percolation considerable work has been done on the fractal and percolation aspects of fracture network systems we begin with the review of these two approaches in sections 3 4 and 5 after the next section describing the problem and objective of this paper 2 statement of the problem objective of this review paper many different science and engineering disciplines deal with characterization of and applications on complex network systems specific interest in earth science and related disciplines leads to exploring the natural fracture systems embedded in rocks of which bring more difficulty compared to synthetic networks e g electrical circuits power lines it systems etc due to their random nature and lack of tangible data understanding the topological and geometrical characteristics of these natural fracture networks in quantitative terms and relating them to the mechanical and hydraulic behaviors also displayed is crucial conductivity of the fracture network is a critical parameter in many engineering applications including oil gas and geothermal fluid productions groundwater contamination and waste deposition in underground reservoirs the deterministic estimation of conductivity is technically and computationally difficult as well as time consuming due to the lack of data available for characterization and the random nature of the networks with this reality many different models have been proposed to estimate fracture network permeability as it is essential data for modeling any type of transport process in any underground reservoir one may classify these models for network permeability as deterministic or stochastic two issues are prominent in this practice 1 a well defined and validated typically empirical equation s b in conjunction with this independent parameters representing the characteristics of the networks to be used in said equations for the former percolation theory a stochastic approach was suggested in the 80 s requiring a correct definition of the percolation constants and exponents although this is theoretically possible for ordered systems if one uses ordinary percolation to describe the fracture network continuum percolation models that are more realistic make it highly challenging to describe the random nature of fracture network permeability no unique solutions with universal percolation constants have been proposed for these types of continuum models yet there are however different approaches to define them with specific geometrical and statistical fracture network descriptions one option is to correlate these constants or exponents to the fractal characteristics of fracture networks the objective of this paper is to provide both a summary and critical review of these approaches to guide researchers in their attempts to develop new correlations for fracture network permeability although this is a review paper an exercise on fractal characteristics of natural fracture networks is provided at the end the use of different fractal models or dimensions and measurement techniques have been tested for use in correlating the constants of continuum percolation equations used to estimate fracture network permeability 3 background of fracture network permeability models the simplest model of fracture permeability is based on the assumption of a single fracture described by two parallel plates the flow relationship the cubic law is described by huitt 1956 as follows idea first introduced much earlier by boussinesq in 1868 1 q 1 b 3 l 12 Œº Œ¥ p l where Œ¥ p is the pressure drop in the direction of flow l is the length of the fracture where the pressure drop occurs l is the width of the fracture perpendicular to the flow direction and Œº is the viscosity of fluid the aperture is b and volumetric rate q is proportional to b 3 from this relationship one may obtain the permeability kf by the following equation also known as the muskat equation 2 k f b 2 12 a single flat surface fracture model can be extended to a network model by adding multiple fractures parallel to each other which could be assumed as the simplest fracture network model 3 k f 4 54 10 6 w 3 i f if the width w is in inches if is the number of fractures per feet eq 3 in this form is useful for practical applications as fracture density can be readily obtained from well data cores or image logs it is a multiplication of single fracture permeability that can be estimated if the fracture width w is determined assuming that it is the same for all fractures by the fracture density number of fractures per feet hence the higher the density of fractures the higher the permeability of the fracture system composed of non intersecting multiple parallel fractures parsons 1966 considered a set of tilted but parallel fractures described by angle Œ± also incorporating the matrix permeability km 4 k fm k m e 1 3 c o s 2 Œ± 1 12 d 1 e n 3 c o s 2 Œ± n 12 d n f o r 1 n f r a c t u r e s e t s here k is permeability e is fracture width d is fracture spacing Œ± is the angle between axis of pressure gradient and fracture planes m f and fm are the indices for matrix fracture and fracture matrix combined respectively note however that fracture systems are naturally more complex and they need to be represented as a network model rather than systematically ordered single fracture systems in this case parameters other than aperture should be considered as independent variables therefore one step ahead is to introduce the values representing the characteristic network properties into fracture network permeability correlations quantification of fracture density length size connectivity orientation distribution type and aperture which makes the problem more complex is needed in this attempt for the quantification process the fractal characteristics of these properties can be used in several attempts analog models created for porous media were applied to estimate the permeability of fracture networks xu 2015 and babadagli and al salmi 2004 listed permeability correlations for porous media using fractal dimensions sahimi 1995 provided an extensive review of methods used to estimate the permeability of different porous structures here we take two of the most recent approaches as examples miao et al 2015 developed the following equation using the cubic law concept given in eq 1 and correlated the network permeability kf to the fractal dimension d f for the fracture length distribution 5a k f Œ≤ 3 d 128 1 d f 4 d f l max 3 1 cos 2 Œ± sin 2 Œ∏ 1 1 d f 2 d f this equation shows that the permeability is also a function of the structural parameters it includes maximum fracture length l max fracture density d fracture azimuth Œ± and facture dip angle Œ∏ as well as fracture porosity œï of the fracture network Œ≤ is a proportionality constant in a similar fashion wei and xia 2017 evaluated fracture network permeabilities correlated to fractal properties including the following relationship derived from xu et al 2006 5b k f d 0 2 32 1 n 1 d l 1 n m 1 d l 1 n 4 d d 1 d l 1 1 n 4 d d 1 d l 1 m 1 1 2 1 n 1 d l 1 n m d l 1 n 1 d l cos Œ∏ where d 0 is the diameter of the 0th branching level n is the branching number d l is the fractal dimension of channel length distribution d d is the fractal dimension for diameter distribution and m is the total branching level the fractal dimensions in eqs 5a and 5b are for the distributions of geometric network properties length and diameter respectively other tools for determining fractal dimensions to be used in a similar exercise are the ones representing the topological and geometrical features such as box counting bc sand box sb or scanning lines sl thus one step forward is relating the permeability to fractal characteristics of geometrical fracture properties derived from the above listed approaches a comprehensive exercise was performed by jafari and babadagli 2009 2011 by testing 12 characteristic values covering all fracture properties such as fracture density length connectivity orientation and aperture on synthetic random fracture networks they showed that four out of 12 parameters were sufficient to present a correlation for the network permeability and the following type of equation was found to be the most accurate jafari and babadagli 2009 6 l n k x 25 008 e x p 0 046 x 1 2 895 l n x 2 1 705 l n x 3 l n x 4 34 675 where kx denotes equivalent fracture network permeability in the x direction x1 is the box counting dimension of intersection points x2 is the maximum touch with scanning lines in the x direction x3 is the maximum touch with scanning lines in y direction and x4 is the box counting dimension of fracture lines furthermore they repeated the same procedure on 2d natural fracture patterns from different sources jafari and babadagli 2011 the following equation was created for natural patterns 7 k x 2 16 10 10 exp 13 720 x 1 41 779 l n x 2 37 779 l n x 3 41 658 l n x 4 1 262 l n x 5 10 116 where kx denotes equivalent fracture network permeability in the x direction x1 is the box counting dimension of intersection points x2 the connectivity index x3 is the maximum touch with scanning lines in the x direction x4 is the maximum touch with scanning lines in y direction and x5 is the box counting dimension of fracture lines these models could be useful to simplify the complex systems but miss the probabilistic or stochastic nature of fractures percolation theory as described in the following section will cover these characteristics probabilistic nature and scaling of the fracture network the combination of these two theories i e percolation and fractal geometry would yield a more universal and practical solution this paper deals with this problem clarifies what fractal parameters to use in this exercise and explains how this process should be done to cover as many characteristics as possible of complex natural fracture networks 4 ordinary percolation theory and its relation to fracture permeability and fractal geometry fracture networks are composed of fractures of different sizes lengths and orientations and have different types of connectivity varying medium by medium and rock by rock therefore they are both highly disordered and random systems which is not possible to model using the simple approaches discussed above the stochastic nature is not included in the above summarized deterministic models so one of the approaches used to describe fracture network s hydraulic characteristics mainly conductivity considering the stochastic nature is the percolation model stauffer and aharony 1985 aharony 1986 sahimi 1995 adler and thovert 1999 adler et al 2013 for an infinitely large system the probability p p for a selected site to belong to a spanning cluster is given by the following equation 8 p p p p c Œ≤ p p c where p is the probability of a site being occupied and pc is the critical threshold value the exponent Œ≤ is a universal exponent which is independent of the lattice characteristics but dependent of the dimensionality of space fig 2 a shows an ordinary conventional percolation system with different probability situations at a critical threshold value pc the system starts percolating and this is determined by the network type for example pc 0 59 for 2d square networks of site percolation the selected percolation thresholds for various lattices are shown in table 1 for site and bond percolation types many percolation properties obey scaling laws near the percolation threshold value pc this critical parameter depends on the euclidean dimension d 2 or d 3 of the system whereas pc is determined by the geometry of the network type the exponent Œ≤ is universally defined at 0 138 and 0 41 for 2d and 3d networks sahimi 1995 small clusters of connected fractures exist for small values of p for higher values of p the typical linear size of clusters and thereby the density of fractures in each cluster increases at the percolation threshold value pc they converge to infinity and the typical linear size of the cluster is defined as follows 9 Œæ p p c ŒΩ Œæ is known as the correlation length typical radius of percolation cluster for p pc i e below the percolation threshold the exponent ŒΩ is 1 33 and 0 89 for 2d and 0 89 for 3d networks table 2 above the threshold value pc a spanning cluster an open channel exists making the fluid percolate and thus yielding a conductive system if the mass of this percolating system spanning cluster is distributed uniformly aharony 1986 related the mass in a volume of finite size m to linear size l length with this relationship for l Œæ 10 m l d m dm is the mass fractal dimension it is related to the exponents in eqs 8 and 9 see these values in table 2 through the following equation 11 d m d Œ≤ ŒΩ where d is the euclidean dimension and Œ≤ and ŒΩ are the universal constants as described in table 2 dm defined in eq 11 is a universal value 1 9 for 2d and 2 5 for 3d systems if there is a spanning cluster above the percolation threshold pc the system percolates and the conductivity permeability k of the sample can be defined as follows 12 k p p c Œº p p c permeability can be related to the correlation length as follows if l Œæ homogeneous regime 13 k p p c Œº Œæ Œº ŒΩ on the other hand the permeability depends on the size of the sample l in the fractal regime l Œæ through the following relationship 14 k l l Œº ŒΩ the exponent Œº is given as 1 and 1 75 clerc et al 1983 for both 2d and 3d systems respectively and universal sahimi 1995 table 2 in a similar attempt bottger and bryskin 1985 reported an exponent value for conductivity of a 2d network system as 1 2 for lattice percolation fig 2 in the regime of l Œæ where the percolation cluster is fractal there are strong geometrical constraints on the physical processes occurring in fractures in fact the fractures show a more irregularly ordered medium and appear more random fig 2b compared to pore structures which could be represented suitably by regular lattice network geometries fig 2a then there are deviations from the universality of the exponents for the irregularly ordered medium and this constitutes the main objective of this paper these systems shown in fig 2b are called the continuum models and they are evaluated in the next section 5 continuum objects percolation model and its relation to fracture permeability and fractal geometry as opposed geometrically regular and statistically well defined lattice models fig 2a continuum models were suggested for representing and modeling fracture systems in nature fig 2b this makes the problem more complicated to reach the universal definition of the exponents and constants in the percolation models one of the most critical issues in this type of model is to quantify the connectivity which does not obey a universal rule as it does in the regular lattice model it is also a function of topological parameters such as fracture length density orientation and their distribution in the system the main problem of this type of ordering is connectivity in order to develop a percolating cluster berkowitz 1995 defined the connectivity for a fracture network system similar to the one seen in fig 2b with exponentially distributed constant length by the following relationship 15 p n n c Œ≤ where n is the total number of fractures in the domain and nc is the critical number of objects fractures at threshold he found that eq 15 is valid the exponent Œ≤ is equal to 0 138 for a limited range 0 05 n nc nc 0 5 meaning that in the finite samples of constant length near nc large fluctuations in the probability of connectivity interconnection may occur as the fracture density increases the probability of interconnection approaches unity and the finite size clusters start connecting to the percolating cluster thus this scaling relationship is useful to describe connectivity probability at higher densities however n nc nc 0 5 the probability of connectivity approaches unity quickly this indicates that more studies are needed to consider all possibilities of fracture network properties to reach a universal exponent to describe conductivity charlaix et al 1986 proposed the following equation replacing the probability in eq 15 with permeability 16 k n n c t they reported the exponent t in eq 16 for fractured rocks and found it to be 1 3 and 2 in 2d and 3d models respectively based on the work of guyon et al 1984 in which measurements were performed for different geometries of networks square triangular hexagonal and diamond in 2d and 3d halperin et al 1985 compared the exponents for discrete lattice percolation with their 3d swiss cheese randomly distributed system model and found that the exponent Œº in eq 12 is larger for their model than that of the discrete model the exponent Œº is geometry dependent and their suggested Œº values varied between 1 7 and 2 7 depending on the aperture of each network element single fracture which is apparently higher than the accepted value of 1 2 for 2d nolte et al 1989 hestir and long 1990 reported that the critical threshold pc is between 0 35 and 0 65 depending on the lattice type see table 1 and the exponent in the following relationship for permeability normalized with respect to the permeability at p 1 is independent of the lattice universal and about 1 1 guyon et al 1984 17 k k p 1 p p c t zallen 1983 suggested that the exponent could be as high as 1 3 but in general one may assume that t 1 hestir and long 1990 extended their work to examine the exponents for fractures of different sizes and orientations fixed density distributed with a poisson process in a 2d plane they validated the value of t 1 1 testing eq 17 for different and random length and density systems in the above exercises typically one type of geometry constant length was applied alternative representations for eqs 9 and 12 were presented by koudina et al 1998 and the constants and exponents were determined for different geometries as a range of values 18 Œæ œÅ œÅ c ŒΩ 19 k œÅ œÅ c Œº where œÅ is the number of fractures in the domain and œÅ c is the critical number of fractures per excluded volume 5 1 can œÅ c and Œº in eq 19 be universally defined as seen in the above summarized review a wide range of values of œÅ c and ¬µ were suggested for different geometries or statistics of fracture network systems one may need to converge these numbers into a single value for any given system to obtain a universal relationship more specifically the two parameters in eq 19 œÅ c and Œº are to be determined to estimate the permeability of continuum type fracture networks fig 2b several authors estimated a range of values for different geometries as mentioned above in a limited number of studies these values were formulated by correlating to relevant parameters fracture network and geometrical properties œÅ c is beyond the scope of this paper and efforts made for the quantification of œÅ c values will be summarized in the next section afterwards the correlation approaches for the exponent Œº will be discussed in detail 5 2 universal values for œÅ c mourzenko et al 2005 studied the effects domain size power law exponent and fracture shape on the percolation threshold of random fracture networks œÅ c they described the values varying between 1 53 and 3 02 for different domain shape and sizes and size length of fractures balberg et al 1984 and balberg 1985 suggested the following range for this quantity 3 2 œÅ c 4 5 for the 2d model and 0 7 œÅ c 2 8 for the 3d model huseby et al 1997 determined œÅ c to be 2 26 for equally sized triangles interestingly for square hexagon octagon and 20 gon of equal size fracture 3d systems the values were very close between 2 22 and 2 30 later the œÅ c values were reported to be highly geometry dependent as tabulated in table 3 a range of œÅ c values were defined by adler and thovert 1999 for different 2d and 3d fracture network geometries table 3 5 3 universal correlations for Œº the exponent Œº is more difficult to determine compared to œÅ c but it was shown that it can be correlated to fracture network properties and their representative fractal characteristics jafari and babadagli 2013 li and li 2015 yet a universal formulation covering all critical parameters and all possible systems considering the randomicity has not been proposed as opposed to universal values for the exponents defined for lattice models ŒΩ 0 88 Œº 2 0 stauffer and aharony 1985 in continuum percolation the exponent Œº might depend on the geometrical model which is highly random and typically complex fig 2b the interconnection of the bonds and thereby conductivity in a continuous network is determined by the geometry in other words ¬µ is a dependent on geometrical model and therefore yields a non universal behavior koudina et al 1998 determined the ratio of ¬µ ŒΩ for 3d random networks of regular hexagonal fractures the results are as follows for four different conditions 1 at the percolation threshold it is ¬µ ŒΩ 2 22 which is in agreement with the universal value of 2 3 estimated by stauffer and aharony 1985 2 at intermediate and high densities it is obtained to be ¬µ 1 57 their test for different bigger densities œÅ length to radius l r ratios r to be different disk radii in which different length l of fractures were embedded then l r to be number of fractures per unit volume showed deviations from ¬µ 1 57 koudina et al 1998 the first attempt to correlate the exponent to fracture network permeability was done by berkowitz and balberg 1993 they considered a simple backbone illustration texaslike farm and assumed that overall permeability decreases as the length of flow path increases hence the permeability k Œæ will drop sharply as the correlation length Œæ will diverge as the system approaches the percolation threshold then the conductivity exponent is defined as follows 20 k Œæ p p c Œ∂ k for the permeability of the entire system for a system of dimensionality d the following equation can be written for a square geometry texaslike farm as described by them 21 k k Œæ l Œæ d 2 combining eqs 9 20 and 21 the exponent Œº in eq 12 can be determined by the following relationship 22 Œº Œ∂ k d 2 ŒΩ these exponents are easy to determine for simple systems and this was an interesting attempt to bring an approach to describe the exponent yet it is not universal berkowitz and balberg 1993 further questioned what geometrical properties were relevant to connectivity what would be the threshold for percolations and what is the exponent ¬µ that describes the permeability next to the critical threshold they also noted that many systems have the same exponent ¬µ much later two attempts were made to describe the exponent ¬µ for a more general system jafari and babadagli 2013 proposed the following relationship for randomly distributed variable length variable size and variable orientation fracture networks for one type of geometry by fixing œÅ c as 3 6 as suggested in table 3 for the geometry they used 23 k 88 41 œÅ œÅ c 0 46 zhang and sanderson 2002 measured the exponent in eq 19 for different geometries and obtained values for 2d networks with different densities and distribution types orthogonal or random obtaining values between 1 05 and 1 37 which are not universal and are geometry dependent li and li 2015 also used fractal dimensions to obtain a correlation for the exponent ¬µ they began with describing the term connectivity f and showed that connectivity around the percolation threshold can be represented by 24 f œÅ œÅ c ŒΩ 3 d c Œ≤ where Œ≤ and ŒΩ are defined in eqs 8 and 9 respectively conductivity k can be represented as a function of connectivity f tortuosity fracture density and fracture aperture 25 k k o œÅ œÅ c Œº where the exponent is defined by 26 Œº 3 d c Œ≤ 2 d œÑ ŒΩ dc and dœÑ are fractal dimensions and ŒΩ and Œ≤ are to be determined for different fracture lengths constant and lognormal li and li 2015 stated that the fractal dimension dc defines the connectivity and dœÑ is the fractal dimension for the most probable flow path dopt or the most probable traveling time db lee et al 1999 they were defined as dopt 1 21 and db 1 64 for spanning clusters of random networks sheppard et al 1999 exponent ¬µ in eq 26 was found to be 0 924 for constant length and uncorrelated networks which has a fractal dimension of dc 2 0 this exponent is 1 122 1 257 and 0 919 for the constant length with dc 1 75 constant length with dc 1 62 and log normally distributed length with dc 2 0 respectively li and li 2015 compared the ¬µ values with others 1 6 by mourzenko et al 2005 0 46 by jafari and babadagli 2013 and 1 1 by yazdi et al 2011 attributing the difference to the fact that these studies neglected the contribution of non percolating clusters and the simulation ranges were above the percolation threshold all these attempts summarized above generated results for different geometries but limited the research to case specific even though some of them cover many different combinations of fracture length size for 3d models distribution orientation difficult to quantify usually random distribution and densities mourzenko et al 2005 jafari and babadagli 2013 li and li 2015 adler and thovert 1999 concluded that there is no characteristic fractal dimension with different fracture network patterns also referring to berkowitz and hadad 1997 based on these approaches one may observe that it is plausible to use fracture network characteristics mainly fractal dimensions to propose a universal correlation defining œÅ c and ¬µ but what should be considered is which fractal dimensions and which network properties 6 parameters controlling the permeability of a fracture network and their relationship to fractal geometry one step ahead of previous attempts towards the improvement of the correlations for the exponent ¬µ is to include a more optimal number of variables that directly control the permeability of networks this practice consists of three steps which are listed below in the form of questions 1 which network properties what are the fracture network properties to be considered in these correlations 2 which network characteristics of these network properties critical fractal parameters how are the network properties quantified measure using fractal and possibly other non fractal methods 3 which fractal methods for these network properties are these fractal methods consistent in representing the specific effect of the network property in the permeability correlations these three steps will be described further in this section 6 1 which network properties the following geometrical parameters control the conductivity of fracture networks 1 density spacing 2 length 3 connectivity 4 orientation anisotropy 5 distribution type of fractures location homogenous or heterogeneous distribution 6 aperture not a network property 7 shape for 3d systems tools to quantify those properties are fractals power laws scaling and resolution and percolation theory berkowitz 2002 the secondary parameters are rock types and stress condition causing fracture development which directly control the above listed primary characteristics of fracture networks many of these parameters e g fracture length and density can be the same but the distribution of fractures in space can be in many different forms e g homogenous log normal power law etc this is controlled by rock type fracture cause stress and history secondary and tertiary fractures may develop over time deviating from the original shape these different forms add more complexity therefore relating the network characteristics to physical processes rock type is avoided meaning fracture systems are taken as a geometric structure and evaluations are made based on this definition even this simplification has not been sufficient for accurate mathematical descriptions as multiple characteristics play a role at the same time therefore stochastic probabilistic models such as percolation are considered to better represent the systems the above listed fracture network parameters should be described and subsequently the exponent or the constants in eq 19 should be correlated to these parameters fractal characteristics have been shown to be one of the most useful options as they may inherently cover many of these parameters the next question is which parameters or characteristics represent these geometrical characteristics of the fracture network 6 2 which network characteristics of these network properties critical fractal parameters after describing all possible fracture network properties playing a role on the fracture network permeability one has to quantify them using fractal techniques hence we begin with the question of which parameters represent these geometrical characteristics of the fracture network or which characteristics of the network represent the phenomenon here is the list of characteristics for each network property to be determined their distribution fractal characteristics etc 1 density spacing fractures lines or shapes and their mid points 2 length fractures lines or shapes 3 connectivity fractures lines or shapes and intersection points 4 orientation anisotropy scanning lines 5 distribution type of fractures location homogenous or heterogeneous distribution 6 aperture not a network property 7 shape for 3d systems fractal characteristics of these properties can be found in many different resources individually but a comprehensive review of different techniques to measure the fractal characteristics of these properties can be found in research done by kruhl 2013 the next question is which fractal measurements represent which one of these seven parameters to be included in the correlation studies 6 3 which fractal method for these network properties after all one should define which characteristics of fracture networks play a critical role to be included in an expression created for the exponent ¬µ to universally define the permeability value based on the percolation theory this can be questioned as which fractal dimension s and any other quantification parameters would describe all the characteristics of these properties in other words which characteristics are best represented by which fractal dimension the fractal methods to describe the above listed parameters are discussed below 6 3 1 density and length two methods that are commonly applied to measure the fractal dimensions are the box counting bc and sand box sb mass dimension methods the bc method is based on measuring the number of object fractures as a line mid point or intersection points filled with boxes of different sizes fig 3 a and plotting the number of boxes against the size of the box barton and larsen 1985 roy et al 2007 when plotted on a log log scale the slope yields the bc fractal dimension through the following relationship 27 n r r d bc where n r is the number of the filled boxes and r is the box sizes and dbc is the bc fractal dimension the sb method is based on counting the number of features fractures as a line mid point or intersection points in a circle fig 3b the process is repeated with different sizes of uni centered circles and plotting the number of counts against the size of the circle the mass or sb fractal dimension dm is obtained applying the following relationship 28 m r r d m the number of counts m r is plotted against the size of circle r on a log log scale and the slope of the straight line yields sb i e mass fractal dimension bunde and havlin 1995 babadagli 2001 and jafari and babadagli 2009 2011 measured different characteristics mid point intersection point using different methods such as sb and bc it was concluded that the strongest correlation with fracture network permeability was obtained by the bc fractal dimension of intersection points and fracture lines as fractal properties along with certain non fractal measures such as connectivity index maximum number of intersections between fractures and imaginary scanning lines in the x and y directions jafari and babadagli 2009 2011 sb dimension did not show a strong correlation with fracture network permeability la pointe 1988 studied the relationship between the network permeability and fractal dimension for 3d systems the method that he followed to measure the fractal dimension was reminiscent of the bc method later la pointe 1997 noted that the flow is linearly proportional to the mass fractal dimension for the compartmentalized 3d fracture network systems zhang and sanderson 2002 measured the fractal dimensions of 2d synthetic fracture network s different densities and orientations using the bc method to determine the critical fractal dimension at which the system percolates they found a value of 1 3 on average it varied between 1 22 and 1 38 for different fracture density systems according to the following equation 29 d f a f d d c f df is the fractal dimension of the largest cluster it describes connectivity but interestingly it is determined by the bc method d is fracture density and dc is the threshold value at which the system starts percolating f is the exponent determining the universal law barton 1995 heuristically observed that the threshold fractal dimension determined by the box counting method on different natural fracture patterns is 1 35 which is coincidently consistent with zhang and sanderson s 2002 numerical models the exponent describing the connectivity was obtained to be very close to each other for different geometries of 2d fracture networks and averaged around 1 2 which could be considered applicable to a wide range of network systems as it did not vary significantly for the geometries they considered a group of works used mass fractal dimension to be used in correlations with permeability chang and yortsos 1990 presented a formulation for single phase flow in a fracture network system based on the following assumption for fracture network permeability kf as a function of distance r 30 k f r r d m d Œ∏ Œ∏ is an exponent defined from the object s structure d is the euclidean dimension and dm is the mass sb fractal dimension later li and li 2015 defined correlation dimension dc as shown in eq 26 which is a mass dimension of the fracture center distribution determined using the sand box method this dimension describes connectivity of the network as mentioned earlier la pointe 1997 observed that the flow thereby permeability is linearly proportional to the mass fractal dimension for the compartmentalized 3 d systems hence a controversial issue emerges as to which fractal dimension represents which feature of fracture networks this point needs further clarifications and will be discussed in the next section box counting vs sand box mass dimensions we begin with comparing the box counting bc and sand box sb fractal dimensions for a wide variety of random systems generated by jafari and babadagli 2009 the first comparison was done for the fractal dimension of the mid points mp and intersection points ip determined by the sb method a k a mass dimension against the bc fractal dimension of the fracture lines there are 20 different densities and fracture lengths and each case was run for different realizations using different random numbers yielding a total of 1000 runs jafari and babadagli 2009 no strong correlation was observed between the sb fractal dimension of mid points and the bc fractal dimension of fracture lines except the cases with low density and short length fractures fig a1 for the intersection points ip in the same plot only a few cases of high density fractures showed a relatively good correlation with the bc fractal dimension of fracture lines in fig a2 the fractal dimensions of mp and ip obtained by different methods bc and sb were compared the ips yielded a better correlation than the mp cases although no typical trend was observed for the mp cases only four cases yielded an agreement in fractal dimensions but some of them were high density long fracture and the two others were low density ones high density fracture networks showed consistent fractal dimensions similarly no consistent trends between the sb and bc dimensions were observed for other types of fracture networks figs a3 and a4 as seen the bc and sb fractal dimensions may converge above a certain threshold these observations led to test the natural fracture patterns in a similar manner and seek a trend between sb and bc fractal dimensions of the same properties fig a5 shows the results and as seen the inconsistency between the sb and bc dimensions are even worse than the random and synthetic patterns given in fig a4 the pattern s circle with a solid line showed consistency as displayed in fig a6 similar to the random cases they are well connected near or above the percolation threshold presumably high œÅ c consisting of a densely and relatively systematically distributed fracture system another characteristic of the networks is to have a single backbone that spreads over the network thus contributing to the conductivity a group of fracture patterns did not show consistency circled by dotted line and these patterns are displayed in fig a7 characteristically they are not well connected even non percolating such as the pattern in fig a7c more irregularly distributed compared to the ones in fig a6 and consist of unconnected multi clusters and dangling bonds fig a7b c d as seen in the above analysis although the same property fracture density and distribution is measured the methodology used to determine the fractal nature is different in these two methods yielding different fractal dimensions and trends this evokes the following question should we consider both fractal dimensions in permeability correlations also could both fractal dimensions be related to the hydraulic conductivity of fracture networks which one of these fractal dimensions is more related to the conductivity of a network in this case do we need more than one fractal dimension or fractal method fracture property for the same fracture characteristics mainly length density and connectivity controlling the permeability of the network which fractal dimension bc or sb is related to network conductivity rangriz shokri et al 2016 indicated that the permeability of the network is dependent on the backbone of the cluster this backbone cluster should spread over the network in order for the system to percolate and the bc method fracture lines to give a better estimate of the spatial coverage of the backbone cluster the sb method on the other hand detects local variations unconnected multi clusters and dangling bonds which has no or minimal effect on the control of the permeability of fracture network this in fact was shown by tuia and kanevski 2008 through a systematic exercise fig b1 displays two networks which are statistically the same number of fracture intersection points and geometrically topologically the same distribution identical except a small cluster at the center of fig b1a this small change in the local density is detected by the sb dimension indicated by a big difference in the value 1 67 and 1 98 for the pattern in fig b1a and b respectively this type of small change in the system is expected to have an insignificant effect on the permeability of the network and interestingly the bc dimensions are very close to each other the two patterns given in fig b2 reflect different pattern characteristics these patterns contain the same number of intersection points but different spatial distributions such two separate systems yielded very different bc dimensions 2 and 1 79 for fig b2a and b respectively but quite similar sb dimensions 1 91 and 1 86 for fig b2a and b respectively this means sb methods did not detect any change in the local density of this type there are empty parts in the pattern in fig b2b such difference in these two patterns significantly changes the permeability of the fracture network and this can be detected by the bc fractal dimension also covering the anisotropic nature of it as will be discussed later in 6 3 3 orientation a final support to this idea could be to conduct a similar test on a different type of data stalgorova and babadagli 2014 modeled tracer injection through a well structured fractured media with two mutually perpendicular fracture sets with equal lengths by random walk particle tracking simulations fig 4 after obtaining the production curves for different r values distance between injection and production wells as shown in fig 4 they generated the plots of the probability of a particle p t against traveling time t to reach the particle production well for scaling purpose the plots of p t rŒ≤ vs t rŒ± were created and the exponents Œ± and Œ≤ satisfying the scaling overlapped curves for five different r values were obtained they found that Œ± 1 81 and Œ≤ 1 66 for the particular fracture network type shown in fig 4 and identified the dependencies of these exponents on the fractal dimensions of the network the Œ≤ is the exponent related to the most probable traveling time p t the probability of the particle to have traveling time t whereas Œ± is related to the travelling time quicker for r1 than others and the latest for r4 in fig 4 hence the Œ≤ exponent has to do with distribution of the particle within the system which has to do with permeability interestingly Œ± was strongly correlated to sb fractal dimension and Œ≤ was strongly dependent on the bc fractal dimension as concluded by stalgorova and babadagli 2014 6 3 2 connectivity one of the most critical fracture network characteristics to satisfy a conductive system is connectivity it does not obey a universal rule as it does in regular lattice type percolation models and therefore it is the most difficult network characteristics to quantify and include in the correlations one approach to quantify the connective nature of the network is non fractal methods i e number of fractures per area to represent density or distribution of fracture intersection points jafari and babadagli 2009 defined a non fractal entity called the connectivity index and used it in their correlations connectivity index was reported to be the second most powerful parameter in the improvement of the correlation coefficient after the bc dimension table 4 connectivity can also be represented implicitly indirectly by other characteristics for example fracture lines length and intersection points density or the combination of those the longer the fracture lengths and the denser the fractures the higher the connectivity and percolation constants œÅ c in eq 19 incorporate the connectivity of the networks and other specific parameters might not be needed to represent it as also shown earlier the bc fractal dimension of fracture lines could even be sufficient for certain cases to include the connectivity nature of the networks in correlations in fact barton 1995 analyzed many different natural fracture networks and heuristically concluded that the systems percolate become conductive if the bc fractal dimension is above 1 35 which in a sense represents a threshold number to represent the connectivity to some extent there are however fractal approaches defining connectivity directly connectivity is quantified by the number of intersections per fractures with others adler and thovert 1999 and can be represented by different ways such as number of intersections per number of fractures babadagli 2001 scanline approaches babadagli 2002 could be an option to indirectly cover the connectivity or simply define the number of intersection points per unit area jafari and babadagli 2013 li and li 2015 used two fractal dimensions dc and dœÑ in eq 26 which are derived as follows dc this is the correlation dimension introduced by li and li 2015 as the spatial correlation of the fracture using two point correlation function defined by darcel et al 2003 which depicts the probability of two cracks within a distance r of the same cluster 31 c r n r n t where nt is the total crack center number of all cracks and n r is the number of crack centers within a distance r with the following scaling relationship one may obtain the fractal dimension dc 32 c r r d c this fractal dimension dc defines the connectivity through the relationship given in eqs 24 and 26 li and li 2015 estimated dc values for different densities and apertures varying between 1 62 and 2 0 for constant and 2 0 for log normally distributed fracture lengths dœÑ this is the fractal dimension for the most probable flow path li and li 2015 related this fractal dimension to a tortuosity œÑ term for random fracture networks if l Œæ is the cumulative fracture length in the backbone cluster and ls is its straight line length the tortuosity is œÑ l Œæ ls for a measurement increment Œµ dœÑ can be obtained by the following relationship 33 l Œæ Œµ l s Œµ 1 d œÑ lee et al 1999 stated that dt is equivalent to the fractal dimension for the most probable flow path dopt or the most probable traveling time db they were defined as dopt 1 21 and db 1 64 by sheppard et al 1999 for the spanning cluster of 2d random networks permeability is related to tortuosity œÑ fracture density œÅ fracture aperture b and crack connectivity f i e k k km f œÑ œÅ b where km is the permeability of the solid matrix but addition of aperture and relating the fractal dimension to connectivity is a critical step and these fractal properties were used to generate a correlation for the exponent ¬µ eq 32 despite these recent efforts on quantification of connectivity though fractal approaches we are far from a universal relationship the two fractal dimensions described above are functions of many fracture properties connectivity density and even aperture but not orientation even though the tortuosity concept may include the orientation effect to some extent that means this term should be incorporated in a correlation for the exponent ¬µ eq 26 and further tested for different geometries for validation 6 3 3 orientation fracture network systems may exhibit an anisotropic nature and therefore the orientation of fractures emerges as another critical parameter to be quantitatively included in permeability correlations non fractal scanline methods could be a practical approach in this attempt and as can be inferred from eqs 6 and 7 the scanning lines maximum touch in x and y and z directions could be useful in incorporating the orientation effect in the permeability correlations jafari and babadagli 2009 2011 in these correlations after the fractal dimension of intersection points and fracture lines using the bc method two non fractal indicators showed a strong correlation with permeability 1 maximum touch with scanning lines in the x direction and 2 maximum touch with scanning lines in the y direction these indicators cover the orientation effect on fracture network permeability for more fine tuned correlation jafari and babadagli 2009 2011 suggested adding the connectivity index connectivity was covered by the fractal dimension of intersection points implicitly connectivity index however did not improve the correlation but adding well test permeability was more useful for this thus the critical and controlling parameters to develop a correlation were the bc fractal dimension of the fracture lines or ips as well as scanning lines covering density orientation connectivity and length on natural patterns jafari and babadagli 2011 tested these parameters on natural patterns they observed that three parameters namely the bc fractal dimensions of fracture intersection points fractal dimensions of fracture lines and lacunarity yielded a reasonably good correlation for different types of rocks and regions in a geothermal region the correlation significantly improved when lacunarity is excluded and connectivity index maximum number of intersection points between fracture lines and the imaginary scanning lines in the and y directions are added as for the fractal methods several attempts have been made adler and thovert 1999 used 2d fracture networks to quantify intersection connectivity and orientation and showed that the probability p l that a fracture intersection occurs in an interval with length l along the scanline show the following scaling rule is expressed as follows 34 p l l d b db is the bc fractal dimension and it was observed that it depends on orientation of fractures led√©sert et al 1993 scanline fractal dimension approaches babadagli 2001 could be an option to directly cover the orientation an improved version of this method was proposed by babadagli 2002 based on a method developed by katz and thompson 1985 and applied by krohn and thompson 1986 on 2d images of porous rocks babadagli 2001 defined the following relationship for fractal behavior 35 n l l 2 d sl where dsl is called scanline fractal dimension l is the feature size distance between two intersecting points between the scanning line and fracture indicated by circles in fig 3c and n l is the number features counted through the imaginary scanlines indicated by the dashed lines in fig 3c this fractal dimension has not been tested on any permeability correlations or for the exponent correlations the fractal dimensions obtained from these methods were not tested to include the orientation effect in a correlation for the exponent ¬µ a critical question at this point is to what extent the bc dimension of fracture lines representing primarily density or the bc dimension of intersection points primarily representing connectivity and lines are sufficient to cover all these fracture properties reviewed so far length density connectivity and orientation rangriz shokri et al 2016 showed that the fractal dimension of fracture lines box counting as proposed by barton and larsen in 1985 was by far the most critical parameter correlated to the exponent ¬µ in eq 19 if other non fractal parameters connectivity index fracture wellbore intersection well test permeability fracture spacing maximum touch in the x and y directions are included along with the bc dimensions of the fracture lines no other fractal parameter is needed this is in line with jafari and babadagli s 2013 observations as given in table 4 they considered all possible configurations except the distribution their study was for the systems at the percolation threshold the exponent ¬µ in eq 19 is strongly correlated to the bc fractal dimension of fracture lines but the bc dimension of intersection points also showed a good correlation 6 3 4 distribution type anisotropy fracture distribution determines the anisotropic nature of fracture networks meaning it could be a useful tool in estimating the permeability in other words it how they are located in the network system indicates whether fractures are distributed homogenously or heterogeneously two different distribution types are illustrated in fig 5 a uncorrelated and 5b correlated by li and li 2015 although both network types contain the same number and size of fractures the distribution type controls the connectivity and orientation anisotropy if the fractures are distributed heterogeneously the distribution type should be included directly by assigning the type of distribution e g log normal power law etc or using indirect measurements in permeability correlations for example miao et al 2015 and wei and xia 2017 used the fractal dimension of fracture length and size distribution only in permeability correlations whereas jafari and babadagli 2009 included non fractal parameters such as scanning lines in different directions in their correlations eqs 6 and 7 as an indirect representation of distribution type li and li 2015 showed that dc as defined in eq 32 can be used to incorporate the distribution type connectivity and orientation in the fracture network permeability correlations the dc for the purely random system is close to the euclidean dimension which is 2 decreasing as the system generated a more clustered network this fractal dimension was used in developing the correlation for ¬µ shown in eq 19 if the distribution type is not identified and the estimation is purely based on the statistical data for the fracture length and number one may not be able to capture the conductive nature of the network accurately for the flow in the x and y directions which are similar in the case of fig 5a but totally different in the case of fig 5b another approach to cover the distribution type was tested by jafari and babadagli 2009 2011 fig 5c and 5d show similar discrepancies to the cases in fig 5a and 5b the distribution type effect could be covered in the bc fractal dimension or bc fractal dimension could help to cover the anisotropy effect as well implicitly which is justified by the significant different in the bc fractal dimensions for both network type consisting of the same number of fracture intersection points fig b2 despite close values of the sb fractal dimension for further improvement jafari and babadagli 2013 suggested adding the connectivity index as a non fractal parameter and this could be replaced by dc introduced by li and li 2015 to cover the distribution type directly affecting the connectivity and anisotropic nature orientation of the network 6 3 5 aperture aperture is the only non network property of fractures and in most of the studies covered in this paper it is ignored to a great extent this could be a reasonable approach as the aperture effect could be negligible compared to the other network properties such as density length and connectivity jafari and babadagli 2009 showed that the aperture of the fracture dominates only for a special case of low density short fractures and extremely high conductivity of all fractures high aperture this is usually not the case for systems above percolation threshold which is a requirement for a conductive network system on the other hand studies considering the aperture of single fractures exist li and li 2015 incorporated aperture affect in the permeability correlation eq 19 6 3 6 shape this paper mostly considered 2d fracture network system cases rather than 3d models the parameters tested and evaluated in this study could then be extended to 3d systems considering shapes instead of lines using a similar methodology in relating the fractal properties in correlations for permeability substantial work was performed to define the percolation characteristics œÅ c and ¬µ in eq 19 as a function of fracture shapes and their distributions for 3d models huseby et al 1997 koudina et al 1998 mourzenko et al 2005 these studies considered different geometrical shapes and the distribution types to develop a range of values for different 3d geometries the data generated could be used in a single correlation by relating the constant and exponent values to ¬µ in eq 19 in an effort for universalization 7 conclusions and remarks in general this paper sought an answer for this question can fractal geometry and percolation theories be combined to obtain a universal correlation for hydraulic conductivity of complex fracture systems more specifically the attempt was to test different fractal characteristics of fracture network properties using different methods to be used in an expression for the exponent in eq 19 the approach used was to first critically review and evaluate the concepts and correlations proposed previously next suitable techniques to obtain the fractal characteristics of the network properties were analyzed the evaluation and fractal analyses were based on 2d models but could be extended to 3d using the same approach it is critical to analyze if the inter correlations among those fractal characteristics should be searched to improve the quality of the expression developed for the exponent ¬µ in eq 19 for example using bc of mp representing the density of the fractures rather than ip representing the connectivity of the fractures could be useful in reducing the numbers of fracture parameters to be measured density length and connectivity of fracture networks are interrelated and the expectation was that the bc of the fracture lines for 2d fracture systems and ip points could be sufficient to cover these three characteristics although bc of ips is expected to primarily cover the connectivity nature of the networks interestingly the bc of the lines could be itself sufficient to incorporate the effects of all three properties that directly control the network permeability in this case one may question how many additional fractal characteristics are needed to improve the universal nature of the expression and if we can reduce the number of those to minimize the efforts for estimation measuring of the fractal characteristics of the networks another critical fracture network characteristic orientation can be represented by scanning lines at least in the x and y directions if not multifractal by scanning lines spectra in 180 or even 360 although this non fractal measure was tested and included in correlations eq 6 and 7 as well as the correlation for the exponent in eq 19 as seen in table 4 the fractal dimension of the scanning lines as proposed by babadagli 2002 eq 35 and eq 34 led√©sert et al 1993 adler and thovert 1999 could be another option specific efforts were made on the comparison of the sb and bc fractal dimensions of fracture lines ips and mps no correlations between these methods were observed with some exceptions such as well connected and homogeneously distributed networks with no significant number of dangling clusters in summary the bc dimension was shown to be the most powerful fractal tool to cover many aspects of fracture network conductivity related properties even including connectivity eq 29 although non fractal options exist newly proposed fractal dimension such as dc dœÑ and db as defined in eqs 32 33 and 34 respectively could be used to improve the correlations for the percolation exponent ¬µ given in eqs 22 23 and 26 an alternative way to generate correlation for the exponent in eq 19 is using the fractal dimension of property distributions i e the statistical characteristics like dc defined in eq 32 rather than the geometrical characteristics such as bc fractal dimension obtained by applying the measurements on actual fracture patterns the combination of both options could improve the accuracy and universality of correlations for the percolation exponents like ¬µ in eq 19 covering four essential characteristics length density connectivity and orientation and be an alternative to the geometrical fractal dimension only a final comment could be made on the other value in eq 19 œÅ c in eq 19 has a pure connectivity property but its description is not as simple as in the ordinary systems fig 2a for the continuum models fig 2b as listed in table 3 the values of œÅ c are functions of geometric characteristic of the fractures shape size type etc in general the higher the connectivity and the density and size in line with this the higher the œÅ c hu et al 2018 whether this description is sufficient for all possible geometries and fracture networks jafari and babadagli 2013 could be tested this was not investigated in this study but based on the outcome of this work one may intuitively state that fracture network characteristics and quantification tools through fractal characteristics showing correlations to the exponent ¬µ can be used to obtain correlations and improve the numbers suggested by adler and thovert 1999 as listed in table 3 for œÅ c as well in conclusion this paper moves the efforts on the universalization of eq 19 one step ahead all possible configuration and geometrical topological characteristics were discussed and the possibilities for the inclusion of them in the correlations were listed it is hoped that the quantities and fractal properties methods analyzed in this paper will shed light on generating more accurate and practical
