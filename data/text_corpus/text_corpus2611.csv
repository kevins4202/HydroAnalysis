13055,a new photoresponsive hyper cross linked polyamide thin film nanocomposite nanofiltration membrane was fabricated by incorporating polypyrrole graphitic carbon nitride ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst through interfacial polymerization for water decontamination and desalination applications an ultrafiltration polysulfone polyethylene terephthalate psf pet membrane support was prepared through phase inversion and a hyper cross linked ppy g cn polyamide active layer was fabricated on the psf pet by using n n bis 2 aminoethyl 1 3 propanediamine as an aqueous amine and terephthaloyl chloride tpc as a non aqueous solution while different amounts of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst were homogeneously dispersed in aqueous amine solution before interfacial polymerization reaction and three fabricated membranes were named as x ppy g cn hcpams out of the three fabricated membranes 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam was found to be the best performing membrane in terms of flux and rejection the maximum water flux of the membrane was found to be 78 57 l m 2 h 1 at 25 bars with rejection of eriochrom black t ebt approaching 99 90 at 20 bar moreover the 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam also showed a remarkable rejection of 79 58 and 72 88 for mgso4 and nacl respectively the 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam showed exceptionally high photocatalytic self cleaning as all of the organic fouling coloration due to ebt was removed under simulated solar light irradiation for 1 h leading to photocatalytic degradation of ebt the 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam membrane remained physically intact even after elongated exposure to light source graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanocomposite photo catalyst photoresponsive membrane nanofiltration water decontamination desalination 1 introduction the essentiality of water is central to survival of living beings as well as for the continuity of several industrial processes as water is pivotal to the wellbeing of human society the supply of clean water is in high demands for socio economic development of current age of rapid industrialization the importance of water can be realized from the fact that the availability of sustainable water for all has been incorporated at 6th position in sustainable development goals sdgs agenda adopted by international community to provide clean water to the masses by 2030 1 however water is getting polluted at an immense pace the contamination of water is caused by various organic and inorganic pollutants such as hazardous dyes heavy metal ions different divalent and monovalent ions which are deposited into water bodies by a multitude of sources of which rapid industrialization is at the top 2 release of organic compounds used in manufacturing toxic metals from tanning industries and dyes from paint textiles and inks industries are common sources of water pollution 3 4 similarly the release of untreated industrial effluents leads to severe water pollution which not only endangers the survival of aquatic life but also damages water quality requiring excessive treatment before use for a domestic or industrial purpose various azo dyes such as eriochrom black t ebt are extensively used in various applications such as complexometric titrations textiles painting and printing ebt is highly toxic poisonous and carcinogenic in nature 5 industries also release dye contaminated saline water which contains a series of salts such as caco3 na2so4 and nacl which need to be removed before using water for various applications 6 hence decontamination and desalting of dye contaminated saline water is extremely important for production of clean water a number of techniques such as adsorption distillation flocculation coagulation precipitation biodegradation and advanced oxidation processes have been frequently used for wastewater treatment 7 but membrane technology is green less energy intensive and has high potential for removing dyes and salts from contaminated water 8 moreover membrane based technologies have a huge potential for scaling up for industrial scale applications various membrane based technologies including microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have been developed and used for water purification 9 with potential of rejecting relatively low molecular weight 200 1000 da organic pollutants and divalent ions nanofiltration membranes nfms have huge potential for advanced industrial saline wastewater treatment 10 although nfms have enormous potential for water treatment and desalting but nfms suffer from a serious issue of fouling which is generally caused by different foulants including organic pollutants such as dyes which are adsorbed on the membrane surface through various interactions such as electrostatic interactions hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding which affect the performance of the membrane 11 such organic fouling is difficult to remove by simple rinsing and washing and hence some special treatment is required for the removal of such foulants from the membrane surface leading to an enhanced operation and lifespan of membrane 12 hence various methodologies have been adopted in literature for cleaning the membrane surface 13 but such methodologies suffer from certain drawbacks such as extended time for treatment high energy and solvent requirements hence developing a membrane with built in antifouling and photocatalytic self cleaning properties can be an excellent option which is getting attention by the research community as it is an ecofriendly and effective technique various semiconducting photocatalytic nanomaterials including tio2 zno and zns have been extensively used in photocatalytic degradation of organic foulants such as dyes as these semiconductors have excellent photocatalytic efficiency exceptionally high structural stability and above all non toxicity 14 16 the incorporation of various inorganic photocatalytic nanomaterials in the self cleaning membrane have proven to be an excellent option for mitigating fouling of membrane through photocatalytic self cleaning under light irradiation in a work carried out by you et al it has been observed that incorporation of tio2 in polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane enhanced the self cleaning performance of pvdf membrane due to increased dye removal through photocatalytic degradation 17 however the use of such photocatalytic nanomaterials especially tio2 needs activation by high energy uv irradiation as semiconducting materials have large band gap which hampers the utilization of these materials in real life applications as the uv light accounts for 3 5 of the sunlight 18 to activate the semiconductors with visible light and to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency different metal oxides have been doped in the structure of the semiconductors 19 however construction of uniform and homogeneous films metal oxide doped semiconductors has been challenging because of the non compatibility of the semiconducting materials with the organic monomeric amines such as meta phenylenediamine mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc to address this challenge a new approach is being adopted where an inorganic metal and organic component ligand are linked to together in the form of metal organic frameworks mofs which have been subsequently incorporated in the active layer of the membrane leading to enhanced self cleaning performance of the membrane in an example a copper triazole mof has been used in the fabrication of loose nfm leading to enhanced water flux and better self cleaning ability 20 despite the use of mof there is still a serious issue of the leaching and stability of the incorporated materials in the active layers of the membranes in order to address the challenge of leaching covalent cross linking of photocatalytic materials is an emerging trend in the fabrication of fouling resistant self cleaning thin film composite membranes tfc nfms 21 keeping the above issues and significance of covalent cross linking of photocatalytic nanomaterials in mind we have fabricated a new fouling resistant photo responsive self cleaning membrane by incorporating polypyrrole graphitic carbon nitride ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst in the membrane active layer through interfacial polymerization ip the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst was synthesized with the idea of developing an excellent composite with salient features of lower band gap and easy excitation by solar simulated light irradiation polypyrrole ppy is a promising conjugated polymer cp with extended conjugation along its structure which allows it to absorb light in the visible range and assists in excitation of the nanocomposite by visible light instead of uv only 22 another salient feature of blending ppy in the ppy g cn composite is the availability of highly reactive nh amine function for reaction with acid chloride of tmc or tpc terephthaloyl chloride leading to covalent cross linking of the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst in polyamide active layer of the membrane the new membranes have been fabricated by introducing a certain amount of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst in the aqueous solution of multifunctional linear aliphatic amine n n bis 2 aminoethyl 1 3 propanediamine tetra amine the interfacial polymerization ip was carried out on polysulfone psf ultrafiltration support prepared by phase inversion by using a linear cross linker tpc dissolved in n hexane the ip reaction led to formation of covalently crosslinked ppy g cn in the hyper cross linked polyamide active pa layer resulting into membranes regarded as ppy g cn hcpam the fabricated membranes have been thoroughly characterized by attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx atomic force microscopy afm x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps water contact angle wca and elemental mapping nanofiltration experiments with different salts such as na2so4 mgcl2 mgso4 cacl2 nacl and ebt as an organic foulant were performed the ebt fouled membrane was tested for its potential for self cleaning through photocatalytic degradation by using simulated solar light irradiation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials melamine pyrrole fecl3 eriochrom black t ebt nacl na2so4 mgcl2 cacl2 mgso4 hexane triethylamine tea polysulfone psf dimethyl acetamide dmac n n bis 2 aminoethyl 1 3 propanediamine naoh terephthaloyl chloride tpc di water and polyester terephthalate pet supports were used as it is without any further purification treatment 2 2 synthesis of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst was synthesized by simple wet impregnation approach coupled with thermal polymerization method for the synthesis of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst initially polypyrrole ppy was prepared by oxidative polymerization method using pyrrole as monomer and fecl3 as an oxidizing agent an aqueous solution of 1 pyrrole monomer 100 ml was taken in a round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and then 2 aqueous solution of fecl3 100 ml was added in a dropwise manner at room temperature this reaction was continued for 24 h under same conditions to complete the polymerization process after 24 h the resultant precipitate was filtered and washed several times with deionized water and methanol after complete washing the resultant precipitate was dried in an air oven at 100 c to obtain ppy powder after the synthesis of ppy it was dispersed in ethanol using ultra sonication bath and then mixed with 10 g melamine powder to obtain a homogeneous paste of ppy melamine powder initially homogenized paste was dried at 80 c for 30 min in an alumina crucible and then thermally polymerized at 550 c in an air oven for 4 h to obtain ppy incorporated bulk g cn after obtaining the ppy incorporated bulk g cn it was finely crushed by a pestle and mortar and then thermally polymerized again at 300 c in an air oven for 24 h to obtain the nanosheets of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst 2 3 fabrication of ppy g cn hcpam the thin film composite tfc ppy g cn hcpam membrane was fabricated through ip the polysulfone psf ultrafiltration support was prepared by phase inversion on pet support and kept in di water overnight followed by dipping the psf pet support in 0 05 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds for 24 h to increase the wettability of support an aqueous solution 2 of amine containing certain amount 0 05 to 0 25 of the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst was prepared and thoroughly homogenized by probe sonicator for 30 min then psf pet support was dipped in aqueous solution 2 of amine containing ppy g cn nanocomposite and the impregnation was carried out for 10 min after amine impregnation the excess amine solution was removed by using a rubber roller and membrane was dried in air and then the membrane was dipped in n hexane solution 0 15 of tpc and ip was carried out for 60 s leading to the formation of polyamide active layer containing covalently cross linked photocatalytic ppy g cn nanocomposite the fabricated membrane ppy g cn hcpam was dipped in di water before nanofiltration test various phases of membrane fabrication are given below in fig 1a while the reaction conditions for interfacial polymerization are given in fig 1b 2 4 characterization the ppy g cn nanocomposite and pure g cn was characterized by uv vis spectroscopy to evaluate the photo physical features of the g cn and ppy g cn nanocomposite using jasco v 670 spectrophotometer the chemical structure and nature of various functionalities present in g cn ppy g cn nanocomposite and in membranes samples was determined by using atr ftir ftir nicolet is50 thermo fisher scientific water contact angle was measured by using goniometer ca drop shape analyzer dsa100e kruss the surface morphological features of the membranes were determined by fesem qauttro thermo fisher scientific the elemental composition of the membrane was determined by edx analysis while the elemental distribution was determined by elemental mapping the surface roughness of the membranes was measured by afm agilent 5500 afm while surface chemical composition was studied by xps vg scientific escalab mkii spectrometer 2 5 nanofiltration experiments nanofiltration experiments were performed on a crossflow filtration setup sterlitech as demonstrated in schematic diagram in fig 2 the crossflow filtration setup is composed of a feed tank attached to a cooling condenser temperature cool bath while the feed outlet is connected with high pressure pump connected to a flowmeter and a pressure transducer and feed is supplied to three parallelly connected membrane cells membrane modules the membrane module has one inlet and two outlets one for retentate and one for permeate and the permeates were returned back to the feed tank through one inlet into the feed tank all the three membranes were installed in the membrane modules at the same time and the feed was changed according to the experimental requirements the used feed solution was discarded through discharge gate for the measurement of water flux di water was used as feed and the flux was estimated by using the following eq 1 1 j v a t where the water flux is represented by j l m 2 h 1 while v l is the volume of the permeate generated during a given period of time t h that has passed through the membrane during crossflow filtration experiments whereas a is the area m2 of the membrane the rejection was estimated by using eq 2 2 r 1 c p c f 100 the r shows the rejection of solutes during nanofiltration crossflow experiments while the concentration of the solutes is given by cp and the concentration of the feed solution is given by cf the concentration of various salts was kept at 2 g l 1 which was measured by conductivity meter ultrameter ii the concentration of the dyes in the feed 10 mg l 1 and permeate was estimated by uv vis analysis 2 6 photocatalytic self cleaning experiment the photocatalytic self cleaning of the fouled ppy g cn hcpam membrane was performed to eliminate the organic fouling from the membrane surface for this experiment photo responsive ppy g cn hcpam membrane fouled by organic dye ebt during crossflow filtration test was removed carefully from the membrane module and then fouled membrane was immersed in deionized water of 0 5 cm height in a glass container after that fouled membrane was illuminated by simulated solar light using a light source xenon lamp intensity 100 mw cm2 for the photocatalytic degradation of organic foulant adsorbed on the membrane surface 3 results and discussion the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst was fabricated by using wet impregnation approach coupled with thermal polymerization method the pyrrole was polymerized by using fecl3 resulting into polypyrrole ppy which was thoroughly washed dispersed in ethanol and homogenized with melamine for ppy g cn fabrication the homogenized paste was initially kept at 80 c for 30 min and after that kept at high temperature 550 c for thermal polymerization leading to formation of ppy incorporated bulk g cn nanocomposite which was later transformed into nanosheets of ppy g cn nanocomposite by further thermal polymerization at 300 c for 48 h the selection of g cn is attributed to its salient feature of being photo catalyst as among the various photocatalytic semiconducting materials g cn is unique in having aromatic triazine and heptazine rings as a part of its basic units leading to the formation of 2d lamellar structure with intrinsic molecular porosity moreover the g cn possesses a band gap of 2 7 ev which can absorb light in violet blue range making g cn a perfect polymeric semiconducting material 23 as g cn is a polymeric metal free semiconducting material and hence it is highly compatible for nanocomposite formation with polypyrrole ppy which is another important polymer with extended π conjugation in its backbone while numerous amine functionalities nh are readily available along the polymer chains of ppy the thermal polymerization of melamine among the chains of ppy could potentially lead to the formation of highly homogenous ppy g cn nanocomposite having salient features of both components such as photocatalytic potential of g cn light gathering capability of ppy which augments the photocatalytic potential of g cn moreover the availability of free nh groups of ppy in the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst provides sites for cross linking with acid chloride group of tpc during interfacial polymerization fig 1b furthermore intrinsic molecular porosity of triazine and heptazine subunits of g cn has potential to play a significant role in the nanofiltration performance of the fabricated membrane ppy g cn hcpam the intrinsic molecular porosity of g cn will introduce certain pore size in the structure of the membrane which will in turn allow only specifically sized molecules to pass through while others will be rejected hence intrinsic molecular porosity can potentially play a role in rejection of solutes from feed the fabricated ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst was thoroughly dispersed and homogenized in an aqueous solution of tetramine the psf pet support was thoroughly impregnated with the above aqueous solution of ppy g cn photo catalyst containing amine solution which was exposed to n hexane solution of tpc for ip the selection of linear tetramine with multiple amine functions in a single molecule offers multiple reaction sites for hyper crosslinking while the linear structure of tpc allows the minimized stearic hindrance among the chains resulting into a hyper cross linked polyamide active layer on the psf pet support moreover the free nh of ppy can also potentially contribute to cross linking with tpc during ip which leads to a covalently linked ppy g cn photo catalyst in the hyper cross linked polyamide active layer leading to minimized chances of leaching of the photo catalyst during the membrane operation hence the fabricated membrane ppy g cn hcpam possesses all the unique features needed for photocatalytic self cleaning under simulated solar light illumination for fouling mitigation the reaction conditions and various reactants along with possible structure of the fabricated membrane are given in fig 3 the g cn and ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst was characterized by atr ftir pxrd and uv drs it was clearly evident from the ft ir spectra of ppy fig 4a and g cn fig s1a that a broad amine nh peak is located at around 3400 cm 1 while the same peak is also present in ppy g cn nanocomposite which confirmed the presence of the reacting components in ppy g cn nanocomposite the pxrd patterns of g cn fig s1b ppy and ppy g cn nanocomposite is given in fig 4b where it can be seen that the ppy lacked the sharp peaks while in case of ppy g cn nanocomposite with two sharp peaks at 13 and 26 which are attributed to the presence of g cn in the nanocomposite as pxrd of g cn possessed similar peaks fig s1b 24 in order to evaluate the photo physical features of g cn fig s2a and ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst fig 4c the uv drs spectra were recorded to find out the absorbance of g cn and ppy g cn nanocomposite where it can be seen that both materials were absorbing in a mixed uv visible region of the light spectrum figs 4c s2a moreover the calculation of band gap for g cn fig s2b and ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst fig 4d showed a value of 2 80 ev and 2 69 ev respectively whenever there is a dopant or a loading material in the host material there is a donor state or defects state formed below the conduction band of the host materials when absorption accrues transition takes place from the valence band of the host material to the newly formed low lying defects state which results in reduction in the bandgap energy the evidence of various functionalities which are present in the pristine membrane and ppy g cn hcpam was obtained by atr ftir as shown in fig 5 the broad and deep band in the region of 3600 cm 1 to 3400 cm 1 is attributed to the presence of amide nh linkages of the polyamide network of the active layer of the membrane while the peaks located at around 3100 cm 1 to 2900 cm 1 are attributed to the aromatic ch and aliphatic ch and ch2 which are attributed to the presence of aliphatic tetra amine and aromatic tpc in case of ppy g cn hcpam the amide peak in the 3600 cm 1 to 3400 cm 1 gets more and more deeper with the increasing concentration of ppy g cn nanocomposite which hinted the presence of the ppy g cn nanocomposite in the membrane while the other important peak is of the carbonyl co which is located at around 1650 cm 1 which is due to the amide conh and pet carbonyl moieties moreover the fig 5b shows more of the fingerprint region of the membranes the surface hydrophilic features of ultrafiltration support psf pet pristine membrane hcpam and ppy g cn hcpam with various proportions of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst were determined by water contact angle wca fig 6 it can be clearly seen that wca of psf pet support increases from 78 35 to 96 50 which might be attributed to the formation polyamide active layer in case of hcpam however after the inclusion of the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst the wca shows a decreasing trend as the wca decreases to 88 21 75 11 and 70 12o in case of 0 05 0 10 and 0 25 of ppy g cn respectively increase in wca after deposition of polyamide active layer in case of hcpam might be attributed to the formation of a highly rough surface 20 a decrease in wca upon addition of 0 1 of ppy g cn nanocomposite in the membrane fabrication might be attributed to the formation of a relatively hydrophilic polyamide active layer due to the hydrophilic nature of the ppy g cn nanocomposite the surface roughness of all of the membranes was estimated by atomic force microscopy afm as shown in fig 7 it is clearly evident from fig 7 that average surface roughness ra of pristine hcpam was 26 2 0 05 nm fig 7a a1 while ra decreases to 22 4 0 05 nm 20 3 0 05 nm and 18 4 0 05 nm for 0 05 fig 7b b1 0 10 fig 7c c1 and 0 25 fig 7d d1 of ppy g cn nanocomposite incorporated hcpam membranes the decrease in surface roughness of the membrane upon addition of ppy g cn also highlights the fact that ppy g cn nanocomposite has actively participated in crosslinking reaction during ip based on the different observations during the membrane performance evaluation 0 1 of ppy g cn nanocomposite was the best suitable concentration for membrane fabrication the surface morphological features of the psf pet pristine hcpam and 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam were determined by fesem as given in fig 8 the fesem of psf pet ultrafiltration support is shown in fig 8a and a1 along with edx analysis fig 8a2 where it can be seen that the psf pet support was intact and possessed uniformly distributed pore structure while edx analysis showed the presence of essential elements of psf pet support which include carbon c oxygen o and sulfur s in case of pristine membrane hcpam fig 8b and b1 the formation of polyamide active layer is visible in the form of globular structures which have covered the psf pet surface completely fig 8b2 showed the presence of c o s and an additional element nitrogen n which was due to the contribution of tetramine in the polyamide formation in case of 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam membrane fig 8c the surface of the membrane became even more globular and denser compared to hcpam which can be attributed to the contribution of ppy g cn in the crosslinking event of ip the ppy g cn hcpam possessed a uniform ridge and valley structure similar to the commercial membranes fig 8c2 furthermore the active layer is devoid of any agglomeration of the nanocomposite which also hinted the uniform distribution of ppy g cn nanocomposite in the polyamide active layer moreover high resolution micrographs of pure hcpam and ppy g cn hcpam membranes are given in fig s3 where it was clearly evident that the globular surface became quite smooth after inclusion of ppy g cn nanocomposite during membrane fabrication the distribution of various elements in membrane is shown in the elemental mapping analysis shown in fig 9 it can be seen that c o and s were uniformly distributed over the entire membrane surface as in case of psf pet support fig 9a a3 while in case of hcpam in addition to other elements n is also equally distributed over the entire region of the membrane fig 9b b4 similarly in case of ppy g cn hcpam the n is uniformly distributed over the membrane fig 9c c4 the presence and uniform distribution of all essential elements throughout the entire region of fabricated membrane confirmed that all of the contributing components are present in the structure of the membrane in order to quantitively establish the elemental composition of the membranes xps analysis was conducted as given in fig 10 the xps analysis of pristine hcpam revealed the presence of elements carbon c1s nitrogen n1s and oxygen o1s at 286 7 ev 399 3 ev and 530 4 ev respectively at their respective atomic ratios of 79 9 6 3 and 13 8 although all of the elements c1s n1s and o1s were present in ppy g cn hcpam but their ratios were altered as c1s n1s and o1s were found at 71 0 15 5 and 13 6 respectively the higher percentage of n1s in case of ppy g cn hcpam is a confirmation of active contribution of ppy g cn nanocomposite in membrane fabrication moreover it was quite interesting to know that n c ratio of 7 8 and 21 7 while o c ratio 17 2 and 19 0 were found for hcpam and ppy g cn hcpam nanocomposite membranes an increase in n c and o c ratios after inclusion of ppy g cn indicated an increase in degree of crosslinking during interfacial polymerization as both co and cn are constituents of amide conh linkage the flux of di water was measured at various transmembrane pressures where the transmembrane pressure was varied from 10 bar to 25 bar it was observed the flux of di water was linearly related to the applied transmembrane pressure which hinted the integrity and stability of the membrane during crossflow filtration experiments among the various membranes tested the 0 1 ppy g cn hcpam showed best performance in terms of flux compared to the pristine hcpam 0 05 and 0 25 versions of ppy g cn hcpam the 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam has a flux of 78 57 l m 2 h 1 compared to pristine hcpam with a water flux of 52 85 l m 2 h 1 0 05 ppy g cn hcpam with a flux of 55 71 l m 2 h 1 and 0 25 ppy g cn hcpam with a di water flux of 54 42 l m 2 h 1 at 25 bars the trend of water flux by different membranes can be explained by considering several factors such as wca tightness porosity of different membranes lower permeate flux by 0 05 ppy g cn hcpam can be explained by large value of wca of 88 21 which is linked with decreased hydrophilicity of membranes leading to lower permeate flux of 55 71 l m 2 h 1 the higher permeate flux 78 57 l m 2 h 1 shown by 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam might be possibly due to lowering of wca compared to 0 05 ppy g cn hcpam and ideal porosity for passage of water molecules although the lowest wca is shown by 0 25 ppy g cn hcpam but its permeate flux was also lower which indicated that pure water permeation is not merely dependent on wca instead water permeation is dependent on other factors like membrane porosity and degree of crosslinking as 0 25 ppy g cn hcpam had the highest content of ppy g cn which might have led to extensive crosslinking as confirmed by xps studies leading to tighter active layer with decreased porosity resulting into lowest permeate flux of 54 42 l m 2 h 1 hence using higher concentrations of ppy g cn is not ideal for obtaining a best performing membrane therefore 0 10 of ppy g cn nanocomposite was found to an optimum dosage for preparing an excellently performing membrane in terms of pure water permeate flux and rejection of salts and pollutants however the rejection shown by pristine hcpam membrane was more than that of the nanocomposite membranes in case of all the tested salts including mgcl2 na2so4 mgso4 cacl2 and nacl this might be attributed to the rigidity and intrinsic molecular porosity of g cn sheets with possible inclination of the sheets at different planes allowing the slightly higher passage of the salts through the nanocomposite membranes compared to pristine hcpam however the rejections of the various nanocomposite versions of ppy g cn hcpam were still considerably high for all the salts different versions of ppy g cn hcpam showed varied behavior for different salts as 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam showed highest rejection for mgso4 cacl2 and nacl compared to 0 05 ppy g cn hcpam and 0 25 ppy g cn hcpam therefore upon consideration of the performance of the membranes in terms of flux and rejection 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam was found to be the best membrane with optimal performance as it showed high flux with reasonable rejection of salts such as mgcl2 the following fig 11a and b show the flux and rejection behavior of all the tested membranes to investigate the self cleaning potential of ppy g cn hcpam a feed solution of 10 mg g 1 of ebt was applied to the membranes installed in parallel in the crossflow filtration trolley and the ebt was allowed to deposit on the membrane for 2 h at 20 bars and the permeate was collected for analysis it is clearly evident from fig 12a that the uv vis of the permeate obtained from three tested membranes did not show any considerable absorbance at the λmax of 550 nm of ebt feed furthermore fig 12b shows that all three membranes has rejected 90 with rejection reaching to 99 9 in case of 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam and 0 25 ppy g cn hcpam which is even more clearer from the fig 12c which shows the experimental samples of feed and permeate the self cleaning properties of the photoresponsive 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam were evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of organic foulant ebt dye deposited on the membrane surface the membrane was taken out of the crossflow filtration cell and then irradiated by simulated solar light for 1 h to monitor the degradation of the organic foulant adsorbed on the membrane surface given the excellent photocatalytic behavior of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst the 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam membrane showed exceptional self cleaning behavior as all of the organic fouling coloration of the dye on the membrane surface was completely disappeared after solar light irradiation moreover the 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam membrane remained physically intact even after exposure to the simulated solar light as it is evident from fig 13 this might be attributed to 1 the possible covalent cross linking of the ppy g cn nanocomposite in the polyamide active layer through nh function of ppy which can easily attack acid chloride group of tpc in the presence of tea and 2 the photocatalytic efficiency of the ppy g cn nanocomposite was good enough to completely degrade the dye from the surface of the membrane although the polymeric membranes are prone to uv irradiation as the polymers can degrade on exposure to uv light however in current experiments uv light was not used solely for membrane irradiation instead a simulated solar light which was a mixture of uv and visible lights was used and hence it has less damaging impact on the membranes on the other hand the fabricated membrane showed a stable performance even after repeated exposure to solar simulated light the stability and recyclability of ppy g cn hcpam was studied by repeatedly applying ebt contaminated feed for three consecutive cycles and the ppy g cn hcpam membrane was self cleaned after each cycle by exposure to solar simulated light leading to cleaning of the membrane surface the ppy g cn hcpam membrane was able to retain its performance even after three cycles of ebt fouling and self cleaning as shown in fig s4 as ebt is a photosensitizer a control experiment was also performed as shown in fig s5 where it was found that ebt showed a photo degradation of just 22 while with the ppy g cn hcpam photocatalytic membrane the 82 of ebt dye was photo catalytically degraded under simulated solar light irradiation generally the working mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of the of the organic pollutants especially the dyes is based on the generation of reactive oxygen species ros including singlet oxygen which involves a series of oxidation reduction steps a possible mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of dye under solar simulated light is given in the following fig 14 the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of ppy possess 2 67 ev and 0 18 ev while the conduction band cb and valance bands vb of g cn lie at 1 12 ev and 1 57 ev respectively under solar simulated light irradiation both ppy and g cn get excited and generate e and h as the cb band of g cn is more negative compared to lumo of ppy some of photo generated e are transferred from cb of g cn to the lumo of ppy at the same time the h generated in the ppy homo are transferred to g cn leading to the separation of electrons and holes which results in their decreased tendency to recombine which in turn leads to enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ppy g cn nanocomposite the photo generated e could react with surface oxygen o2 leading to the production of superoxide radical o2 which in turn reacts with water and transferred to hydroxyl radical oh however the h generated on g cn cannot produce oh on reaction with water as the energy of the vb of g cn is lower than the standard redox potential of oh h2o 2 86 ev vs she hence the h generated on g cn react with the dye molecule leading to degradation of the dyes on the membrane surface 25 the summary of the complete mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of organic foulant dye is depicted in the following fig 14 4 conclusion in summary we have successfully fabricated a new photo responsive hyper cross linked polyamide active layer with ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst covalently cross linked in the active layer of the thin film composite nanofiltration membrane the active layer is fabricated by reaction of a multifunctional amine possessing four amine functions in a single molecule and terephthaloyl chloride tpc as a cross linker the interfacial polymerization was carried out on the ultrafiltration support prepared by phase inversion by using ppy g cn as a nanocomposite

the essentiality of water is central to survival of living beings as well as for the continuity of several industrial processes as water is pivotal to the wellbeing of human society the supply of clean water is in high demands for socio economic development of current age of rapid industrialization the importance of water can be realized from the fact that the availability of sustainable water for all has been incorporated at 6th position in sustainable development goals sdgs agenda adopted by international community to provide clean water to the masses by 2030 1 however water is getting polluted at an immense pace the contamination of water is caused by various organic and inorganic pollutants such as hazardous dyes heavy metal ions different divalent and monovalent ions which are deposited into water bodies by a multitude of sources of which rapid industrialization is at the top 2 release of organic compounds used in manufacturing toxic metals from tanning industries and dyes from paint textiles and inks industries are common sources of water pollution 3 4 similarly the release of untreated industrial effluents leads to severe water pollution which not only endangers the survival of aquatic life but also damages water quality requiring excessive treatment before use for a domestic or industrial purpose various azo dyes such as eriochrom black t ebt are extensively used in various applications such as complexometric titrations textiles painting and printing ebt is highly toxic poisonous and carcinogenic in nature 5 industries also release dye contaminated saline water which contains a series of salts such as caco3 na2so4 and nacl which need to be removed before using water for various applications 6 hence decontamination and desalting of dye contaminated saline water is extremely important for production of clean water a number of techniques such as adsorption distillation flocculation coagulation precipitation biodegradation and advanced oxidation processes have been frequently used for wastewater treatment 7 but membrane technology is green less energy intensive and has high potential for removing dyes and salts from contaminated water 8 moreover membrane based technologies have a huge potential for scaling up for industrial scale applications various membrane based technologies including microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have been developed and used for water purification 9 with potential of rejecting relatively low molecular weight 200 1000 da organic pollutants and divalent ions nanofiltration membranes nfms have huge potential for advanced industrial saline wastewater treatment 10 although nfms have enormous potential for water treatment and desalting but nfms suffer from a serious issue of fouling which is generally caused by different foulants including organic pollutants such as dyes which are adsorbed on the membrane surface through various interactions such as electrostatic interactions hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding which affect the performance of the membrane 11 such organic fouling is difficult to remove by simple rinsing and washing and hence some special treatment is required for the removal of such foulants from the membrane surface leading to an enhanced operation and lifespan of membrane 12 hence various methodologies have been adopted in literature for cleaning the membrane surface 13 but such methodologies suffer from certain drawbacks such as extended time for treatment high energy and solvent requirements hence developing a membrane with built in antifouling and photocatalytic self cleaning properties can be an excellent option which is getting attention by the research community as it is an ecofriendly and effective technique various semiconducting photocatalytic nanomaterials including tio2 zno and zns have been extensively used in photocatalytic degradation of organic foulants such as dyes as these semiconductors have excellent photocatalytic efficiency exceptionally high structural stability and above all non toxicity 14 16 the incorporation of various inorganic photocatalytic nanomaterials in the self cleaning membrane have proven to be an excellent option for mitigating fouling of membrane through photocatalytic self cleaning under light irradiation in a work carried out by you et al it has been observed that incorporation of tio2 in polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane enhanced the self cleaning performance of pvdf membrane due to increased dye removal through photocatalytic degradation 17 however the use of such photocatalytic nanomaterials especially tio2 needs activation by high energy uv irradiation as semiconducting materials have large band gap which hampers the utilization of these materials in real life applications as the uv light accounts for 3 5 of the sunlight 18 to activate the semiconductors with visible light and to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency different metal oxides have been doped in the structure of the semiconductors 19 however construction of uniform and homogeneous films metal oxide doped semiconductors has been challenging because of the non compatibility of the semiconducting materials with the organic monomeric amines such as meta phenylenediamine mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc to address this challenge a new approach is being adopted where an inorganic metal and organic component ligand are linked to together in the form of metal organic frameworks mofs which have been subsequently incorporated in the active layer of the membrane leading to enhanced self cleaning performance of the membrane in an example a copper triazole mof has been used in the fabrication of loose nfm leading to enhanced water flux and better self cleaning ability 20 despite the use of mof there is still a serious issue of the leaching and stability of the incorporated materials in the active layers of the membranes in order to address the challenge of leaching covalent cross linking of photocatalytic materials is an emerging trend in the fabrication of fouling resistant self cleaning thin film composite membranes tfc nfms 21 keeping the above issues and significance of covalent cross linking of photocatalytic nanomaterials in mind we have fabricated a new fouling resistant photo responsive self cleaning membrane by incorporating polypyrrole graphitic carbon nitride ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst in the membrane active layer through interfacial polymerization ip the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst was synthesized with the idea of developing an excellent composite with salient features of lower band gap and easy excitation by solar simulated light irradiation polypyrrole ppy is a promising conjugated polymer cp with extended conjugation along its structure which allows it to absorb light in the visible range and assists in excitation of the nanocomposite by visible light instead of uv only 22 another salient feature of blending ppy in the ppy g cn composite is the availability of highly reactive nh amine function for reaction with acid chloride of tmc or tpc terephthaloyl chloride leading to covalent cross linking of the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst in polyamide active layer of the membrane the new membranes have been fabricated by introducing a certain amount of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst in the aqueous solution of multifunctional linear aliphatic amine n n bis 2 aminoethyl 1 3 propanediamine tetra amine the interfacial polymerization ip was carried out on polysulfone psf ultrafiltration support prepared by phase inversion by using a linear cross linker tpc dissolved in n hexane the ip reaction led to formation of covalently crosslinked ppy g cn in the hyper cross linked polyamide active pa layer resulting into membranes regarded as ppy g cn hcpam the fabricated membranes have been thoroughly characterized by attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx atomic force microscopy afm x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps water contact angle wca and elemental mapping nanofiltration experiments with different salts such as na2so4 mgcl2 mgso4 cacl2 nacl and ebt as an organic foulant were performed the ebt fouled membrane was tested for its potential for self cleaning through photocatalytic degradation by using simulated solar light irradiation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials melamine pyrrole fecl3 eriochrom black t ebt nacl na2so4 mgcl2 cacl2 mgso4 hexane triethylamine tea polysulfone psf dimethyl acetamide dmac n n bis 2 aminoethyl 1 3 propanediamine naoh terephthaloyl chloride tpc di water and polyester terephthalate pet supports were used as it is without any further purification treatment 2 2 synthesis of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst was synthesized by simple wet impregnation approach coupled with thermal polymerization method for the synthesis of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst initially polypyrrole ppy was prepared by oxidative polymerization method using pyrrole as monomer and fecl3 as an oxidizing agent an aqueous solution of 1 pyrrole monomer 100 ml was taken in a round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and then 2 aqueous solution of fecl3 100 ml was added in a dropwise manner at room temperature this reaction was continued for 24 h under same conditions to complete the polymerization process after 24 h the resultant precipitate was filtered and washed several times with deionized water and methanol after complete washing the resultant precipitate was dried in an air oven at 100 c to obtain ppy powder after the synthesis of ppy it was dispersed in ethanol using ultra sonication bath and then mixed with 10 g melamine powder to obtain a homogeneous paste of ppy melamine powder initially homogenized paste was dried at 80 c for 30 min in an alumina crucible and then thermally polymerized at 550 c in an air oven for 4 h to obtain ppy incorporated bulk g cn after obtaining the ppy incorporated bulk g cn it was finely crushed by a pestle and mortar and then thermally polymerized again at 300 c in an air oven for 24 h to obtain the nanosheets of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst 2 3 fabrication of ppy g cn hcpam the thin film composite tfc ppy g cn hcpam membrane was fabricated through ip the polysulfone psf ultrafiltration support was prepared by phase inversion on pet support and kept in di water overnight followed by dipping the psf pet support in 0 05 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds for 24 h to increase the wettability of support an aqueous solution 2 of amine containing certain amount 0 05 to 0 25 of the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst was prepared and thoroughly homogenized by probe sonicator for 30 min then psf pet support was dipped in aqueous solution 2 of amine containing ppy g cn nanocomposite and the impregnation was carried out for 10 min after amine impregnation the excess amine solution was removed by using a rubber roller and membrane was dried in air and then the membrane was dipped in n hexane solution 0 15 of tpc and ip was carried out for 60 s leading to the formation of polyamide active layer containing covalently cross linked photocatalytic ppy g cn nanocomposite the fabricated membrane ppy g cn hcpam was dipped in di water before nanofiltration test various phases of membrane fabrication are given below in fig 1a while the reaction conditions for interfacial polymerization are given in fig 1b 2 4 characterization the ppy g cn nanocomposite and pure g cn was characterized by uv vis spectroscopy to evaluate the photo physical features of the g cn and ppy g cn nanocomposite using jasco v 670 spectrophotometer the chemical structure and nature of various functionalities present in g cn ppy g cn nanocomposite and in membranes samples was determined by using atr ftir ftir nicolet is50 thermo fisher scientific water contact angle was measured by using goniometer ca drop shape analyzer dsa100e kruss the surface morphological features of the membranes were determined by fesem qauttro thermo fisher scientific the elemental composition of the membrane was determined by edx analysis while the elemental distribution was determined by elemental mapping the surface roughness of the membranes was measured by afm agilent 5500 afm while surface chemical composition was studied by xps vg scientific escalab mkii spectrometer 2 5 nanofiltration experiments nanofiltration experiments were performed on a crossflow filtration setup sterlitech as demonstrated in schematic diagram in fig 2 the crossflow filtration setup is composed of a feed tank attached to a cooling condenser temperature cool bath while the feed outlet is connected with high pressure pump connected to a flowmeter and a pressure transducer and feed is supplied to three parallelly connected membrane cells membrane modules the membrane module has one inlet and two outlets one for retentate and one for permeate and the permeates were returned back to the feed tank through one inlet into the feed tank all the three membranes were installed in the membrane modules at the same time and the feed was changed according to the experimental requirements the used feed solution was discarded through discharge gate for the measurement of water flux di water was used as feed and the flux was estimated by using the following eq 1 1 j v a t where the water flux is represented by j l m 2 h 1 while v l is the volume of the permeate generated during a given period of time t h that has passed through the membrane during crossflow filtration experiments whereas a is the area m2 of the membrane the rejection was estimated by using eq 2 2 r 1 c p c f 100 the r shows the rejection of solutes during nanofiltration crossflow experiments while the concentration of the solutes is given by cp and the concentration of the feed solution is given by cf the concentration of various salts was kept at 2 g l 1 which was measured by conductivity meter ultrameter ii the concentration of the dyes in the feed 10 mg l 1 and permeate was estimated by uv vis analysis 2 6 photocatalytic self cleaning experiment the photocatalytic self cleaning of the fouled ppy g cn hcpam membrane was performed to eliminate the organic fouling from the membrane surface for this experiment photo responsive ppy g cn hcpam membrane fouled by organic dye ebt during crossflow filtration test was removed carefully from the membrane module and then fouled membrane was immersed in deionized water of 0 5 cm height in a glass container after that fouled membrane was illuminated by simulated solar light using a light source xenon lamp intensity 100 mw cm2 for the photocatalytic degradation of organic foulant adsorbed on the membrane surface 3 results and discussion the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst was fabricated by using wet impregnation approach coupled with thermal polymerization method the pyrrole was polymerized by using fecl3 resulting into polypyrrole ppy which was thoroughly washed dispersed in ethanol and homogenized with melamine for ppy g cn fabrication the homogenized paste was initially kept at 80 c for 30 min and after that kept at high temperature 550 c for thermal polymerization leading to formation of ppy incorporated bulk g cn nanocomposite which was later transformed into nanosheets of ppy g cn nanocomposite by further thermal polymerization at 300 c for 48 h the selection of g cn is attributed to its salient feature of being photo catalyst as among the various photocatalytic semiconducting materials g cn is unique in having aromatic triazine and heptazine rings as a part of its basic units leading to the formation of 2d lamellar structure with intrinsic molecular porosity moreover the g cn possesses a band gap of 2 7 ev which can absorb light in violet blue range making g cn a perfect polymeric semiconducting material 23 as g cn is a polymeric metal free semiconducting material and hence it is highly compatible for nanocomposite formation with polypyrrole ppy which is another important polymer with extended π conjugation in its backbone while numerous amine functionalities nh are readily available along the polymer chains of ppy the thermal polymerization of melamine among the chains of ppy could potentially lead to the formation of highly homogenous ppy g cn nanocomposite having salient features of both components such as photocatalytic potential of g cn light gathering capability of ppy which augments the photocatalytic potential of g cn moreover the availability of free nh groups of ppy in the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst provides sites for cross linking with acid chloride group of tpc during interfacial polymerization fig 1b furthermore intrinsic molecular porosity of triazine and heptazine subunits of g cn has potential to play a significant role in the nanofiltration performance of the fabricated membrane ppy g cn hcpam the intrinsic molecular porosity of g cn will introduce certain pore size in the structure of the membrane which will in turn allow only specifically sized molecules to pass through while others will be rejected hence intrinsic molecular porosity can potentially play a role in rejection of solutes from feed the fabricated ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst was thoroughly dispersed and homogenized in an aqueous solution of tetramine the psf pet support was thoroughly impregnated with the above aqueous solution of ppy g cn photo catalyst containing amine solution which was exposed to n hexane solution of tpc for ip the selection of linear tetramine with multiple amine functions in a single molecule offers multiple reaction sites for hyper crosslinking while the linear structure of tpc allows the minimized stearic hindrance among the chains resulting into a hyper cross linked polyamide active layer on the psf pet support moreover the free nh of ppy can also potentially contribute to cross linking with tpc during ip which leads to a covalently linked ppy g cn photo catalyst in the hyper cross linked polyamide active layer leading to minimized chances of leaching of the photo catalyst during the membrane operation hence the fabricated membrane ppy g cn hcpam possesses all the unique features needed for photocatalytic self cleaning under simulated solar light illumination for fouling mitigation the reaction conditions and various reactants along with possible structure of the fabricated membrane are given in fig 3 the g cn and ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst was characterized by atr ftir pxrd and uv drs it was clearly evident from the ft ir spectra of ppy fig 4a and g cn fig s1a that a broad amine nh peak is located at around 3400 cm 1 while the same peak is also present in ppy g cn nanocomposite which confirmed the presence of the reacting components in ppy g cn nanocomposite the pxrd patterns of g cn fig s1b ppy and ppy g cn nanocomposite is given in fig 4b where it can be seen that the ppy lacked the sharp peaks while in case of ppy g cn nanocomposite with two sharp peaks at 13 and 26 which are attributed to the presence of g cn in the nanocomposite as pxrd of g cn possessed similar peaks fig s1b 24 in order to evaluate the photo physical features of g cn fig s2a and ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst fig 4c the uv drs spectra were recorded to find out the absorbance of g cn and ppy g cn nanocomposite where it can be seen that both materials were absorbing in a mixed uv visible region of the light spectrum figs 4c s2a moreover the calculation of band gap for g cn fig s2b and ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst fig 4d showed a value of 2 80 ev and 2 69 ev respectively whenever there is a dopant or a loading material in the host material there is a donor state or defects state formed below the conduction band of the host materials when absorption accrues transition takes place from the valence band of the host material to the newly formed low lying defects state which results in reduction in the bandgap energy the evidence of various functionalities which are present in the pristine membrane and ppy g cn hcpam was obtained by atr ftir as shown in fig 5 the broad and deep band in the region of 3600 cm 1 to 3400 cm 1 is attributed to the presence of amide nh linkages of the polyamide network of the active layer of the membrane while the peaks located at around 3100 cm 1 to 2900 cm 1 are attributed to the aromatic ch and aliphatic ch and ch2 which are attributed to the presence of aliphatic tetra amine and aromatic tpc in case of ppy g cn hcpam the amide peak in the 3600 cm 1 to 3400 cm 1 gets more and more deeper with the increasing concentration of ppy g cn nanocomposite which hinted the presence of the ppy g cn nanocomposite in the membrane while the other important peak is of the carbonyl co which is located at around 1650 cm 1 which is due to the amide conh and pet carbonyl moieties moreover the fig 5b shows more of the fingerprint region of the membranes the surface hydrophilic features of ultrafiltration support psf pet pristine membrane hcpam and ppy g cn hcpam with various proportions of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst were determined by water contact angle wca fig 6 it can be clearly seen that wca of psf pet support increases from 78 35 to 96 50 which might be attributed to the formation polyamide active layer in case of hcpam however after the inclusion of the ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst the wca shows a decreasing trend as the wca decreases to 88 21 75 11 and 70 12o in case of 0 05 0 10 and 0 25 of ppy g cn respectively increase in wca after deposition of polyamide active layer in case of hcpam might be attributed to the formation of a highly rough surface 20 a decrease in wca upon addition of 0 1 of ppy g cn nanocomposite in the membrane fabrication might be attributed to the formation of a relatively hydrophilic polyamide active layer due to the hydrophilic nature of the ppy g cn nanocomposite the surface roughness of all of the membranes was estimated by atomic force microscopy afm as shown in fig 7 it is clearly evident from fig 7 that average surface roughness ra of pristine hcpam was 26 2 0 05 nm fig 7a a1 while ra decreases to 22 4 0 05 nm 20 3 0 05 nm and 18 4 0 05 nm for 0 05 fig 7b b1 0 10 fig 7c c1 and 0 25 fig 7d d1 of ppy g cn nanocomposite incorporated hcpam membranes the decrease in surface roughness of the membrane upon addition of ppy g cn also highlights the fact that ppy g cn nanocomposite has actively participated in crosslinking reaction during ip based on the different observations during the membrane performance evaluation 0 1 of ppy g cn nanocomposite was the best suitable concentration for membrane fabrication the surface morphological features of the psf pet pristine hcpam and 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam were determined by fesem as given in fig 8 the fesem of psf pet ultrafiltration support is shown in fig 8a and a1 along with edx analysis fig 8a2 where it can be seen that the psf pet support was intact and possessed uniformly distributed pore structure while edx analysis showed the presence of essential elements of psf pet support which include carbon c oxygen o and sulfur s in case of pristine membrane hcpam fig 8b and b1 the formation of polyamide active layer is visible in the form of globular structures which have covered the psf pet surface completely fig 8b2 showed the presence of c o s and an additional element nitrogen n which was due to the contribution of tetramine in the polyamide formation in case of 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam membrane fig 8c the surface of the membrane became even more globular and denser compared to hcpam which can be attributed to the contribution of ppy g cn in the crosslinking event of ip the ppy g cn hcpam possessed a uniform ridge and valley structure similar to the commercial membranes fig 8c2 furthermore the active layer is devoid of any agglomeration of the nanocomposite which also hinted the uniform distribution of ppy g cn nanocomposite in the polyamide active layer moreover high resolution micrographs of pure hcpam and ppy g cn hcpam membranes are given in fig s3 where it was clearly evident that the globular surface became quite smooth after inclusion of ppy g cn nanocomposite during membrane fabrication the distribution of various elements in membrane is shown in the elemental mapping analysis shown in fig 9 it can be seen that c o and s were uniformly distributed over the entire membrane surface as in case of psf pet support fig 9a a3 while in case of hcpam in addition to other elements n is also equally distributed over the entire region of the membrane fig 9b b4 similarly in case of ppy g cn hcpam the n is uniformly distributed over the membrane fig 9c c4 the presence and uniform distribution of all essential elements throughout the entire region of fabricated membrane confirmed that all of the contributing components are present in the structure of the membrane in order to quantitively establish the elemental composition of the membranes xps analysis was conducted as given in fig 10 the xps analysis of pristine hcpam revealed the presence of elements carbon c1s nitrogen n1s and oxygen o1s at 286 7 ev 399 3 ev and 530 4 ev respectively at their respective atomic ratios of 79 9 6 3 and 13 8 although all of the elements c1s n1s and o1s were present in ppy g cn hcpam but their ratios were altered as c1s n1s and o1s were found at 71 0 15 5 and 13 6 respectively the higher percentage of n1s in case of ppy g cn hcpam is a confirmation of active contribution of ppy g cn nanocomposite in membrane fabrication moreover it was quite interesting to know that n c ratio of 7 8 and 21 7 while o c ratio 17 2 and 19 0 were found for hcpam and ppy g cn hcpam nanocomposite membranes an increase in n c and o c ratios after inclusion of ppy g cn indicated an increase in degree of crosslinking during interfacial polymerization as both co and cn are constituents of amide conh linkage the flux of di water was measured at various transmembrane pressures where the transmembrane pressure was varied from 10 bar to 25 bar it was observed the flux of di water was linearly related to the applied transmembrane pressure which hinted the integrity and stability of the membrane during crossflow filtration experiments among the various membranes tested the 0 1 ppy g cn hcpam showed best performance in terms of flux compared to the pristine hcpam 0 05 and 0 25 versions of ppy g cn hcpam the 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam has a flux of 78 57 l m 2 h 1 compared to pristine hcpam with a water flux of 52 85 l m 2 h 1 0 05 ppy g cn hcpam with a flux of 55 71 l m 2 h 1 and 0 25 ppy g cn hcpam with a di water flux of 54 42 l m 2 h 1 at 25 bars the trend of water flux by different membranes can be explained by considering several factors such as wca tightness porosity of different membranes lower permeate flux by 0 05 ppy g cn hcpam can be explained by large value of wca of 88 21 which is linked with decreased hydrophilicity of membranes leading to lower permeate flux of 55 71 l m 2 h 1 the higher permeate flux 78 57 l m 2 h 1 shown by 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam might be possibly due to lowering of wca compared to 0 05 ppy g cn hcpam and ideal porosity for passage of water molecules although the lowest wca is shown by 0 25 ppy g cn hcpam but its permeate flux was also lower which indicated that pure water permeation is not merely dependent on wca instead water permeation is dependent on other factors like membrane porosity and degree of crosslinking as 0 25 ppy g cn hcpam had the highest content of ppy g cn which might have led to extensive crosslinking as confirmed by xps studies leading to tighter active layer with decreased porosity resulting into lowest permeate flux of 54 42 l m 2 h 1 hence using higher concentrations of ppy g cn is not ideal for obtaining a best performing membrane therefore 0 10 of ppy g cn nanocomposite was found to an optimum dosage for preparing an excellently performing membrane in terms of pure water permeate flux and rejection of salts and pollutants however the rejection shown by pristine hcpam membrane was more than that of the nanocomposite membranes in case of all the tested salts including mgcl2 na2so4 mgso4 cacl2 and nacl this might be attributed to the rigidity and intrinsic molecular porosity of g cn sheets with possible inclination of the sheets at different planes allowing the slightly higher passage of the salts through the nanocomposite membranes compared to pristine hcpam however the rejections of the various nanocomposite versions of ppy g cn hcpam were still considerably high for all the salts different versions of ppy g cn hcpam showed varied behavior for different salts as 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam showed highest rejection for mgso4 cacl2 and nacl compared to 0 05 ppy g cn hcpam and 0 25 ppy g cn hcpam therefore upon consideration of the performance of the membranes in terms of flux and rejection 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam was found to be the best membrane with optimal performance as it showed high flux with reasonable rejection of salts such as mgcl2 the following fig 11a and b show the flux and rejection behavior of all the tested membranes to investigate the self cleaning potential of ppy g cn hcpam a feed solution of 10 mg g 1 of ebt was applied to the membranes installed in parallel in the crossflow filtration trolley and the ebt was allowed to deposit on the membrane for 2 h at 20 bars and the permeate was collected for analysis it is clearly evident from fig 12a that the uv vis of the permeate obtained from three tested membranes did not show any considerable absorbance at the λmax of 550 nm of ebt feed furthermore fig 12b shows that all three membranes has rejected 90 with rejection reaching to 99 9 in case of 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam and 0 25 ppy g cn hcpam which is even more clearer from the fig 12c which shows the experimental samples of feed and permeate the self cleaning properties of the photoresponsive 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam were evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of organic foulant ebt dye deposited on the membrane surface the membrane was taken out of the crossflow filtration cell and then irradiated by simulated solar light for 1 h to monitor the degradation of the organic foulant adsorbed on the membrane surface given the excellent photocatalytic behavior of ppy g cn nanocomposite photo catalyst the 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam membrane showed exceptional self cleaning behavior as all of the organic fouling coloration of the dye on the membrane surface was completely disappeared after solar light irradiation moreover the 0 10 ppy g cn hcpam membrane remained physically intact even after exposure to the simulated solar light as it is evident from fig 13 this might be attributed to 1 the possible covalent cross linking of the ppy g cn nanocomposite in the polyamide active layer through nh function of ppy which can easily attack acid chloride group of tpc in the presence of tea and 2 the photocatalytic efficiency of the ppy g cn nanocomposite was good enough to completely degrade the dye from the surface of the membrane although the polymeric membranes are prone to uv irradiation as the polymers can degrade on exposure to uv light however in current experiments uv light was not used solely for membrane irradiation instead a simulated solar light which was a mixture of uv and visible lights was used and hence it has less damaging impact on the membranes on the other hand the fabricated membrane showed a stable performance even after repeated exposure to solar simulated light the stability and recyclability of ppy g cn hcpam was studied by repeatedly applying ebt contaminated feed for three consecutive cycles and the ppy g cn hcpam membrane was self cleaned after each cycle by exposure to solar simulated light leading to cleaning of the membrane surface the ppy g cn hcpam membrane was able to retain its performance even after three cycles of ebt fouling and self cleaning as shown in fig s4 as ebt is a photosensitizer a control experiment was also performed as shown in fig s5 where it was found that ebt showed a photo degradation of just 22 while with the ppy g cn hcpam photocatalytic membrane the 82 of ebt dye was photo catalytically degraded under simulated solar light irradiation generally the working mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of the of the organic pollutants especially the dyes is based on the generation of reactive oxygen species ros including singlet oxygen which involves a series of oxidation reduction steps a possible mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of dye under solar simulated light is given in the following fig 14 the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of ppy possess 2 67 ev and 0 18 ev while the conduction band cb and valance bands vb of g cn lie at 1 12 ev and 1 57 ev respectively under solar simulated light irradiation both ppy and g cn get excited and generate e and h as the cb band of g cn is more negative compared to lumo of ppy some of photo generated e are transferred from cb of g cn to the lumo of ppy at the same time the h generated in the ppy homo are transferred to g cn leading to the separation of electrons and holes which results in their decreased tendency to recombine which in turn leads to enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ppy g cn nanocomposite the photo generated e could react with surface oxygen o2 leading to the production of superoxide radical o2 which in turn reacts with water and transferred to hydroxyl radical oh however the h generated on g cn cannot produce oh on reaction with water as the energy of the vb of g cn is lower than the standard redox potential of oh h2o 2 86 ev vs she hence the h generated on g cn react

analogues cesium ion adsorption 1 introduction the concern for the effluent containing radioactive elements is currently rising rapidly on account of that the exposure of organisms to radioactive effluent can cause various health problems resulting from chemical toxicity and radiation 1 3 three radioisotopes of radioactive cs 134cs 135cs and 137cs in effluent are produced in large quantities during fission and have long half lives mainly from research facilities nuclear weapons testing nuclear power plants and spent fuel reprocessing 4 5 as a result the removal of cs from effluent is very significant 6 8 getting rid of cs from effluent efficiently is still a great challenging task in view of their good solubility in water high affinity and easy migration in the surroundings 9 11 adsorption chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane separation and evaporation are all highly efficient removing techniques for radionuclides 12 20 adsorption is considered an efficient technique on account of its low cost and simplicity of handling 21 27 a variety of adsorbents have been developed to treat radioactive effluents nevertheless the existing adsorbents do not meet the practical needs in terms of efficiency capacity and selectivity new adsorbent development is therefore necessary for the effective treatment of radioactive effluents 9 13 many materials are already available for the treatment of contaminants with radioactive elements and heavy metals including heavy metals such as graphene oxides and their derivatives metal organic frameworks mofs carbon nanotubes layered double hydroxides ldhs 28 39 and clay minerals 40 41 graphene oxide with its unparalleled physicochemical properties such as large quantities of surface functional groups as well as highly specific surface area is of greater interest 42 44 especially assembled by two dimensional graphene building units three dimensional reduced graphene oxide aerogels 3drgoa own a unique three dimensional hierarchical structure composed of macro medium and micro pores 45 46 which is conducive to mass transfer and diffusion of adsorbent 3drgoa has become a research hotspot and widely reported as an excellent carrier for other active substances 9 29 30 47 49 typically template assisted development self assembled and direct deposition can be applied to construct 3drgoa among which self assembled is considered the most common method 50 51 in representative cases 3drgoa is self assembled through directly reducing graphene oxide dispersions by hydrothermal reduction or chemical reduction 52 however 3drgoa s strong hydrophobic interactions and fewer surface functional groups limit its broader application to resolve these problems hydrophilic modification of 3drgoa is needed to remove hydrophilic contaminants from aqueous solutions hao et al reported a 3d prussian blue doped rgo utilized in the field of effluent treatment 53 simultaneously gupta et al got rid of cs and sr2 through applying kms 1 rgo aerogel 54 lee et al synthesized prussian blue loaded pvp rgo polyvinylpyrrolidone reduced graphene oxide aerogels to absorb hazardous contaminants 55 prussian blue pb is a broad category of functional materials with open skeletal structures that facilitates rapid ion conduction and thus enhances ion adsorption so as to prussian blue analogs pbas 56 59 the abundant interstitial sites in pbas makes it possible to keep most of alkali metals and polyvalent metals including aluminum al sodium na et al pbas are usually denoted as ax may mb cn 6 z nh2o where ma and mb are normally manganese mn zinc zn or iron fe etc and a is normally sodium na lithium li or potassium k where the strength of ligand round the central ion are determined by the spin state 60 pb pbas is considered as special adsorbents for cs because of their good adsorption capacity 61 63 simple preparation method and good adsorption selectivity however pb pbas is difficult to separate from solutions on account of their strong aggregation which severely limits their application therefore pb pbas hybrid functional materials as an efficient solution have attracted the attention of many researchers wi et al selectively removed cs using the functional porous polyvinyl alcohol sponge modified by pb 64 the composite had good adsorption and accessible separation properties likewise lee et al developed a new strategy to utilize the copper ferrocyanide embedded magnetic hydrogel microbeads to absorb cs from effluent 65 certainly the combination of pb pbas with carrier materials to obtain a multifunctional adsorbent with the expected advantages is a very practical approach however a few researches about the pb pbas modified porous reduced graphene oxide aerogels have been announced in the present study we developed a convenient reduction solution precipitation method to prepare ternary prussian blue analog doped reduced graphene oxide aerogels rgoa tpbas as novel materials that can efficiently and selectively adsorb cs from effluent and be separated from the solution easily fig 1 shows a simple synthesis schematic in addition this novel adsorbent was characterized to reveal the microscopic structure and physicochemical properties the influence of process parameters including ph coexisting ions as well as time for adsorption were investigated on the adsorption isotherms and kinetics and the potential adsorption mechanisms were briefly described based on the experimental results obtained 2 results and discussion 2 1 basic physical property of rgoa tpbas the appearance of the rgoa tpbas can be easily observed as shown in fig 2 interestingly rgoa tpbas can be prepared in any shape desired depending on the container which in this case is a cylinder with a radius of 2 cm and a height of 1 2 cm as shown in fig 2 b when a weight of 100 g is pressed on the rgoa tpbas the aerogel is only compressed by 2 mm without any fragments indicating that the rgoa tpbas have a certain mechanical strength which demonstrates the possibility of the aerogel composite as an absorbent as evidenced in fig 2 c d rgoa tpbas can be easily separated from solution after immersion in water and after adsorption is complete which further displays the potential of the material as an adsorbent 2 2 structural characterization xrd patterns shown in fig 3 a illustrates the crystal structures and compositions of rgoa rgoa tpbas the patterns are basically the same as tpba s standard card jcpds card no 83 2293 fe4 co cn 6 2 667 h2o 16 and no 22 1184 ni3 co cn 6 2 3h2o the characteristic peak of rgo at 26 46 appears in the rgoa spectrum which is considered to belong to the broad graphitic carbon peak 66 indicating that graphene oxide is reduced by l ascorbic acid after in situ growth of tpbas rgoa tpbas shows the typical main peak of tpbas 17 19 25 47 and 31 46 which demonstrates that there are particles of tpbas in the laminate and the broad peaks of rgo are still obvious indicating that the structure of rgo is not disrupted the typical vibrational bands absorption peaks for 2180 1610 1401 and 1100 cm 1 of the cn bond carbonyl ch bond and coc bond can be reached from the ft ir spectra fig 3 b it indicates that the adsorbent rgoa tpbas have the characteristic peaks of tpbas and thus proves that tpbas is successfully loaded in rgoa to gain insight into the structures of rgoa rgoa tpbas and rgoa tpbas cs raman spectra are performed and shown in fig 3 c both products show strong d bands at about 1346 cm 1 and g bands at almost 1584 cm 1 intensity ratios id ig of the d and g bands are commonly used to evaluate ordered or disordered carbon crystal structures the id ig of rgoa rgoa tpbas and rgoa tpbas cs are 1 196 1 195 and 1 221 respectively the d g band intensity ratios of rgoa show almost no difference with that of rgo pba indicating that the decoration of tpbas have little effect on the structure of rgoa however after adsorption of cs the significant increase of id ig indicates sp2 domains of the adsorbent augment due to surface interactions during adsorption 67 fig 4 shows the xps spectra of rgoa tpbas it can be clearly observed that there were six kinds of elements in the surface of rgoa tpbas in which c mostly and o were from go and k fe ni c partly co and n were the constitutes of pbas fig 4 a demonstrating the xps spectra of n 1s fe 2p co 2p and ni 2p fig 4 b e the peak located at the binding energy of 397 9 ev can be a typical cn peak the peaks at 708 6 ev and 721 6 ev represent characteristic peaks of fe 2p the peak at 781 2 ev can be attributed to co2 of co 2p3 2 while the peak at 796 4 ev is associated with co2 of co 2p1 2 the peak at 855 3 ev is from ni2 of ni 2p3 2 while the peak at 872 9 ev can be assigned to ni2 of ni 2p1 2 it is effectively demonstrated that tpbas have been modified in the multivacancy structure of rgoa sem images fig 5 a d show the laminar stacking and cross linked structure of rgoa it consists of a large number of small wrinkles and large voids providing suitable sites for the accommodation of tpbas particles while inhibiting the escape of these particles in the structure space so as to improve the interaction between rgoa and tpbas which can ensure the stability of rgoa tpbas this unparalleled structure provides more in situ growth sites for pbas as well as the greatly facilitates the exposure of active sites to contaminants the tems of rgoa tpbas are shown in fig 5 e f it was visualized that lamellae of go are covered with folds which keep consistency to the sem results a large number of free particles are doped to the go sheets after modification which further demonstrated the successful incorporation of fine tpbas particles into functional materials with porous cross structures the adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of rgoa and rgoa tpbas fig 6 are measured by barret joyner halenda bjh method the specific surface area of rgoa tpbas is 54 26 more than 13 times that of rgoa the specific surface area of rgoa tpbas is attributed to the modification of tpbas inducing the formation of some mesopores and several micropores in the composites at moderate relative pressures both isotherms exhibit typical type iv adsorption isotherm characteristics with significant hysteresis curves indicating that rgoa and rgoa tpbas are iupac classified mesoporous materials 68 the pore size distributions are mainly located at 30 1 nm fig 6 b the presence of these mesopores facilitates the diffusion and mass transfer across adsorbents thus improving the adsorption kinetics as well as the adsorption performance 2 3 adsorption performance 2 3 1 adsorption kinetics influence of contact time on the adsorption of cs by rgoa tpbas and rgoa tpbas is shown in fig 7 a at the early stage of exposure 0 5 h the ct values decreases rapidly with increasing exposure time then enters the relaxation phase 5 24 h and ultimately reaches balance 24 72 h the cs removal rates of rgoa tpbas and rgoa tpbas are 30 40 47 12 and 67 27 respectively compared with that of rgoa and tpbas the cs removal rate of rgoa tpbas increased by 55 and 78 respectively which may be related to the special porous structure of the composites the modification of tpbas in the surface and internal pore channels of rgoa provided more accessible active centers for cs is more favorable for cs adsorption fig 7 b illustrates the adsorption kinetic curves of rgoa tpbas in solutions with different initial concentrations of cs with increasing of preliminary concentration from 10 mg l 1 to 25 mg l 1 the ct shows a similar trend that is to say the rapid adsorption occurs within the first 5 h since the large number of active centers of rgoa tpbas in concentrated solution interacting with cs on the contrary the corresponding removal efficiency decreases as the preliminary concentration increases which is attributed to the limited active centers of the adsorbent 69 the corresponding removal rates decreased from 90 21 to 67 27 and 38 22 for preliminary concentrations of 10 mg l 1 25 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 correspondingly to shed a sight on the adsorption mechanism the experimental data are fitted using different kinetic models including the pseudo first order model eq 1 the pseudo second order model eq 2 the intraparticle diffusion model eq 3 and the elovich model eq 4 70 72 which have the following linear equity equations 1 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 3 q t k i t 0 5 c 4 q t 1 β ln αβ 1 β ln t the rate constants where k 1 h 1 and k 2 g mg h 1 represent the quasi first order and pseudo second order equations in eqs 1 and 2 correspondingly in eqs 1 and 2 q t mg g 1 and q e mg g 1 represent instantaneous and equilibrium adsorption amounts correspondingly in eq 3 ki mg g h0 5 1 and c denote the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and the boundary layer thickness constant respectively in eq 4 α mg g h 1 represents the initial metal adsorption rate and β g mg 1 represents the desorption constant the fitted curves for the four kinetic models appear in fig 7 c f and the corresponding parameter values are displayed at table 1 as can be seen from table 1 the pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models describe this kinetic process better than the intraparticle model as far as the r2 values are concerned the pseudo second order model has the best fit among the four models at 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 r2 0 9976 0 9979 and 0 9982 compared with intraparticle model the elovich model is fit for describing the adsorption of cs by rgoa tpbas with better r2 r2 0 9766 0 9881 and 0 9840 at 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 indicates that cs adsorption on rgoa tpbas is controlled by chemisorption and this generally involves an ion exchange process either the co sharing and transfer of electrons between the adsorbent and absorber according to elovich model the preliminary adsorption rate values table 1 are different when the initial concentrations of cs are different 174 16 246 41 and 1071 80 mg g h 1 at 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 respectively at the initial concentrations of cs of 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 the resolution constants are shown in table 1 as 0 202 0 102 and 0 113 g mg 1 respectively indicating that the composite has good adsorption performance on cs to predict the rate controlling steps of the adsorption process the commonly used diffusion model includes three adsorption processes membrane diffusion particle diffusion and adsorption reaction 69 as shown in table 1 the diffusion rate constants for the three fractions are 7 33 4 27 and 0 79 mg g h0 5 1 when the preliminary concentration is 10 mg l 1 the largest diffusion rate constants are found for the first cross section which is attributed to the large presence of active centers and the rapid chemisorption as a result of the rapid diffusion of the membrane a very slow adsorption in the second and third segments with larger intercepts 22 8 mg g 1 and 34 3 mg g 1 exhibits a very slow adsorption process which is under control by particle diffusion rather than by membrane diffusion the adsorption curves for 25 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 initial concentrations show similar trends to those for 10 mg l 1 initial concentration indicating that all adsorption processes are independent of cs initial concentration and follows the same mechanism 2 3 2 adsorption isotherms to figure out the adsorption capacity with rgoa tpbas the adsorption isotherms of cs are measured in the range of preliminary concentrations that are ranged from 5 to 350 mg l 1 as illustrated in fig 8 a q e increases with the increase of c e until it reaches a plateau application langmuir eq 5 and freundlich models eq 6 to depict the test data 69 73 74 with the following linear equations 5 q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e 6 q t k f c e 1 n hereby the equilibrium concentration of cs and the corresponding equilibrium adsorption amount are ce mg l 1 and qe mg g 1 together with k l l mg 1 and k f ln mg1 n g 1 standing for the constants of the langmuir and freundlich models correspondingly based on the values of r2 in table 2 it might be deduced that the langmuir model r2 0 9929 describes the experimental data well while the freundlich model r2 0 9655 does not apply to this adsorption process it suggests that the cs adsorption by rgoa tpbas may be a homogeneous monomolecular layer mainly dominated by chemisorption as illustrated in table 3 the adsorption capacity obtained for the adsorbent in this work 226 98 mg g 1 outperforms that of most of the adsorbents reported so far the synthesized complex rgoa tpbas may be an excellent alternative for radionuclides removal from effluent considering the superiorities of the simple synthesis method and easy separation from the solution 2 3 3 other effects the ph value can be seen to have an effect on the adsorption of cs by rgoa tpbas fig s2 a ph values from 5 to 3 and 9 to 11 both see a slight decrease in adsorption amount compared to neutral under strongly acidic conditions the competitive adsorption of h and cs and the fact that h preferentially coordinates with tpbas lead to a decrease in cs adsorption by rgoa tpbas 75 and in alkaline solution cs will be hydrolyzed to form cesium hydroxide and partial dissolution of fe3 in tpbas will also occur giving rise to a decrease in the adsorption amount of cs on rgoa tpbas 75 76 therefore the removal of cs is not favored in the presence of strong acids and bases and a ph of around 7 is best to investigate the selectivity of rgoa tpbas adsorbent for cs the adsorption performance of rgoa tpbas adsorbent for cs in the presence of competing cations is further studied fig s2 b the presence of k and na has a greater effect while ca2 and mg2 have a smaller effect on the adsorption performance of rgoa tpbas this is due to the fact that the hydrated radius of k and na are similar to that of cs thus affecting the adsorption of rgoa tpbas for cs these findings are similar to those of wang et al 63 2 3 4 adsorption cycle performance 0 5 m hcl are used as the desorption reagent and the reuse experiment was tested for five cycles the he experimental results are shown in fig s3 the adsorption efficiency of rgoa tpbas for cs after five cycles could still reach 75 this indicates that rgoa tpbas is a cs adsorbent with excellent cycling performance 2 3 5 adsorption mechanism the mechanism of adsorption can be speculated as the following based on the results of xrd sem edx and xps as illustrated in fig 3 a after adsorption of cs the peaks at 25 47 and 31 46 disappeared and the peak at 17 19 has not disappeared completely indicating that the crystal structure in tpbas has changed which may be due to the involvement of the vacancy defect structure of the crystals in tpbas in the adsorption and cs entered into the vacancy of the crystal by exchange with fe3 and k causing the disappearance and movement of the diffraction peak 77 79 as a consequence it can be deduced that tpbas have a valuable function in the adsorption of cs ion trapping mechanisms which are physical adsorption of cs by pbas similar conclusion was drawn by husnul et al 80 are also studied and posited from the raman spectra fig 3 c it can be seen that the i d i g increases from 1 195 to 1 221 after adsorption of cs which indicates that cs is adsorbed on the surface and edges of rgoa making the number of defects in graphene increase 54 as it can be seen from sem edx plots fig s1 elemental cs can be easily observed after adsorption 4 6 wt proving once again that the adsorption of cs using this material is quite effective after xps analysis fig 9 the typical peaks of cs 3d observed in the spectra of rgoa tpbas near 724 5 ev and 738 5 ev indicate that cs was successfully adsorbed fig 9 a b and it could be seen that the characteristic peak of k 2p disappears after adsorption fig 9 c which indicates that k is replaced by cs further proving that the dominant adsorption of the material is a chemisorption process the o 1s of rgoa tpbas after adsorption shows a slight shift of the o 1s peak compared with that when it was not adsorbed fig 9 d e which indicated that there is also an interaction between the oxygen containing functional groups in graphene and cs suggesting that the adsorption did not occur only on tpbas but was a joint effect of multiple adsorptions 3 conclusions in this work a novel composite adsorbent material of rgoa tpbas was prepared by a simple controlled self assembly technique this unparalleled structure with small wrinkles and large voids increases specific surface area of the adsorbent while also greatly facilitates the exposure of active sites to the contaminants therefore the composite adsorbent exhibits outstanding adsorption of 226 98 mg g 1 maximum adsorption capacity and shows good selectivity for cs adsorption even under the influence of coexisting ions the proposed secondary kinetic model in combination with the langmuir isotherm model fits the adsorption in good way the results of characterization show that the adsorption process involves ion capture and ion exchange etc rgoa tpba can be separated from the adsorption solution as easily as possible it would be a promising adsorbent material for the treatment of radioactive effluent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

escape of these particles in the structure space so as to improve the interaction between rgoa and tpbas which can ensure the stability of rgoa tpbas this unparalleled structure provides more in situ growth sites for pbas as well as the greatly facilitates the exposure of active sites to contaminants the tems of rgoa tpbas are shown in fig 5 e f it was visualized that lamellae of go are covered with folds which keep consistency to the sem results a large number of free particles are doped to the go sheets after modification which further demonstrated the successful incorporation of fine tpbas particles into functional materials with porous cross structures the adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of rgoa and rgoa tpbas fig 6 are measured by barret joyner halenda bjh method the specific surface area of rgoa tpbas is 54 26 more than 13 times that of rgoa the specific surface area of rgoa tpbas is attributed to the modification of tpbas inducing the formation of some mesopores and several micropores in the composites at moderate relative pressures both isotherms exhibit typical type iv adsorption isotherm characteristics with significant hysteresis curves indicating that rgoa and rgoa tpbas are iupac classified mesoporous materials 68 the pore size distributions are mainly located at 30 1 nm fig 6 b the presence of these mesopores facilitates the diffusion and mass transfer across adsorbents thus improving the adsorption kinetics as well as the adsorption performance 2 3 adsorption performance 2 3 1 adsorption kinetics influence of contact time on the adsorption of cs by rgoa tpbas and rgoa tpbas is shown in fig 7 a at the early stage of exposure 0 5 h the ct values decreases rapidly with increasing exposure time then enters the relaxation phase 5 24 h and ultimately reaches balance 24 72 h the cs removal rates of rgoa tpbas and rgoa tpbas are 30 40 47 12 and 67 27 respectively compared with that of rgoa and tpbas the cs removal rate of rgoa tpbas increased by 55 and 78 respectively which may be related to the special porous structure of the composites the modification of tpbas in the surface and internal pore channels of rgoa provided more accessible active centers for cs is more favorable for cs adsorption fig 7 b illustrates the adsorption kinetic curves of rgoa tpbas in solutions with different initial concentrations of cs with increasing of preliminary concentration from 10 mg l 1 to 25 mg l 1 the ct shows a similar trend that is to say the rapid adsorption occurs within the first 5 h since the large number of active centers of rgoa tpbas in concentrated solution interacting with cs on the contrary the corresponding removal efficiency decreases as the preliminary concentration increases which is attributed to the limited active centers of the adsorbent 69 the corresponding removal rates decreased from 90 21 to 67 27 and 38 22 for preliminary concentrations of 10 mg l 1 25 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 correspondingly to shed a sight on the adsorption mechanism the experimental data are fitted using different kinetic models including the pseudo first order model eq 1 the pseudo second order model eq 2 the intraparticle diffusion model eq 3 and the elovich model eq 4 70 72 which have the following linear equity equations 1 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 3 q t k i t 0 5 c 4 q t 1 β ln αβ 1 β ln t the rate constants where k 1 h 1 and k 2 g mg h 1 represent the quasi first order and pseudo second order equations in eqs 1 and 2 correspondingly in eqs 1 and 2 q t mg g 1 and q e mg g 1 represent instantaneous and equilibrium adsorption amounts correspondingly in eq 3 ki mg g h0 5 1 and c denote the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and the boundary layer thickness constant respectively in eq 4 α mg g h 1 represents the initial metal adsorption rate and β g mg 1 represents the desorption constant the fitted curves for the four kinetic models appear in fig 7 c f and the corresponding parameter values are displayed at table 1 as can be seen from table 1 the pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models describe this kinetic process better than the intraparticle model as far as the r2 values are concerned the pseudo second order model has the best fit among the four models at 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 r2 0 9976 0 9979 and 0 9982 compared with intraparticle model the elovich model is fit for describing the adsorption of cs by rgoa tpbas with better r2 r2 0 9766 0 9881 and 0 9840 at 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 indicates that cs adsorption on rgoa tpbas is controlled by chemisorption and this generally involves an ion exchange process either the co sharing and transfer of electrons between the adsorbent and absorber according to elovich model the preliminary adsorption rate values table 1 are different when the initial concentrations of cs are different 174 16 246 41 and 1071 80 mg g h 1 at 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 respectively at the initial concentrations of cs of 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 the resolution constants are shown in table 1 as 0 202 0 102 and 0 113 g mg 1 respectively indicating that the composite has good adsorption performance on cs to predict the rate controlling steps of the adsorption process the commonly used diffusion model includes three adsorption processes membrane diffusion particle diffusion and adsorption reaction 69 as shown in table 1 the diffusion rate constants for the three fractions are 7 33 4 27 and 0 79 mg g h0 5 1 when the preliminary concentration is 10 mg l 1 the largest diffusion rate constants are found for the first cross section which is attributed to the large presence of active centers and the rapid chemisorption as a result of the rapid diffusion of the membrane a very slow adsorption in the second and third segments with larger intercepts 22 8 mg g 1 and 34 3 mg g 1 exhibits a very slow adsorption process which is under control by particle diffusion rather than by membrane diffusion the adsorption curves for 25 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 initial concentrations show similar trends to those for 10 mg l 1 initial concentration indicating that all adsorption processes are independent of cs initial concentration and follows the same mechanism 2 3 2 adsorption isotherms to figure out the adsorption capacity with rgoa tpbas the adsorption isotherms of cs are measured in the range of preliminary concentrations that are ranged from 5 to 350 mg l 1 as illustrated in fig 8 a q e increases with the increase of c e until it reaches a plateau application langmuir eq 5 and freundlich models eq 6 to depict the test data 69 73 74 with the following linear equations 5 q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e 6 q t k f c e 1 n hereby the equilibrium concentration of cs and the corresponding equilibrium adsorption amount are ce mg l 1 and qe mg g 1 together with k l l mg 1 and k f ln mg1 n g 1 standing for the constants of the langmuir and freundlich models correspondingly based on the values of r2 in table 2 it might be deduced that the langmuir model r2 0 9929 describes the experimental data well while the freundlich model r2 0 9655 does not apply to this adsorption process it suggests that the cs adsorption by rgoa tpbas may be a homogeneous monomolecular layer mainly dominated by chemisorption as illustrated in table 3 the adsorption capacity obtained for the adsorbent in this work 226 98 mg g 1 outperforms that of most of the adsorbents reported so far the synthesized complex rgoa tpbas may be an excellent alternative for radionuclides removal from effluent considering the superiorities of the simple synthesis method and easy separation from the solution 2 3 3 other effects the ph value can be seen to have an effect on the adsorption of cs by rgoa tpbas fig s2 a ph values from 5 to 3 and 9 to 11 both see a slight decrease in adsorption amount compared to neutral under strongly acidic conditions the competitive adsorption of h and cs and the fact that h preferentially coordinates with tpbas lead to a decrease in cs adsorption by rgoa tpbas 75 and in alkaline solution cs will be hydrolyzed to form cesium hydroxide and partial dissolution of fe3 in tpbas will also occur giving rise to a decrease in the adsorption amount of cs on rgoa tpbas 75 76 therefore the removal of cs is not favored in the presence of strong acids and bases and a ph of around 7 is best to investigate the selectivity of rgoa tpbas adsorbent for cs the adsorption performance of rgoa tpbas adsorbent for cs in the presence of competing cations is further studied fig s2 b the presence of k and na has a greater effect while ca2 and mg2 have a smaller effect on the adsorption performance of rgoa tpbas this is due to the fact that the hydrated radius of k and na are similar to that of cs thus affecting the adsorption of rgoa tpbas for cs these findings are similar to those of wang et al 63 2 3 4 adsorption cycle performance 0 5 m hcl are used as the desorption reagent and the reuse experiment was tested for five cycles the he experimental results are shown in fig s3 the adsorption efficiency of rgoa tpbas for cs after five cycles could still reach 75 this indicates that rgoa tpbas is a cs adsorbent with excellent cycling performance 2 3 5 adsorption mechanism the mechanism of adsorption can be speculated as the following based on the results of xrd sem edx and xps as illustrated in fig 3 a after adsorption of cs the peaks at 25 47 and 31 46 disappeared and the peak at 17 19 has not disappeared completely indicating that the crystal structure in tpbas has changed which may be due to the involvement of the vacancy defect structure of the crystals in tpbas in the adsorption and cs entered into the vacancy of the crystal by exchange with fe3 and k causing the disappearance and movement of the diffraction peak 77 79 as a consequence it can be deduced that tpbas have a valuable function in the adsorption of cs ion trapping mechanisms which are physical adsorption of cs by pbas similar conclusion was drawn by husnul et al 80 are also studied and posited from the raman spectra fig 3 c it can be seen that the i d i g increases from 1 195 to 1 221 after adsorption of cs which indicates that cs is adsorbed on the surface and edges of rgoa making the number of defects in graphene increase 54 as it can be seen from sem edx plots fig s1 elemental cs can be easily observed after adsorption 4 6 wt proving once again that the adsorption of cs using this material is quite effective after xps analysis fig 9 the typical peaks of cs 3d observed in the spectra of rgoa tpbas near 724 5 ev and 738 5 ev indicate that cs was successfully adsorbed fig 9 a b and it could be seen that the characteristic peak of k 2p disappears after adsorption fig 9 c which indicates that k is replaced by cs further proving that the dominant adsorption of the material is a chemisorption process the o 1s of rgoa tpbas after adsorption shows a slight shift of the o 1s peak compared with that when it was not adsorbed fig 9 d e which indicated that there is also an interaction between the oxygen containing functional groups in graphene and cs suggesting that the adsorption did not occur only on tpbas but was a joint effect of multiple adsorptions 3 conclusions in this work a novel composite adsorbent material of rgoa tpbas was prepared by a simple controlled self assembly technique this unparalleled structure with small wrinkles and large voids increases specific surface area of the adsorbent while also greatly facilitates the exposure of active sites to the contaminants therefore the composite adsorbent exhibits outstanding adsorption of 226 98 mg g 1 maximum adsorption capacity and shows good selectivity for cs adsorption even under the influence of coexisting ions the proposed secondary kinetic model in combination with the langmuir isotherm model fits the adsorption in good way the results of characterization show that the adsorption process involves ion capture and ion exchange etc rgoa tpba can be separated from the adsorption solution as easily as possible it would be a promising

13057,tetracycline is a broad spectrum antibiotic largely found in the environment with many adverse effects on environmental and human health recently the coupling of different advanced oxidation processes has been promised as the effective approach for the degradation of refractory pollutants in this work the magnetically separable ag cufe2o4 cqds photocatalyst was successfully synthesized and characterized by x ray powder diffraction differential reflectance spectroscopy transmission electron microscopy field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy analysis the potential of different systems namely photocatalyst light photocatalyst persulfate and photocatalyst persulfate light as well as operation parameters reusability and involved radicals were evaluated for tetracycline degradation the highest removal efficiency for the different systems was obtained as photocatalyst persulfate light 100 30 min photocatalyst persulfate 100 55 min photocatalyst light 100 75 min the 47 total organic carbon removal was obtained in optimum condition and intermediate products were proposed based on results of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry the results indicated that reaction rate constant kobs decreased from 0 1319 to 0 0270 min 1 0 0332 min 1 and 0 0174 min 1 with increasing ph initial tetracycline concentration and humic acid ha respectively the inhibitory effect of inorganic ions was obtained as cl no3 hco3 the nanocomposite showed high reusability after 5 consecutive cycles 91 5 the results of the scavenger analysis suggest the superoxide and positive hole are the main species involved in tetracycline degradation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tetracycline sulfate radicals advanced oxidation processes photocatalyst persulfate nanocomposite 1 introduction the increase in the world s population also means an increase in pressure on water resources as a consequence of increased human activities population growth is related to an increase in human life expectancy in which the development of pharmaceuticals drugs antibiotics hormones etc for disease control has played an important role 1 however the increased use of pharmaceuticals poses an environmental and public health problem as in most cases they are discharged into the public domain without proper treatment in recent years the scientific community has focused their attention on the characterization management and treatment of hospital wastewater 2 within pharmaceuticals antibiotics deserve special attention special features include high chemical stability lack of complete metabolism in water treatment and widespread use that pose a threat to the eco environment and human health 3 in fact antibiotics are already widely found in aqueous environments such as surface waters seaside environments soils groundwater and even drinking water 4 since antibiotics are a class of anti infective drugs that kill or stop the growth of bacteria they lead to the generation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and increase the large amount of antibiotic resistant genes args in nature 5 tetracycline tc is a broad spectrum antibiotic has been widely used to treat different diseases such as chlamydial infection rickettsia disease mycoplasma pneumonia feed additives in livestock and other nonbacterial infections 6 7 the amount of tc in aqueous media has been reported between 17 and 497 ng l and extended half life 180 d under environmental conditions 8 9 conventional wastewater treatment methods cannot completely degrade tc due to its antibacterial properties and refractory nature 10 11 unlike other advanced technologies e g adsorption membrane separation etc aops have attracted attention for the degradation of recalcitrant compounds due to fast oxidation no formation of oxidation subproducts complete oxidation of contaminants and great performance 12 13 recently radical sulfate based aops sr aops have emerged as a variant to conventional aops 14 sr aops are based on the generation of sulfate radicals so4 using peroxymonosulfate pms or persulfate ps as oxidants 15 these sr aops provide advantages including higher oxidation potential in a wide ph range and a longer half life so4 2 5 3 1 v and 30 40 μs oh 2 2 2 7 v and 1 μs selectivity more suitable reaction with target organic matter containing unsaturated bonds or aromatic p electrons before self quenching during the diffusion process through different paths e g hydrogen abstraction addition reaction and electron transfer processes easy transportation of oxidants compared to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 cost effective much more persistently and stability 16 18 also unlike conventional aops sr aops generates both so4 and oh radicals that can be produced under different environmental conditions and participate in the decomposition process 19 20 moreover the performance of sr aops is not limited to an acidic environment unlike the fenton reaction ph 2 4 21 although the effectiveness of the aops processes is significant the use of one aop process could not be enough to totally degrade some recalcitrant compounds 22 for instance zhang et al 2020 have reported that persulfate based aop alone is not satisfactory for tc degradation 23 for that reason tang et al 2019 combined persulfate ps and heterogeneous photocatalysis leading to enhanced efficiency degradation due to the role of pds as electron acceptors for charger separation 24 therefore it is necessary to intensify the processes by combining different aops to promote removal efficiency by overcoming the drawbacks of each process and enhancing the quantity and diversity of reactive oxygen species ros therefore sr aops are one of the efficient and environmentally friendly approaches to remove the antibiotic 25 26 since a long time ago different methods have been used namely the energy activation approach uv electric heat and etc adding transition metals ag cu fe co and etc alkali activation and chelation agents to activate ps for producing free radicals 27 29 among them energy activation has remarkable drawbacks thermal activation of ps activation by thermal is extremely ph dependent also uv activation of ps required high energy and expensive equipment that significantly increases the cost of the removal process 30 31 transition metals are conventional activators used in two approaches namely heterogeneous and homogeneous for ps activation unlike energy activation there is no need to add external energy 21 some studies have reported that coupling heterogeneous visible light photocatalysis with an oxidant is a promising approach for antibiotic degradation 23 24 the employing of heterogeneous photocatalysts e g nanocomposite have significant advantages including great efficiency reusability decreasing secondary pollutants and non favorable loss of catalysts and nonradical activation although the presence of ions in the water matrix leads to problems such as sludge production radical scavenging and a limited ph tightness range 28 copper is one of the metals that has been shown to have a good ability to activate ps through the role of an electron donor and electron bridge to assist rapid electron transfer between ps and the catalyst 16 32 moreover an iron based catalyst has been widely applied to active ps because it has proper features such as fast so4 generation cost effective low toxicity and high accessibility in nature 33 34 magnetic spinel type copper ferrite cufe2o4 is a promising alternative as cu and fe activator sources compared to other copper nanocomposites e g cuo in addition cufe2o4 is a promising heterogeneous catalyst for the elimination of refractory contaminants through activation of sr aops due to its significant catalytic activity superb stability low cost and eligible separation however cufe2o4 has shown low efficiency due to insufficient active site quantity limited conductivity that obstructs its capacity for electron transfer and catalysis and slow solid liquid interfacial mass transfer and low generation regeneration of dissolved ferrous ions 17 35 zhang et al 2013 illustrated that cu2 leaching in cufe2o4 is much lower than in cuo 36 furthermore the study by li et al 2019 revealed that the cu cufe2o4 catalyst demonstrated great catalytic activity for ps activation to degrade tc even in the presence of inorganic ions especially bicarbonate ions in addition they reported that the presence of copper and ferrous ions on the catalyst surface causes the generation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals 16 furthermore zhao et al 2017 reported that cufe2o4 has a low photocatalytic efficiency under visible light radiation due to fast recombination of photogenerated e h pairs therefore some components such as c3n4 tio2 cuo ceo2 and agbr have been added to cufe2o4 to improve its photocatalytic activity the finding confirmed that ag components are more effective compared to the other 37 because the silver containing compound promotes catalytic activity by accelerating the electron transfer in the ferrous ferric redox cycle and developing active sites on the surface 27 31 the study by ouyang et al 2020 showed that silver ag can effectively activate ps and its doping into nanoparticles improves ps activation due to high catalytic activity 21 therefore two approaches that include more light absorption and prevent charge recombination are required to promote cufe2o4 photocatalytic activity here ag through localized surface plasmon resonance lspr causes increased visible light absorption and also plays the role of an electron trap and active reaction sites 38 dai et al 2014 also have revealed that ag is the effective e acceptor which improves the separation of e h pairs 39 on the other hand surendra et al 2018 have illustrated that ag can affect cufe2o4 properties leading to the promotion of photocatalytic activity also cufe2o4 is a good match with ag due to its suitable band edges ecb 1 22 ev evb 0 22 ev 40 moreover liu et al 2021 have reported that silver based photocatalytic materials have high visible light degradation activities due to their proper bandgap and excellent visible light response 41 carbon based composites have developed as hopeful catalysts in aop technologies due to their strong physicochemical features and being environmentally friendly 42 carbon quantum dots cqds have unique properties that include vigorous chemical inertness easy functionalization low toxicity reliable stability and superior electron reserve and electron transfer attributes 17 43 moreover cqds can facilitate electrons in the composite interface 44 therefore the combination of metals with each other and with carbon promotes the activation of ps and improved catalyst stability 36 furthermore in the photocatalytic approach the cqds can harvest photons via direct absorption these photons induce the e h pairs in cqds that appear as photocatalysts 34 cqds improve semiconductor photocatalysis activity by separating photogenerated charge carriers by forming heterojunction increasing conversion of cqds wide spectrum light absorption adsorption of organic pollutant by conjugated π structure and finally synergistic effect by surface plasmon resonance spr effect of silver nanoparticles 17 45 46 furthermore cqds due to the existence of functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl and amine facilitate the response to visible light during the photocatalytic process because of n π 47 li et al 2021 have reported that carbonous materials improve the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite because they have a broader visible light response range facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers as well as boost electronic features 48 the photo corrosion under light irradiation is one of the main drawbacks of the metal semiconductors the main solution to this problem construction of heterojunction with other semiconductors especially carbon materials 49 hence the present study attempts to reduce tc using the novel heterogeneous photocatalysis coupling persulfate oxidation with ag cufe2o4 cqds under visible light radiation considering the effect of the different parameters such as the influence of ph inorganic ions humic acids ha and nanocomposite dosage in addition a mechanistic approach to tc degradation is proposed based on studies with different scavengers finally the recovery reuse and loss of efficiency of the photocatalyst have been studied 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the chemical reagents used in this work include silver nitrate agno3 25 ammonia nh3 iron nitrate fe no3 3 9h2o copper nitrate cu no3 2 3h2o

external magnet 2 ml of sample was collected at regular intervals and 1 ml of methanol was immediately added to prevent further tc degradation finally the sample was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and the residual concentration of tc was measured using hplc section 2 5 ultimately the obtained data were fitted by pseudo first order kinetics eq 1 1 ln c t c 0 k obs t where c0 mg l is the

sedimented at the bottom of the test tube 30 μl of this extractant was injected into the hplc 38 2 6 mechanism of tc degradation tc degradation is due to ros generation in the oxidation process the radical trapping experiment is the proper way to determine the role of ros in the pollutant decomposition process the major ros that participates in the ph ps l process includes sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical oh positive hole h and superoxide o2 for this purpose the quenching test was carried out using specific scavengers including methanol meoh tert butyl alcohol tba sodium oxalate so and 1 4 benzoquinone bq for trapping the so4 oh h and o2 respectively by adding the scavengers radical trapping will occur whose degree of inhibition indicates the contribution of each scavenger to the quenching test this process reveals the greater role of the corresponding ros by reducing the removal efficiency 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd analysis fig 1 a illustrated the xrd patterns of cqds cufe2o4 ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds as shown the centered broad peak centered is observed around 2θ 25 c which can be corresponded to the reflection 002 of cqds 50 the distinct diffraction peaks of cufe2o4 were located at 2θ 30 5 36 39 2 43 6 54 57 5 and 63 3 are assigned to 220 311 202 4 0 0 312 4 1 1 and 4 4 0 planes respectively which confirm typical spinel cufe2o4 structure 51 the appearance peaks at 2θ 39 2 111 45 8 200 and 66 5 2 2 0 correspond to the silver crystal in ag cufe2o4 nanoparticles 52 the xrd pattern of ag cufe2o4 cqd showed that the peaks corresponded to the cqds are not detected which is due to the small quantity of cqds assembled in the ag cufe2o4 nanoparticle 53 while the peaks related to ag 2θ 11 5 15 8 20 23 5 38 4 and 77 5 and cufe2o4 2θ 30 5 35 5 43 5

absorbance spectra of cqds ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds within the range of 200 to 800 nm as shown absorption edge for cqds ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds was obtained at 240 410 and 530 nm respectively which indicated ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds have a broader absorption region therefore this analysis confirms ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds are active successfully in all studied areas 55 also the absorption edge of ag cufe2o4 cqds nanocomposite shows the optical band gap is 2 3 ev the results indicated that the incorporation of cqds and ag with copper ferrite induced an increase in the visible region dadigala et al have reported that due to the intrinsic optical absorbance of cqds increasing the quantity of cqds leads to an increase in intensity in the visible region in ag nanoparticle decorated g c3n4 nanosheets 46 the study by guo et al showed that carbon based materials can improve the photocatalytic activity of cufe2o4 spheres via a prolonged lifetime and a lower recombination rate of e h pairs due to the electrical interplay between the carbon matter doped and the cufe2o4 surface 56 57 moreover ag induces the increase of e concentrations leading to the burstein moss effect 40 this is due to the surface plasmon band of ag which under electromagnetic irradiation the collective oscillations of the free conduction band electrons would increase 58 3 3 tem analysis tem analysis was used for the study of the morphology and microstructure of ag cufe2o4 cqd fig 2a as illustrated in fig 2 a small nanoparticles have caused the formation of sphere like particles 16 moreover some irregular particles are created due to the phenomenon of copper jahn teller distortion that causes low crystallographic symmetry 59 3 4 fesem eds analysis the morphology of ag cufe2o4 cqds ag cufe2o4 and cqds were characterized by fesem analysis fig 2b d as shown the ag cufe2o4 cqds and ag cufe2o4 nanocomposites have a cubic structure with a high degree of crystalline with diameter of 25 70 nm furthermore the particles are uniform and agglomerative 17 also the fesem results of cqds is revealed small spherical particles of size 12 nm the elemental mapping image confirms the presence of o fe cu and ag suggesting the successful formation of ag cufe2o4 nanoparticles furthermore o fe and cu are distributed in the core section while ag was thickly spread in the edge area representative that it was regularly dispersed on the surface of the shell fig 2c 27 the eds analysis revealed that the mass percentages of o fe cu and ag are 36 60 40 96 16 57 and 5 87 respectively in the ag cufe2o4 nanoparticles fig 2d 3 5 effect of different systems on tc removal fig 3 a d shows the removal of tc in the ph l fig 3 a ph ps fig 3 b and ph ps l fig 3 c systems for the ph l process the tc removal efficiency of cqd agno3 and cufe2o4 was obtained by 44 33 and 57 at 120 min respectively the tc removal reached 100 at 115 and 75 min with ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds respectively fig 3 a as observed in fig 3 a cqds have moderate photocatalytic activity the main feature of cqds is the absorption of the wide spectrum of light which led to exciting electrons e and the transit from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb under visible light irradiation photogenerated e h pairs induce the formation of different ros e g oh and o2 which participate in tc degradation hu et al proposed the following mechanism for the photodegradation of organic pollutant by cqds eq 3 9 60 3 cqds hϑ e h 4 h 2 o or oh h ho h 5 e o 2 o 2 6 org h h org h org h 7 org h ho org h 2 o 8 org o 2 org oo o 2 h 2 o degradation 9 org h ho h org ho o 2 h 2 o degradation cheng et al have reported 97 photodegradation of rhodamine b using cqds under natural light after 4 h 61 the removal efficiency of tc by agno3 was obtained by 33 suggesting a low photocatalytic activity of agno3 nanoparticles when agno3 nanoparticles added to the solution produce ag which is reducing agents ag has photocatalytic activity alone while it improves the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst by hindering recombination of e h pairs 62 also ag due to surface plasmon resonance spr induces more light absorption in the visible region moreover ag alone does not react with pollutant 63 the results indicated that the tc removal efficiency by cufe2o4 is 57 copper ferrite contains both cu2 and fe3 therefore the transfer of e between the cu cu2 and fe2 fe3 ion pairs increases the catalytic activity 50 on the other hand gao et al reported that the cufe2o4 semiconductor produces the e h pairs under light irradiation excitation of cufe2o4 excitation by visible light causes ros generation on the catalyst surface furthermore many reactive sites will be produced due to the pore structures and the large surface area of cufe2o4 that provides the required channels for charge transfer and an adequate contact area for the catalyst and antibiotics 64 65 jing et al have illustrated ground state electrons of cufe2o4 via photon absorption of photons with enough energy of hν namely hν eg 1 53 ev will be transferred from vb to cb and the same number of holes remains in vb subsequently the pairs e h are captured by absorbed oxygen and hydroxyl radical generate the o2 and oh 66 however as the results have shown the removal efficiency of tc is not great due to the small band gap of cufe2o4 that led to fast recombination of e h pairs which decreased the degradation of photocatalytic tc 67 the photodegradation of tc by ag cufe2o4 revealed that 100 efficiency will be achieved after 115 min suggesting high photocatalytic activity of ag cufe2o4 the combination of ag with cufe2o4 led to the formation of smaller particles and a reduced agglomeration increasing the surface area therefore active sites produce a higher efficiency in light harvesting furthermore given the redox potentials when ag cufe2o4 was irradiated the photogenerated electrons could transfer from the cufe2o4 conduction band to that of ag also at the same time photogenerated holes could transfer from the valence band of ag to that of cufe2o4 which reduces recombination of e h pairs 37 zhu et al demonstrated that ag loading makes more visible light harvesting by ag cufe2o4 similarly a smaller size of ag cufe2o4 induces more hydrogen bonded surface water molecules and hydroxyl groups which facilitate the generation of more ros 58 surendra has reported ag cufe2o4 has excellent photocatalytic activity 97 due to the uniform structure with small particle size that led to proper dispersion of the particles in solution the results have confirmed that particle size plays a significant role in catalytic activity 40 the study by li et al also confirmed the synergetic effect between silver and copper iron oxide 68 finally the photocatalytic activity of ag cufe2o4 cqds showed the highest photodegradation efficiency reaching total tc removal in 75 min the results indicated that combinations of different components ag cufe2o4 and cqds have a synergetic effect cqds induce a more uniform size distribution and a better monodispersity of nanocomposite this is due to the excellent dispersibility and ultra small and regular size of cqds in addition cqds increase the hydrophilicity of the surface as well as increase the interaction between nanocomposite and pollutant 69 furthermore due to the electron storage capacity of cqds the photon excited electrons from ag cufe2o4 can transfer in the conducting network of cqds which hinders the recombination of photogenerated e h pairs 70 on the other hand cqds led to increasing the stability of ag cufe2o4 via two routes a effectively protect nanocomposite dissolution in aqueous solution b cqds act as both electron acceptors and donors which hinders the photo corrosion of the nanocomposite furthermore cqds absorb visible light and emit shorter wavelength light which induces the re excitation of ag cufe2o4 for the generation of photogenerated e h pairs then the electrons will be trapped by cqds and hindering the recombination of e h pairs in addition spr in ag particles causes a higher e h pair formation rate which induces the synergistic effect of ag and cqds increasing photocatalytic activity 71 fig 3 b shows the removal of tc by cqds agno3 cufe2o4 ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds in the ph ps oxidation process as shown in fig 3 b the order of tc removal efficiency is as follows cqds 21 60 min agno3 56 60 min cufe2o4 72 57 min ag cufe2o4 86 55 min ag cufe2o4 cqds 100 55 min these results suggested that the combination of ps with photocatalysts ph ps improved the removal of tc compared to photocatalysis individually fig 3 a moreover the ability of cqds alone is low for ps activation han et al suggested that the presence of large amounts of oxygen groups in cqds leads to negligible carbocatalytic activity that reduces poor graphitic degree and conductivity this phenomenon is not suitable for generating the sulfate radical via direct electron transfer to ps 72 also edge sites and ketonic groups of carbon materials due to chemically electroactive properties can stimulate ps to generate sulfate radicals 59 moreover surface attached sulfate radicals are produced by reaction of the carbon lattice with ps these radicals through continuous electron extraction processes on the carbon surface induce oxidation of pollutants 73 74 hou et al revealed that surface defects graphitic structure and n containing functionalities produce activity sites in ncqds that contribute to ps activation 75 however liang et al also have reported that the small size of cqds is the effective factor for ps activation because small particles provide more active sites which increases catalytic activity 76 77 on the other hand the results indicated that the high removal efficiency by nanocomposite containing ag ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds is due to the high catalytic properties of ag which can facilitate ps oxidation and generate more sulfate radicals moreover fe2 and cu are effective transition metals in ps decomposition eqs 10 12 27 31 the study by li et al confirmed that adsorbed ps induces oxidation of cu2 to cu3 on the surface of cufe2o4 and subsequently cu3 reacts with water molecules to generate hydroxyl radicals eqs 13 14 16 furthermore guo et al have reported that cu2 accelerates fe3 2 eq 15 and oxygen vacancies ov in fe2o3 improving more ros generation for tc decomposition ovs improve interfacial electron transfer which induces ps activation eqs 16 18 78 10 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 3 so 4 so 4 2 11 cu s 2 o 8 2 cu 2 so 4 so 4 2 12 ag s 2 o 8 2 ag 2 so 4 so 4 2 13 cu 2 s 2 o 8 2 cu 3 so 4 so 4 2 14 cu 3 h 2 o cu 2 h ho 15 cu 3 fe 2 cu 2 fe 3 16 ovs o 2 17 o 2 h 2 o ooh oh 18 ovs s 2 o 8 2 so 4 oh the results indicated that the integration of the ps and ph l process ph ps l leads to more degradation of tc compared to the ps and ph l processes fig 3 c achieving the total removal of tc using ag cufe2o4 cqd in 30 min as previously discussed ros could be produced in the ph l and ps oxidation process thus in addition to ps activated by nanocomposite the light led to more activation of ps resulting in more ros generation in the ps ph l system in the kinetic study illustrated in all systems the kobs of the final nanocomposite was more of its components fig 3 d furthermore the ag cufe2o4 cqds kobs for tc degradation was obtained 0 0207 min 1 0 0387 min 1 and 0 1319 min 1 for ph l ps oxidation and ph ps l systems respectively this result suggested the synergistic effect between the photocatalyst ps and light for tc degradation 3 6 effect of ph the ph is the effective parameter in chemical reactions that affect the catalyst surface chemical properties of the pollutant and the kinetics of reactions fig 4 a and b shows the effect of ph on tc degradation in ph ps l systems as shown the highest degradation was obtained at acidic ph for all systems the results revealed that the removal of tc by the ag cufe2o4 cqd nanocomposite decreased by 42 during 30 min with an increase in ph from 3 to 11 fig 4 a the kobs was obtained 0 1319 min 1 0 0884 min 1 0 0594 min 1 0 0421 min 1 and 0 0270 min 1 for ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 respectively fig 4 b this is due to acid catalytic ps decomposition which generates extra sulfate radicals while under alkali conditions sulfate radicals react with water molecules and hydroxyl ions and generate oh which has lower redox potential 1 8 2 7 v than sulfate radicals 2 5 3 1 v eqs 19 20 27 furthermore nanocomposite surface passivation can occur at high ph leading to decreased catalytic activity of ag cufe2o4 cqd 28 wang et al have also reported that the highest acid red 73 degradation was obtained at ph 3 in the fe ag gac catalytic persulfate system 31 19 so 4 h 2 o ho so 4 2 h 20 so 4 oh ho so 4 2 in addition zero valent cu corrosion increased at acidic ph which enhances the activity of cufe2o4 for ps decomposition 79 the acid dissociation constants pka of the tc and the phzpc of the nanocomposite are the other parameters that affect the removal efficiency li et al have reported that tc is the amphoteric molecule with three pka 3 30 7 68 and 9 68 according to the ph of the solution since the phzpc of the nanocomposite is 4 8 the surface charge of the nanocomposite at ph phzpc and ph phzpc is negative and positive respectively however there are some repulsing electrostatic forces between nanocomposite and tc at ph 3 tcpka 3 30 tc is as h3tc the acid catalytic effect for ps decomposition causes the generation of more sulfate radicals that overcomes the electrostatic repulsing effect on the other hand high repulsing electrostatic forces between the ag cufe2o4 cqds nanocomposite and tc htc and tc2 forbid sorption of tc under alkali conditions 80 additionally under acidic conditions ph phzpc the negative charge of s2o8 2 facilitates more contact with the positive charge of the nanocomposite surface and leads to more ros generation 21 furthermore high oh concentration and negative charge nanocomposite ph phzpc under alkali conditions cause a decrease in tc diffusion and hinder e transfer to the surface area of ag cufe2o4 cqd and decreased tc degradation 81 duan et al have reported that carbon in nanocomposites is functionalized by hydroxyl ions under high alkali conditions which hinders the adsorption of ps ions via electrostatic repulsive forces 73 furthermore ros will be quenched and converted to inert products such as so4 2 hso4 and o2 due to interaction reactions between so4 and oh which leads to a decrease in active species concentration at a high and neutral ph 30 meanwhile the high removal of tc in the photocatalytic process at acidic ph is due to the fact that the function of photogenerated h for tc degradation is more effective at lower ph 82 3 7 effect of initial concentration of tc fig 5 a and b illustrates the effect of the initial concentration of tc on the removal efficiency the result indicated that the removal efficiency decreased with increasing tc concentration the order of tc removal performance as a function of concentration is as follows 5 mg l 100 20 min 10 mg l 100 30 min 15 mg l 100 38 min 20 mg l 89 45 min 30 mg 78 45 min fig 5a furthermore the kobs decreased from 0 1319 min 1 to 0 0332 min 1 with increasing tc concentration fig 5 b when the tc concentration is increased the penetration of light into the solution will decrease and cause a restriction of the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite and direct photolysis of ps yang et al have reported that increasing the tc concentration restrains light penetration into solution which reduces access to photons 83 furthermore fewer ros are accessed for the degradation of target pollutants in high tc concentration 31 84 furthermore with increasing tc concentration more concentrations of intermediate tc are produced that consume ros and compete with the main pollutant decomposition 85 the active catalyst sites are the main parameter for ros generation via photocatalytic and ps oxidation tc molecules at high concentrations adsorbed on catalyst sites and cause deactivation 86 ouyang et al have reported that the reaction between tc and ros will decrease when the initial concentration of tc increases 21 3 8 effect of nanocomposite dosage fig 6 a shows the degradation efficiency of tc at different dosages of ag cufe2o4 cqds nanocomposite 0 0 4 g l as depicted the removal of tc increased to 0 3 g l and then decreased slightly kobs was obtained 0 0516 min 1 0 0951 min 1 0 1319 min 1 and 0 1207 min 1 for 0 1 g l 0 2 g l 0 3 g l and 0 4 g l respectively fig 6 b increasing catalyst dosage improves pollutant adsorption on the catalyst surface and also accessibility of more active sites for reaction with ps which will accelerate ros generation and provide an effective interaction between pollutant and sulfate radicals because sulfate radicals can be produced near ps on the catalyst surface if the tc is in the vicinity of the oxidant it improves the reaction between so4 and tc thus facilitating faster degradation of tc at higher catalyst dosages kobs decreases due to nanocomposite agglomeration and loss of total surface area or self quenching effect of generated radicals 33 87 furthermore when the number of activated sites is exceeded they cannot be effectively used for pollutant adsorption and occupied by ps thus the reaction between ps and tc with activated sites is reduced 30 33 the study of li et al showed that an additional dose of catalyst would quench the ros 16 moradi et al have reported that light scattering and screening effect will occur in a high dose of nanocomposites which causes a decrease in tc removal 81 3 9 effect of ps concentration fig 7 a and b indicated the effect of ps concentrations 0 75 12 mm on tc degradation in the ph ps l process results have shown that the removal efficiency increases up to 6 mm and then decreases with increasing ps concentration fig 7 a the kobs was obtained 0 0141 min 1 0 0435 min 1 0 0892 min 1 0 1319 min 1 and 0 1114 min 1 for 0 75 1 5 3 6 and 12 mm respectively fig 7 b the high concentration of ps facilitates the accelerated generation of sulfate radicals that leads to faster degradation of tc however a further increase of ps concentrations to 12 mm has negative effects due to the self quenching reaction of the free radical eqs 21 22 35 88 21 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 22 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 s 2 o 8 so 4 2 chen et al have reported that the accessibility of oxidant was the limiting parameter that determined radical generation at low oxidant concentrations furthermore a high concentration of oxidants led to less reactive ros e g s2o8 generation via self scavenging or competitive reaction 87 the study by ouyang et al showed that the quenching phenomenon of ros would occur in the excessive concentration of ps 21 the other reason was revealed by miao et al who have reported that the active sites of cufe2o4 would be saturated in high pms concentration and therefore the excess oxidant cannot be activated by the catalyst 89 furthermore yang et al have illustrated the outcompetition of ros in the excessive s2o8 2 concentration leading to stagnant removal efficiency 90 3 10 effect of inorganic ions and organic matter cl no3 and hco3 are common inorganic anions in natural water that can affect the pollutant degradation process therefore inorganic anions play a superior role in photocatalytic processes via the effect on the catalyst surface and deactivate active sites 91 fig 8 a d illustrates the effect of cl no3 and hco3 anions on tc removal as observed the inhibition effect of inorganic ions is obtained in the following order cl no3 hco3 taghizadeh et al 2020 have reported that clogging of catalyst active sites would occur in the presence of inorganic ions leading to decreased photocatalytic activity 92 the results of the cl effect indicate that the kobs of tc degradation increased slightly with increasing cl concentration up to 0 5 mm and then decreased fig 8 a as observed kobs increased from 0 1319 min 1 to 0 1368 min 1 and then decreased to 0 0924 min 1 at maximum cl concentration the positive effect of cl on kobs may be due to enhanced oxidative ability through generation of different chlorine radicals include cl cl2 and cloh in the medium eqs 23 28 at a high concentration of cl retardation in the decomposition of ps would occur this could be due to the quenching of the reaction quenching of the cl2 and cl radicals eqs 29 30 84 93 liu et al 2018 have reported that cl accelerates rhodamine b photodegradation due to the generation of chloride radicals 93 li et al 2019 showed that the degradation of tc would increase in the presence of chloride ions because of the cl2 and cl radicals 16 23 so 4 cl so 4 2 cl 24 cl h vb cl 25 cl ho cl oh 26 cl cl cl 2 27 cl 2 oh cloh cl 28 cl 2 h 2 o cloh cl h 29 cl 2 cl 2 cl 2 2 cl 30 cl cl cl 2 fig 8 b shows the effect of no3 on the photodegradation of tc the results show a slightly decreasing trend with an increase in the concentration of no3 ions up to 1 mm then the trend of kobs decreased sharply with increasing the concentration of no3 ions which was assigned to the reaction of no3 with positive hole sulfate and hydroxyl radicals this process induces the no3 which has less ability to degradation of organic matter eqs 31 33 31 no 3 so 4 no 3 so 4 2 32 no 3 h vb no 3 33 no 3 ho no 3 oh fig 8 c shows the effect of hco3 on tc degradation as can be observed kobs decreased from 0 1319 min 1 to 0 03 min 1 in the presence of hco3 fig 8 d when hco3 is added the ph of the solution would increase due to carbonate formation which is an unfavorable condition for the generation of sulfate radicals moreover hco3 reacting with sulfate and hydroxyl radicals leads to generation of hco3 and co3 2 which they have less oxidation potential in the decomposition of organic pollutants eqs 34 38 93 on the other hand bicarbonate reduces ros production by absorbing light 94 34 hco 3 so 4 hco 3 so 4 2 35 hco 3 h co 3 36 hco 3 ho co 3 h 2 o 37 co 3 2 so 4 co 3 so 4 2 38 co 3 2 ho co 3 o h fig 8 e shows the effect of organic matter on the photodegradation of tc humic acid ha is the most popular model of dissolved natural organic matter dom the effect of ha was evaluated at different doses 0 5 1 5 and 10 mg l the result indicated that kobs decreased from 0 1319 min 1 to 0 0174 min 1 in the presence of ha the results showed that kobs did not decrease at 2 5 mg l of ha 0 1329 min 1 fig 8 f in other words when ha 2 5 mg l kobs decelerated due to the scavenging effect of ha competing with the target pollutant for ros at a higher concentration this is due to the blocking of the active catalyst sites that can occur by phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of ha leading to a decrease in kobs 87 wang et al have reported that when phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of dom adsorbed on the catalyst surface the reactive sites are blocked and pms activation by cufe2o4 is decreased 33 however ha in a certain concentration 2 5 mg l acts as an electron shuttle and the chelation of fe had an effect on tc degradation because the concentration of ferrous and total fe in solution increased in the presence of ha compared to that without ha therefore ha facilitates the transfer of e from ag cufe2o4 to ps and accelerates the formation of fe2 and sulfate radical 95 3 11 reusability and stability of nanocomposite fig 9 a and b showed the reusability of the ag cufe2o4 cqds nanocomposite in 5 cycles the reuse and stability of nanocomposites is the main factor in the ph ps l process after every 30 min the nanocomposite was magnetically collected washed three times with dw and then dried at 120 c for reuse application 16 subsequently 6 mm ps and 10 mg l tc were added and the second cycle of tc degradation was carried out these steps were repeated for four cycles the results indicated that the removal efficiency in five cycles was decreased from 100 to 98 96 5 93 7 and 91 5 fig 9 a reuse of nanocomposite also affected the kobs as fig 9 b illustrated the kobs was decreased from 0 1319 min 1 run 1 to 0 1260 min 1 0 1153 min 1 0 1021 min 1 and 0 092 min 1 for consecutive repetitions the lower efficiency of the recycled nanocomposite may be due to the consumption of active sites of ag cu and fe ions moreover residual tc and its intermediates can hinder effective oxidation of ps by nanocomposite 21 chen et al suggested that leaching of ions and nanocomposite agglomeration cause a decrease in the removal efficiency after using the catalyst several times 87 the fesem and xrd analysis were applied for more evaluation of nanocomposite stability fig 9 c d as fesem results illustrated the nanocomposite surface has little changed and loosed but it has retained its original structure also the xrd pattern confirmed that the xrd peaks of fresh and used photocatalyst are relatively stable and the intensity of the peaks has decreased slightly due to little leaching of the metals fig 9 e 31 the leaching quantities of ag fe and cu to the medium were obtained at 0 095 0 167 and 0 125 mg l and decreased to 0 032 0 095 and 0 063 mg l respectively at the 5th run since the leached quantities of metals are 0 2 mg l demonstrates the high physicochemical stability of nanocomposite on the other hand the slight decrease in removal efficiency directs that the photocatalyst reuse is still effective and cost effective after even 5 runs degradation process 16 96 table 1 shows the comparison of the performance of ag cufe2o4 cqds ps vl in tc and toc removal with similar studies that include sulfate radical based oxidation processes as results illustrate the tc removal and kobs are by far higher than many similar studies the high value of kobs demonstrates the high quantity of ros generation in the system that leads to the complete degradation of tc 100 in a relatively short time 30 min this confirmed that the ag cufe2o4 cqds ps vl system is an effective process for photodegradation tc coupled with ps that can be used as a satisfactory method for aqueous solutions containing tc 3 12 quenching test and possible activation mechanism the ps ph l system has a complex mechanism in which different radicals are involved in pollutant degradation in sr aops systems sulfate and hydroxyl radicals are the ros that normally control the reaction in order to verify this as well as to deduce which other species appear in the proposed ps ph l system experiments are carried out with a set of scavengers thus meoh and tba are used as a scavenger of for so4 and oh the quench rate constant of meoh for so4 and oh have been reported to be 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 and 9 7 106 m 1 s 1 respectively however tba mostly is the scavenger of oh and its quench rate constant is 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 which is much higher than so4 4 0 105 m 1 s 1 on the other hand bq and so scavenge o2 and h respectively 105 being the quench rate constant of bq for o2 is 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 106 fig 10a shows the removal efficiencies decreased from 100 to 36 53 79 and 90 in the presence of bq so meoh and tba respectively which means that the major involved ros are o2 h so4 and oh contribute to the degradation mechanism in terms of reduction of reaction rates fig 10b clearly shows how the elimination rate of tetracycline is reduced by the different scavengers used the kobs was decreased to 0 0729 min 1 0 0483 min 1 0 0251 min 1 and 0 0138 min 1 when added tba meoh so and bq respectively it is thus clear that the species o2 plays the main role in the photo assisted persulfate activation mechanism as previously reported by other authors in similar systems 107 the main hypothesis is that this could be due to the role of releasing ag cu and fe ions in bulk and or ag cu and fe on the catalyst surface in reduction of o2 to o2 108 next in order of importance the results indicated that h plays a significant role in the tc degradation this may be due to the consumption of photogenerated electrons in the conduction bands by so4 which leads to more h contribution in the tc degradation therefore persulfate improved the photocatalytic process by decreasing the recombination of e h pairs and is representative of the proper collaboration between ps and the light mechanism 109 the results obtained are similar to those observed by other authors in similar systems for instance han et al have also shown the o2 and h are the main radicals in the cqds pms system they hypothesized that the e h pairs by cqds would be generated under visible light irradiation and pms molecule would act as an electron trap generate h2o2 and then o2 would produce via further decomposing hydrogen peroxide meanwhile the valence band of cqds directly contributes to pollutant degradation leading to more separation of e h pairs 72 moreover in the photocatalytic approach the ag could absorb the photons which induce the exciting of the electrons below the fermi level of the ag to the surface plasmon states subsequently the photogenerated electron will easily be transferred to cb of cqds and finally react with dissolved o2 to generate the o2 in parallel the photogenerated hole on ag can directly react with tc or oxide the h2o into oh radical 69 the results also revealed that the inhibition of the degradation efficiency of tc with the addition of meoh is apparently greater than with tba suggesting that the so4 is responsible for the pollutant degradation 110 however the contribution of oh in degradation process is due to the reaction of so4 with water molecules hydroxyl ions leading to the generation of hydroxyl radicals eq 12 13 109 wang et al have reported that in pms activated by the ag mesoporous g c3n4 hybrid the o2 and h are the main ros which participates in the degradation of bisphenol a they proposed that photogenerated electrons could be trapped by pms to generate the so4 thus promotes the separation of e h pairs moreover e reacts with the oxygen molecule produce the o2 and along with the positive holes leads to the degradation of the pollutant 111 however despite their importance all these results obtained qualitatively using scavengers should be confirmed quantitatively using technologies such as electron paramagnetic resonance epr 3 13 mineralization efficiency and tc degradation pathway total organic carbon toc was applied to assess the mineralization of the tc fig 11 a b illustrated the removal and kobs of tc and toc as shown the removal efficiency for tc is 100 after 30 min while the toc removal in the same condition is 47 these results confirmed that the tc is degraded to intermediates during the degradation process lc ms analysis was used to identify by products of tc in the ph ps l system according to the intermediates detected a possible degradation mechanism has been proposed in scheme 1 double bonds aromatic rings and amino groups are the main targets for the attack of the ros o2 h so4 and oh the reactions of the ring opening and or carbon bond cleavage are the principal route for the generation of the intermediates 112 therefore the nonselective attack of the ros on any functional groups and locations of the tc can generate the different intermediates caused by various degradation pathways firstly tc is attack by oh and formed the hydroxylate product p1 m z 461 simultaneously n demethylation and or bidemethylation could occur because of the so4 an attack that generates the p2 m z 431 and p3 m z 417 23 subsequently p3 could be converted to p4 m z 400 by the dihydroxylation reaction furthermore the loss of amino groups in p2 leads to the formation of p5 m z 416 113 then further degradation leads to the dislodging of the functional groups opening rings and the generation of the simpler intermediates p6 m z 285 and p7 m z 238 114 in the following p8 m z 150 is produced due to the formation of cooh and the dislodging of the oh groups finally the greater the attack of ros on central c in molecules and mineralize those leads to the generation of low weight by products and complete mineralization co2 h2o nh4 no3 55 4 conclusions the novel ag cufe2o4 cqds nanocomposite was successfully prepared by the solvothermal method the effect of different nanocomposite components on tc degradation in ph l ph ps and ph ps l systems was evaluated the highest removal efficiency of tc was obtained as the ph ps l ph ps ph l process different nanocomposite components play an effective role in degradation systems cqds enhanced the tc degradation via generation of e h pairs induced a more uniform size distribution and better monodispersity of the nanocomposite increased the hydrophilicity of the surface and enlarged the interaction between nanocomposite and pollutant ag improved the removal of tc due to spr the formation of smaller particles and the reduced agglomeration when combined with cufe2o4 cufe2o4 through produces the e h pairs under light irradiation and the e transfer between cu cu2 and fe2 fe3 ion pairs increase the catalytic activity the increase in ph and initial tc concentration reduced tc degradation the ps concentration and catalyst doses had a positive effect on processes up to 6 mm and 0 3 g l respectively the inhibitory effect of inorganic ions was obtained as follows cl no3 hco3 furthermore ha 2 5 mg l had a negative influence on tc removal the nanocomposite showed the proper reusability after 5 cycles and the quenching test indicated o2 and h are the main ros which participates in tc degradation besides the

13057,tetracycline is a broad spectrum antibiotic largely found in the environment with many adverse effects on environmental and human health recently the coupling of different advanced oxidation processes has been promised as the effective approach for the degradation of refractory pollutants in this work the magnetically separable ag cufe2o4 cqds photocatalyst was successfully synthesized and characterized by x ray powder diffraction differential reflectance spectroscopy transmission electron microscopy field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy analysis the potential of different systems namely photocatalyst light photocatalyst persulfate and photocatalyst persulfate light as well as operation parameters reusability and involved radicals were evaluated for tetracycline degradation the highest removal efficiency for the different systems was obtained as photocatalyst persulfate light 100 30 min photocatalyst persulfate 100 55 min photocatalyst light 100 75 min the 47 total organic carbon removal was obtained in optimum condition and intermediate products were proposed based on results of liquid chromatography mass

acid ha respectively the inhibitory effect of inorganic ions was obtained as cl no3 hco3 the nanocomposite showed high reusability after 5 consecutive cycles 91 5 the results of the scavenger analysis suggest the superoxide and positive hole are the main species involved in tetracycline degradation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tetracycline sulfate radicals advanced oxidation processes photocatalyst persulfate nanocomposite 1 introduction the increase in the world s population also means an increase in pressure on water resources as a consequence of increased human activities population growth is related to an increase in human life expectancy in which the development of pharmaceuticals drugs antibiotics hormones etc for disease control has played an important role 1 however the increased use of pharmaceuticals poses an environmental and public health problem as in most cases they are discharged into the public domain without proper treatment in recent years the scientific community has focused their attention on the characterization management and treatment of hospital wastewater 2 within pharmaceuticals antibiotics deserve special attention special features include high chemical stability lack of complete metabolism in water treatment and widespread use that pose a threat to the eco environment and human health 3 in fact antibiotics are already widely found in aqueous environments such as surface waters seaside environments soils groundwater and even drinking water 4 since antibiotics are a class of anti infective drugs that kill or stop the growth of bacteria they lead to the generation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and increase the large amount of antibiotic resistant genes args in nature 5 tetracycline tc is a broad spectrum antibiotic has been widely used to treat different diseases such as chlamydial infection rickettsia disease mycoplasma pneumonia feed additives in livestock and other nonbacterial infections 6 7 the amount of tc in aqueous media has been reported between 17 and 497 ng l and extended half life 180 d under environmental conditions 8 9 conventional wastewater treatment methods cannot completely degrade tc due to its antibacterial properties and refractory nature 10 11 unlike other advanced technologies e g adsorption membrane separation etc aops have attracted attention for the degradation of recalcitrant compounds due to fast oxidation no formation of oxidation subproducts complete oxidation of contaminants and great performance 12 13 recently radical sulfate based aops sr aops have emerged as a variant to conventional aops 14 sr aops are based on the generation of sulfate radicals so4 using peroxymonosulfate pms or persulfate ps as oxidants 15 these sr aops provide advantages including higher oxidation potential in a wide ph range and a longer half life so4 2 5 3 1 v and 30 40 μs oh 2 2 2 7 v and 1 μs selectivity more suitable reaction with target organic matter containing unsaturated bonds or aromatic p electrons before self quenching during the diffusion process through different paths e g hydrogen abstraction addition reaction and electron transfer processes easy transportation of oxidants compared to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 cost effective much more persistently and stability 16 18 also unlike conventional aops sr aops generates both so4 and oh radicals that can be produced under different environmental conditions and participate in the decomposition process 19 20 moreover the performance of sr aops is not limited to an acidic environment unlike the fenton reaction ph 2 4 21 although the effectiveness of the aops processes is significant the use of one aop process could not be enough to totally degrade some recalcitrant compounds 22 for instance zhang et al 2020 have reported that persulfate based aop alone is not satisfactory for tc degradation 23 for that reason tang et al 2019 combined persulfate ps and heterogeneous photocatalysis leading to enhanced efficiency degradation due to the role of pds as electron acceptors for charger separation 24 therefore it is necessary to intensify the processes by combining different aops to promote removal efficiency by overcoming the drawbacks of each process and enhancing the quantity and diversity of reactive oxygen species ros therefore sr aops are one of the efficient and environmentally friendly approaches to remove the antibiotic 25 26 since a long time ago different methods have been used namely the energy activation approach uv electric heat and etc adding transition metals ag cu fe co and etc alkali activation and chelation agents to activate ps for producing free radicals 27 29 among them energy activation has remarkable drawbacks thermal activation of ps activation by thermal is extremely ph dependent also uv activation of ps required high energy and expensive equipment that significantly increases the cost of the removal process 30 31 transition metals are conventional activators used in two approaches namely heterogeneous and homogeneous for ps activation unlike energy activation there is no need to add external energy 21 some studies have reported that coupling heterogeneous visible light photocatalysis with an oxidant is a promising approach for antibiotic degradation 23 24 the employing of heterogeneous photocatalysts e g nanocomposite have significant advantages including great efficiency reusability decreasing secondary pollutants and non favorable loss of catalysts and nonradical activation although the presence of ions in the water matrix leads to problems such as sludge production radical scavenging and a limited ph tightness range 28 copper is one of the metals that has been shown to have a good ability to activate ps through the role of an electron donor and electron bridge to assist rapid electron transfer between ps and the catalyst 16 32 moreover an iron based catalyst has been widely applied to active ps because it has proper features such as fast so4 generation cost effective low toxicity and high accessibility in nature 33 34 magnetic spinel type copper ferrite cufe2o4 is a promising alternative as cu and fe activator sources compared to other copper nanocomposites e g cuo in addition cufe2o4 is a promising heterogeneous catalyst for the elimination of refractory contaminants through activation of sr aops due to its significant catalytic activity superb stability low cost and eligible separation however cufe2o4 has shown low efficiency due to insufficient active site quantity limited conductivity that obstructs its capacity for electron transfer and catalysis and slow solid liquid interfacial mass transfer and low generation regeneration of dissolved ferrous ions 17 35 zhang et al 2013 illustrated that cu2 leaching in cufe2o4 is much lower than in cuo 36 furthermore the study by li et al 2019 revealed that the cu cufe2o4 catalyst demonstrated great catalytic activity for ps activation to degrade tc even in the presence of inorganic ions especially bicarbonate ions in addition they reported that the presence of copper and ferrous ions on the catalyst surface causes the generation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals 16 furthermore zhao et al 2017 reported that cufe2o4 has a low photocatalytic efficiency under visible light radiation due to fast recombination of photogenerated e h pairs therefore some components such as c3n4 tio2 cuo ceo2 and agbr have been added to cufe2o4 to improve its photocatalytic activity the finding confirmed that ag components are more effective compared to the other 37 because the silver containing compound promotes catalytic activity by accelerating the electron transfer in the ferrous ferric redox cycle and developing active sites on the surface 27 31 the study by ouyang et al 2020 showed that silver ag can effectively activate ps and its doping into nanoparticles improves ps activation due to high catalytic activity 21 therefore two approaches that include more light absorption and prevent charge recombination are required to promote cufe2o4 photocatalytic activity here ag through localized surface plasmon resonance lspr causes increased visible light absorption and also plays the role of an electron trap and active reaction sites 38 dai et al 2014 also have revealed that ag is the effective e acceptor which improves the separation of e h pairs 39 on the other hand surendra et al 2018 have illustrated that ag can affect cufe2o4 properties leading to the promotion of photocatalytic activity also cufe2o4 is a good match with ag due to its suitable band edges ecb 1 22 ev evb 0 22 ev 40 moreover liu et al 2021 have reported that silver based photocatalytic materials have high visible light degradation activities due to their proper bandgap and excellent visible light response 41 carbon based composites have developed as hopeful catalysts in aop technologies due to their strong physicochemical features and being environmentally friendly 42 carbon quantum dots cqds have unique properties that include vigorous chemical inertness easy functionalization low toxicity reliable stability and superior electron reserve and electron transfer attributes 17 43 moreover cqds can facilitate electrons in the composite interface 44 therefore the combination of metals with each other and with carbon promotes the activation of ps and improved catalyst stability 36 furthermore in the photocatalytic approach the cqds can harvest photons via direct absorption these photons induce the e h pairs in cqds that appear as photocatalysts 34 cqds improve semiconductor photocatalysis activity by separating photogenerated charge carriers by forming heterojunction increasing conversion of cqds wide spectrum light absorption adsorption of organic pollutant by conjugated π structure and finally synergistic effect by surface plasmon resonance spr effect of silver nanoparticles 17 45 46 furthermore cqds due to the existence of functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl and amine facilitate the response to visible light during the photocatalytic process because of n π 47 li et al 2021 have reported that carbonous materials improve the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite because they have a broader visible light response range facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers as well as boost electronic features 48 the photo corrosion under light irradiation is one of the main drawbacks of the metal semiconductors the main solution to this problem construction of heterojunction with other semiconductors especially carbon materials 49 hence the present study attempts to reduce tc using the novel heterogeneous photocatalysis coupling persulfate oxidation with ag cufe2o4 cqds under visible light radiation considering the effect of the different parameters such as the influence of ph inorganic ions humic acids ha and nanocomposite dosage in addition a mechanistic approach to tc degradation is proposed based on studies with different scavengers finally the recovery reuse and loss of efficiency of the photocatalyst have been studied 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the chemical reagents used in this work include silver nitrate agno3 25 ammonia nh3 iron nitrate fe no3 3 9h2o copper nitrate cu no3 2 3h2o

external magnet 2 ml of sample was collected at regular intervals and 1 ml of methanol was immediately added to prevent further tc degradation finally the sample was filtered through a 0 22 μm

sedimented at the bottom of the test tube 30 μl of this extractant was injected into the hplc 38 2 6 mechanism of tc degradation tc degradation is due to ros generation in the oxidation process the radical trapping experiment is the proper way to determine the role of ros in the pollutant decomposition process the major ros that participates in the ph ps l process includes sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical oh positive hole h and superoxide o2 for this purpose the quenching test was carried out using specific scavengers including methanol meoh tert butyl alcohol tba sodium oxalate so and 1 4 benzoquinone bq for trapping the so4 oh h and o2 respectively by adding the scavengers radical trapping will occur whose degree of inhibition indicates the contribution of each scavenger to the quenching test this process reveals the greater role of the corresponding ros by reducing the removal efficiency 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd analysis fig 1 a illustrated the xrd patterns of cqds cufe2o4 ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds as shown the centered broad peak centered is observed around 2θ 25 c which can be corresponded to the reflection 002 of cqds 50 the distinct diffraction peaks of cufe2o4 were located at 2θ 30 5 36 39 2 43 6 54 57 5 and 63 3 are assigned to 220 311 202 4 0 0 312 4 1 1 and 4 4 0 planes respectively which confirm typical spinel cufe2o4 structure 51 the appearance peaks at 2θ 39 2 111 45 8 200 and 66 5 2 2 0 correspond to the silver crystal in ag cufe2o4 nanoparticles 52 the xrd pattern of ag cufe2o4 cqd showed that the peaks corresponded to the cqds are not detected which is due to the small quantity of cqds assembled in the ag cufe2o4 nanoparticle 53 while the peaks related to ag 2θ 11 5 15 8 20 23 5 38 4 and 77 5 and cufe2o4 2θ 30 5 35 5 43 5 44 6 53 9 57 2 62 9 64 8 and 78 4 were observed in the xrd pattern of ag cufe2o4 cqds 54 the debye scherrer s eq 2 was employed to calculate the crystallite sizes of the ag cufe2o4 cqds nanocomposite 2 d k λ β cos θ where d is the crystal size nm k is a constant 0 9 λ is a function of the x ray wavelength nm cukα 0 154443 nm β is the corrected full width at half maximum fwhm of the diffraction peak and θ is the diffraction angle for the peak bragg s angle the average crystallite size for ag cufe2o4 cqds was obtained at 19 54 nm 37 3 2 uv visible drs analysis fig 1 b illustrates the optical absorbance spectra of cqds ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds within the range of 200 to 800 nm as shown absorption edge for cqds ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds was obtained at 240 410 and 530 nm respectively which indicated ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds have a broader absorption region therefore this analysis confirms ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds are active successfully in all studied areas 55 also the absorption edge of ag cufe2o4 cqds nanocomposite shows the optical band gap is 2 3 ev the results indicated that the incorporation of cqds and ag with copper ferrite induced an increase in the visible region dadigala et al have reported that due to the intrinsic optical absorbance of cqds increasing the quantity of cqds leads to an increase in intensity in the visible region in ag nanoparticle decorated g c3n4 nanosheets 46 the study by guo et al showed that carbon based materials can improve the photocatalytic activity of cufe2o4 spheres via a prolonged lifetime and a lower recombination rate of e h pairs due to the electrical interplay between the carbon matter doped and the cufe2o4 surface 56 57 moreover ag induces the increase of e concentrations leading to the burstein moss effect 40 this is due to the surface plasmon band of ag which under electromagnetic irradiation the collective oscillations of the free conduction band electrons would increase 58 3 3 tem analysis tem analysis was used for the study of the morphology and microstructure of ag cufe2o4 cqd fig 2a as illustrated in fig 2 a small nanoparticles have caused the formation of sphere like particles 16 moreover some irregular particles are created due to the phenomenon of copper jahn teller distortion that causes low crystallographic symmetry 59 3 4 fesem eds analysis the morphology of ag cufe2o4 cqds ag cufe2o4 and cqds were characterized by fesem analysis fig 2b d as shown the ag cufe2o4 cqds and ag cufe2o4 nanocomposites have a cubic structure with a high degree of crystalline with diameter of 25 70 nm furthermore the particles are uniform and agglomerative 17 also the fesem results of cqds is revealed small spherical particles of size 12 nm the elemental mapping image confirms the presence of o fe cu and ag suggesting the successful formation of ag cufe2o4 nanoparticles furthermore o fe and cu are distributed in the core section while ag was thickly spread in the edge area representative that it was regularly dispersed on the surface of the shell fig 2c 27 the eds analysis revealed that the mass percentages of o fe cu and ag are 36 60 40 96 16 57 and 5 87 respectively in the ag cufe2o4 nanoparticles fig 2d 3 5 effect of different systems on tc removal fig 3 a d shows the removal of tc in the ph l fig 3 a ph ps fig 3 b and ph ps l fig 3 c systems for the ph l process the tc removal efficiency of cqd agno3 and cufe2o4 was obtained by 44 33 and 57 at 120 min respectively the tc removal reached 100 at 115 and 75 min with ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds respectively fig 3 a as observed in fig 3 a cqds have moderate photocatalytic activity the main feature of cqds is the absorption of the wide spectrum of light which led to exciting electrons e and the transit from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb under visible light irradiation photogenerated e h pairs induce the formation of different ros e g oh and o2 which participate in tc degradation hu et al proposed the following mechanism for the photodegradation of organic pollutant by cqds eq 3 9 60 3 cqds hϑ e h 4 h 2 o or oh h ho h 5 e o 2 o 2 6 org h h org h org h 7 org h ho org h 2 o 8 org o 2 org oo o 2 h 2 o degradation 9 org h ho h org ho o 2 h 2 o degradation cheng et al have reported 97 photodegradation of rhodamine b using cqds under natural light after 4 h 61 the removal efficiency of tc by agno3 was obtained by 33 suggesting a low photocatalytic activity of agno3 nanoparticles when agno3 nanoparticles added to the solution produce ag which is reducing agents ag has photocatalytic activity alone while it improves the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst by hindering recombination of e h pairs 62 also ag due to surface plasmon resonance spr induces more light absorption in the visible region moreover ag alone does not react with pollutant 63 the results indicated that the tc removal efficiency by cufe2o4 is 57 copper ferrite contains both cu2 and fe3 therefore the transfer of e between the cu cu2 and fe2 fe3 ion pairs increases the catalytic activity 50 on the other hand gao et al reported that the cufe2o4 semiconductor produces the e h pairs under light irradiation excitation of cufe2o4 excitation by visible light causes ros generation on the catalyst surface furthermore many reactive sites will be produced due to the pore structures and the large surface area of cufe2o4 that provides the required channels for charge transfer and an adequate contact area for the catalyst and antibiotics 64 65 jing et al have illustrated ground state electrons of cufe2o4 via photon absorption of photons with enough energy of hν namely hν eg 1 53 ev will be transferred from vb to cb and the same number of holes remains in vb subsequently the pairs e h are captured by absorbed oxygen and hydroxyl radical generate the o2 and oh 66 however as the results have shown the removal efficiency of tc is not great due to the small band gap of cufe2o4 that led to fast recombination of e h pairs which decreased the degradation of photocatalytic tc 67 the photodegradation of tc by ag cufe2o4 revealed that 100 efficiency will be achieved after 115 min suggesting high photocatalytic activity of ag cufe2o4 the combination of ag with cufe2o4 led to the formation of smaller particles and a reduced agglomeration increasing the surface area therefore active sites produce a higher efficiency in light harvesting furthermore given the redox potentials when ag cufe2o4 was irradiated the photogenerated electrons could transfer from the cufe2o4 conduction band to that of ag also at the same time photogenerated holes could transfer from the valence band of ag to that of cufe2o4 which reduces recombination of e h pairs 37 zhu et al demonstrated that ag loading makes more visible light harvesting by ag cufe2o4 similarly a smaller size of ag cufe2o4 induces more hydrogen bonded surface water molecules and hydroxyl groups which facilitate the generation of more ros 58 surendra has reported ag cufe2o4 has excellent photocatalytic activity 97 due to the uniform structure with small particle size that led to proper dispersion of the particles in solution the results have confirmed that particle size plays a significant role in catalytic activity 40 the study by li et al also confirmed the synergetic effect between silver and copper iron oxide 68 finally the photocatalytic activity of ag cufe2o4 cqds showed the highest photodegradation efficiency reaching total tc removal in 75 min the results indicated that combinations of different components ag cufe2o4 and cqds have a synergetic effect cqds induce a more uniform size distribution and a better monodispersity of nanocomposite this is due to the excellent dispersibility and ultra small and regular size of cqds in addition cqds increase the hydrophilicity of the surface as well as increase the interaction between nanocomposite and pollutant 69 furthermore due to the electron storage capacity of cqds the photon excited electrons from ag cufe2o4 can transfer in the conducting network of cqds which hinders the recombination of photogenerated e h pairs 70 on the other hand cqds led to increasing the stability of ag cufe2o4 via two routes a effectively protect nanocomposite dissolution in aqueous solution b cqds act as both electron acceptors and donors which hinders the photo corrosion of the nanocomposite furthermore cqds absorb visible light and emit shorter wavelength light which induces the re excitation of ag cufe2o4 for the generation of photogenerated e h pairs then the electrons will be trapped by cqds and hindering the recombination of e h pairs in addition spr in ag particles causes a higher e h pair formation rate which induces the synergistic effect of ag and cqds increasing photocatalytic activity 71 fig 3 b shows the removal of tc by cqds agno3 cufe2o4 ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds in the ph ps oxidation process as shown in fig 3 b the order of tc removal efficiency is as follows cqds 21 60 min agno3 56 60 min cufe2o4 72 57 min ag cufe2o4 86 55 min ag cufe2o4 cqds 100 55 min these results suggested that the combination of ps with photocatalysts ph ps improved the removal of tc compared to photocatalysis individually fig 3 a moreover the ability of cqds alone is low for ps activation han et al suggested that the presence of large amounts of oxygen groups in cqds leads to negligible carbocatalytic activity that reduces poor graphitic degree and conductivity this phenomenon is not suitable for generating the sulfate radical via direct electron transfer to ps 72 also edge sites and ketonic groups of carbon materials due to chemically electroactive properties can stimulate ps to generate sulfate radicals 59 moreover surface attached sulfate radicals are produced by reaction of the carbon lattice with ps these radicals through continuous electron extraction processes on the carbon surface induce oxidation of pollutants 73 74 hou et al revealed that surface defects graphitic structure and n containing functionalities produce activity sites in ncqds that contribute to ps activation 75 however liang et al also have reported that the small size of cqds is the effective factor for ps activation because small particles provide more active sites which increases catalytic activity 76 77 on the other hand the results indicated that the high removal efficiency by nanocomposite containing ag ag cufe2o4 and ag cufe2o4 cqds is due to the high catalytic properties of ag which can facilitate ps oxidation and generate more sulfate radicals moreover fe2 and cu are effective transition metals in ps decomposition eqs 10 12 27 31 the study by li et al confirmed that adsorbed ps induces oxidation of cu2 to cu3 on the surface of cufe2o4 and subsequently cu3 reacts with water molecules to generate hydroxyl radicals eqs 13 14 16 furthermore guo et al have reported that cu2 accelerates fe3 2 eq 15 and oxygen vacancies ov in fe2o3 improving more ros generation for tc decomposition ovs improve interfacial electron transfer which induces ps activation eqs 16 18 78

achieving the total removal of tc using ag cufe2o4 cqd in 30 min as previously discussed ros could be produced in the ph l and ps oxidation process thus in addition to ps activated by nanocomposite the light led to more activation of ps resulting in more ros generation in the ps ph l system in the kinetic study illustrated in all systems the kobs of the final nanocomposite was more of its components fig 3 d furthermore the ag cufe2o4 cqds kobs for tc degradation was obtained 0 0207 min 1 0 0387 min 1 and 0 1319 min 1 for ph l ps oxidation and ph ps l systems respectively this result suggested the synergistic effect between the photocatalyst ps and light for tc degradation 3 6 effect of ph the ph is the effective parameter in chemical reactions that affect the catalyst surface chemical properties of the pollutant and the kinetics of reactions fig 4 a and b shows the effect of ph on tc degradation in ph ps l systems as shown the highest degradation was obtained at acidic ph for all systems the results revealed that the removal of tc by the ag cufe2o4 cqd nanocomposite decreased by 42 during 30 min with an increase in ph from 3 to 11 fig 4 a the kobs was obtained 0 1319 min 1 0 0884 min 1 0 0594 min 1 0 0421 min 1 and 0 0270 min 1 for ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 respectively fig 4 b this is due to acid catalytic ps decomposition which generates extra sulfate radicals while under alkali conditions sulfate radicals react with water molecules and hydroxyl ions and generate oh which has lower redox potential 1 8 2 7 v than sulfate radicals 2 5 3 1 v eqs 19 20 27 furthermore nanocomposite surface passivation can occur at high ph leading to decreased catalytic activity of ag cufe2o4 cqd 28 wang et al have also reported that the highest acid red 73 degradation was obtained at ph 3 in the fe ag gac catalytic persulfate system 31 19 so 4 h 2 o ho so 4 2 h 20 so 4 oh ho so 4 2 in addition zero valent cu corrosion increased at acidic ph which enhances the activity of cufe2o4 for ps decomposition 79 the acid dissociation constants pka of the tc and the phzpc of the nanocomposite are the other parameters that affect the removal efficiency li et al have reported that tc is the amphoteric molecule with three pka 3 30 7 68 and 9 68 according to the ph of the solution since the phzpc of the nanocomposite is 4 8 the surface charge of the nanocomposite at ph phzpc and ph phzpc is negative and positive respectively however there are some repulsing electrostatic forces between nanocomposite and tc at ph 3 tcpka 3 30 tc is as h3tc the acid catalytic effect for ps decomposition causes the generation of more sulfate radicals that overcomes the electrostatic repulsing effect on the other hand high repulsing electrostatic forces between the ag cufe2o4 cqds nanocomposite and tc htc and tc2 forbid sorption of tc under alkali conditions 80 additionally under acidic conditions ph phzpc the negative charge of s2o8 2 facilitates more contact with the positive charge of the nanocomposite surface and leads to more ros generation 21 furthermore high oh concentration and negative charge nanocomposite ph phzpc under alkali conditions cause a decrease in tc diffusion and hinder e transfer to the surface area of ag cufe2o4 cqd and decreased tc degradation 81 duan et al have reported that carbon in nanocomposites is functionalized by hydroxyl ions under high alkali conditions which hinders the adsorption of ps ions via electrostatic repulsive forces 73 furthermore ros will be quenched and converted to inert products such as so4 2 hso4 and o2 due to interaction reactions between so4 and oh which leads to a decrease in active species concentration at a high and neutral ph 30 meanwhile the high removal of tc in the photocatalytic process at acidic ph is due to the fact that the function of photogenerated h for tc degradation is more effective at lower ph 82 3 7 effect of initial concentration of tc fig 5 a and b illustrates the effect of the initial concentration of tc on the removal efficiency the result indicated that the removal efficiency decreased with increasing tc concentration the order of tc removal performance as a function of concentration is as follows 5 mg l 100 20 min 10 mg l 100 30 min 15 mg l 100 38 min 20 mg l 89 45 min 30 mg 78 45 min fig 5a furthermore the kobs decreased from 0 1319 min 1 to 0 0332 min 1 with increasing tc concentration fig 5 b when the tc concentration is increased the penetration of light into the solution will decrease and cause a restriction of the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite and direct photolysis of ps yang et al have reported that increasing the tc concentration restrains light penetration into solution which reduces access to photons 83 furthermore fewer ros are accessed for the degradation of target pollutants in high tc concentration 31 84 furthermore with increasing tc concentration more concentrations of intermediate tc are produced that consume ros and compete with the main pollutant decomposition 85 the active catalyst sites are the main parameter for ros generation via photocatalytic and ps oxidation tc molecules at high concentrations adsorbed on catalyst sites and cause deactivation 86 ouyang et al have reported that the reaction between tc and ros will decrease when the initial concentration of tc increases 21 3 8 effect of nanocomposite dosage fig 6 a shows the degradation efficiency of tc at different dosages of ag cufe2o4 cqds nanocomposite 0 0 4 g l as depicted the removal of tc increased to 0 3 g l and then decreased slightly kobs was obtained 0 0516 min 1 0 0951 min 1 0 1319 min 1 and 0 1207 min 1 for 0 1 g l 0 2 g l 0 3 g l and 0 4 g l respectively fig 6 b increasing catalyst dosage improves pollutant adsorption on the catalyst surface and also accessibility of more active sites for reaction with ps which will accelerate ros generation and provide an effective interaction between pollutant and sulfate radicals because sulfate radicals can be produced near ps on the catalyst surface if the tc is in the vicinity of the oxidant it improves the reaction between so4 and tc thus facilitating faster degradation of tc at higher catalyst dosages kobs decreases due to nanocomposite agglomeration and loss of total surface area or self quenching effect of generated radicals 33 87 furthermore when the number of activated sites is exceeded they cannot be effectively used for pollutant adsorption and occupied by ps thus the reaction between ps and tc with activated sites is reduced 30 33 the study of li et al showed that an additional dose of catalyst would quench the ros 16 moradi et al have reported that light scattering and screening effect will occur in a high dose of nanocomposites which causes a decrease in tc removal 81 3 9 effect of ps concentration fig 7 a and b indicated the effect of ps concentrations 0 75 12 mm on tc degradation in the ph ps l process results have shown that the removal efficiency increases up to 6 mm and then decreases with increasing ps concentration fig 7 a the kobs was obtained 0 0141 min 1 0 0435 min 1 0 0892 min 1 0 1319 min 1 and 0 1114 min 1 for 0 75 1 5 3 6 and 12 mm respectively fig 7 b the high concentration of ps facilitates the accelerated generation of sulfate radicals that leads to faster degradation of tc however a further increase of ps concentrations to 12 mm has negative effects due to the self quenching reaction of the free radical eqs 21 22 35 88 21 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 22 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 s 2 o 8 so 4 2 chen et al have reported that the accessibility of oxidant was the limiting parameter that determined radical generation at low oxidant concentrations furthermore a high concentration of oxidants led to less reactive ros e g s2o8 generation via self scavenging or competitive reaction 87 the study by ouyang et al showed that the quenching phenomenon of ros would occur in the excessive concentration of ps 21 the other reason was revealed by miao et al who have reported that the active sites of cufe2o4 would be saturated in high pms concentration and therefore the excess oxidant cannot be activated by the catalyst 89 furthermore yang et al have illustrated the outcompetition of ros in the excessive s2o8 2 concentration leading to stagnant removal efficiency 90 3 10 effect of inorganic ions and organic matter cl no3 and hco3 are common inorganic anions in natural water that can affect the pollutant degradation process therefore inorganic anions play a superior role in photocatalytic processes via the effect on the catalyst surface and deactivate active sites 91 fig 8 a d illustrates the effect of cl no3 and hco3 anions on tc removal as observed the inhibition effect of inorganic ions is obtained in the following order cl no3 hco3 taghizadeh et al 2020 have reported that clogging of catalyst active sites would occur in the presence of inorganic ions leading to decreased photocatalytic activity 92 the results of the cl effect indicate that the kobs of tc degradation increased slightly with increasing cl concentration up to 0 5 mm and then decreased fig 8 a as observed kobs increased from 0 1319 min 1 to 0 1368 min 1 and then decreased to 0 0924 min 1 at maximum cl concentration the positive effect of cl on kobs may be due to enhanced oxidative ability through generation of different chlorine radicals include cl cl2 and cloh in the medium eqs 23 28 at a high concentration of cl retardation in the decomposition of ps would occur this could be due to the quenching of the reaction quenching of the cl2 and cl radicals eqs 29 30 84 93 liu et al 2018 have reported that cl accelerates rhodamine b photodegradation due to the generation of chloride radicals 93 li et al 2019 showed that the degradation of tc would increase in the presence of chloride ions because of the cl2 and cl radicals 16 23 so 4 cl so 4 2 cl 24 cl h vb cl 25 cl ho cl oh 26 cl cl cl 2 27 cl 2 oh cloh cl 28 cl 2 h 2 o cloh cl h 29 cl 2 cl 2 cl 2 2 cl 30 cl cl cl 2 fig 8 b shows the effect of no3 on the photodegradation of tc the results show a slightly decreasing trend with an increase in the concentration of no3 ions up to 1 mm then the trend of kobs decreased sharply with increasing the concentration of no3 ions which was assigned to the reaction of no3 with positive hole sulfate and hydroxyl radicals this process induces the no3 which has less ability to degradation of organic matter eqs 31 33 31 no 3 so 4 no 3 so 4 2 32 no 3 h vb no 3 33 no 3 ho no 3 oh fig 8 c shows the effect of hco3 on tc degradation as can be observed kobs decreased from 0 1319 min 1 to 0 03 min 1 in the presence of hco3 fig 8 d when hco3 is added the ph of the solution would increase due to carbonate formation which is an unfavorable condition for the generation of sulfate radicals moreover hco3 reacting with sulfate and hydroxyl radicals leads to generation of hco3 and co3 2 which they have less oxidation potential in the decomposition of organic pollutants eqs 34 38 93 on the other hand bicarbonate reduces ros production by absorbing light 94 34 hco 3 so 4 hco 3 so 4 2 35 hco 3 h co 3 36 hco 3 ho co 3 h 2 o 37 co 3 2 so 4 co 3 so 4 2 38 co 3 2 ho co 3 o h fig 8 e shows the effect of organic matter on the photodegradation of tc humic acid ha is the most popular model of dissolved natural organic matter dom the effect of ha was evaluated at different doses 0 5 1 5 and 10 mg l the result indicated that kobs decreased from 0 1319 min 1 to 0 0174 min 1 in the presence of ha the results showed that kobs did not decrease at 2 5 mg l of ha 0 1329 min 1 fig 8 f in other words when ha 2 5 mg l kobs decelerated due to the scavenging effect of ha competing with the target pollutant for ros at a higher concentration this is due to the blocking of the active catalyst sites that can occur by phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of ha leading to a decrease in kobs 87 wang et al have reported that when phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of dom adsorbed on the catalyst surface the reactive sites are blocked and pms activation by cufe2o4 is decreased 33 however ha in a certain concentration 2 5 mg l acts as an electron shuttle and the chelation of fe had an effect on tc degradation because the concentration of ferrous and total fe in solution increased in the presence of ha compared to that without ha therefore ha facilitates the transfer of e from ag cufe2o4 to ps and accelerates the formation of fe2 and sulfate radical 95 3 11 reusability and stability of nanocomposite fig 9 a and b showed the reusability of the ag cufe2o4 cqds nanocomposite in 5 cycles the reuse and stability of nanocomposites is the main factor in the ph ps l process after every 30 min the nanocomposite was magnetically collected washed three times with dw and then dried at 120 c for reuse application 16 subsequently 6 mm ps and 10 mg l tc were added and the second cycle of tc degradation was carried out these steps were repeated for four cycles the results indicated that the removal efficiency in five cycles was decreased from 100 to 98 96 5 93 7 and 91 5 fig 9 a reuse of nanocomposite also affected the kobs as fig 9 b illustrated the kobs was decreased from 0 1319 min 1 run 1 to 0 1260 min 1 0 1153 min 1 0 1021 min 1 and 0 092 min 1 for consecutive repetitions the lower efficiency of the recycled nanocomposite may be due to the consumption of active sites of ag cu and fe ions moreover residual tc and its intermediates can hinder effective oxidation of ps by nanocomposite 21 chen et al suggested that leaching of ions and nanocomposite agglomeration cause a decrease in the removal efficiency after using the catalyst several times 87 the fesem and xrd analysis were applied for more evaluation of nanocomposite stability fig 9 c d as fesem results illustrated the nanocomposite surface has little changed and loosed but it has retained its original structure also the xrd pattern confirmed that the xrd peaks of fresh and used photocatalyst are relatively stable and the intensity of the peaks has decreased slightly due to little leaching of the metals fig 9 e 31 the leaching quantities of ag fe and cu to the medium were obtained at 0 095 0 167 and 0 125 mg l and decreased to 0 032 0 095 and 0 063 mg l respectively at the 5th run since the leached quantities of metals are 0 2 mg l demonstrates the high physicochemical stability of nanocomposite on the other hand the slight decrease in removal efficiency directs that the photocatalyst reuse is still effective and cost effective after even 5 runs degradation process 16 96 table 1 shows the comparison of the performance of ag cufe2o4 cqds ps vl in tc and toc removal with similar studies that include sulfate radical based oxidation processes as results illustrate the tc removal and kobs are by far higher than many similar studies the high value of kobs demonstrates the high quantity of ros generation in the system that leads to the complete degradation of tc 100 in a relatively short time 30 min this confirmed that the ag cufe2o4 cqds ps vl system is an effective process for photodegradation tc coupled with ps that can be used as a satisfactory method for aqueous solutions containing tc 3 12 quenching test and possible activation mechanism the ps ph l system has a complex mechanism in which different radicals are involved in pollutant degradation in sr aops systems sulfate and hydroxyl radicals are the ros that normally control the reaction in order to verify this as well as to deduce which other species appear in the proposed ps ph l system experiments are carried out with a set of scavengers thus meoh and tba are used as a scavenger of for so4 and oh the quench rate constant of meoh for so4 and oh have been reported to be 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 and 9 7 106 m 1 s 1 respectively however tba mostly is the scavenger of oh and its quench rate constant is 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 which is much higher than so4 4 0 105 m 1 s 1 on the other hand bq and so scavenge o2 and h respectively 105 being the quench rate constant of bq for o2 is 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 106 fig 10a shows the removal efficiencies decreased from 100 to 36 53 79 and 90 in the presence of bq so meoh and tba respectively which means that the major involved ros are o2 h so4 and oh contribute to the degradation mechanism in terms of reduction of reaction rates fig 10b clearly shows how the elimination rate of tetracycline is reduced by the different scavengers used the kobs was decreased to 0 0729 min 1 0 0483 min 1 0 0251 min 1 and 0 0138 min 1 when added tba meoh so and bq respectively it is thus clear that the species o2 plays the main role in the photo assisted persulfate activation mechanism as previously reported by other authors in similar systems 107 the main hypothesis is that this could be due to the role of releasing ag cu and fe ions in bulk and or ag cu and fe on the catalyst surface in reduction of o2 to o2 108 next in order of importance the results indicated that h plays a significant role in the tc degradation this may be due to the consumption of photogenerated electrons in the conduction bands by so4 which leads to more h contribution in the tc degradation therefore persulfate improved the photocatalytic process by decreasing the recombination of e h pairs and is representative of the proper collaboration between ps and the light mechanism 109 the results obtained are similar to those observed by other authors in similar systems for instance han et al have also shown the o2 and h are the main radicals in the cqds pms system they hypothesized that the e h pairs by cqds would be generated under visible light irradiation and pms molecule would act as an electron trap generate h2o2 and then o2 would produce via further decomposing hydrogen peroxide meanwhile the valence band of cqds directly contributes to pollutant degradation leading to more separation of e h pairs 72 moreover in the photocatalytic approach the ag could absorb the photons which induce the exciting of the electrons below the fermi level of the ag to the surface plasmon states subsequently the photogenerated electron will easily be transferred to cb of cqds and finally react with dissolved o2 to generate the o2 in parallel the photogenerated hole on ag can directly react with tc or oxide the h2o into oh radical 69 the results also revealed that the inhibition of the degradation efficiency of tc with the addition of meoh is apparently greater than with tba suggesting that the so4 is responsible for the pollutant degradation 110 however the contribution of oh in degradation process is due to the reaction of so4 with water molecules hydroxyl ions leading to the generation of hydroxyl radicals eq 12 13 109 wang et al have reported that in pms activated by the ag mesoporous g c3n4 hybrid the o2 and h are the main ros which participates in the degradation of bisphenol a they proposed that photogenerated electrons could be trapped by pms to generate the so4 thus promotes the separation of e h pairs moreover e reacts with the oxygen molecule produce the o2 and along with the positive holes leads to the degradation of the pollutant 111 however despite their importance all these results obtained qualitatively using scavengers should be confirmed quantitatively using technologies such as electron paramagnetic resonance epr 3 13 mineralization efficiency and tc degradation pathway total organic carbon toc was applied to assess the mineralization of the tc fig 11 a b illustrated the removal and kobs of tc and toc as shown the removal efficiency for tc is 100 after 30 min while the toc removal in the same condition is 47 these results confirmed that the tc is degraded to intermediates during the degradation process lc ms analysis was used to identify by products of tc in the ph ps l system according to the intermediates detected a possible degradation mechanism has been proposed in scheme 1 double bonds aromatic rings and amino groups are the main targets for the attack of the ros o2 h so4 and oh the reactions of the ring opening and or carbon bond cleavage are the principal route for the generation of the intermediates 112 therefore the nonselective attack of the ros on any functional groups and locations of the tc can generate the different intermediates caused by various degradation pathways firstly tc is attack by oh and formed the hydroxylate product p1 m z 461 simultaneously n demethylation and or bidemethylation could occur because of the so4 an attack that generates the p2 m z 431 and p3 m z 417 23 subsequently p3 could be converted to p4 m z 400 by the dihydroxylation reaction furthermore the loss of amino groups in p2 leads to the formation of p5 m z 416 113 then further degradation leads to the dislodging of the functional groups opening rings and the generation of the simpler intermediates p6 m z 285 and p7 m z 238 114 in the following p8 m z 150 is produced due to the formation of cooh and the dislodging of the oh groups finally the greater the attack of ros on central c in molecules and mineralize those leads to the generation of low weight by products and complete mineralization co2 h2o nh4 no3 55 4 conclusions the novel ag cufe2o4 cqds nanocomposite was successfully prepared by the solvothermal method the effect of different nanocomposite components on tc degradation in ph l ph ps and ph ps l systems was evaluated the highest removal efficiency of tc was obtained as the ph ps l ph ps ph l process different nanocomposite components play an effective role in degradation systems cqds enhanced the tc degradation via generation of e h pairs induced a more uniform size distribution and better monodispersity of the nanocomposite increased the hydrophilicity of the surface and enlarged the interaction between nanocomposite and pollutant ag improved the removal of tc due to spr the formation of smaller particles and the reduced agglomeration when combined with cufe2o4 cufe2o4 through produces the e h pairs under light irradiation and the e transfer between cu cu2 and fe2 fe3 ion pairs increase the catalytic activity the increase in ph and initial tc concentration reduced tc degradation the ps concentration and catalyst doses had a positive effect on processes up to 6 mm and 0 3 g l respectively the inhibitory effect of inorganic ions was obtained as follows cl no3 hco3 furthermore ha 2 5 mg l had a negative influence on tc removal the nanocomposite showed the proper reusability after 5 cycles and the quenching test indicated o2 and h are the main ros which participates in tc degradation besides the pathway of tc degradation and main produced by products were identified by lc ms the mineralization study showed 47 removal of toc in the ph ps l process the study confirmed that the ag cufe2o4 cqds

13058,heavy metal pollution in water is a major concern due to its bioaccumulation non biodegradability and high toxicity long term cadmium cd ii ion exposure could have an adverse impact on human health because natural water bodies contain cd ii pollution at low concentrations the treatment of cd ii polluted water should be treated as micro polluted water it is critical to develop an effective water purification procedure to remove cd ii from micro polluted water in the present research mgfe binary layered hydroxide graphene oxide mgfe ldh go nanocomposite was synthesized characterized and used for efficient cd ii adsorption the adsorption process was investigated in terms of ph influence kinetic behavior isotherm equilibrium curves and estimation of thermodynamic parameters the characterization results showed that mgfe ldh go which is composed of crystalline mgfe binary hydroxide and amorphous go structures has a considerable surface area 223 m2 g and has a plate like hexagonal structure with even forms and lamellar aggregates cd ii adsorption was favoured on the mgfe ldh go surface in neutral circumstances at 25 c the pseudo second order kinetic behavior was adequately described although the isotherm equilibrium curves fitted the langmuir isotherm with a high maximum uptake capacity of 174 83 mg g chemisorption controlled spontaneous and endothermic reactions occurred which was confirmed by thermodynamic studies further the surface interaction mechanism was investigated using the xps analysis of spent catalyst the mgfe ldh go nanocomposite is efficient to treat cd ii with a removal percentage of 99 it can be reused more than four times without losing its original capacity and stability overall the mgfe ldh go nanocomposite exhibited high potential to be utilized as an adsorbent for the removal of pollutants from actual contaminated water samples graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mgfe ldh go heavy metal adsorption surface mechanism recycling spectroscopic studies real water treatment 1 introduction environmental pollution due to heavy metal contamination has always lingered around since ages the intrinsic foster values of the environment for sustenance have been greatly affected the bioaccumulation of these non biodegradable heavy metals such as cadmium cd chromium cr mercury hg and lead pb etc has not only threatened the aquatic sphere of the earth but also affected human lives even at low concentrations cd is a very hazardous heavy metal to humans and the environment 1 hence there is a dire need for remediation of heavy metals particularly those which impact the drinking groundwater sources the traditional techniques of environmental remediation including chemical precipitation flocculation ion exchange and electrochemical removal have limitations such as ineffective heavy metal removal substantial by product output and expensive operational costs 2 3 all of these appear to be insufficient in offering solutions particularly in developing nations where capital costs are high by considering the above methods technical and socio economic disadvantages the adsorptive methods are considered with biological and nanotechnological approaches 4 5 which is a common method to remove heavy metals from water metal oxide and biopolymer based hybrid adsorbents have gotten a lot of attention because of their efficacy use and renewability through suitable desorption methods 6 8 from these studies it is also understood that the adsorbent is the key to the success of adsorption operation in recent decades graphene oxide go widely used for wastewater treatment because oxygen containing functional groups become like an anchor for adsorbing heavy metals onto their surface and enable go dispersibility in many solvents especially in water 4 furthermore the possession of a large surface area of graphene oxide sheets provides abundant space for the metal ion to be adsorbed 9 10 go is difficult to separate from aqueous solutions due to its great dispensability in the water in this context many researchers had proven modified graphene oxide with other composites are effective for the efficient adsorptive treatment of large volumes of contaminated groundwater and improve its separability 11 14 additionally it was reported that modification of go surface could improve its utilization in the industrial water treatment 15 thus the hybrid composite material layered double hydroxide ldh go was developed to improve go separability and cd removal ability in this study ldh is well known layered structured material with hexagonal divalent mii and trivalent miii metal ions and polyatomic anions a around it 16 18 because of its anions exchangeable ability ldh can be considered a good adsorbent in environmental clean up 19 however ldh can be decomposed inevitably under acidic conditions and oxidation reduction conditions 20 meanwhile the dissolution of metals can result in the loss of catalytic adsorption capability and reusability on ldh 21 however according to a prior study the hybrid composite go mg al ldh can boost ldh stability by immobilizing it in go while also enhancing composite separability 19 in addition their research showed that the go in ldh considerably improved its uranium adsorption performance a few researchers were used various metal hydrate go hybrid composites for the removal of cd ii 22 25 but they still face obstacles such as low surface area low efficiency and complicated post processing making their practical use for water treatment less feasible therefore the development of a stable adsorbent based on layered hydroxide go hybrids for sustainable remediation of heavy metals in this study mgfe ldh is composited with go in order to improve separability along with enhanced adsorptive removal of cd ii from actual wastewater sample and compared with previous studies which is not reported previously as of our best of awareness in this study mgfe ldh and go composites were synthesized and characterized using xps ft ir sem and xrd techniques batch type adsorption and desorption procedures were used to study the influence of different environmental parameters kinetics ph amount of nanocomposite temperature etc on cd ii elimination by using synthesized mg fe ldh go nanocomposite in addition to adsorption desorption experiments and instrumental analysis such as xps was used to evaluate the possible interactions between cd ii and mg fe ldh go nanocomposite 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of mgfe ldh go nanocomposite a modified hummers technique was used to synthesize go from graphite flakes 26 the prepared go was used in the preparation of mgfe ldh go in a typical synthesis a calculated amount of graphene oxide go was placed in 25 ml of distilled water and dispersed using ultrasonication with high power for 1 h followed by adding the fe iii mg ii 2 1 m ratio precursors dissolved in distilled water and swirled for a clear solution then 3 m naoh solution was added dropwise and continuously stirred for 6 h at 60 c after the reaction was completed the obtained mixture was allowed to cool naturally to 25 c and then the obtained precipitate was washed with distilled h2o and c2h5oh for multiple times to eliminate any undesired contaminants before being dried overnight at 60 c to yield the mgfe ldh go 2 2 characterization of materials different instruments and detailed methodologies used for the characterization of materials in this study are provided in the electronic supplementary information section 2 3 batch type adsorption experiments to prevent determined errors triplicate cd ii adsorption assays for mgfe ldh go hybrids m v 0 5 g l were performed using 0 01 m nano3 solutions in falcon vials at ph 6 by adding a few drops of 0 1 m hcl or naoh to the samples the ph was adjusted the hybrid was separated from the water phase after reaching equilibrium using 0 45 μm nylon membrane filters to look into the impact of coexisting cations na k ca2 and mg2 concentration in the range of 1 100 mg l batch sorption experiments were performed at ph 6 0 by using initial cd ii concentration of 10 mg l and mgfe ldh go concentration of 0 5 g l upon equilibrium after 120 min samples were collected and analysed for metal ion concentrations to test the adsorption isotherm of cd ii different solutions with various amounts of metal ion 10 300 mg l were prepared the thermodynamics efficacy of metal ion adsorption on mgfe ldh go was also investigated at different temperatures in the range of 298 323 k at ph 6 different parameters such as concentration of nanocomposite 0 1 1 0 g l time 5 360 min and temperature 298 323 k were studied for cd ii adsorption the amount of cd ii in supernatant solution was measured by means of icp oes analysis the difference in concentration levels between the initial and allowed to equilibrate is used to calculate the amount of cd ii loaded on the mgfe ldh go hybrid 2 4 desorption experiments to evaluate the recyclability of the mgfe ldh go it was tested with various desorbing agents including hno3 hcl h2so4 naoh of each with 0 1 m in six adsorption desorption cycle periods after adding a 50 ml known amount of each prepared testing acid to each falcon tube containing cd ii loaded adsorbent 19 5 mg of cd ii g of mgfe ldh go the tubes were rotated for 3 h to ensure complete desorption of cd ii among all tested desorbing agents hno3 shows good desorption ability above 95 for cd ii following that different concentrations 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 m of hno3 acid were used to achieve high efficiency in cd ii desorption from mgfe ldh go but the results revealed that 0 1 m hno3 was the most effective in each final cycle the recovered mgfe ldh go was thoroughly washed twice with milli q water and isolated by a magnet to remove any residual ions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mgfe ldh go nanocomposite fig 1 a depicts the powder xrd patterns of go and mgfe ldh go the characteristic reflection of go is the peak at 2θ 11 7 13 is shifted to 9 17o upon conjugation of mgfe ldh with go the reflections ascribed to ldh structure are presented at 2θ 31 7 45 48 56 43 and 66 66 for mgfe ldh go respectively 21 this observation verifies the successful synthesis of mgfe ldh on graphene sheets the broad scan xps spectra of go and mgfe ldh go composites are shown in fig 1 b the o 1s 535 ev and c 1s 285 ev peaks represent the intrinsic constituents of go 27 the xps analysis results provided the most notable signals corresponding to mg 1s 1300 ev fe 2p 720 ev along with o 1s and c 1s components this finding indicates that the occurrence of fe and mg components in mgfe ldh go composite the presence of numerous oxygen containing molecules including organic oxygen o in coo co and c o c functional groups and inorganic oxygen o in m o or m oh was inferred by the xps spectrum s high intensity and wide o 1s peaks 28 the sem images fig 2 a b of mgfe ldh go found that the plate like structure with even shapes and lamellar aggregates the tem images revealed plate like mgfe ldh platelets with 158

composites had bet specific surface area and average pore size of 223 m2 g and 2 6 nm respectively fig s1 the presence of numerous oxygen containing functional groups in mgfe ldh go composites was revealed by using ft ir analysis fig s2 depicts the ft ir spectra of go and mgfe ldh go graphene oxide sample showed ir absorption peaks at 3340 1645 1429 1223 and 1067 cm 1 assigned to the stretching vibrations of the oh co o c o c o c and co functional groups respectively the peaks due to oh co o c o and c o c functional groups altered to 3382 1635 and 1450 cm 1 revealing that mgfe ldh platelets are conjugated to surface of graphene oxide via functional groups containing oxygen the metal hydroxides were responsible for the 528 cm 1 peak the 528 cm 1 band might be associated to mg o mg or fe o mg lattice vibrations 21 3 2 kinetic and isotherms studies the kinetics and isotherms of cd ii uptake over mgfe ldh go nanocomposite are depicted in fig 3 a and 3 b respectively as shown in fig 3 a a substantial increase in cd ii adsorption over mgfe ldh go nanocomposite was observed within 120 min of reaction time the mgfe ldh go composite showed adsorption capacity around 99 94 and 85 of cd ii in 10 25 and 50 mg l solutions respectively non linear pseudo first order eq 1 29 pseudo second order eq 2 30 elovich eq 3 31 and weber morris eq 4 32 dynamic models were used to fit the experimental

is the desorption constant of elovich kinetic kid mg g min1 2 is the rate constant of the weber morris intra particle diffusion model and c mg g is a constant associated with the thickness of the boundary layer where a higher value of c corresponds to a greater effect on the limiting boundary layer the table 1 displays the kinetic parameters derived from four dynamic models fitting to the cd ii kinetic data fig 3 a the good fit of dynamic model evaluated using correlation determination coefficient r2 and closeness of predicted qe cal values with experimental qe exp as showed in table 1 the pseudo second order kinetic model can effectively predict the cd ii removal kinetics over mgfe ldh go composite with good correlation values r2 1 when comparing the other dynamic models tested which was consistent with prior investigations 19 further a suitability of second order dynamic model was confirmed from the closeness in experimental qe exp and model predicted qe model uptake capacity of mgfe ldh go for cd ii these results are suggesting that the dynamic cd ii uptake process over mgfe ldh go surface is following rate limiting kinetics further the high values of intra particle diffusion constant c suggesting that the adsorption kinetics are highly influenced by the limiting boundary layer 33 fig 3 b shows the non linear fitting of isotherm models langmuir 34 freundlich 35 and temkin 36 for cd ii isotherm data and table 2 shows the relative parameters computed from the three models the suitability of isotherm fit of experimental data was evaluated using

resultant high correlation coefficient of determination value r2 1 and the low values of pearson s chi square measured error χ 2 and hybrid fractional error suggesting that the langmuir well explained the cd ii uptake isotherm on to both mgfe ldh go and go among the three models tested the observed results also suggesting the cd ii uptake of go 99 15 mg l is much lower than compared to mgfe ldh go 174 83 mg l which is revealing that go conjugated mg and fe hydroxides species in mgfe ldh go are efficient enhanced for cd ii adsorption if the langmuir isotherm constant kl values are between 0 and 1 then the adsorption process is beneficial however if the kl values are more than 1 the process is unfavourable the results in the present investigation showing that all kl values measured for different temperatures 298 323 k are in 0 1 range indicating the favorable nature of cd ii adsorption over mgfe ldh go and go adsorbents this observation confirmed the major adsorption mechanism of cd ii removal via monolayer adsorption over mgfe ldh go composite surface the higher adsorption capability of mgfe ldh go can be explained by mgfe hydroxide s strong affinity for cd ii on the surface of mgfe ldh go which could produce inner sphere complexes and or coordinate with the functional groups oh cooh presented in go 8 it is possible that cd ii adsorption was caused by complexes formed between functional groups of go e g ocd and coo cd and or mgfe ldh mg fe oh cd the mgfe ions in mgfe ldh go filled cd ii binding sites also the presence of mg ii fe iii in ldh go could provide a positive charge to the adsorbent which can inhibit the adsorption of cd ii due to electrostatic repulsion 22 this study concluded that the ldh phases of mgfe ldh go contributed to cd ii sorption via direct surface complexation ion exchange electrostatic retention and precipitation 8 22 process the cd ii adsorption ability of the synthesized mgfe ldh go composite table 3 is compared with cd ii adsorption capabilities of various ldh based adsorbents and also go with different functional groups 14 22 25 from table 3 observed that the adsorption capacity of modified go with ldh shows high adsorption capacities even at low adsorbent dose however mgfe ldh go 0 5 g l nanocomposite synthesized in the present study shows high adsorption capacity compared to other ldh go materials reported in the literature majorly due to the unique surface properties including high surface area the presence of ldh terminal surface functional groups as well as free alcohol and carboxylic functional groups is suggested to be a probable reason for greater mgfe ldh go uptake capacity fig 3 b further clarifies that the functionalization of go with mgfe ldh improved the amount of adsorption capability 3 3 effect of ph and interfering ions the ph of the solution is a critical influencing factor which could alter the adsorption ability of adsorbent as the ionization of water is influenced by ph it could greatly influence the surface charge of adsorbent and the ph of the adsorbate influences the species distribution in solution fig 3 c shows that increase of ph of the solution increased the cd ii adsorption by the synthesized adsorbent the maximum adsorption reaches at ph 6 in lower ph 6 mgfe ldh go has a positive charge ldh go phzpc 6 5 and ionization water is inclined toward h ions as shown in fig 3 d the phzpc of adsorbent was measured by the well known electro chemical method reported elsewhere 39 the low cd ii adsorption is due to the electrostatic repulsive forces between mgfe ldh go and cd ii at high ph 6 the surface adsorbent becomes negative that leads to high adsorption of positive cd ii however for further studies ph 6 often for natural water was chosen as optimum in general many ions originated from different soluble salts present in wastewater and they can interfere with cd ii ion adsorption in this study different cations na k ca2 and mg2 were used for coexisting studies fig 3 e shows that na and k were not competed with cd ii to adsorb on the surface of mgfe ldh go when the interfering ion concentration in the range of 1 100 mg l however presence of ca2 98 5 and mg2 97 influenced cd ii adsorption slightly similarly influence of presence of anions such as no3 and so4 2 also studied and the results found that the no significant influence was observed on the removal of cd ii 3 4 thermodynamic analysis adsorption thermodynamic characteristics were examined at 298 323 k to determine the effect of temperature on cd ii removal capacity to calculate thermodynamic paraments van t hoff eq 8 plot used 8 ln k c h r 1 t s r where r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is in k k c is denoted thermodynamic equilibrium constant dimensionless is calculated using the eq 9 reported elsewhere 33 9 k c m w 55 5 1000 k l where the factor 55 5 is the number of moles of pure water per liter 1000 g l divided by 18 g mol and kl l mg is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant the molecular weight of the adsorbate cd ii mw g mol the predicted thermodynamic parameters are presented in table s1 the positive values of δh and the negative slope of the van t hoff equation in fig 3 f indicate that the cd ii adsorption process over the mgfe ldh go is endothermic the presence of a positive δs 129 12 j mol k indicates that cd ii variability rises during uptake process and the mgfe ldh go has a significant affinity for cd ii further the high value of δh 16 83 kj mol suggests that the adsorption process was involved chemical interactions the negative values of gibbs free energy indicate the spontaneity of the adsorption process 3 5 stability and efficacy of adsorbent for recovery and re use fig 4 a depicts the reuse tests for cd ii removal over mgfe ldh go hybrid each adsorption cycle study used 10 mg l of cd ii solution and 0 5 g l of mgfe ldh go adsorbent after the completion of each adsorption cycle mgfe ldh go was washed with 0 1 m hno3 solution to assist in the desorption of adsorbed cd ii ions after six cycles of adsorption desorption studies the maximum uptake ability of mgfe ldh go for cd ii was decreased from 19 82 to 10 45 mg g after the fourth cycle the adsorption capacity decreases because of the leaching of fe and mg from the ldh structure the synthesized mgfe ldh go nanocomposite exhibited consistent cd ii adsorption capacity up to four cycles indicating that it can be used in sustainable wastewater treatment without loss of its stability with maximum removal of cd ii the reuse investigations showed that mgfe ldh go nanocomposite could be used as an ecologically recyclable with excellent recovery ability and high removal capacity which is significant and novelty observed when compared to the previous reports 3 6 cd ii removal from real surface water the selected groundwater had the concentration of calcium 7 mg l sodium 9 mg l and potassium 1 4 mg l the stability tests were carried out using 0 5 g l of adsorbent 2 0 and 5 0 mg l of cd ii contaminated groundwater for both initial concentrations cd ii was entirely removed with around 99 efficiency as shown in fig 4 b according to the observed findings mgfe ldh go has the potential to absorb heavy metals from wastewater 3 7 plausible cd ii adsorption mechanism over mgfe ldh go composite the kinetics isotherms and thermodynamic results suggest that the adsorption process was carried out by chemical interaction between adsorbent and cd ii further it is evaluated and confirmed by spectroscopic studies here the xps spectra of the mgfe ldh go nanocomposite before mgfe ldh go and after mgfe ldh go cd ii adsorption were obtained to determine the mechanism of adsorbent adsorbate interaction the survey xps spectra of mgfe ldh go and mgfe ldh go cd ii are shown in fig 5 a for mgfe ldh go and mgfe ldh go cd ii the fe 2p 1 2 and fe 2p 3 2 peak was observed at the binding energy range of 711 0 725 0 ev 38 40 which are deconvoluted into six peaks fig 5b at 710 6 712 5 718 4 726 3 724 0 732 0 ev after adsorption the binding energy of the six peaks shifted to 710 2 712 3 717 5 725 9 723 8 732 5 ev respectively suggesting that the fe oxide is involved in the adsorption process the c 1s spectra for mgfe ldh go and mgfe ldh go cd ii fig 5 c were observed with few important differences the three deconvoluted c 1s peaks for mgfe ldh go are at binding energy of 284 5 285 8 and 288 8 ev while these peaks have appeared at 284 5 287 2 and 286 2 ev respectively for mgfe ldh go cd ii sample it is worth noting that the binding energies of the peaks changed because of cd ii adsorption the change suggests that lone pair electrons in co and co related groups might well be coordinated toward cd ii the overall c 1s peak intensity of mgfe ldh go cd ii and mgfe ldh go altered indicating that oxygen atoms bound to the carbon atoms during the cd ii adsorption the samples exhibited two mg 1s xps peaks as shown in fig 5 d and these two peaks could be assigned to mgo 1304 2 ev and mg oh 2 1303 6 ev the peak positions of both peaks shifted to lower binding energies at 1303 9 ev and 1303 1 ev after cd ii adsorption more importantly the cd 3d 5 2 and cd 3d 3 2 xps peaks were detected at 404 9 411 6 ev due to cd ii species 22 27 in the mgfe ldh go cd ii sample which are formed from the surface adsorbed cd ii the related high resolution cd 3d peak is depicted in fig s4 based on the observed xps results the plausible mechanism for cd ii adsorption can be described as the lone pair electrons in oxygen atoms bounded to carbon and mgfe ldh were directed toward cd ii to produce chemical interaction with mgfe ldh go and cd ii the proposed mechanism is compatible with kinetic and isotherm fittings as well as thermodynamic experiments 4 conclusions in conclusion mg fe ldh go nanocomposite with a high effective surface area 222 9 m2 g has been synthesized successfully the mgfe ldh go nanocomposite exhibited high cd ii removal ability to investigate the structure of the synthesized composite different characterization techniques were used the xrd and xps results revealed that the synthesized mgfe ldh go possessed the desired ldh structure and had a high purity the sem and tem results revealed the presence of nanosized platelets with size of 158 nm for mgfe ldh go composite the cd ii adsorption was characterized by pseudo second order kinetics indicating chemisorption the langmuir isotherm model fit with the equilibrium data and the results concluded that the chemisorption via homeomorphic surface induced precipitation and complex formation was used to control cd ii adsorption by the mgfe ldh go composite it was noticed that the mgfe ldh go composite had a better adsorption capacity and chemical stability for cd ii removal thermodynamic studies further concluded that the adsorption process is temperature favorable endothermic and chemisorption is predominated the xps studies concluded that the adsorption process of cd ii proceeded via the coordination chemical interaction of co c o related groups along with layered metal hydroxides on go the stability and recycling studies conclude that the as prepared mgfe ldh go sustainably re used for more than four cycles without losing its original capacity further the results of the utilization of the composite for industrial wastewater samples concluded that mgfe ldh go could successfully remove cd ii under optimized conditions declaration of competing interest the authors claim that they do

13058,heavy metal pollution in water is a major concern due to its bioaccumulation non biodegradability and high toxicity long term cadmium cd ii ion exposure could have an adverse impact on human health because natural water bodies contain cd ii pollution at low concentrations the treatment of cd ii polluted water should be treated as micro polluted water it is critical to develop an effective water purification procedure to remove cd ii from micro polluted water in the present research mgfe binary layered hydroxide graphene oxide mgfe ldh go nanocomposite was synthesized characterized and used for efficient cd ii adsorption the adsorption process was investigated in terms of ph influence kinetic behavior isotherm equilibrium curves and estimation of thermodynamic parameters the characterization results showed that mgfe ldh go which is composed of crystalline mgfe binary hydroxide and amorphous go structures has a considerable surface area 223 m2 g and has a plate like hexagonal structure with even forms and lamellar aggregates cd ii adsorption was favoured on the mgfe ldh go surface in neutral circumstances at 25 c the pseudo second order kinetic behavior was adequately described although the isotherm equilibrium curves fitted the langmuir isotherm with a high maximum uptake capacity of 174 83 mg g chemisorption controlled spontaneous and endothermic reactions occurred which was confirmed by thermodynamic studies further the surface interaction mechanism was investigated using the xps analysis of spent catalyst the mgfe ldh go nanocomposite is efficient to treat cd ii with a removal percentage of 99 it can be reused more than four times without losing its original capacity and stability overall the mgfe ldh go nanocomposite exhibited high potential to be utilized as an adsorbent for the removal of pollutants from actual contaminated water samples graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mgfe ldh go heavy metal adsorption surface mechanism recycling spectroscopic studies real water treatment 1 introduction environmental pollution due to heavy metal contamination has always lingered around since ages the intrinsic foster values of the environment for sustenance have been greatly affected the bioaccumulation of these non biodegradable heavy metals such as cadmium cd chromium cr mercury hg and lead pb etc has not only threatened the aquatic sphere of the earth but also affected human lives even at low concentrations cd is a very hazardous heavy metal to humans and the environment 1 hence there is a dire need for remediation of heavy metals particularly those which impact the drinking groundwater sources the traditional techniques of environmental remediation including chemical precipitation flocculation ion exchange and electrochemical removal have limitations such as ineffective heavy metal removal substantial by product output and expensive operational costs 2 3 all of these appear to be insufficient in offering solutions particularly in developing nations where capital costs are high by considering the above methods technical and socio economic disadvantages the adsorptive methods are considered with biological and nanotechnological approaches 4 5 which is a common method to remove heavy metals from water metal oxide and biopolymer based hybrid adsorbents have gotten a lot of attention because of their efficacy use and renewability through suitable desorption methods 6 8 from these studies it is also understood that the adsorbent is the key to the success of adsorption operation in recent decades graphene oxide go widely used for wastewater treatment because oxygen containing functional groups become like an anchor for adsorbing heavy metals onto their surface and enable go dispersibility in many solvents especially in water 4 furthermore the possession of a large surface area of graphene oxide sheets provides abundant space for the metal ion to be adsorbed 9 10 go is difficult to separate from aqueous solutions due to its great dispensability in the water in this context many researchers had proven modified graphene oxide with other composites are effective for the efficient adsorptive treatment of large volumes of contaminated groundwater and improve its separability 11 14 additionally it was reported that modification of go surface could improve its utilization in the industrial water treatment 15 thus the hybrid composite material layered double hydroxide ldh go was developed to improve go separability and cd removal ability in this study ldh is well known layered structured material with hexagonal divalent mii and trivalent miii metal ions and polyatomic anions a around it 16 18 because of its anions exchangeable ability ldh can be considered a good adsorbent in environmental clean up 19 however ldh can be decomposed inevitably under acidic conditions and oxidation reduction conditions 20 meanwhile the dissolution of metals can result in the loss of catalytic adsorption capability and reusability on ldh 21 however according to a prior study the hybrid composite go mg al ldh can boost ldh stability by immobilizing it in go while also enhancing composite separability 19 in addition their research showed that the go in ldh considerably improved its uranium adsorption performance a few researchers were used various metal hydrate go hybrid composites for the removal of cd ii 22 25 but they still face obstacles such as low surface area low efficiency and complicated post processing making their practical use for water treatment less feasible therefore the development of a stable adsorbent based on layered hydroxide go hybrids for sustainable remediation of heavy metals in this study mgfe ldh is composited with go in order to improve separability along with enhanced adsorptive removal of cd ii from actual wastewater sample and compared with previous studies which is not reported previously as of our best of awareness in this study mgfe ldh and go composites were synthesized and characterized using xps ft ir sem and xrd techniques batch type adsorption and desorption procedures were used to study the influence of different environmental parameters kinetics ph amount of nanocomposite temperature etc on cd ii elimination by using synthesized mg fe ldh go nanocomposite in addition to adsorption desorption experiments and instrumental analysis such as xps was used to evaluate the possible interactions between cd ii and mg fe ldh go nanocomposite 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of mgfe ldh go nanocomposite a modified hummers technique was used to synthesize go from graphite flakes 26 the prepared go was used in the preparation of mgfe ldh go in a typical synthesis a calculated amount of graphene oxide go was placed in 25 ml of distilled water and dispersed using ultrasonication with high power for 1 h followed by adding the fe iii mg ii 2 1 m ratio precursors dissolved in distilled water and swirled for a clear solution then 3 m naoh solution was added dropwise and continuously stirred for 6 h at 60 c after the reaction was completed the obtained mixture was allowed to cool naturally to 25 c and then the obtained precipitate was washed with distilled h2o and c2h5oh for multiple times to eliminate any undesired contaminants before being dried overnight at 60 c to yield the mgfe ldh go 2 2 characterization of materials different instruments and detailed methodologies used for the characterization of materials in this study are provided in the electronic supplementary information section 2 3 batch type adsorption experiments to prevent determined errors triplicate cd ii adsorption assays for mgfe ldh go hybrids m v 0 5 g l were performed using 0 01 m nano3 solutions in falcon vials at ph 6 by adding a few drops of 0 1 m hcl or naoh to the samples the ph was adjusted the hybrid was separated from the water phase after reaching equilibrium using 0 45 μm nylon membrane filters to look into the impact of coexisting cations na k ca2 and mg2 concentration in the range of 1 100 mg l batch sorption experiments were performed at ph 6 0 by using initial cd ii concentration of 10 mg l and mgfe ldh go concentration of 0 5 g l upon equilibrium after 120 min samples were collected and analysed for metal ion concentrations to test the adsorption isotherm of cd ii different solutions with various amounts of metal ion 10 300 mg l were prepared the thermodynamics efficacy of metal ion adsorption on mgfe ldh go was also investigated at different temperatures in the range of 298 323 k at ph 6 different parameters such as concentration of nanocomposite 0 1 1 0 g l time 5 360 min and temperature 298 323 k were studied for cd ii adsorption the amount of cd ii in supernatant solution was measured by means of icp oes analysis the difference in concentration levels between the initial and allowed to equilibrate is used to calculate the amount of cd ii loaded on the mgfe ldh go hybrid 2 4 desorption experiments to evaluate the recyclability of the mgfe ldh go it was tested with various desorbing agents including hno3 hcl h2so4 naoh of each with 0 1 m in six adsorption desorption cycle periods after adding a 50 ml known amount of each prepared testing acid to each falcon tube containing cd ii loaded adsorbent 19 5 mg of cd ii g of mgfe ldh go the tubes were rotated for 3 h to ensure complete desorption of cd ii among all tested desorbing agents hno3 shows good desorption ability above 95 for cd ii following that different concentrations 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 m of hno3 acid were used to achieve high efficiency in cd ii desorption from mgfe ldh go but the results revealed that 0 1 m hno3 was the most effective in each final cycle the recovered mgfe ldh go was thoroughly washed twice with milli q water and isolated by a magnet to remove any residual ions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mgfe ldh go nanocomposite fig

ascribed to ldh structure are presented at 2θ 31 7 45 48 56 43 and 66 66 for mgfe ldh go respectively 21 this observation verifies the successful synthesis of mgfe ldh on graphene sheets the broad scan xps spectra of go and mgfe ldh go composites are shown in fig 1 b the o 1s 535 ev and c 1s 285 ev peaks represent the intrinsic constituents of go 27 the xps analysis results provided the most notable signals corresponding to mg 1s 1300 ev fe 2p 720 ev along with o 1s and c 1s components this finding indicates that the occurrence of fe and mg components in mgfe ldh go composite the presence of numerous oxygen containing molecules including organic oxygen o in coo co and c o c functional groups and inorganic oxygen o in m o or m oh was inferred by the xps spectrum s high intensity and wide o 1s peaks 28 the sem images fig 2 a b of mgfe ldh go found that the plate like structure with even shapes and lamellar aggregates the tem images revealed plate like mgfe ldh platelets with 158

are conjugated to surface of graphene oxide via functional groups containing oxygen the metal hydroxides were responsible for the 528 cm 1 peak the 528 cm 1 band might be associated to mg o mg or fe o

the pseudo second order kinetic model can effectively predict the cd ii removal kinetics over mgfe ldh go composite with good correlation values r2 1 when comparing the other dynamic models tested which was consistent with prior investigations 19 further a suitability of second order dynamic model was confirmed from the closeness in experimental qe exp and model predicted qe model uptake capacity of mgfe ldh go for cd ii these results are suggesting that the dynamic cd ii uptake process over mgfe ldh go surface is following rate limiting kinetics further the high values of intra

observed on the removal of cd ii 3 4 thermodynamic analysis adsorption thermodynamic characteristics were examined at 298 323 k to determine the effect of temperature on cd ii removal capacity to calculate thermodynamic paraments van t hoff eq 8 plot used 8 ln k c h r 1 t s r where r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is in k k c is denoted thermodynamic equilibrium constant dimensionless is calculated using the eq 9 reported elsewhere 33 9 k c m w 55 5 1000 k l where the factor 55 5 is the number of moles of pure water per liter 1000 g l divided by 18 g mol and kl l mg is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant the molecular weight of the adsorbate cd ii mw g mol the predicted thermodynamic parameters are presented in table s1 the positive values of δh and the negative slope of the van t hoff equation in fig 3 f indicate that the cd ii adsorption process over the mgfe ldh go is endothermic the presence of a positive δs 129 12 j mol k indicates that cd ii variability rises during uptake process and the mgfe ldh go has a significant affinity for cd ii further the high value of δh 16 83 kj mol suggests that the adsorption process was involved chemical interactions the negative values of gibbs free energy indicate the spontaneity of the adsorption process 3 5 stability and efficacy of adsorbent for recovery and re use fig 4 a depicts the reuse tests for cd ii removal over mgfe ldh go hybrid each adsorption cycle study used 10 mg l of cd ii solution and 0 5 g l of mgfe ldh go adsorbent after the completion of each adsorption cycle mgfe ldh go was washed with 0 1 m hno3 solution to assist in the desorption of adsorbed cd ii ions after six cycles of adsorption desorption studies the maximum uptake ability of mgfe ldh go for cd ii was decreased from 19 82 to 10 45 mg g after the fourth cycle the adsorption capacity decreases because of the leaching of fe and mg from the ldh structure the synthesized mgfe ldh go nanocomposite exhibited consistent cd ii adsorption capacity up to four cycles indicating that it can be used in sustainable wastewater treatment without loss of its stability with maximum removal of cd ii the reuse investigations showed that mgfe ldh go nanocomposite could be used as an ecologically recyclable with excellent recovery ability and high removal capacity which is significant and novelty observed when compared to the previous reports 3 6 cd ii removal from real surface water the selected groundwater had the concentration of calcium 7 mg l sodium 9 mg l and potassium 1 4 mg l the stability tests were carried out using 0 5 g l of adsorbent 2 0 and 5 0 mg l of cd ii contaminated groundwater for both initial concentrations cd ii was entirely removed with around 99 efficiency as shown in fig 4 b according to the observed findings mgfe ldh go has the potential to absorb heavy metals from wastewater 3 7 plausible cd ii adsorption mechanism over mgfe ldh go composite the kinetics isotherms and thermodynamic results suggest that the adsorption process was carried out by chemical interaction between adsorbent and cd ii further it is evaluated and confirmed by spectroscopic studies here the xps spectra of the mgfe ldh go nanocomposite before mgfe ldh go and after mgfe ldh go cd ii adsorption were obtained to determine the mechanism of adsorbent adsorbate interaction the survey xps spectra of mgfe ldh go and mgfe ldh go cd ii are shown in fig 5 a for mgfe ldh go and mgfe ldh go cd ii the fe 2p 1 2 and fe 2p 3 2 peak was observed at the binding energy range of 711 0 725 0 ev 38 40 which are deconvoluted into six peaks fig 5b at 710 6 712 5 718 4 726 3 724 0 732 0 ev after adsorption the binding energy of the six peaks shifted to 710 2 712 3 717 5 725 9 723 8 732 5 ev respectively suggesting that the fe oxide is involved in the adsorption process the c 1s spectra for mgfe ldh go and mgfe ldh go cd ii fig 5 c were observed with few important differences the three deconvoluted c 1s peaks for mgfe ldh go are at binding energy of 284 5 285 8 and 288 8 ev while these peaks have appeared at 284 5 287 2 and 286 2 ev respectively for mgfe ldh go cd ii sample it is worth noting that the binding energies of the peaks changed because of cd ii adsorption the change suggests that lone pair electrons in co and co related groups might well be coordinated toward cd ii the overall c 1s peak intensity of mgfe ldh go cd ii and mgfe ldh go altered indicating that oxygen atoms bound to the carbon atoms during the cd ii adsorption the samples exhibited two mg 1s xps peaks as shown in fig 5 d and these two peaks could be assigned to mgo 1304 2 ev and mg oh 2 1303 6 ev the peak positions of both peaks shifted to lower binding energies at 1303 9 ev and 1303 1 ev after cd ii adsorption more importantly the cd 3d 5 2 and cd 3d 3 2 xps peaks were detected at 404 9 411 6 ev due to cd ii species 22 27 in the mgfe ldh go cd ii sample which are formed from the surface adsorbed cd ii the related high resolution cd 3d peak is depicted in fig s4 based on the observed xps results the plausible mechanism for cd ii adsorption can be described as the lone pair electrons in oxygen atoms bounded to carbon and mgfe ldh were directed toward cd ii to produce chemical interaction with mgfe ldh go and cd ii the proposed mechanism is compatible with kinetic and isotherm fittings as well as thermodynamic experiments 4 conclusions in conclusion mg fe ldh go nanocomposite with a high effective surface area 222 9 m2 g has been synthesized successfully the mgfe ldh go nanocomposite exhibited high cd ii removal ability to investigate the structure of the synthesized composite different characterization techniques were used the xrd and xps results revealed that the synthesized mgfe ldh go possessed the desired ldh structure and had a high purity the sem and tem results revealed the presence of nanosized platelets with size of 158 nm for mgfe ldh go composite the cd ii adsorption was characterized by pseudo second order kinetics indicating chemisorption the langmuir isotherm model fit with the equilibrium data and the results concluded that the chemisorption via homeomorphic surface induced precipitation and complex formation was used to control cd ii adsorption by the mgfe ldh go composite it was noticed that the mgfe ldh go composite had a better adsorption capacity and chemical stability for cd ii removal thermodynamic studies further concluded that the adsorption process is temperature favorable endothermic and chemisorption is predominated the xps studies concluded that the adsorption process of cd ii proceeded via the coordination chemical interaction of co c o related groups along with layered metal hydroxides on go the stability and recycling studies conclude that the as prepared mgfe ldh go sustainably re used for more than four cycles without losing its original capacity further the results of the utilization of the composite for industrial wastewater samples concluded that mgfe ldh go could successfully remove cd ii under optimized conditions declaration of competing interest the authors claim that they do

13059,in this work the influence of the matrix on the photolytic activation of peroxymonosulfate pms and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been studied for the inactivation of enterococcus sp additionally two different reactor configurations batch reactor and tubular reactor have been evaluated that achieve complete disinfection within 120 min when using a tubular reactor three water matrices distilled water saline solution and simulated wastewater have been studied and experiments have been carried out using radical scavengers to determine the main reactive species involved in each process the hydroxyl radical oh has been found to be the main responsible for the inactivation of bacteria in distilled water while chlorinated species generated during treatments are responsible for disinfection in a saline matrix the study of the influence of various inorganic ions br f po4 3 no3 no2 on treatments revealed an increase in the efficacy of the pms uv a system in the presence of br due to the bromine generation furthermore the effect of f has been studied for the first time determining that the presence of this compound does not have a significant influence on the h2o2 uv a system while inhibiting pms uv a treatment overall the results suggest that h2o2 based treatments would be less dependent on matrix composition than those involving pms and the presence of nitrites is a contraindication to the application of either process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords advanced oxidation processes enterococcus sp inorganic anions persulfates uv activation 1 introduction due to climate change and population growth approximately two thirds of the population experience severe water shortages for at least one month a year and by 2050 this number will continue to rise so that 52 of the world s population will be at risk 1 this has led researchers and governments to focus on finding alternative water sources to reduce water stress allowing higher quality water to be reserved for human consumption although one of the solutions that have attracted the most attention is the reuse of reclaimed wastewater it is estimated that more than 80 of the wastewater ww generated on the planet is discharged into the natural environment without adequate prior treatment according to the united nations world water development report 2018 2 this entails the introduction into the aqueous medium of many highly harmful contaminants chemical physical and biological which pose a risk not only for biodiversity but also for human health several studies have demonstrated the presence of various contaminants in the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp revealing that some pollutants are recalcitrant to conventional treatments 3 4 pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria viruses fungi etc are one of the most common pollutants present in wastewater 5 9 regulations generally determine which species of microorganisms should be used as indicator microorganisms this is the case of escherichia coli a bacteria frequently used as an indicator of faecal contamination 10 however previous studies have shown that enterococcus sp might be more resistant to some disinfection treatments 11 13 therefore this species may be more appropriate as an indicator in the study of advanced oxidation processes aops as they may not be correctly assessed by less resistant microbiological indicators although chlorination and ozonation are the most well established and commonly used disinfection techniques today 14 these techniques have some drawbacks the most important is the formation of disinfection by products dbps that can be a threat to human health 15 such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haa and bromate dbps are mainly formed by the reaction of the reagents used as a disinfectant with the organic matter present in the water therefore if disinfection is to be implemented as a tertiary treatment in a wastewater treatment plant the risk of formation of these compounds is very high as the effluent to be treated may still contain a high concentration of organic matter 16 this requires the development of new disinfection techniques that can be used in these cases to provide the quality necessary to ensure safe reuse in this context aops have been demonstrated to be a great alternative to conventional treatments aops consist of the generation of highly reactive free radicals capable of degrading organic molecules while inactivating microorganisms 17 20 the hydroxyl radical oh generated from hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been commonly used as an oxidizing agent in aops due to its high redox potential 1 8 2 7 v 21 22 however sulfate radicals so4 also appear to be a great alternative as they have a redox potential 2 5 3 1 v equal to or greater than oh 23 so4 can be generated through the activation of various oxidizing compounds with peroxymonosulfate pms one of the most widely used together with sodium or potassium peroxydisulfate pds pms is commercially available as oxone a triple potassium salt highly unstable facilitating its reaction with other compounds and several studies have highlighted its disinfection efficacy over pds 24 25 many different methods can be used to activate pms and h2o2 for the generation of radicals such as radiation homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis heat or ultrasound 26 27 within uv radiation uv c emission is one of the most widely used methods in aops however several authors have reported good efficacy in treatments that combine uv a radiation with h2o2 28 29 or pms 11 30 although most of these studies combine radiation with other activation methods such as iron for photo fenton processes its efficacy is worth exploring as a single activation method despite the many advantages of aops several studies have revealed that one of the drawbacks of these processes is that their effectiveness is highly affected by the composition of the aqueous matrix 31 32 the presence of components such as organic matter or carbonates has been widely investigated 31 since they may act as inhibitors of treatments since they are scavengers of free radical species 33 however some water constituents have been reported to promote parallel reactions that could accelerate degradation processes 34 consequently individual matrix components can affect water treatment processes depending on the nature of the target pollutant the dissolved compounds or the chemicals involved in the treatment process 31 34 35 the main objective of this work is to study the influence of the water matrix on the photolytic activation of h2o2 and pms applied to the inactivation of enterococcus sp in water streams in addition two different reactor configurations have been compared to determine which is the most efficient in terms of radiation distribution the influence of the matrix has been evaluated by comparing three aqueous matrices with different compositions distilled water saline solution and simulated wastewater the influence of five inorganic anions br f po4 3 no3 no2 whose effects on aops have been less explored so far has been studied in this work finally experiments have been carried out using scavengers to identify the main radicals involved in the inactivation of bacteria in the proposed scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 aqueous matrix three aqueous matrices with different levels of complexity have been used throughout the study the simplest matrix being distilled water dw a saline solution ss with a sodium chloride concentration nacl scharlau concentration of 0 9 has also been used and finally to test the viability of treatment in a more complex matrix some experiments were carried out using simulated wastewater sww the composition of sww was meat peptone scharlau 160 mg l meat extract scharlau 110 mg l urea scharlau co nh2 2 30 mg l nacl scharlau 7 mg l cacl2 2h2o scharlau 4 mg l mgso4

enterococcus sp see section 2 3 other reagents have been used throughout the experiments treatments were carried out using different doses 0 01 1 5 mm of potassium peroxymonosulfate 2khso5 khso4 k2so4 pms oxone sigma aldrich and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 in water chem lab furthermore furfuryl alcohol ffa c5h6o2 aldrich tert butyl alcohol tba c4h10o scharlau and methanol meoh ch3oh chem lab have been used as radical scavengers in a molar ratio of 20 1 scavenger oxidant tests have been carried out to ensure that these concentrations are not harmful to enterococcus sp other reagents used during

acid h2so4 jt baker 2 3 bacterial preparation and analysis wild strains of enterococcus sp previously isolated from real wastewater and stored in cryovials in a freezer were used in this study to contaminate the water samples to activate frozen bacteria the content of a cryovial 0 5 ml was inoculated in 50 ml of luria bertani broth scharlau spain and incubated for 24 h 37 c after this time the broth was divided into two 50 ml falcon tubes 25 ml of broth in each one and centrifugated for 15 mins at 4200 rpm to ensure complete separation of bacteria from the feeding broth once the supernatant was discarded the pellets were resuspended in the same volume of saline solution nacl 0 9 and stored in the fridge for later use to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments the culture and enumeration of the bacteria were carried out mainly using the drop plate method 38 through a 10 fold serial dilution in sterile saline solution nacl 0 9 however the spread plate method standard method 9215c 39 was also used to increase the detection limit dl when needed the samples were plated on slanetz bartley agar scharlau spain and the colonies formed were counted after 48 h of incubation at 37 c the number of colonies was expressed as colony forming units per ml cfu ml and the detection limit was 10 cfu ml and 100 cfu ml when using the spread plate method or the drop plate method respectively analyses were performed in triplicate and the standard deviation of the results was calculated 2 4 experimental setup in this study two different reactor configurations have been assessed the optimizations of pms and h2o2 were carried out in a 500 ml batch reactor agitated with a magnetic stirrer two black light lamps philips tl 6 w 365 nm were placed over the reactor at a distance such that the radiation on the water surface was 8 5 w m 2 since the position of the lamps in this configuration is not fixed the irradiance was checked before each experiment using an hd 2102 1 portable luxmeter delta ohm to ensure that the radiation intensity at the surface was constant in all experiments the rest of the experiments were carried out in a tubular reactor with continuous recirculation and a total volume of 1 l the illumination of this reactor was provided by a black light lamp located on the axis and according to the illuminated volume 0 252 l 25 2 of the total water sample and the flow rate 1 2 l min 1 the uv a contact time was 12 6 s for more detail photographs of both reactors have been included in the supplementary material fig s1 for all experiments the water sample was inoculated with enterococcus sp so that the initial concentration of cultivable bacteria was 8 105 1 106 cfu ml and the necessary concentrations of reagents were added the experiments lasted 120 min and were carried out at natural ph 6 the temperature of the water varied between 26 c and 30 c due to the slight heating caused by the recirculating pump however no impact of this variability was observed during the experiments to determine incident radiation reaching water during treatments ferrioxalate actinometry experiments were carried out using dw both in batch and tubular reactors following the procedure described elsewhere 37 in addition free chlorine generation was monitored using a multiparameter photometer hanna hi83399 together with the hi93701 f reagent kit of the same brand in order to compare inactivation under various conditions pseudo first order rate constants k min 1 were estimated by linear regression fitting a synergistic factor was calculated to evaluate the synergistic effect 40 following eq 1 1 s k oxidant uv a k oxidant k uv a 3 results 3 1 photolytic activation of pms and h2o2 the inactivation of enterococcus sp was studied over time for different concentrations of pms and h2o2 in a batch reactor with the incidence of uv a radiation and the results were plotted in fig 1 for optimization dw samples were used as the aqueous matrix uv a radiation alone was not able to inactivate the microorganisms present in the medium but once pms was added the elimination of enterococcus sp began to increase fig 1a inactivation was practically negligible for a pms dose of 0 01 mm obtaining a disinfection rate of 0 33 log after 120 min of irradiation however by increasing the concentration of oxidants to 0 05 mm and 0 1 mm the disinfection rate increased to 1 2 log and 4 3 log for the same time higher doses of oxidant led to complete inactivation of the bacteria in less than 15 min considering that when the detection limit had been reached non activated pms has been stated to have some disinfection capacity 41 so dark experiments were carried out no significant inactivation was observed for the doses assessed data not shown the same procedure was carried out for hydrogen peroxide fig 1b but none of the concentrations applied had a significant effect on the bacteria population however according to other authors a dose of h2o2 of 1 5 mm 51 mg l 1 when fenton like methods are used is sufficient for microorganism inactivation 42 43 this could indicate that uv a radiation is not capable of activating the oxidant to generate radicals that attack the bacteria present in the water under the experimental conditions tested since the treatment is carried out in distilled water there are no particles in the medium that scatter light or organic matter that absorbs it so the reason that the radiation does not have the desired effect could be that incident radiation is not sufficient to activate h2o2 a concentration of 1 5 mm h2o2 and a concentration of 0 05 mm pms were chosen and the same treatments were carried out in a tubular reactor to check whether a different reactor and light distribution could improve the inactivation of enterococcus sp in this new arrangement the lamp was placed on the central axis of the reactor surrounded by the fluid so a better light distribution is expected than in previous experiments in which the lamp was placed over the reactor as expected greater bacteria inactivation was achieved in the tubular reactor with consequent higher disinfection rates fig 2b shows how when using the new configuration enterococcus sp inactivation reaches the detection limit after 120 min of h2o2 uv a treatment while elimination was almost non existent in the batch reactor similarly the effectiveness of the pms uv a treatment improved increasing the disinfection rate from 1 2 log to complete inactivation after 120 min fig 2a as in the batch configuration the effect of uv a radiation alone on the bacterial population was studied concluding that the amount of radiation emitted by the lamps is not sufficient to inactivate enterococcus sp an increase in the disinfectant power of the non activated reagents was observed the disinfection rate achieved by pms and h2o2 was 1 68 and 0 55 log respectively this may be due to a higher decomposition of the compounds as a consequence of the more aggressive agitation generated by the passage of the liquid through the feed pump the synergy factor s of the combination of reagents and ultraviolet visible uv a radiation was calculated for which it was first necessary to calculate the pseudo first order kinetic constant table s1 supplementary material shows the inactivation rate constants obtained as well as the s calculated for the two treatments in the two configurations as expected the highest s was obtained for the h2o2 uv a system in the tubular reactor 11 90 while no interaction between the two treatment elements was observed for the batch configuration the difference between the s values obtained for the pms uv a system is smaller although the tubular reactor also favours synergy in this treatment experimental results showed that by changing the reactor configuration used for the treatment higher efficiencies can be obtained using the same reagent dose although it is possible to deduce that this is due as mentioned above to a better distribution of the radiation actinometry experiments have been carried out in both the batch reactor and the tubular reactor to quantify the total incident radiation fig 3 shows fe2 formation versus time during the two actinometric reactions the results were linearly fitted to obtain the slope and in order to calculate the incident radiation flux it was divided by the quantum yield of ferrioxalate actinometry which is known but is dependent on wavelength goldstein et al 2008 estimated this parameter in the range of 205 365 nm obtaining a weighted average value for the emission spectrum of the lamps used in this work of 1 273 mol einstein 44 the incident radiation calculated for the tubular reactor was 2 23 10 6 einstein l 1 s 1 while this value was 1 19 10 6 einstein l 1 s 1 for the batch reactor despite using two lamps this improvement in treatment efficiency may be due to two different phenomena the first one is a better activation of the oxidants due to higher incident radiation the bond dissociation energy of hydrogen peroxide has been estimated to be between 44 1 and 50 72 kcal mol 1 184 51 212 kj ml 1 45 on the other hand there is no reference value for the pms bond energy although it has been estimated to be lower than that of h2o2 46 this could explain why there is some activation of pms when using a batch configuration but not of h2o2 on the other hand although radiation alone has been shown to be not capable of inactivating microorganisms it could have sufficient power to weaken their structure and promote slight oxidative damage 47 facilitating their subsequent inactivation when reagents are added either by direct oxidation or through generated radicals in either case actinometry results corroborate that by using a tubular reactor the greater efficiency of the treatment is a consequence of the fact that this configuration can maximise incident radiation flux therefore this configuration was selected as optimal for the rest of the experiments 3 2 effect of the matrix the selected doses of pms and h2o2 from the optimization phase section 3 1 were applied to various aqueous matrices gradually increasing the complexity of the medium for this a saline solution and simulated wastewater were used the saline solution used has a concentration of 9 g l 1 although municipal wastewater generally has a lower salt content 0 5 g l 1 saline wastewater can occur for a variety of reasons such as leaks from landfills or in response to seawater infiltration into sewer systems which is a common problem during storm surge flooding in coastal areas 48 on the other hand it should not be forgotten that nacl concentrations of up to 760 mm can be found in industrial wastewater 49 the concentration of salt ions in inorganic industries ranges from 1 5 to 11 g l 1 and the concentration of total dissolved solids tds can range between 48 and 100 g l 1 depending on the industrial process 50 bacteria are well acclimatised to media with a salinity of up to 10 g l 1 and their survival in more concentrated media is difficult 48 finally it should be noted that the use of a saline concentration of 9 g l 1 is very common in microbiological analyzes to avoid cell death as a consequence of the osmotic difference between the inside and outside of the cell therefore it is important to get insight about the effects of this salt concentration in terms of nacl on the studied disinfection processes fig 4a shows that the inactivation of microorganisms was complete in 5 min when the pms uv a system was applied in saline solution it has been stated that pms reacts with chlorine generating hclo cl2 species eqs 2 3 51 responsible for the inactivation of bacteria 20 52 to confirm the formation of free chlorine an experiment was carried out in which the free chlorine was monitored fig s2 supplementary material illustrates how the generation of free chlorine occurs linearly up to a concentration of 1 6 mg l considering that the initial sodium chloride concentration 9 g l 1 led to 5 46 g l of chlorine in the water 0 3 of the chlorine was transformed into free chlorine 2 c l hso 5 hclo so 4 2 3 c l h hclo h 2 o cl 2 on the other hand the optimized treatment in dw was not enough to inactivate enterococcus sp in the simulated wastewater only a 0 5 log reduction of the initial concentration was achieved after 120 min the higher complexity of the matrix frequently leads to lower degradation or inactivation rates and dissolved organic matter dom has a documented role as a sink for radicals 53 the synthetic wastewater used in this work has a dissolved organic carbon content of 100 mg l 36 which is responsible for inhibition of treatment in addition organic matter can absorb radiation in the uv a region thus also preventing the activation of the oxidant in addition to this the unstable nature of pms means that it can react rapidly with almost any component of the matrix 54 55 therefore the higher the complexity of the matrix the higher the degradation rate of pms leaving less available for activation by uv a previous studies have demonstrated that higher doses of pms would be needed to achieve bacterial inactivation under the same conditions 11 in fig 4b the efficiency of the h2o2 uv a system is compared in the three studied matrices complete inhibition of treatment was observed when applied in simulated wastewater as in the pms uv a system the presence of organic matter could be mainly responsible for inhibition of treatment by absorbing radiation quenching radicals and promoting h2o2 degradation also known for its unstable nature although cédat et al 2016 determined that the amount of h2o2 used in this work 1 5 mm is sufficient to remove estrogens 56 from wastewater uv c 254 nm was used in that study to activate h2o2 hydrogen peroxide has a much higher radiation absorption capacity in the uv c region than at the wavelength used in this work 57 which explains the difference in activation efficiency therefore a much higher radiation dose would be necessary to achieve the same effect the disinfection rates achieved in the saline matrix were similar to those obtained in dw with the disinfection kinetics slightly higher in ss in this matrix the detection limit was reached at 90 min compared to the 120 min needed to reach the same point when the treatment was applied in distilled water this differs from the reported results for the removal of organic pollutants the presence of cl has been shown to have inhibitory effects on the degradation of compounds such as amoxicillin 58 ofloxacin 59 or rhb dye 60 by acting as a scavenger for hydroxyl radicals eqs 4 5 61 however nihemaiti et al 2018 stated that the presence of chloride did not influence the degradation of trace organic chemicals 62 as the reaction between chloride and oh is reversible the rate constant of the forward reaction 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 being lower than that of the backward reaction 6 1 109 m 1 s 1 moreover the chlorine radical formed during these reactions may aid in this case the inactivation of enterococcus sp 4 oh cl cloh oh cl 5 cloh h cl h 2 o 3 3 enterococcus sp inactivation mechanisms 3 3 1 identification of main radical species to know more about reactive species involved in the inactivation process a set of experiments using radical scavengers has been conducted in dw and sww these experiments have not been carried out on real wastewater due to the low treatment performance achieved in the said matrix the use of scavengers is a good qualitative approach for the identification of free species however further analysis using more complex analytical technologies such as electron paramagnetic resonance epr should be performed to confirm the results meoh has been used as a scavenger for hydroxyl and sulfate radicals while tba has been used as a scavenger for hydroxyl radicals only furthermore singlet oxygen 1o2 can also play an important role in the elimination of pollutants in aops so ffa has been used as a scavenger of this species meoh is known to scavenge so4 and oh at a rate of 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 and 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 respectively 63 on the contrary tba reacts only with oh at a rate of 6 108 m 1 s 1 three orders of magnitude faster than so4 8 0 105 m 1 s 1 63 ffa reacts with 1o2 at a rate of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 but it should also be noted that ffa is also an efficient quencher for oh 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 thus if oh was the dominant reactive species tba and ffa should have similar inhibitory effects 64 all scavengers had a similar effect on the activation of pms in dw the efficiency of the treatment was reduced so that after two hours the concentration of microorganisms was only reduced by 1 2 log units fig 5a this shows that the oh radical is mainly responsible for bacterial inactivation in this scenario as it is the only radical that reacts with all the scavengers used however since inhibition is not complete there is part of the disinfection that is not due to the action of any of the radicals studied which could indicate the combination with non radical pathways qi et al 2020 obtained the same result when combining pms and uv a radiation for the inactivation of escherichia coli 65 some 53 consider the existence of nonradical mechanisms for the disinfection or degradation of contaminants as one of the advantages of using pms as these mechanisms are less sensitive to scavenging by organic matter performing scavenger experiments on the saline matrix confirmed that as stated in section 3 2 inactivation in this scenario is mainly a consequence of the generation of chlorinated species eqs 1 2 fig 5b shows that none of the scavengers resulted in a pronounced decrease in the efficacy of the treatment revealing that the reactive species studied play a minor role in disinfection a closer look at the inactivation curves shows that all the scavengers slightly increased the time needed to complete the treatment from 5 to 15 min with the use of ffa resulting in the slowest inactivation wen et al 2019 also stated the greater involvement in chlorinated species disinfection compared to radicals in their study on the inactivation of fungi by a pms cl system 20 the hydroxyl radical is mainly responsible for the inactivation of enterococcus sp in the scenario dw h2o2 uv a when meoh and ffa were added to the treatments very similar results were obtained fig 6a treatment was inhibited so that when using meoh the disinfection ratio was 0 6 log after 90 min a slightly stronger inhibition was observed when using ffa as a scavenger as only 0 5 log units decreased the concentration of microorganisms this indicates that 1o2 also plays a role in treatment although less than oh most studies reporting the use of h2o2 uv a for the removal of pollutants overlook the possible effect of radicals other than oh in fact a recent study by kim et al 2021 addressed the occurrence of unknown reactive species in uv h2o2 systems and the presence of singlet oxygen was reported 66 disinfection increases significantly during the last part of the treatment achieving an inactivation rate of 2 9 log and 1 9 log at 120 min when using meoh and ffa respectively although the disinfection result is similar in the two matrices the scavenger study reveals that the disinfection mechanism is different when treating water with the presence of cl in this case hydroxyl radicals do not play such a relevant role in treatment because although the disinfection rate is slightly lower compared to the reference treatment when using meoh as a scavenger after 120 min the result achieved is the same 3 3 2 proposed inactivation mechanisms based on both the above findings and a critical revision of the scientific literature an outline of mechanistic processes that might play a role on the inactivation of enterococcus sp have been proposed the effect of uv light on bacteria inactivation differs according to the uv source in contrast to uv c radiation the emission in the uv a range is not absorbed by bacteria dna but is capable of inactivating microorganisms by damaging their proteins or through the generation of internal reactive oxidant species 67 in tests using radiation alone it has been observed that the dose used is not sufficient to disinfect on its own although it is expected that throughout treatment it will affect the cell membrane by combining uv a with h2o2 hydroxyl radicals can be generated in the extracellular environment and are capable of attacking and destroying the cell membrane leading to leakage of intracellular material and the death of bacteria it has been confirmed by scavenger experiments which suggests that oh is mainly responsible for the inactivation of enterococcus sp in the h2o2 uv a system additionally the cell structure might be weakened due to uv a exposure it would allow diffusion of inactivated h2o2 into the cell which can produce an intracellular fenton reaction with the iron naturally present inside the cell it might leads to an enhancement of bacterial inactivation 29 this is reflected in an increase in the last few minutes of the disinfection rate fig 6a that is not dependent on generated radicals as seen previously moreover this effect is accentuated by increasing the incident radiation flux which explains why this effect was not observed in the batch reactor something similar might happens in the pms uv a system again it has been seen that the most influential radical in microorganism inactivation is oh although some involvement of the sulfate radical must also be assumed like oh so4 has a strong oxidative capacity capable of oxidizing cell membrane lipids and destroying their proteins 68 as mentioned above uv a radiation causes stress on the cell that allows reactive species to penetrate through the membrane and reach the cytoplasm resulting in the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins and causing the death of bacteria 65 in addition to radicals there are other ways to oxidize the cytoplasmic membrane that can be related to other forms of pms action on the one hand direct oxidation of pms on the components of the cell wall is possible 69 on the other hand berruti et al 2021 also propose the possibility of sulfate penetration through the cell membrane facilitating its reaction with the metals naturally present inside the cell from this sulfate radicals can also be generated intracellularly damaging internal cell components this approach is based on the fact that sulfate so4 2 which is present in oxone pms source used in the present study is one of the preferred sources of sulfur for cells and its uptake occurs through well defined membrane protein transporters 69 a very different scenario appears in the pms uv a cl system where all disinfection is a consequence of the chlorine compounds generated wen et a 2019 studied the effect of the pms cl system on the inactivation of various fungal species determining that the cell membrane is destroyed in treatment with the intracellular material discharged into the medium 20 chemical compounds with high oxidative potential such as free chlorine have been shown to break the chemical bonds in the molecules that make up the cells 68 during treatment with h2o2 uv a cl it is also observed that hydroxyl radicals do not play any or only a residual role in the inactivation of microorganisms as with pms in this treatment chlorinated compounds might play a role in bacterial inactivation however on this occasion their generation is conditional on the prior generation of hydroxyl radicals as explained in section 3 2 it would explain why a slower disinfection rate is observed than in the pms uv a scenario where pms can directly react with chlorides what is not possible with h2o2 therefore it can be expected that inactivation will occur via two routes direct oxidation from cloh eqs 4 and 5 and intracellular oxidation as previously explained in fig 7 an attempt has been made to synthesise the inactivation mechanisms proposed for the different scenarios studied 3 4 influence of inorganic anions the composition of the matrix in which the treatments take place has been shown to have a great influence on their effectiveness the presence of certain compounds such as organic matter or carbonates which are easily found in municipal wastewater has been extensively studied 31 however there is little to no information on the implications of the presence of other inorganic compounds that frequently appear in industrial wastewater at high concentrations in addition most studies on the influence of the matrix have evaluated the degradation of pollutants but it is also necessary to study the effect of inorganic ions on the inactivation of microorganisms for this reason the influence of five anions at the same concentrations of 5 mm no2 no3 f br po4 3 has been analysed for optimized treatments the concentration of 5 mm for each anion was selected as the minimum concentration necessary to observe positive or negative effects in the selected treatments tests were carried out to verify that these compounds are not harmful to microorganisms in the concentration used data not shown fig 8a shows the influence of the anions on the activation of pms for the inactivation of enterococcus sp a large increase in the efficiency of the process was observed when treated with 5 mm br in water while in the reference treatment dw the detection limit was reached after 120 min the presence of bromides in the matrix increased the reaction rate so that the detection limit was reached in half an hour this behaviour resembles that observed in the presence of chlorides a study by xie et al revealed that both so4 and pms can transform br into bromine radicals free bromine and other brominated species such as hbro eqs 6 12 70 these newly generated reactive species are responsible for such a rapid inactivation of the bacteria however the presence of this new species can lead in the presence of organic matter to the formation of potentially harmful dbps in these circumstances the use of aops loses one of its main advantages the nonformation of dbps 6 s o 4 b r br s o 4 2 k 3 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 7 br b r br 2 k 1 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 8 br oh broh k 1 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 9

fluorides and the presence of nitrites seem to have the opposite effect decreasing the efficiency of the treatment after 120 min the concentration of microorganisms was reduced by only 2 51 log in the presence of no2 although jaemin chai et al 2021 reported that low concentrations of this ion can promote radical generation in catalytic processes 71 the presence of excess no2 ions can act as a scavenger of sulfate radicals k 8 8 108 m 1 s 1 23 more notable was the decrease in the presence of f since at the same time the initial concentration is reduced by only 1 68 log to our knowledge no research has yet studied the interaction of pms or sulfate radicals with f from the observed response it can be deduced that fluorides compete with microorganisms for radicals thus decreasing the effectiveness of the treatment finally neither po4 3 nor no3 had a considerable effect on the treatment in the study of the catalytic activation of pms phosphates as well as nitrates and nitrites have been found to have an inhibitory effect on treatment 72 however this negative effect is attributed to the competition of anions for active centers on the surface of the catalyst used and not by radical reaction due to the low reaction rate between no3 and so4 k 2 1 m 1 s 1 23 on the other hand ao et al 2018 73 determined that the removal of ciprofloxacin by pms uv a was enhanced by the presence of no3 this serves to illustrate that it is necessary to study each specific case to know how the pollutant and matrix components would interact the results show that the treatment based on h2o2 activation is less affected by variations in matrix composition fig 8b no differences were observed from the reference dw when the treatment was carried out in the presence of br f or po4 3 efficiency again decreased in the presence of nitrites a slowdown in bacterial inactivation was observed during the first part of the treatment but the same result was achieved in the reference treatment after 120 min reaching the detection limit high concentration of no2 also led to a lower degradation of ibuprofen in the study by wang et al 2021 74 this ion reacts with the hydroxyl radical k 1 1010 m 1 s 1 leading to the less reactive no2 radical on the contrary an improvement in bacterial inactivation was observed with the addition of 5 mm no3 reaching the detection limit in 90 min in the h2o2 uv a system these inorganic species have been reported to generate oh and no2 under direct uv photolysis eqs 13 17 consequently increasing the degradation of some compounds 75 although this process can occur in both systems studied the results show that it is enhanced in the h2o2 uv a system 13 n o 3 hv n o 2 o 14 n o 3 hv n o 2 o 15 o h 2 o 2 oh 16 o h 2 o oh ho 17 2 n o 2 h 2 o n o 2 n o 3 2 h these results suggest that the h2o2 uv a system may be less dependent on matrix composition than pms based treatments with the presence of nitrites being a contraindication to the application of either process furthermore the use of advanced oxidation processes based on the formation of sulfate radicals would also be contraindicated for waters with a high concentration of bromides despite the higher inactivation rate 4 conclusions both the pms uv a and h2o2 uv a systems have been proven to successfully inactivate enterococcus sp a higher incident radiation flux is achieved in the tubular reactor compared to the batch configuration enhancing treatment performance optimized treatments in distilled water are effective when applied in a saline matrix however they have not been successful in transferring said processes to wastewater this corroborates the belief that it is necessary to study the behaviour of the treatments directly in wastewater and optimization in a simpler matrix may be unnecessary as the results obtained are in many cases not reproducible in more complex matrices the use of scavengers confirms that when a pms treatment is applied in a medium with a high content of chlorides the effect of radicals is minor in a simpler medium without the presence of ions the predominant main radical involved in disinfection with uv a activated pms is oh the same applies to the h2o2 uv a system although the presence of chloride has been reported to inhibit the degradation of contaminants its interaction with hydroxyl radicals results in more selective species that could enhance the disinfection efficiency although the presence of high concentrations of br leads to very rapid bacteria inactivation this is due to the formation of free bromine that in the presence of organic matter can give rise to potentially hazardous by products furthermore the presence of f and no2 negatively affects the performance of the treatment based on sulfate radicals therefore in these three scenarios the use of h2o2 based treatments is recommended however the pms concentration needed to achieve complete disinfection is lower than that of h2o2 therefore when applying these treatments under real conditions more economic and environmental studies would be necessary to determine the most appropriate treatment in each situation declaration of competing

13059,in this work the influence of the matrix on the photolytic activation of peroxymonosulfate pms and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been studied for the inactivation of enterococcus sp additionally two different reactor configurations batch reactor and tubular reactor have been evaluated that achieve complete disinfection within 120 min when using a tubular reactor three water matrices distilled water saline solution and simulated wastewater have been studied and experiments have been carried out using radical scavengers to determine the main reactive species involved in each process the hydroxyl radical oh has been found to be the main responsible for the inactivation of bacteria in distilled water while chlorinated species generated during treatments are responsible for disinfection in a saline matrix the study of the influence of various inorganic ions br f po4 3 no3 no2 on treatments revealed an increase in the efficacy of the pms uv a system in the presence of br due to the bromine generation furthermore the effect of f has been studied for the first time determining that the presence of this compound does not have a significant influence on the h2o2 uv a system while inhibiting pms uv a treatment overall the results suggest that h2o2 based treatments would be less dependent on matrix composition than those involving pms and the presence of nitrites is a contraindication to the application of either process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords advanced oxidation processes enterococcus sp inorganic anions persulfates uv activation 1 introduction due to climate change and population growth approximately two thirds of the population experience severe water shortages for at least one month a year and by 2050 this number will continue to rise so that 52 of the world s population will be at risk 1 this has led researchers and governments to focus on finding alternative water sources to reduce water stress allowing higher quality water to be reserved for human consumption although one of the solutions that have attracted the most attention is the reuse of reclaimed wastewater it is estimated that more than 80 of the wastewater ww generated on the planet is discharged into the natural environment without adequate prior treatment according to the united nations world water development report 2018 2 this entails the introduction into the aqueous medium of many highly harmful contaminants chemical physical and biological which pose a risk not only for biodiversity but also for human health several studies have demonstrated the presence of various contaminants in the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp revealing that some pollutants are recalcitrant to conventional treatments 3 4 pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria viruses fungi etc are one of the most common pollutants present in wastewater 5 9 regulations generally determine which species of microorganisms should be used as indicator microorganisms this is the case of escherichia coli a bacteria frequently used as an indicator of faecal contamination 10 however previous studies have shown that enterococcus sp might be more resistant to some disinfection treatments 11 13 therefore this species may be more appropriate as an indicator in the study of advanced oxidation processes aops as they may not be correctly assessed by less resistant microbiological indicators although chlorination and ozonation are the most well established and commonly used disinfection techniques today 14 these techniques have some drawbacks the most important is the formation of disinfection by products dbps that can be a threat to human health 15 such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haa and bromate dbps are mainly formed by the reaction of the reagents used as a disinfectant with the organic matter present in the water therefore if disinfection is to be implemented as a tertiary treatment in a wastewater treatment plant the risk of formation of these compounds is very high as the effluent to be treated may still contain a high concentration of organic matter 16 this requires the development of new disinfection techniques that can be used in these cases to provide the quality necessary to ensure safe reuse in this context aops have been demonstrated to be a great alternative to conventional treatments aops consist of the generation of highly reactive free radicals capable of degrading organic molecules while inactivating microorganisms 17 20 the hydroxyl radical oh generated from hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been commonly used as an oxidizing agent in aops due to its high redox potential 1 8 2 7 v 21 22 however sulfate radicals so4 also appear to be a great alternative as they have a redox potential 2 5 3 1 v equal to or greater than oh 23 so4 can be generated through the activation of various oxidizing compounds with peroxymonosulfate pms one of the most widely used together with sodium or potassium peroxydisulfate pds pms is commercially available as oxone a triple potassium salt highly unstable facilitating its reaction with other compounds and several studies have highlighted its disinfection efficacy over pds 24 25 many different methods can be used to activate pms and h2o2 for the generation of radicals such as radiation homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis heat or ultrasound 26 27 within uv radiation uv c emission is one of the most widely used methods in aops however several authors have reported good efficacy in treatments that combine uv a radiation with h2o2 28 29 or pms 11 30 although most of these studies combine radiation with other activation methods such as iron for photo fenton processes its efficacy is worth exploring as a single activation method despite the many advantages of aops several studies have revealed that one of the drawbacks of these processes is that their effectiveness is highly affected by the composition of the aqueous matrix 31 32 the presence of components such as organic matter or carbonates has been widely investigated 31 since they may act as inhibitors of treatments since they are scavengers of free radical species 33 however some water constituents have been reported to promote parallel reactions that could accelerate degradation processes 34 consequently individual matrix components can affect water treatment processes depending on the nature of the target pollutant the dissolved compounds or the chemicals involved in the treatment process 31 34 35 the main objective of this work is to study the influence of the water matrix on the photolytic activation of h2o2 and pms applied to the inactivation of enterococcus sp in water streams in addition two different reactor configurations have been compared to determine which is the most efficient in terms of radiation distribution the influence of the matrix has been evaluated by comparing three aqueous matrices with different compositions distilled water saline solution and simulated wastewater the influence of five inorganic anions br f po4 3 no3 no2 whose effects on aops have been less explored so far has been studied in this work finally experiments have been carried out using scavengers to identify the main radicals involved in the inactivation of bacteria in the proposed scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 aqueous matrix three aqueous matrices with different levels of complexity have been used throughout the study the simplest matrix being distilled water dw a saline solution ss with a sodium chloride concentration nacl scharlau concentration of 0 9 has also been used and finally to test the viability of treatment in a more complex matrix some experiments were carried out using

acid h2so4 jt baker 2 3 bacterial preparation and analysis wild strains of enterococcus sp previously isolated from real wastewater and stored in cryovials in a freezer were used in this study to contaminate the water samples to activate frozen bacteria the content of a cryovial 0 5 ml was inoculated in 50 ml of luria bertani broth scharlau spain and incubated for 24 h 37 c after this time the broth was divided into two 50 ml falcon tubes 25 ml of broth in each one and centrifugated for 15 mins at 4200 rpm to ensure complete separation of bacteria from the feeding broth once the supernatant was discarded the pellets were resuspended in the same volume of saline solution nacl 0 9 and stored in the fridge for later use to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments the culture and enumeration of the bacteria were carried out mainly using the drop plate method 38 through a 10 fold serial dilution in sterile saline solution nacl 0 9 however the spread plate method standard method 9215c 39 was also used to increase the detection limit dl when needed the samples were plated on slanetz bartley agar scharlau spain and the colonies formed were counted after 48 h of incubation at 37 c the number of colonies was expressed as colony forming units per ml cfu ml and the detection limit was 10 cfu ml and 100 cfu ml when using the spread plate method or the drop plate method respectively analyses were performed in triplicate and the standard deviation of the results was calculated 2 4 experimental setup in this study two different reactor configurations have been assessed the optimizations of pms and h2o2 were carried out in a 500 ml batch reactor agitated with a magnetic stirrer two black light lamps philips tl 6 w 365 nm were placed over the reactor at a distance such that the radiation on the water surface was 8 5 w m 2 since the position of the lamps in this configuration is not fixed the irradiance was checked before each experiment using an hd 2102 1 portable luxmeter delta ohm to ensure that the radiation intensity at the surface was constant in all experiments the rest of the experiments were carried out in a tubular reactor with continuous recirculation and a total volume of 1 l the illumination of this reactor was provided by a black light lamp located on the axis and according to the illuminated volume 0 252 l 25 2 of the total water sample and the flow rate 1 2 l min 1 the uv a contact time was 12 6 s for more detail photographs of both reactors have been included in the supplementary material fig s1 for all experiments the water sample was inoculated with enterococcus sp so that the initial concentration of cultivable bacteria was 8 105 1 106 cfu ml and the necessary concentrations of reagents were added the experiments lasted 120 min and were carried out at natural ph 6 the temperature of the water varied between 26 c and 30 c due to the slight heating caused by the recirculating pump however no impact of this variability was observed during the experiments to determine incident radiation reaching water during treatments ferrioxalate actinometry experiments were carried out using dw both in batch and tubular reactors following the procedure described elsewhere 37 in addition free chlorine generation was monitored using a multiparameter photometer hanna hi83399 together with the hi93701 f reagent kit of the same brand in order to compare inactivation under various conditions pseudo first order rate constants k min 1 were estimated by linear regression fitting a synergistic factor was calculated to evaluate the synergistic effect 40 following eq 1 1 s k oxidant uv a k oxidant k uv a 3 results 3 1 photolytic activation of pms and h2o2 the inactivation of enterococcus sp was studied over time for different concentrations of pms and h2o2 in a batch reactor with the incidence of uv a radiation and the results were plotted in fig 1 for optimization dw samples were used as the aqueous matrix uv a radiation alone was not able to inactivate the microorganisms present in the medium but once pms was added the elimination of enterococcus sp began to increase fig 1a inactivation was practically negligible for a pms dose of 0 01 mm obtaining a disinfection rate of 0 33 log after 120 min of irradiation however by increasing the concentration of oxidants to 0 05 mm and 0 1 mm the disinfection rate increased to 1 2 log and 4 3 log for the same time higher doses of oxidant led to complete inactivation of the bacteria in less than 15 min considering that when the detection limit had been reached non activated pms has been stated to have some disinfection capacity 41 so dark experiments were carried out no significant inactivation was observed for the doses assessed data not shown the same procedure was carried out for hydrogen peroxide fig 1b but none of the concentrations applied had a significant effect on the bacteria population however according to other authors a dose of h2o2 of 1 5 mm 51 mg l 1 when fenton like methods are used is sufficient for microorganism inactivation 42 43 this could indicate that uv a radiation is not capable of activating the oxidant to generate radicals that attack the bacteria present in the water under the experimental conditions tested since the treatment is carried out in distilled water there are no particles in the medium that scatter light or organic matter that absorbs it so the reason that the radiation does not have the desired effect could be that incident radiation is not sufficient to activate h2o2 a concentration of 1 5 mm h2o2 and a concentration of 0 05 mm pms were chosen and the same treatments were carried out in a tubular reactor to check whether a different reactor and light distribution could improve the inactivation of enterococcus sp in this new arrangement the lamp was placed on the central axis of the reactor surrounded by the fluid so a better light distribution is expected than in previous experiments in which the lamp was placed over the reactor as expected greater bacteria inactivation was achieved in the tubular reactor with consequent higher disinfection rates fig 2b shows how when using the new configuration enterococcus sp inactivation reaches the detection limit after 120 min of h2o2 uv a treatment while elimination was almost non existent in the batch reactor similarly the effectiveness of the pms uv a treatment improved increasing the disinfection rate from 1 2 log to complete inactivation after 120 min fig 2a as in the batch configuration the effect of uv a radiation alone on the bacterial population was studied concluding that the amount of radiation emitted by the lamps is not sufficient to inactivate enterococcus sp an increase in the disinfectant power of the non activated reagents was observed the disinfection rate achieved by pms and h2o2 was 1 68 and 0 55 log respectively this may be due to a higher decomposition of the compounds as a consequence of the more aggressive agitation generated by the passage of the liquid through the feed pump the synergy factor s of the combination of reagents and ultraviolet visible uv a radiation was calculated for which it was first necessary to calculate the pseudo first order kinetic constant table s1 supplementary material shows the inactivation rate constants obtained as well as the s calculated for the two treatments in the two configurations as expected the highest s was obtained for the h2o2 uv a system in the tubular reactor 11 90 while no interaction between the two treatment elements was observed for the batch configuration the difference between the s values obtained for the pms uv a system is smaller although the tubular reactor also favours synergy in this treatment experimental results showed that by changing the reactor configuration used for the treatment higher efficiencies can be obtained using the same reagent dose although it is possible to deduce that this is due as mentioned above to a better distribution of the radiation actinometry experiments have been carried out in both the batch reactor and the tubular reactor to quantify the total incident radiation fig 3 shows fe2 formation versus time during the two actinometric reactions the results were linearly fitted to obtain the slope and in order to calculate the incident radiation flux it was divided by the quantum yield of ferrioxalate actinometry which is known but is dependent on wavelength goldstein et al 2008 estimated this parameter in the range of 205 365 nm obtaining a weighted average value for the emission spectrum of the lamps used in this work of 1 273 mol einstein 44 the incident radiation calculated for the tubular reactor was 2 23 10 6 einstein l 1 s 1 while this value was 1 19 10 6 einstein l 1 s 1 for the batch reactor despite using two lamps this improvement in treatment efficiency may be due to two different phenomena the first one is a better activation of the oxidants due to higher incident radiation the bond dissociation energy of hydrogen peroxide has been estimated to be between 44 1 and 50 72 kcal mol 1 184 51 212 kj ml 1 45 on the other hand there is no reference value for the pms bond energy although it has been estimated to be lower than that of h2o2 46 this could explain why there is some activation of pms when using a batch configuration but not of h2o2 on the other hand although radiation alone has been shown to be not capable of inactivating microorganisms it could have sufficient power to weaken their structure and promote slight oxidative damage 47 facilitating their subsequent inactivation when reagents are added either by direct oxidation or through generated radicals in either case actinometry results corroborate that by using a tubular reactor the greater efficiency of the treatment is a consequence of the fact that this configuration can maximise incident radiation flux therefore this configuration was selected as optimal for the rest of the experiments 3 2 effect of the matrix the selected doses of pms and h2o2 from the optimization phase section 3 1 were applied to various aqueous matrices gradually increasing the complexity of the medium for this a saline solution and simulated wastewater were used the saline solution used has a concentration of 9 g l 1 although municipal wastewater generally has a lower salt content 0 5 g l 1 saline wastewater can occur for a variety of reasons such as leaks from landfills or in response to seawater infiltration into sewer systems which is a common problem during storm surge flooding in coastal areas 48 on the other hand it should not be forgotten that nacl concentrations of up to 760 mm can be found in industrial wastewater 49 the concentration of salt ions in inorganic industries ranges from 1 5 to 11 g l 1 and the concentration of total dissolved solids tds can range between 48 and 100 g l 1 depending on the industrial process 50 bacteria are well acclimatised to media with a salinity of up to 10 g l 1 and their survival in more concentrated media is difficult 48 finally it should be noted that the use of a saline concentration of 9 g l 1 is very common in microbiological analyzes to avoid cell death as a consequence of the osmotic difference between the inside and outside of the cell therefore it is important to get insight about the effects of this salt concentration in terms of nacl on the studied disinfection processes fig 4a shows that the inactivation of microorganisms was complete in 5 min when the pms uv a system was applied in saline solution it has been stated that pms reacts with chlorine generating hclo cl2 species eqs 2 3 51 responsible for the inactivation of bacteria 20 52 to confirm the formation of free chlorine an experiment was carried out in which the free chlorine was monitored fig s2 supplementary material illustrates how the generation of free chlorine occurs linearly up to a concentration of 1 6 mg l considering that the initial sodium chloride concentration 9 g l 1 led to 5 46 g l of chlorine in the water 0 3 of the chlorine was transformed into free chlorine 2 c l hso 5 hclo so 4 2 3 c l h hclo h 2 o cl 2 on the other hand the optimized treatment in dw was not enough to inactivate enterococcus sp in the simulated wastewater only a 0 5 log reduction of the initial concentration was achieved after 120 min the higher complexity of the matrix frequently leads to lower degradation or inactivation rates and dissolved organic matter dom has a documented role as a sink for radicals 53 the synthetic wastewater used in this work has a dissolved organic carbon content of 100 mg l 36 which is responsible for inhibition of treatment in addition organic matter can absorb radiation in the uv a region thus also preventing the activation of the oxidant in addition to this the unstable nature of pms means that it can react rapidly with almost any component of the matrix 54 55 therefore the higher the complexity of the matrix the higher the degradation rate of pms leaving less available for activation by uv a previous studies have demonstrated that higher doses of pms would be needed to achieve bacterial inactivation under the same conditions 11 in fig 4b the efficiency of the h2o2 uv a system is compared in the three studied matrices complete inhibition of treatment was observed when applied in simulated wastewater as in the pms uv a system the presence of organic matter could be mainly responsible for inhibition of treatment by absorbing radiation quenching radicals and promoting h2o2 degradation also known for its unstable nature although cédat et al 2016 determined that the amount of h2o2 used in this work 1 5 mm is sufficient to remove estrogens 56 from wastewater uv c 254 nm was used in that study to activate h2o2 hydrogen peroxide has a much higher radiation absorption capacity in the uv c region than at the wavelength used in this work 57 which explains the difference in activation efficiency therefore a much higher radiation dose would be necessary to achieve the same effect the disinfection rates achieved in the saline matrix were similar to those obtained in dw with the disinfection kinetics slightly higher in ss in this matrix the detection limit was reached at 90 min compared to the 120 min needed to reach the same point when the treatment was applied in distilled water this differs from the reported results for the removal of organic pollutants the presence of cl has been shown to have inhibitory effects on the degradation of compounds such as amoxicillin 58 ofloxacin 59 or rhb dye 60 by acting as a scavenger for hydroxyl radicals eqs 4 5 61 however nihemaiti et al 2018 stated that the presence of chloride did not influence the degradation of trace organic chemicals 62 as the reaction between chloride and oh is reversible the rate constant of the forward reaction 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 being lower than that of the backward reaction 6 1 109 m 1 s 1 moreover the chlorine radical formed during these reactions may aid in this case the inactivation of enterococcus sp 4 oh cl cloh oh cl 5

using radical scavengers has been conducted in dw and sww these experiments have not been carried out on real wastewater due to the low treatment performance achieved in the said matrix the use of scavengers is a good qualitative approach for the identification of free species however further analysis using more complex analytical technologies such as electron paramagnetic resonance epr should be performed to confirm the results meoh has been used as a scavenger for hydroxyl and sulfate radicals while tba has been used as a scavenger for hydroxyl radicals only furthermore singlet oxygen 1o2 can also play an important role in the elimination of pollutants in aops so ffa has been used as a scavenger of this species meoh is known to scavenge so4 and oh at a rate of 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 and 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 respectively 63 on the contrary tba reacts only with oh at a rate of 6 108 m 1 s 1 three orders of magnitude faster than so4 8 0 105 m 1 s 1 63 ffa reacts with 1o2 at a rate of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 but it should also be noted that ffa is also an efficient quencher for oh 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 thus if oh was the dominant reactive species tba and ffa should have similar inhibitory effects 64 all scavengers had a similar effect on the activation of pms in dw the efficiency of the treatment was reduced so that after two hours the concentration of microorganisms was only reduced by 1 2 log units fig 5a this shows that the oh radical is mainly responsible for bacterial inactivation in this scenario as it is the only radical that reacts with all the scavengers used however since inhibition is not complete there is part of the disinfection that is not due to the action of any of the radicals studied which could indicate the combination with non radical pathways qi et al 2020 obtained the same result when combining pms and uv a radiation for the inactivation of escherichia coli 65 some 53 consider the existence of nonradical mechanisms for the disinfection or degradation of contaminants as one of the advantages of using pms as these mechanisms are less sensitive to scavenging by organic matter performing scavenger experiments on the saline matrix confirmed that as stated in section 3 2 inactivation in this scenario is mainly a consequence of the generation of chlorinated species eqs 1 2 fig 5b shows that none of the scavengers resulted in a pronounced decrease in the efficacy of the treatment revealing that the reactive species studied play a minor role in disinfection a closer look at the inactivation curves shows that all the scavengers slightly increased the time needed to complete the treatment from 5 to 15 min with the use of ffa resulting in the slowest inactivation wen et al 2019 also stated the greater involvement in chlorinated species disinfection compared to radicals in their study on the inactivation of fungi by a pms cl system 20 the hydroxyl radical is mainly responsible for the inactivation of enterococcus sp in the scenario dw h2o2 uv a when meoh and ffa were added to the treatments very similar results were obtained fig 6a treatment was inhibited so that when using meoh the disinfection ratio was 0 6 log after 90 min a slightly stronger inhibition was observed when using ffa as a scavenger as only 0 5 log units decreased the concentration of microorganisms this indicates that 1o2 also plays a role in treatment although less than oh most studies reporting the use of h2o2 uv a for the removal of pollutants overlook the possible effect of radicals other than oh in fact a recent study by kim et al 2021 addressed the occurrence of unknown reactive species in uv h2o2 systems and the presence of singlet oxygen was reported 66 disinfection increases significantly during the last part of the treatment achieving an inactivation rate of 2 9 log and 1 9 log at 120 min when using meoh and ffa respectively although the disinfection result is similar in the two matrices the scavenger study reveals that the disinfection mechanism is different when treating water with the presence of cl in this case hydroxyl radicals do not play such a relevant role in treatment because although the disinfection rate is slightly lower compared to the reference treatment when using meoh as a scavenger after 120 min the result achieved is the same 3 3 2 proposed inactivation mechanisms based on both the above findings and a critical revision of the scientific literature an outline of mechanistic processes that might play a role on the inactivation of enterococcus sp have been proposed the effect of uv light on bacteria inactivation differs according to the uv source in contrast to uv c radiation the emission in the uv a range is not absorbed by bacteria dna but is capable of inactivating microorganisms by damaging their proteins or through the generation of internal reactive oxidant species 67 in tests using radiation alone it has been observed that the dose used is not sufficient to disinfect on its own although it is expected that throughout treatment it will affect the cell membrane by combining uv a with h2o2 hydroxyl radicals can be generated in the extracellular environment and are capable of attacking and destroying the cell membrane leading to leakage of intracellular material and the death of bacteria it has been confirmed by scavenger experiments which suggests that oh is mainly responsible for the inactivation of enterococcus sp in the h2o2 uv a system additionally the cell structure might be weakened due to uv a exposure it would allow diffusion of inactivated h2o2 into the cell which can produce an intracellular fenton reaction with the iron naturally present inside the cell it might leads to an enhancement of bacterial inactivation 29 this is reflected in an increase in the last few minutes of the disinfection rate fig 6a that is not dependent on generated radicals as seen previously moreover this effect is accentuated by increasing the incident radiation flux which explains why this effect was not observed in the batch reactor something similar might happens in the pms uv a system again it has been seen that the most influential radical in microorganism inactivation is oh although some involvement of the sulfate radical must also be assumed like oh so4 has a strong oxidative capacity capable of oxidizing cell membrane lipids and destroying their proteins 68 as mentioned above uv a radiation causes stress on the cell that allows reactive species to penetrate through the membrane and reach the cytoplasm resulting in the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins and causing the death of bacteria 65 in addition to radicals there are other ways to oxidize the cytoplasmic membrane that can be related to other forms of pms action on the one hand direct oxidation of pms on the components of the cell wall is possible 69 on the other hand berruti et al 2021 also propose the possibility of sulfate penetration through the cell membrane facilitating its reaction with the metals naturally present inside the cell from this sulfate radicals can also be generated intracellularly damaging internal cell components this approach is based on the fact that sulfate so4 2 which is present in oxone pms source used in the present study is one of the preferred sources of sulfur for cells and its uptake occurs through well defined membrane protein transporters 69 a very different scenario appears in the pms uv a cl system where all disinfection is a consequence of the chlorine compounds generated wen et a 2019 studied the effect of the pms cl system on the inactivation of various fungal species determining that the cell membrane is destroyed in treatment with the intracellular material discharged into the medium 20 chemical compounds with high oxidative potential such as free chlorine have been shown to break the chemical bonds in the molecules that make up the cells 68 during treatment with h2o2 uv a cl it is also observed that hydroxyl radicals do not play any or only a residual role in the inactivation of microorganisms as with pms in this treatment chlorinated compounds might play a role in bacterial inactivation however on this occasion their generation is conditional on the prior generation of hydroxyl radicals as explained in section 3 2 it would explain why a slower disinfection rate is observed than in the pms uv a scenario where pms can directly react with chlorides what is not possible with h2o2 therefore it can be expected that inactivation will occur via two routes direct oxidation from cloh eqs 4 and 5 and intracellular oxidation as previously explained in fig 7 an attempt has been made to synthesise the inactivation mechanisms proposed for the different scenarios studied 3 4 influence of inorganic anions the composition of the matrix in which the treatments take place has been shown to have a great influence on their effectiveness the presence of certain compounds such as organic matter or carbonates which are easily found in municipal wastewater has been extensively studied 31 however there is little to no information on the implications of the presence of other inorganic compounds that frequently appear in industrial wastewater at high concentrations in addition most studies on the influence of the matrix have evaluated the degradation of pollutants but it is also necessary to study the effect of inorganic ions on the inactivation of microorganisms for this reason the influence of five anions at the same concentrations of 5 mm no2 no3 f br po4 3 has been analysed for optimized treatments the concentration of 5 mm for each anion was selected as the minimum concentration necessary to observe positive or negative effects in the selected treatments tests were carried out to verify that these compounds are not harmful to microorganisms in the concentration used data not shown fig 8a shows the influence of the anions on the activation of pms for the inactivation of enterococcus sp a large increase in the efficiency of the process was observed when treated with 5 mm br in water while in the reference treatment dw the detection limit was reached after 120 min the presence of bromides in the matrix increased the reaction rate so that the detection limit was reached in half an hour this behaviour resembles that observed in the presence of chlorides a study by xie et al revealed that both so4 and pms can transform br into bromine radicals free bromine and other brominated species such as hbro eqs 6 12 70 these newly generated reactive species are responsible for such a rapid inactivation of the bacteria however the presence of this new species can lead in the presence of organic matter to the formation of potentially harmful dbps in these circumstances the use of aops loses one of its main advantages the nonformation of dbps 6 s o 4 b r br s o 4 2 k 3 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 7 br b r br 2 k 1 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 8 br oh broh k 1 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 9

fluorides and the presence of nitrites seem to have the opposite effect decreasing the efficiency of the treatment after 120 min the concentration of microorganisms was reduced by only 2 51 log in the presence of no2 although jaemin chai et al 2021 reported that low concentrations of this ion can promote radical generation in catalytic processes 71 the presence of excess no2 ions can act as a scavenger of sulfate radicals k 8 8 108 m 1 s 1 23 more notable was the decrease in the presence of f since at the same time the initial concentration is reduced by only 1 68 log to our knowledge no research has yet studied the interaction of pms or sulfate radicals with f from the observed response it can be deduced that fluorides compete with microorganisms for radicals thus decreasing the effectiveness of the treatment finally neither po4 3 nor no3 had a considerable effect on the treatment in the study of the catalytic activation of pms phosphates as well as nitrates and nitrites have been found to have an inhibitory effect on treatment 72 however this negative effect is attributed to the competition of anions for active centers on the surface of the catalyst used and not by radical reaction due to the low reaction rate between no3 and so4 k 2 1 m 1 s 1 23 on the other hand ao et al 2018 73 determined that the removal of ciprofloxacin by pms uv a was enhanced by the presence of no3 this serves to illustrate that it is necessary to study each specific case to know how the pollutant and matrix components would interact the results show that the treatment based on h2o2 activation is less affected by variations in matrix composition fig 8b no differences were observed from the reference dw when the treatment was carried out in the presence of br f or po4 3 efficiency again decreased in the presence of nitrites a slowdown in bacterial inactivation was observed during the first part of the treatment but the same result was achieved in the reference treatment after 120 min reaching the detection limit high concentration of no2 also led to a lower degradation of ibuprofen in the study by wang et al 2021 74 this ion reacts with the hydroxyl radical k 1 1010 m 1 s 1 leading to the less reactive no2 radical on the contrary an improvement in bacterial inactivation was observed with the addition of 5 mm no3 reaching the detection limit in 90 min in the h2o2 uv a system these inorganic species have been reported to generate oh and no2 under direct uv photolysis eqs 13 17 consequently increasing the degradation of some compounds 75 although this process can occur in both systems studied the results show that it is enhanced in the h2o2 uv a system 13 n o 3 hv n o 2 o 14 n o 3 hv n o 2 o 15 o h 2 o 2 oh 16 o h 2 o oh ho 17 2 n o 2 h 2 o n o 2 n o 3 2 h these results suggest that the h2o2 uv a system may be less dependent on matrix composition than pms based treatments with the presence of nitrites being a contraindication to the application of either process furthermore the use of advanced oxidation processes based on the formation of sulfate radicals would also be contraindicated for waters with a high concentration of bromides despite the higher inactivation rate 4 conclusions both the pms uv a and h2o2 uv a systems have been proven to successfully inactivate enterococcus sp a higher incident radiation flux is achieved in the tubular reactor compared to the batch configuration enhancing treatment performance optimized treatments in distilled water are effective when applied in a saline matrix however they have not been successful in transferring said processes to wastewater this corroborates the belief that it is necessary to study the behaviour of the treatments directly in wastewater and optimization in a simpler matrix may be unnecessary as the results obtained are in many cases not reproducible in more complex matrices the use of scavengers confirms that when a pms treatment is applied in a medium with a high content of chlorides the effect of radicals is minor in a simpler medium without the presence of ions the predominant main radical involved in disinfection with uv a activated pms is oh the same applies to the h2o2 uv a system although the presence of chloride has been reported to inhibit the degradation of contaminants its interaction with hydroxyl radicals results in more selective species that could enhance the disinfection efficiency although the presence of high concentrations of br leads to very rapid bacteria inactivation this is due to the formation of free bromine that in the presence of organic matter can give rise to potentially hazardous by products furthermore the presence of f and no2 negatively affects the performance of the treatment based on sulfate radicals therefore in these three scenarios the use of h2o2 based treatments is recommended however the pms concentration needed to achieve complete disinfection is lower than that of h2o2 therefore when applying these treatments under real conditions more economic and environmental studies would be necessary to determine the most appropriate treatment in each situation declaration of competing
