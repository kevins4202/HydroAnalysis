12460,the release of untreated phosphate into water systems is of great environmental concern thus many adsorption methods have been developed to deal with this issue in the present paper we prepared magnesium aluminum mg al based hydrotalcite al oh 3 adsorbent with a hierarchical structure using a hydrothermal approach tests were conducted to assess variation in the al mg mole ratio interaction time solution ph competitive adsorption and initial concentration of anions on the uptake of phosphate anions the outcome revealed that 96 8 of phosphate could be adsorbed within 2 h using the sample with an al to mg molar ratio of 1 3 am 3 with langmuir theoretical maximum adsorption rate of 94 08 mg p g at 25 c which is 1 59 and 5 98 times higher than mgo m and al2o3 m samples respectively the equilibrium experiment outcomes were fitted with the isotherm kinetic models and the results confirmed an adsorption mechanism involving surface adsorption that introduced phosphate ions into the layered structure of composite the improved phosphate adsorption on am 3 sample was attributed to the interaction of phosphate and hydroxyl ions during the adsorption according to our experimental findings the hydrotalcite prepared offers a great deal of promise for application as an adsorbent for the recovery of phosphate in environmental remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords green synthesis resource recovery hollow structure hydrotalcite phosphate recovery data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increased industrial use of phosphate combined with its widespread use in fertilizers in the agricultural sector had led to the depletion of its natural reserves in addition the high phosphate concentration in natural water bodies and wastewater due to agricultural and industrial waste has emerged as a major environmental concern 1 3 although phosphate is a crucial ingredient for food production excess levels in water systems can lead to eutrophication unrestrained algae growth higher levels of cyanotoxins and water de oxygenation 4 7 to remediate this serious form of environmental pollution low cost efficient and sustainable methods are required for the recovery of phosphate from agricultural and urban runoff and untreated sanitary and industrial waste 8 this has prompted the development of a variety of treatment processes including ion exchange precipitation oxidation reduction and adsorption to eliminate phosphate from contaminated aqueous systems 9 14 adsorption in particular has attracted significant attention as a successful and affordable method for the recovery of phosphate ions 8 15 for example our research group has sought to optimize materials for environmental remediation purposes and has observed that the surface state of the prepared materials has a strong association with their phosphate recovery efficiency 16 20 thorough considerable advancements have been made in the fabrication of metal oxides and hydroxides for use in phosphate recovery from wastewater 21 22 most hydroxides synthesized using conventional methods such as co precipitation suffer from agglomeration and irregular morphology resulting in a lack of effective adsorption sites and limiting the chemisorption of phosphate as a result 23 indeed the preparation of stable homogeneous metal hydroxides with an accurate size remains a challenge 24 28 however the morphologies have been shown to increase the surface area produce a consistent size distribution and create hierarchal nanostructures with lots of active surfaces 29 32 the hollow micro nanostructured materials with hierarchically porous structure are expected to have better phosphate removal than their nanoparticles counterparts hence up to now great efforts have been dedicated to fabricate hollow structured metal oxides hydroxides for phosphate recovery 33 35 a particularly promising adsorbent is layered double hydroxides ldhs which have a brucite like laminar structure with interlayers of positively charged hydroxide interlayers filled with anions that offer attractive physicochemical characteristics like a large surface area high chemical mechanical cohesion ion exchangeability and a simple preparation method 36 41 in recent years various ldhs have been developed to remove organic and inorganic compounds from polluted water because they offer surface functionalization and good adsorbency 37 42 46 however the adsorption of phosphate by ldhs is typically more effective when combined with low cost porous substances with large surface areas 47 48 in particular the mg al based ldhs have been employed for various environmental applications 49 50 these consist of nearly horizontally packed small or two dimensional ldh crystallites and their synthesis involves multiple steps and a substantial aging time 51 however a significant barrier still exists in the efficient synthesis of ldhs with high phosphate recovery and selectivity 52 54 and little is known about how the recovery of phosphate depends on their physicochemical properties and physical characteristics and the environmental factors as far as we know no study was performed to explore the potential of mg al based hydrotalcite composited along with al oh 3 with a hierarchical hollow structure for enhanced recovery of phosphate from simulated wastewater in the present study we employ a hydrothermal method to prepare al mg based hollow hydrotalcite microspheres consisting of al oh 3 in our experiments urea was used as a source of oh and co3 ions and the ph was varied in the in situ reaction to facilitate the synthesis of the hollow microsphere additionally the outcomes of a series of phosphate adsorption studies covering adsorption kinetics isotherms the response of solution ph dose effects and initial phosphate consolidation were also investigated the hydrotalcite prepared at an al to mg molar ratio of 1 3 am 3 exhibited the highest phosphate adsorption with a recovery of 96 8 and 94 08 mg g 1 langmuir theoretical maximum adsorption capacity the mechanisms associated with this higher phosphate recovery were investigated for the as prepared am 3 ldhs using fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps our findings not only highlight the ability to tune the preparation strategies for the ldhs adsorbent to optimize its phosphate adsorption efficiency in the treatment of wastewater but also demonstrate a new method for the carefully preparing hierarchical hydrotalcite with a hollow microsphere structure 2 experimental 2 1 materials all of the reagents employed in this research were of analytical grade and didn t require further purification throughout the experiments milli q ultrapure double distilled water 18 mω cm at 25 c was employed 2 2 green synthesis of hierarchical hollow mg al based hydrotalcite hydroxide composite microspheres aluminum potassium sulfate dodecahydrate alk so4 2 12h2o 99 urea co nh2 2 99 and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate mgso4 7h2o 99 5 were purchased from duksan co ltd south korea the hollow hierarchical mg al hydrotalcite microspheres were fabricated by the green hydrothermal approach as reported previously with modification 55 in the typical synthesis process 0 49 g of aluminum potassium sulfate dodecahydrate and 0 51 g of urea were mixed in 60 ml of deionized water under magnetic rotation at room temperature for 20 min to produce a clear solution next 0 26 g of magnesium sulfate was combined with the solution and agitated for another 15 min the aqueous solution was put into a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 170 c for 180 min to promote the hydrothermal process once the autoclave had naturally cooled at ambient temperature the white suspension was repeatedly rinsed with ethanol and deionized water to separate out the reacted reagents via centrifugation followed by drying in a hot air oven at 60 c for 8 h samples were prepared with an alk so4 2 12h2o mgso4 7h2o molar ratios of 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 5 1 7 2 1 3 1 5 1 and 7 1 were labelled as am 1 am 2 am 3 am 4 am 5 am 6 am 7 am 8 and am 9 respectively the γ al2o3 and mgo were produced under identical experimental conditions followed by calcination of alooh and mg oh 2 samples at 550 c for 2 h the associated samples were designated a and m respectively 2 3 characterization x ray diffraction xrd analysis of the as prepared hollow microspheres was conducted using rigaku miniflex 600 diffractometer with monochromatized cu k radiation 0 15418 nm the 40 kv and 200 ma were the input current and voltage respectively the average crystallite size of the am 3 sample was determined using

apparatus was used to conduct the xps measurement the perkin elmer spectrum two ft ir spectrometer usa was used to record the fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir the zeta potential before phosphate adsorption was tested using zetasizer nano from malvern instruments ltd uk for this 0 1 mg l 1 of the am 3 sample was ultrasonically dispersed in deionized water and an aqueous solution of 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh was used to change the ph range from 2 0 to 10 at 25 c aliquots of the am 3 suspensions were tested 3 times to determine the zeta potential 2 4 adsorption analysis solutions with specific concentrations of phosphate were obtained by dissolving kh2po4 sigma aldrich korea ltd in distilled water the adsorption kinetics were carried out by mixing 20 ml of 50 mg l 1 anhydrous kh2po4 standard solution with 50 mg of the as prepared adsorbents in a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube solution without ph adjustment the suspension was agitated in a linear shaker with an agitation speed of 250 rpm and a temperature of 25 c the centrifuge tubes were withdrawn from the agitator after 2 h and a microporous membrane filter with 0 45 μm pore size were employed for removing the adsorbent mixed phosphate solution from the centrifuge tube the molybdate blue method was then used to estimate the phosphate concentration using the ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer dr3900 hach usa at a detection wavelength of 883 nm the phosphate levels at different time intervals were measured and the recovery ratio r was estimated using eqs 1 and 2 1 q e c 0 c e v m 2 r e c 0 c e c 0 x

solution l q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g m is the mass of the as prepared adsorbent mg and r e is the recovery efficiency at the adsorption equilibrium 2 5 adsorption kinetics to investigate the phosphate adsorption kinetics 50 mg of the am 3 adsorbent in 20 0 ml of aqueous phosphate solution 50 mg l 1 was constantly agitated without solution ph adjustment and at certain intervals aliquots were taken filtered and then analysed using a spectrophotometer the experiments were all carried out at ambient temperature 25 1 c the results were fitted with pseudo first order and pseudo second order models 2 6 adsorption equilibrium different concentrations of phosphate ions 10 25 50 100 200 400 500 700 and 800 mg l 1 were dispersed in double distilled water after being reduced from the 800 mg l 1 standard solution the am 3 adsorbent 50 mg was placed in 20 ml of each of the phosphate solutions without solution ph adjustment and agitated for 2 h at a constant temperature of 25 c after filtering the suspended particles a uv spectrophotometer was used to determine the amount of phosphate present in the clear aqueous solution 2 7 response to ph to more clearly understand the mechanisms of underlying phosphate adsorption onto the as prepared adsorbent the impact of the ph on the adsorption process was analysed first 50 mg of am 3 was added to 50 ml conical flasks containing 20 0 ml of an aqueous phosphate solution 50 mg l 1 the starting ph of this solution was fixed between 2 and 10 by adding 1 0 m hcl or 1 0 m naoh solution the equilibrium phosphate adsorption capacity was calculated for each of the starting ph levels using the same experimental process as for the adsorption kinetics analysis described in section 2 6 2 8 desorption analysis adsorption desorption cycle studies were used to examine the reusability of the am 3 adsorbent the as prepared microspheres with adsorbed phosphate were added to 20 ml 0 3 m naoh solution and desorbed for 24 h without ph adjustment the phosphate content of the desorption aqueous solution was then determined the exposed hollow microspheres were then cleaned with weak acid and pure deionized water and reused for the adsorption desorption process 2 9 interference analysis the effect of potential interfering anion on the adsorption of phosphate ions by the am 3 sample was also looked into the same process as described in section 2 4 was employed except with the independent addition of potential competing anions cl 1 so4 2 no3 f and co3 2 to the phosphate solution 50 mg l 1 as sodium salts at a concentration of 0 3 m 2 10 adsorption thermodynamics modelling the thermodynamic characteristics of phosphate adsorption processes on am 3 m and a samples were evaluated by applying

change in enthalpy and δs 0 is the change in entropy 3 results and discussion 3 1 phase structure and morphology to ascertain the a m and am 3 samples crystal phase composition powder xrd was conducted as shown in fig 1 the diffraction pattern for sample a matched the cubic γ al2o3 phase jcpds card no 10 0425 with diffraction peaks at 19 5 27 2 39 5 46 1 and 67 representing the 111 311 222 400 and 440 crystallographic planes respectively 56 57 no impurities were detected in this sample the diffraction pattern for sample m exhibited peaks at 35 3 43 6 and 63 corresponding to the 111 200 and 220 crystal planes respectively which is in line with the cubic symmetry of mgo jcpds card no 75 0447 58 59 when magnesium sulfate was used as a precursor along with aluminum potassium sulfate in the am 3 sample the diffraction pattern for hydrotalcite jcpds card no 00 048 1023 was observed 60 61 the diffraction peaks were sharp and intense which was indicative of the high crystallinity of the as prepared sample the peaks at 11 6 23 4 34 6 39 5 47 1 60 8 and 62 3 were attributed to 003 006 009 015 018 110 and 113 crystallographic planes respectively of hydrotalcite mg6al2 oh 16co3 4h2o 62 weak diffraction peaks for bayerite jcpds card no 33 0018 were also detected 63 the 003 peak showed a greater intensity than the other peaks suggesting that the as prepared am 3 sample had a hierarchical layered structure 28 the size of the am 3 crystallite was estimated to be 8 7 nm depending on the scherrer formula and the fwhm intensity of the 003 plane the xrd data for the ldh samples were consistent with those presented by previous studies 64 65 the structure of as prepared materials was investigated using fesem fig 2 the fesem images of sample am 3 fig 2a show hollow flower like microspheres consisting of well organized 2d nanosheets the average diameter of the hollow microspheres was determined to be 3 μm fig 2b presents the surface morphology of a single microsphere showing that the microspheres are covered with thin two dimensional 2d nanosheets with 60 75 nm in thickness and width of 1 0 1 5 μm the fesem images indicate that the hydrotalcite had a large surface area which would be favorable for phosphate adsorption fig 2c presents microspheres with a diameter of 3 4 μm size for sample a the higher magnification image in fig 2d of sample a demonstrates that the surface of the microspheres is composed of numerous 2d nanosheets that resemble whiskers and have diameters between 80 and 100 nm and a thickness of about 10 nm a morphology that differs considerably from that of am 3 fig 2e presents a fesem image of sample m showing interconnected sheets and microcrystals with the high magnification image in fig 2f confirming that the 2d nanosheets were broken into smaller pieces possibly due to the diffusion rates during the calcination sample m was thus assumed to have a low surface area and to be unfavorable for use in phosphate adsorption the edx analysis results of sample am 3 is displayed in fig 2g which shows the homogeneous distribution of al mg and o elements within the hollow microspheres the corresponding elemental mapping from eds analysis confirms all the elements were consistently dispersed in the hollow microspheres fig 2h k our results thus demonstrate that hollow hydrotalcite can be quickly and effectively prepared using a hydrothermal method based on urea hydrolysis the hollow structure of the as processed hydrotalcite was examined further using tem and hr tem analysis fig 3a presents a representative tem image of hollow am 3 hollow microspheres which were estimated to be 2 3 μm in size which was consistent with the fesem image shown in fig 2a the interlaced translucent ultrathin 2d nanosheets of the approximate thickness of about 50 70 nm is covered the whole surface of the microspheres the hrtem image revealed fine lattice fringes fig 3b coinciding with crystallographic spacing the distinct lattice fringe of 0 30 nm matches well with the 006 crystallographic planes and 0 7 nm spacing corresponds to the 003 planes of the hydrotalcite crystal lattice confirming that the as prepared am 3 had a hydrotalcite structure 66 a clear boundary was observed between the core and the shell of the hydrotalcite indicating its hollow structure a tem image of an individual 2d nanosheet after electron beam irradiation for 5 min is displayed in fig s1 the image shows that the hydrotalcite 2d nanosheets were sensitive to the high intensity electron beam melting and reforming into small lumpy particles which are shown in the drawn circle in fig s1 this might be a result of the hydroxyl ions being destroyed and the carbonate ions being removed from the hydrotalcite interlayers 3 2 evolution mechanism to explain the formation process for the hollow hierarchical hydrotalcite microspheres a several studies were conducted to ascertain the extent to which the fabrication conditions governed the surface of the hydrotalcite the fesem images in fig 4 present the samples prepared at different time duration early in the reaction 5 min a small particle was obtained with unreacted reagents and fewer 2d nanosheets indicating that the precursor solution was still in the transformation stage from a liquid to a solid stage fig 4a the reagent and urea started to react after 10 min of reaction time and two dimensional nanosheets started to grow however a large number of aggregated spherical microparticles with a rough surface were also observed fig 4b after 30 min the morphology of the sample had not changed significantly see fig 4c but after 60 min the 2d nanosheet structure dominated over the spherical particles with a length of 2 3 μm and a thickness of 200 300 nm fig 4d the length and thickness of the 2d nanosheets further increased as the reaction time increases from 60 to 120 min as illustrated in fig 4e with a rise in reaction time to 180 min hollow microspheres decorated with interconnected two dimensional nanosheets on their surface appeared fig 4f at a longer reaction times up to 720 min this morphology did not change these results collectively show that the formation of the hierarchical hydrotalcite microspheres depends on the preparation time it is known that urea decomposes into ammonia and carbon dioxide at elevated temperatures before the reaction begins consequently stabilizing the ph of the solution 67 in addition the co3 2 and oh ions generated as mineralization agents during urea hydrolysis react with the metal cations which attach to the surface of the ammonia bubble and slowly coagulate into nanoparticles leading to the initial growth of 2d nanosheet over the bubble surface and subsequently to the growth of hollow microspheres decorated with 2d nanosheets 55 68 when experiments were conducted without urea bulk crystalline particles surrounded by smaller microspheres were produced fig s2 these results indicate that the urea in the reaction system was crucial for the formation of the hollow microspheres 3 3 xps analysis to explore more about the surface chemistry and valence state of the freshly prepared am 3 adsorbent both before and after phosphate adsorption xps analysis was performed and the resulting full spectrum is presented in fig s3 both the fresh and used samples contained al mg o and c with a new signal peak for p observed after phosphate adsorption no other elements were detected in either samples confirming the phase purity of the prepared adsorbent generally the peak at around 73 5 ev corresponds to tetrahedral coordinated al3 from aluminum hydroxide the al 2p can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 73 5 and 74 4 ev corresponding to al oh 3 and alo binding energies respectively 69 70 however as shown in fig s4a the prominent al 2p peak in our results shifted to a higher binding energy than that of pure aluminum hydroxide and metal oxygen bonding which can be explained by the chemical interface of mg2 and al3 as a consequence of electronic transfer 71 as illustrated in fig s4b the mg 2p peak was deconvoluted into two peaks at 49 3 ev and 50 4 ev as mgo and mg oh 2 bonding after phosphate adsorption the mg 2p peak could be fitted into four peaks in which the two peaks related to mgo and mg oh 2 with the binding energy at 49 7 ev and 50 8 ev respectively besides two new peaks assigned to mg3 po4 2 and mgpo4 were detected at 51 6 ev and 52 2 ev respectively it is interesting to note that after phosphate adsorption the mg oh 2 and mgo binding energy is shifted 0 4 ev to a higher binding might be due to electron transfer in the valence band as well as the formation of mg o p inner sphere binding 72 73 thus it could be deduced that phosphate anions were combined with the al and mg species on hydrotalcite and formed alp and mgp inner sphere complexation with clear confirmation of phosphate bonding with hydrotalcite 3 4 bet surface area analysis to calculate the surface area pore volume and pore size of the a m am 3 samples nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were performed and the results are shown in fig 5 sample m exhibited a bet type iii isotherm brunauer deming teller classification indicating a weak interaction with n2 and the sample the isotherms for the a am 1 and am 3 samples exhibited type iv hysteresis loops showing a bimodal distribution of pore sizes in the macro and mesoporous regions the hysteresis loops for am 3 differed from those of the other samples at a low relative pressure range of 0 2 to 0 7 the hysteresis loop was type h2 indicating the presence wide body pores and pores with narrow necks produced by the combination of nanoparticles 51 at a high relative pressure of 0 5 to 1 0 approaching 1 the hysteresis loop was type h3 suggesting the presence of slit like pores caused by the aggregation of two dimensional nanosheets within the microspheres 74 78 the bimodal distribution of pore size was attributed to the inter assemblages of pores derived from the bayerite particles and the inter accumulated pores derived from the hydrotalcite 2d nanosheets the desolation section s pore size distribution curves were determined from the nitrogen isotherms by the barrett joyner halenda process is seen in the fig 5 inset the m and am 1 samples had fewer pores mesopores with a size range of 9 1 14 6 nm and meso macro pores with 5 100 nm in length and 36 5 nm in peak pore diameter conforming the presence of meso and macro pores in the hierarchical porous structure of the am 3 sample the standard pore size pore volume and bet surface areas of the a m am 1 and am 3 samples are listed in table 1 the s bet pore volume and pore size of the am 3 sample were greater which was suggestive of a higher potential phosphate adsorption ability than the other samples 79 3 5 phosphate adsorption process 3 5 1 influence of the al mg molar ratio over phosphate adsorption to examine the outcome of the al mg molar ratio on phosphate adsorption 50 mg of the adsorbents and 20 ml of the phosphate aqueous solution c0 50 mg l 1 without ph modification at 25 c were mixed and the outcomes are displayed in fig 6 the phosphate adsorption increased as magnesium ions concentration increased and the al mg ratio of 1 3 was optimal for phosphate adoption beyond this molar ratio the adsorption capacity of hydrotalcite fell which could result from the decrease in surface area and crystallinity 80 specifically the amount of phosphate adsorbed by the a am 3 and m samples was 17 64 19 36 and 0 64 mg p g respectively with the adsorption of the am 3 sample thus being 1 1 and 30 2 fold larger than that of the a and m samples respectively these results show that am 3 was not simply a mix of the two hydroxide adsorbents but a hydrotalcite structure which was supported by xrd analysis interestingly the adsorption activity of the ldh with a higher molar ratio of al3 showed a decrease in phosphate uptake this may be due to a disorder in the layered hydrotalcite structure or a change in crystal phase arising from ionic radium change among the mg and al 81 in contrast am 3 samples increased adsorption may be the result of a large surface area with more phosphate adsorption active sites the loss of physically adsorbed h2o in the a and m samples and decreased surface and porosity resulting from loosely bonded h2o in the interlaced space due to structural deformation during the high temperature calcination resulted in a decrease in their phosphate adsorption capacity depending on the initial phosphate adsorption results of different ldhs the am 3 sample demonstrated the highest adsorption capacity thus it was optimised for further experiments 3 5 2 effect of hydrothermal preparation time on phosphate adsorption to demonstrate the effect of adsorbent hydrothermal preparation time on phosphate adsorption from wastewater the adsorption experiments of the as synthesized am 3 samples were investigated and the results are shown in fig s5 from our results it is clear that the am 3 samples synthesized for different hydrothermal treatment times exhibited different adsorption properties their adsorption activities increased with increasing hydrothermal time the am 3 adsorbent synthesized at 180 min showed superior phosphate adsorption activity by removal percent after suspension was agitated in a linear shaker with an agitation speed of 250 rpm and a temperature of 25 c for 2 h it is well known that hollow hierarchical structured materials possess high surface area and provide more active sites for the adsorption of pollutants since with increase in time to 180 min an appropriate amount of co3 2 and oh ions are generated from urea which had facilitated in hollow hierarchical structure formation these hollow structured hydrotalcite had enabled diffusion and mass transportation of phosphate ions and to some extent the surface positive charge in hydrotalcite might have influenced the enhanced adsorption process 3 5 3 effect of solution ph and adsorbent dosage on phosphate uptake the cost of the treatment for a pollutant depends on the amount of adsorbent required therefore it was important to look at how much adsorbent was being used and how it effect the phosphate uptake the phosphate recovery for am 3 at different adsorbent dosages 30 150 mg 20 ml with a phosphate concentration of 50 mg l 1 was assessed fig 7a displays that initially an increase in the adsorbent dosage led to higher phosphate uptake probably as a result of the adsorbents higher number of active sites and lower electrostatic potential close to the particle surface which enhances the adsorbent solute synergy 82 however there was a decline in phosphate adsorption at adsorbent dosages higher than 50 mg this may be due to the reduction in compelling force of the phosphate concentration in the aqueous solution as the dosage is increased 83 in addition the agglomeration of adsorbent particles prompts the total compelling adsorption sites and seldom continuously rises with the dosage 84 since the recommended adsorbent dose was 50 mg it was employed in subsequent analysis the ph of the phosphate solution adversely impacts adsorption course by modifying the surface charge and functional groups on an adsorbent for this reason the influence of the solution ph on phosphate uptake was studied by changing the ph within the range of 2 to 10 using 1 0 m hcl or naoh as seen in fig 7b increasing the ph from 2 to 4 resulted in a modest increase in the adsorption capacity which was in accordance with a previous study that found that the adsorption of phosphate is strongly ph dependent 85 when the ph was 4 the phosphate adsorption reached its maximum level of 19 36 mg p g and then decreased by further increase in ph a similar decrease in phosphate adsorption has also been noticed by other investigators under basic conditions 86 88 the chemistry of both the adsorbate and the adsorbent is what causes the difference in the adsorption ability with respect to ph 89 previous thermodynamic calculations have shown that the low phosphate uptake at a higher ph range is associated with the competition between hydroxide ions and phosphate ions for adsorption sites 90 when the ph is high the negatively charged hpo4 2 and po4 3 anions repel the negatively charged phosphate ions via electrostatic attraction 91 the zeta potential as a function of the solution ph before phosphate adsorption was evaluated to explore the surface charge and the findings are displayed in fig s6 the removal of the surface hydroxide groups caused the positive zeta potential of am 3 to steadily drop with an increase in ph which resulted in significantly less electrostatic contact between the phosphate ions and the am 3 surface 52 generally the negatively charged phosphate groups h2po4 and hpo4 2 are attracted to the positively charged exterior of am 3 leading to adsorption through electrostatic attraction 64 3 5 4 effect of coexisting anions on phosphate uptake real waste water systems often contain diverse mixtures of anions and competition with these anions may influence phosphate adsorption therefore cl no3 so4 2 f and co3 2 at a concentration of 0 3 m were individually added to the phosphate solution to examine how they effected the am 3 samples ability to adsorb substances as displayed in fig 8 the cl no3 and so4 2 anions in the aqueous solution enjoy inhibiting response on the adsorption of phosphate indicating that these anions were adsorbed onto the surface of the hydrotalcite over electrostatic interfaces and later form complexes besides it is described that ldhs have a memory response and the carbonate has a precise attraction in solution 92 of the selected anions co3 2 presence reduces the phosphate uptake it was presumed that the presence of free carbonate would lead to the reduction in the uptake of phosphate although the ligand exchange process would have interfered by anions the adsorption capacity is still able to maintain around 75 compared with controlled experiment 93 94 besides when f ions coexisted in the phosphate solution it showed adverse effect and phosphate removal efficiency was reduced by 25 this is due to the competitive adsorption between fluoride and phosphate onto active sites of the am 3 surface similar findings have also been reported by other researchers 95 96 3 5 5 adsorption kinetics study to ascertain the adsorption kinetics of phosphate uptake by the am 3 m and a samples pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich kinetic models were analysed the non linear form of the pseudo first order pseudo second order and the elovich equations are as follows 7 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 8 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t 9 q t 1 β ln αβt 1 where q t mg g and q e correspond to the phosphate adsorption on the adsorbents at time t and at equilibrium respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg 1 min 1 are the rate constants of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models respectively and α g mg 1 min 1 and β g mg 1 are the initial adsorption rate and desorption constant respectively employed for in the elovich kinetic model the fitting of the phosphate adsorption kinetics is displayed in fig 9 and table 2 displays the relevant parameters and interaction coefficients as shown in fig 9a the adsorption capacity of the am 3 adsorbent improved quickly in the initial 20 min and the slope of the adsorption line was very steep after 20 min the adsorption slowly increased till 120 min when the adsorption time was longer than 120 min the adsorption kinetics tended to stabilize and reach an equilibrium as demonstrated in fig 9b d and table 2 the correlation coefficients r 2 for the pseudo second order model 0 959 was higher than that of pseudo first order model 0 865 in am 3 sample it shows that phosphate has been adsorbed onto the hollow hydrotalcite microspheres was the result of the pseudo second order and elovich model r 2 0 991 suggesting that chemisorption or the chemical bonds between the active sites on the adsorbent and the phosphate may govern the adsorption process 97 98 the elovich model posits that phosphate adsorption is a complex diffusion process in a heterogeneous stage with the chemisorption process producing an uneven energy distribution over the adsorbent surface 99 besides the a and m adsorbent did not closely fit the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models indicating a weaker integration between adsorbent and phosphate ions which might be due to the lower specific area and weaker electrostatic attraction 3 5 6 effect of the starting phosphate concentration and adsorption isotherms to optimize the adsorption process was also important to understand the role of the adsorbate concentration in phosphate adsorption therefore 50 mg of am 3 hydrotalcite was added to 20 ml of po4 3 solution with an initial concentration in the range of 10 to 800 mg l 1 and the outcomes are illustrated in fig 10a it was discovered that a rise in concentration of po4 3 caused active sites to be fill up quickly adsorption isotherms are important indicators for the adsorption ability of an adsorbent which is significant information to determine the feasibility of the use of prepared material in real world applications hence to determine the best fitting model the experimental results were validated using the langmuir freundlich and temkin non linear isotherm models eqs 10 12 respectively 10 n n m kc 1 kc 11 n k f c n 12 n b ln ac where n is the amount of phosphate adsorbed at equilibrium n m is the maximum amount of phosphate adsorbed k is the langmuir constant accompanied with the energy of adsorption l mg c is the equilibrium concentration k f is the 1 n constant for system mg g n is linearity constant b is a constant related to the heat of adsorption and a is temkin isotherm constant l g the constants for the isotherm models and the correlation coefficients are presented in table 3 according to the correlation coefficients r 2 the langmuir isotherm model fit the empirical data more closely than did the freundlich model fig 10 k l was within 0 1 range signifying the promising adsorption of phosphate ions 100 considering the outcomes of the langmuir model the theoretical maximum adsorption ability of the am 3 sample for phosphate ions was 94 08 mg p g at room temperature which is higher than m and a samples as discussed in the introduction section this is a first study related to phosphate recovery using mg al hydrotalcite composite with al oh 3 so we compared the phosphate adsorption efficiency of the am 3 sample with previously reported ldh adsorbents and the results are summarized in table 4 our proposed am 3 adsorbent exhibited a competitive phosphate adsorption ability compared with its counterparts suggesting that its recovery efficiency coincides with its physico chemical characteristics with the hierarchical layered hollow structure generated numerous active sites for pollutant adsorption as shown in table 4 there are few ldhs showing higher p adsorption ability but these adsorbents were modified either by compositing with metal oxides or utilization of higher dosage of adsorbent and adsorption time which increased their adsorption capacity in contrast our green synthesized almg based hollow hydrotalcite composite displayed higher phosphate maximum adsorption ability which is of a great interest for achieving higher recovery of phosphate as illustrated in fig 10b and table 3 the theoretical maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of mgo and al2o3 was 58 97 mg p g and 15 71 mg p g respectively these results collectively suggest that our proposed hydrotalcite is an effective adsorbent for the recovery of phosphate to further conform the adsorption process was indeed chemisorption or physical adsorption the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm model was employed and the corresponding equation is represented as follows 13 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 where q e is amount of adsorbate adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbate at equilibrium mg g 1 q m is the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent mg g 1 β is the activity coefficient related to mean free energy of adsorption kj2 mol 2 ɛ is the polanvi potential kj mol 1 which is expressed as ɛ rt ln 1 1 ce where r is universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is kelvin temperature k c e is equilibrium aqueous phase concentration of adsorbate mg l 1 the mean adsorption free energy is calculated using the following equation 14 e 1 2 k the value of e was used to determine the type of adsorption process if the value of e is 8 kj mol then it s a physical adsorption and if the value is between 8 and 16 kj mol then the process is chemisorption 114 115 the calculated d r mean adsorption energy e kj mol for am 3 is 9 kj mol which clearly illustrate the multilayer character involving heterogeneous surfaces with chemical adsorption process the calculated d r maximum adsorption capacities along with r 2 value are tabulated in table s1 3 5 7 adsorption thermodynamics the results of thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the experimental data obtained at five different temperatures 10 to 50 c using eqs 3 6 and the results are shown in fig s7 and tabulated in table s2 the g 0 values obtained in this study is negative implied that the adsorption nature was thermodynamically spontaneous and po4 3 adsorption processes onto am 3 a and m adsorbents the absolute performance for m sample was slightly decreased as the temperature increased while the value of g 0 increased when the temperature augmented for am 3 and a suggesting more adsorbed amount of po4 3 at higher temperatures these obtained results were similar with previous reports on the adsorption of phosphate on ldhs 9 it is generally if the h 0 value is between 20 kj mol and 0 kj mol it is suggested as physisorption process while the h 0 of am 3 is 22 41 kj mol suggesting chemisorption process is more dominant 116 as shown in table s1 a positive value of δh could be observed revealing the endothermic nature of phosphate adsorption on am 3 and a which was in agreement with the increase of adsorption capacity at higher temperatures 117 the negative value of δs demonstrate decreased randomness in the sorption process based on our thermodynamic results it could be assumed that ion exchange and electrostatic attraction were involved in phosphate adsorption 3 5 8 regeneration of adsorbents the recoverability of the am 3 adsorbent was investigated using regeneration test the am 3 sample was centrifuged and cleaned with 0 3 mol l 1 naoh ethanol solution three times as shown in fig 11 the phosphate recovery efficiency fell from 96 8 to 83 5 after four cycles possibly due to the loss of the adsorbent during the washing process nevertheless this recyclability was sufficiently high to avoid the need for energy intensive heat treatment 3 5 9 adsorption mechanism kinetics analysis is important because it can be used to forecast the adsorption recovery rate of a contaminant from an aqueous solution the am 3 adsorbent demonstrated good adsorption affinity for the recovery of phosphate from simulated wastewater because of its novel hierarchical structure and higher bet to further elucidate the adsorption mechanisms of the as prepared am 2 adsorbent fesem ftir and xps analysis was accomplished before and after phosphate adsorption as observed in the fesem image in fig s8 a structural change occurred during the adsorption process with the original hollow structure distorted and the 2d nanosheets surrounding the exterior falling off the surface functional groups on the am 3 adsorbent were also determined before and after phosphate adsorption using ftir analysis fig 12a the strong absorption band at 3392 or 3413 cm 1 was ascribed to the vibrations of oh radicals 118 while the hydroxyl stretching frequency of the sample after adsorption shifted to higher wavenumber this shift was attributed to the phosphate anions interacting with the hydroxyl group the bond at 1638 cm 1 corresponded to oh vibrations suggested the presence of water molecules on the surface 55 the peak at 1355 cm 1 was assigned to the co3 2 species in the interlayer of the hydrotalcite 2d nanosheets possibly due to the introduction of co2 via the dissociation of urea during the hydrothermal process 119 the characteristic peaks for metal oxygen bonding from 1000 cm 1 to 450 cm 1 suggested the presence of a ldh structure on the surface of the hollow hydrotalcite microspheres 120 after adsorption the peak for oh broadened suggesting that the oh competed in the process of adsorption the stretching vibration bands at 650 850 cm 1 corresponded to mg o mg bond and the spike at 546 and 550 cm 1 was a result of stretching mode of alo bond 121 the minor band at 992 cm 1 was assigned to the bending vibrations of the adsorbed phosphate which after the adsorption process distinctly demonstrated the presence of po4 3 bonds in the sample 122 it is assumed that the metal oxygen bonds between the ldh and the oxygen in the functional groups on the hydrotalcite aided a crucial role in the recovery of phosphate 52 the ftir data revealed that the typical adsorption peaks of hydrotalcite were well preserved the absence of the alo and mgo peaks from the fingerprint part indicated the impairment of the layered structure which was consistent with the morphology observed noticed in the fesem image in fig s8 the presence of hydrotalcite structure after phosphate adsorption was also visible in the xrd results fig s9 where ligand complexation between the metal cations in the hydrotalcite and the phosphate ions resulted in a decrease in the 003 and 006 planes intensity which is consistent with previous results 28 123 124 to further elucidate the exact mechanisms responsible for phosphate adsorption the xps spectra for am 3 before and after phosphate adsorption were recorded the high resolution c 1s spectra are presented in fig 12b the c 1s spectrum of am 3 adsorbent before and after phosphate adsorption exhibited two prominent peaks the major peak at 284 6 ev derived due to the hydrocarbon in the background the minor peak at approximately 289 1 ev indicating the existence of co3 2 on the adsorbent surface 125 the decrease in the ratio of metal carbonate was observed after the phosphate adsorption indicating that the carbonate bound to hydrotalcite was replaced by the phosphate through ion and ligand exchange process 45 the de convoluted high resolution o 1s spectrum fig 12c had peaks at 530 0 530 7 531 6 and 532 5 ev before phosphate adsorption which were attributed to m o oh co3 2 and h2o respectively 67 after phosphate adsorption four peaks were observed at 530 2 530 70 531 45 and 532 2 ev representing m o oh co3 2 and h2o respectively 126 the intensity of the o 1s peaks of the adsorbent thus differed after phosphate adsorption 127 in corresponding ratio of m o fell significantly after phosphate adsorption possibly due to the m o interacting with h2o in the aqueous solution to form metal hydroxides 128 in addition the adsorption of phosphate over anion transfer that co3 2 ions accomplish along the interlayer of hydrotalcite perhaps replaced with the anionic phosphate molecules in solution it is important to note that the water in the hydrotalcite is bonded to the interlayer carbonate or surface hydroxyl groups via hydrogen bonds 129 as shown in fig 12d a unique p 2p peak at 133 4 ev was detected after phosphate adsorption the xps results are consistent with those of ftir analysis indicating that phosphate bonding occurred with the carboxylate ions the phosphate ions quickly occupied the adsorption sites on the am 3 surface because of the hollow hydrotalcite morphology and high bet surface area which both increase the mobility of pollutants similar observations have been observed by previous researchers in removal of pollutants 130 131 a comparison of the phosphate adsorption capacity of previously reported hydrotalcites is presented in table 4 the proposed am 3 adsorbent had a greater capacity for phosphate adsorption than the other adsorbents it is apparent that the ph of the solution and the main phosphate species influence the potency of electrostatic attraction it is well known that phosphate in the solution exists in several forms like h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 at the lower ph the dominant phosphate species was h3po4 which seems to be weakly attached to the am 3 surface because of less electrostatic forces the p species changed into h2po4 and hpo4 2 as the ph of the solution rose and the surface of the am 3 was protonated to become positively charged 93 132 thus h2po4 and hpo4 2 were consequently adsorbed on the am 3 and the main mechanism for the enhanced adsorption of the proposed mg al hydrotalcite was likely to have been controlled by the ion exchange chemisorption mechanism and electrostatic forces which agreed with the results of the adsorption kinetic analysis thus represents a promising adsorbent for use in phosphate recovery 4 conclusions in this work hollow mg al based hydrotalcite microspheres composited with al oh 3 were developed using a simple urea induced hydrothermal method and used for phosphate adsorption the mg al molar ratio plays a crucial role in determining the morphology and phosphate adsorption ability the am 3 sample exhibited a higher phosphate adsorption efficiency reaching a highest langmuir theoretical maximum adsorption of 94 08 mg p g which was roughly 1 59 and 5 98 times higher removal efficiency than that of pure mgo and al2o3 samples the phosphate recovery ability of am 3 depended on the ph dosage level contact time and concentration of adsorbate adsorption kinetics reveals pseudo second order model r2 0 959 and langmuir isotherm r2 0 995 were well fitted with experimental results the phosphate adsorption on the surface of am 3 was due to chemisorption between the phosphate and hydroxyl ions besides the phosphate ions adsorbed onto am 3 adsorbent was effectively recovered by 0 3 m naoh solution the proposed urea induced hydrothermal method can be employed to develop novel oxide and hydroxide microstructures with a high surface area for not only phosphate adsorption but also other environmental and biomedical engineering applications credit authorship contribution

12460,the release of untreated phosphate into water systems is of great environmental concern thus many adsorption methods have been developed to deal with this issue in the present paper we prepared magnesium aluminum mg al based hydrotalcite al oh 3 adsorbent with a hierarchical structure using a hydrothermal approach tests were conducted to assess variation in the al mg mole ratio interaction time solution ph competitive adsorption and initial concentration of anions on the uptake of phosphate anions the outcome revealed that 96 8 of phosphate could be adsorbed within 2 h using the sample with an al to mg molar ratio of 1 3 am 3 with langmuir theoretical maximum adsorption rate of 94 08 mg p g at 25 c which is 1 59 and 5 98 times higher than mgo m and al2o3 m samples respectively the equilibrium experiment outcomes were fitted with the isotherm kinetic models and the results confirmed an adsorption mechanism involving surface adsorption that introduced phosphate ions into the layered structure of composite the improved phosphate adsorption on am 3 sample was attributed to the interaction of phosphate and hydroxyl ions during the adsorption according to our experimental findings the hydrotalcite prepared offers a great deal of promise for application as an adsorbent for the recovery of phosphate in environmental remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords green synthesis resource recovery hollow structure hydrotalcite phosphate recovery data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increased industrial use of phosphate combined with its widespread use in fertilizers in the agricultural sector had led to the depletion of its natural reserves in addition the high phosphate concentration in natural water bodies and wastewater due to agricultural and industrial waste has emerged as a major environmental concern 1 3 although phosphate is a crucial ingredient for food production excess levels in water systems can lead to eutrophication unrestrained algae growth higher levels of cyanotoxins and water de oxygenation 4 7 to remediate this serious form of environmental pollution low cost efficient and sustainable methods are required for the recovery of phosphate from agricultural and urban runoff and untreated sanitary and industrial waste 8 this has prompted the development of a variety of treatment processes including ion exchange precipitation oxidation reduction and adsorption to eliminate phosphate from contaminated aqueous systems 9 14 adsorption in particular has attracted significant attention as a successful and affordable method for the recovery of phosphate ions 8 15 for example our research group has sought to optimize materials for environmental remediation purposes and has observed that the surface state of the prepared materials has a strong association with their phosphate recovery efficiency 16 20 thorough considerable advancements have been made in the fabrication of metal oxides and hydroxides for use in phosphate recovery from wastewater 21 22 most hydroxides synthesized using conventional methods such as co precipitation suffer from agglomeration and irregular morphology resulting in a lack of effective adsorption sites and limiting the chemisorption of phosphate as a result 23 indeed the preparation of stable homogeneous metal hydroxides with an accurate size remains a challenge 24 28 however the morphologies have been shown to increase the surface area produce a consistent size distribution and create hierarchal nanostructures with lots of active surfaces 29 32 the hollow micro nanostructured materials with hierarchically porous structure are expected to have better phosphate removal than their nanoparticles counterparts hence up to now great efforts have been dedicated to fabricate hollow structured metal oxides hydroxides for phosphate recovery 33 35 a particularly promising adsorbent is layered double hydroxides ldhs which have a brucite like laminar structure with interlayers of positively charged hydroxide interlayers filled with anions that offer attractive physicochemical characteristics like a large surface area high chemical mechanical cohesion ion exchangeability and a simple preparation method 36 41 in recent years various ldhs have been developed to remove organic and inorganic compounds from polluted water because they offer surface functionalization and good adsorbency 37 42 46 however the adsorption of phosphate by ldhs is typically more effective when combined with low cost porous substances with large surface areas 47 48 in particular the mg al based ldhs have been employed for various environmental applications 49 50 these consist of nearly horizontally packed small or two dimensional ldh crystallites and their synthesis involves multiple steps and a substantial aging time 51 however a significant barrier still exists in the efficient synthesis of ldhs with high phosphate recovery and selectivity 52 54 and little is known about how the recovery of phosphate depends on their physicochemical properties and physical characteristics and the environmental factors as far as we know no study was performed to explore the potential of mg al based hydrotalcite composited along with al oh 3 with a hierarchical hollow structure for enhanced recovery of phosphate from simulated wastewater in the present study we employ a hydrothermal method to prepare al mg based hollow hydrotalcite microspheres consisting of al oh 3 in our experiments urea was used as a source of oh and co3 ions and the ph was varied in the in situ reaction to facilitate the synthesis of the hollow microsphere additionally the outcomes of a series of phosphate adsorption studies covering adsorption kinetics isotherms the response of solution ph dose effects and initial phosphate consolidation were also investigated the hydrotalcite prepared at an al to mg molar ratio of 1 3 am 3 exhibited the highest phosphate adsorption with a recovery of 96 8 and 94 08 mg g 1 langmuir theoretical maximum adsorption capacity the mechanisms associated with this higher phosphate recovery were investigated for the as prepared am 3 ldhs using fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps our findings not only highlight the ability to tune the preparation strategies for the ldhs adsorbent to optimize its phosphate adsorption efficiency in the treatment of wastewater but also demonstrate a new method for the carefully preparing hierarchical hydrotalcite with a hollow microsphere structure 2 experimental 2 1 materials all of the reagents employed in this research were of analytical grade and didn t require further purification throughout the experiments milli q ultrapure double distilled water 18 mω cm at 25 c was employed 2 2 green synthesis of hierarchical hollow mg al based hydrotalcite hydroxide composite microspheres aluminum potassium sulfate dodecahydrate alk so4 2 12h2o 99 urea co nh2 2 99 and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate mgso4 7h2o 99 5 were purchased from duksan co ltd south korea the hollow hierarchical mg al hydrotalcite microspheres were fabricated by the green hydrothermal approach as reported previously with modification 55 in the typical synthesis process 0 49 g of aluminum potassium sulfate dodecahydrate and 0 51 g of urea were mixed in 60 ml of deionized water under magnetic rotation at room temperature for 20 min to produce a clear solution next 0 26 g of magnesium sulfate was combined with the solution and agitated for another 15 min the aqueous solution was put into a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 170 c for 180 min to promote the hydrothermal process once the autoclave had naturally cooled at ambient temperature the white suspension was repeatedly rinsed with ethanol and deionized water to separate out the reacted reagents via centrifugation followed by drying in a hot air oven at 60 c for 8 h samples were prepared with an alk so4 2 12h2o mgso4 7h2o molar ratios of 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 5 1 7 2 1 3 1 5 1 and 7 1 were labelled as am 1 am 2 am 3 am 4 am 5 am 6 am 7 am 8 and am 9 respectively the γ al2o3 and mgo were produced under identical experimental conditions followed by calcination of alooh and mg oh 2 samples at 550 c for 2 h the associated samples were designated a and m respectively 2 3 characterization x ray diffraction xrd analysis of the as prepared hollow microspheres was conducted using rigaku miniflex 600 diffractometer with monochromatized cu k radiation 0 15418 nm the 40 kv and 200 ma were the input current and voltage respectively the average crystallite size of the am 3 sample was determined using

instrument usa before measuring nitrogen adsorption all the samples were degassed at 180 c the pore size distribution was determined using a cylindrical pore model thermo fisher scientific k alpha apparatus was used to conduct the xps measurement the perkin elmer spectrum two ft ir spectrometer usa was used to record the fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir the zeta potential before phosphate adsorption was tested using zetasizer nano from malvern instruments ltd uk for this 0 1 mg l 1 of the am 3 sample was ultrasonically dispersed in deionized water and an aqueous solution of 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh was used to change the ph range from 2 0 to 10 at 25 c aliquots of the am 3 suspensions were tested 3 times to determine the zeta potential 2 4 adsorption analysis solutions with specific concentrations of phosphate were obtained by dissolving kh2po4 sigma aldrich korea ltd in distilled water the adsorption kinetics were carried out by mixing 20 ml of 50 mg l 1 anhydrous kh2po4 standard solution with 50 mg of the as prepared adsorbents in a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube solution without ph adjustment the suspension was agitated in a linear shaker with an agitation speed of 250 rpm and a temperature of 25 c the centrifuge tubes were withdrawn from the agitator after 2 h and a microporous membrane filter with 0 45 μm pore size were employed for removing the adsorbent mixed phosphate solution from the centrifuge tube the molybdate blue method was then used to estimate the phosphate concentration using the ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer dr3900 hach usa at a detection wavelength of 883 nm the phosphate levels at different time intervals were measured and the recovery ratio r was estimated using eqs 1 and 2 1 q e c 0 c e v m 2 r e c 0 c e c 0 x 100 where c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium consolidations of phosphate in the solution at the start and end of the experiment respectively both in mg l 1 v is the volume of the phosphate solution l q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g m is the mass of the as prepared adsorbent mg and r e is the recovery efficiency at the adsorption equilibrium 2 5 adsorption kinetics to investigate the phosphate adsorption kinetics 50 mg of the am 3 adsorbent in 20 0 ml of aqueous phosphate solution 50 mg l 1 was constantly agitated without solution ph adjustment and at certain intervals aliquots were taken filtered and then analysed using a spectrophotometer the experiments were all carried out at ambient temperature 25 1 c the results were fitted with pseudo first order and pseudo second order models 2 6 adsorption equilibrium different concentrations of phosphate ions 10 25 50 100 200 400 500 700 and 800 mg l 1 were dispersed in double distilled water after being reduced from the 800 mg l 1 standard solution the am 3 adsorbent 50 mg was placed in 20 ml of each of the phosphate solutions without solution ph adjustment and agitated for 2 h at a constant temperature of 25 c after filtering the suspended particles a uv spectrophotometer was used to determine the amount of phosphate present in the clear aqueous solution 2 7 response to ph to more clearly understand the mechanisms of underlying phosphate adsorption onto the as prepared adsorbent the impact of the ph on the adsorption process was analysed first 50 mg of am 3 was added to 50 ml conical flasks containing 20 0 ml of an aqueous phosphate solution 50 mg l 1 the starting ph of this solution was fixed between 2 and 10 by adding 1 0 m hcl or 1 0 m naoh solution the equilibrium phosphate adsorption capacity was calculated for each of the starting ph levels using the same experimental process as for the adsorption kinetics analysis described in section 2 6 2 8 desorption analysis adsorption desorption cycle studies were used to examine the reusability of the am 3 adsorbent the as prepared microspheres with adsorbed phosphate were added to 20 ml 0 3 m naoh solution and desorbed for 24 h without ph adjustment the phosphate content of the desorption aqueous solution was then determined the exposed hollow microspheres were then cleaned with weak acid and pure deionized water and reused for the adsorption desorption process 2 9 interference analysis the effect of potential interfering anion on the adsorption of phosphate ions by the am 3 sample was also looked into the same process as described in section 2 4 was employed except with the independent addition of potential competing anions cl 1 so4 2 no3 f and co3 2 to the phosphate solution 50 mg l 1 as sodium salts at a concentration of 0 3 m 2 10 adsorption thermodynamics modelling the thermodynamic characteristics of phosphate adsorption processes on am 3 m and a samples were evaluated by applying thermodynamics parameters and their equations are expressed as follows 3 g 0 r t ln k l 4 k l q e c e 5 g 0 h 0 t s 0 6 ln k l s 0 r h 0 rt where δg 0 is the change in gibb s free energy r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the adsorption temperature k l is the equilibrium constant q e is the adsorption amount in equilibrium state and c e is the concentration in equilibrium state δh 0 is the change in enthalpy and δs 0 is the change in entropy 3 results and discussion 3 1 phase structure and morphology to ascertain the a m and am 3 samples crystal phase composition powder xrd was conducted as shown in fig 1 the diffraction pattern for sample a matched the cubic γ al2o3 phase jcpds card no 10 0425 with diffraction peaks at 19 5 27 2 39 5 46 1 and 67 representing the 111 311 222 400 and 440 crystallographic planes respectively 56 57 no impurities were detected in this sample the diffraction pattern for sample m exhibited peaks at 35 3 43 6 and 63 corresponding to the 111 200 and 220 crystal planes respectively which is in line with the cubic symmetry of mgo jcpds card no 75 0447 58 59 when magnesium sulfate was used as a precursor along with aluminum potassium sulfate in the am 3 sample the diffraction pattern for hydrotalcite jcpds card no 00 048 1023 was observed 60 61 the diffraction peaks were sharp and intense which was indicative of the high crystallinity of the as prepared sample the peaks at 11 6 23 4 34 6 39 5 47 1 60 8 and 62 3 were attributed to 003 006 009 015 018 110 and 113 crystallographic planes respectively of hydrotalcite mg6al2 oh 16co3 4h2o 62 weak diffraction peaks for bayerite jcpds card no 33 0018 were also detected 63 the 003 peak showed a greater intensity than the other peaks suggesting that the as prepared am 3 sample had a hierarchical layered structure 28 the size of the am 3 crystallite was estimated to be 8 7 nm depending on the scherrer formula and the fwhm intensity of the 003 plane the xrd data for the ldh samples were consistent with those presented by previous studies 64 65 the structure of as prepared materials was investigated using fesem fig 2 the fesem images of sample am 3 fig 2a show hollow flower like microspheres consisting of well organized 2d nanosheets the average diameter of the hollow microspheres was determined to be 3 μm fig 2b presents the surface morphology of a single microsphere showing that the microspheres are covered with thin two dimensional 2d nanosheets with 60 75 nm in thickness and width of 1 0 1 5 μm the fesem images indicate that the hydrotalcite had a large surface area which would be favorable for phosphate adsorption fig 2c presents microspheres with a diameter of 3 4 μm size for sample a the higher magnification image in fig 2d of sample a demonstrates that the surface of the microspheres is composed of numerous 2d nanosheets that resemble whiskers and have diameters between 80 and 100 nm and a thickness of about 10 nm a morphology that differs considerably from that of am 3 fig 2e presents a fesem image of sample m showing interconnected sheets and microcrystals with the high magnification image in fig 2f confirming that the 2d nanosheets were broken into smaller pieces possibly due to the diffusion rates during the calcination sample m was thus assumed to have a low surface area and to be unfavorable for use in phosphate adsorption the edx analysis results of sample am 3 is displayed in fig 2g which shows the homogeneous distribution of al mg and o elements within the hollow microspheres the corresponding elemental mapping from eds analysis confirms all the elements were consistently dispersed in the hollow microspheres fig 2h k our results thus demonstrate that hollow hydrotalcite can be quickly and effectively prepared using a hydrothermal method based on urea hydrolysis the hollow structure of the as processed hydrotalcite was examined further using tem and hr tem analysis fig 3a presents a representative tem image of hollow am 3 hollow microspheres which were estimated to be 2 3 μm in size which was consistent with the fesem image shown in fig 2a the interlaced translucent ultrathin 2d nanosheets of the approximate thickness of about 50 70 nm is covered the whole surface of the microspheres the hrtem image revealed fine lattice fringes fig 3b coinciding with crystallographic spacing the distinct lattice fringe of 0 30 nm matches well with the 006 crystallographic planes and 0 7 nm spacing corresponds to the 003 planes of the hydrotalcite crystal lattice confirming that the as prepared am 3 had a hydrotalcite structure 66 a clear boundary was observed between the core and the shell of the hydrotalcite indicating its hollow structure a tem image of an individual 2d nanosheet after electron beam irradiation for 5 min is displayed in fig s1 the image shows that the hydrotalcite 2d nanosheets were sensitive to the high intensity electron beam melting and reforming into small lumpy particles which are shown in the drawn circle in fig s1 this might be a result of the hydroxyl ions being destroyed and the carbonate ions being removed from the hydrotalcite interlayers 3 2 evolution mechanism to explain the formation process for the hollow hierarchical hydrotalcite microspheres a several studies were conducted to ascertain the extent to which the fabrication conditions governed the surface of the hydrotalcite the fesem images in fig 4 present the samples prepared at different time duration early in the reaction 5 min a small particle was obtained with unreacted reagents and fewer 2d nanosheets indicating that the precursor solution was still in the transformation stage from a liquid to a solid stage fig 4a the reagent and urea started to react after 10 min of reaction time and two dimensional nanosheets started to grow however a large number of aggregated spherical microparticles with a rough surface were also observed fig 4b after 30 min the morphology of the sample had not changed significantly see fig 4c but after 60 min the 2d nanosheet structure dominated over the spherical particles with a length of 2 3 μm and a thickness of 200 300 nm fig 4d the length and thickness of the 2d nanosheets further increased as the reaction time increases from 60 to 120 min as illustrated in fig 4e with a rise in reaction time to 180 min hollow microspheres decorated with interconnected two dimensional nanosheets on their surface appeared fig 4f at a longer reaction times up to 720 min this morphology did not change these results collectively show that the formation of the hierarchical hydrotalcite microspheres depends on the preparation time it is known that urea decomposes into ammonia and carbon dioxide at elevated temperatures before the reaction begins consequently stabilizing the ph of the solution 67 in addition the co3 2 and oh ions generated as mineralization agents during urea hydrolysis react with the metal cations which attach to the surface of the ammonia bubble and slowly coagulate into nanoparticles leading to the initial growth of 2d nanosheet over the bubble surface and subsequently to the growth of hollow microspheres decorated with 2d nanosheets 55 68 when experiments were conducted without urea bulk crystalline particles surrounded by smaller microspheres were produced fig s2 these results indicate that the urea in the reaction system was crucial for the formation of the hollow microspheres 3 3 xps analysis to explore more about the surface chemistry and valence state of the freshly prepared am 3 adsorbent both before and after phosphate adsorption xps analysis was performed and the resulting full spectrum is presented in fig s3 both the fresh and used samples contained al mg o and c with a new signal peak for p observed after phosphate adsorption no other elements were detected in either samples confirming the phase purity of the prepared adsorbent generally the peak at around 73 5 ev corresponds to tetrahedral coordinated al3 from aluminum hydroxide the al 2p can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 73 5 and 74 4 ev corresponding to al oh 3 and alo binding energies respectively 69 70 however as shown in fig s4a the prominent al 2p peak in our results shifted to a higher binding energy than that of pure aluminum hydroxide and metal oxygen bonding which can be explained by the chemical interface of mg2 and al3 as a consequence of electronic transfer 71 as illustrated in fig s4b the mg 2p peak was deconvoluted into two peaks at 49 3 ev and 50 4 ev as mgo and mg oh 2 bonding after phosphate adsorption the mg 2p peak could be fitted into four peaks in which the two peaks related to mgo and mg oh 2 with the binding energy at 49 7 ev and 50 8 ev respectively besides two new peaks assigned to mg3 po4 2 and mgpo4 were detected at 51 6 ev and 52 2 ev respectively it is interesting to note that after phosphate adsorption the mg oh 2 and mgo binding energy is shifted 0 4 ev to a higher binding might be due to electron transfer in the valence band as well as the formation of mg o p inner sphere binding 72 73 thus it could be deduced that phosphate anions were combined with the al and mg species on hydrotalcite and formed alp and mgp inner sphere complexation with clear confirmation of phosphate bonding with hydrotalcite 3 4 bet surface area analysis to calculate the surface area pore volume and pore size of the a m am 3 samples nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were performed and the results are shown in fig 5 sample m exhibited a bet type iii isotherm brunauer deming teller classification indicating a weak interaction with n2 and the sample the isotherms for the a am 1 and am 3 samples exhibited type iv hysteresis loops showing a bimodal distribution of pore sizes in the macro and mesoporous regions the hysteresis loops for am 3 differed from those of the other samples at a low relative pressure range of 0 2 to 0 7 the hysteresis loop was type h2 indicating the presence wide body pores and pores with narrow necks produced by the combination of nanoparticles 51 at a high relative pressure of 0 5 to 1 0 approaching 1 the hysteresis loop was type h3 suggesting the presence of slit like pores caused by the aggregation of two dimensional nanosheets within the microspheres 74 78 the bimodal distribution of pore size was attributed to the inter assemblages of pores derived from the bayerite particles and the inter accumulated pores derived from the hydrotalcite 2d nanosheets the desolation section s pore size distribution curves were determined from the nitrogen isotherms by the barrett joyner halenda process is seen in the fig 5 inset the m and am 1 samples had fewer pores mesopores with a size range of 9 1 14 6 nm and meso macro pores with 5 100 nm in length and 36 5 nm in peak pore diameter conforming the presence of meso and macro pores in the hierarchical porous structure of the am 3 sample the standard pore size pore volume and bet surface areas of the a m am 1 and am 3 samples are listed in table 1 the s bet pore volume and pore size of the am 3 sample were greater which was suggestive of a higher potential phosphate adsorption ability than the other samples 79 3 5 phosphate adsorption process 3 5 1 influence of the al mg molar ratio over phosphate adsorption to examine the outcome of the al mg molar ratio on phosphate adsorption 50 mg of the adsorbents and 20 ml of the phosphate aqueous solution c0 50 mg l 1 without ph modification at 25 c were mixed and the outcomes are displayed in fig 6 the phosphate adsorption increased as magnesium ions concentration increased and the al mg ratio of 1 3 was optimal for phosphate adoption beyond this molar ratio the adsorption capacity of hydrotalcite fell which could result from the decrease in surface area and crystallinity 80 specifically the amount of phosphate adsorbed by the a am 3 and m samples was 17 64 19 36 and 0 64 mg p g respectively with the adsorption of the am 3 sample thus being 1 1 and 30 2 fold larger than that of the a and m samples respectively these results show that am 3 was not simply a mix of the two hydroxide adsorbents but a hydrotalcite structure which was supported by xrd analysis interestingly the adsorption activity of the ldh with a higher molar ratio of al3 showed a decrease in phosphate uptake this may be due to a disorder in the layered hydrotalcite structure or a change in crystal phase arising from ionic radium change among the mg and al 81 in contrast am 3 samples increased adsorption may be the result of a large surface area with more phosphate adsorption active sites the loss of physically adsorbed h2o in the a and m samples and decreased surface and porosity resulting from loosely bonded h2o in the interlaced space due to structural deformation during the high temperature calcination resulted in a decrease in their phosphate adsorption capacity depending on the initial phosphate adsorption results of different ldhs the am 3 sample demonstrated the highest adsorption capacity thus it was optimised for further experiments 3 5 2 effect of hydrothermal preparation time on phosphate adsorption to demonstrate the effect of adsorbent hydrothermal preparation time on phosphate adsorption from wastewater the adsorption experiments of the as synthesized am 3 samples were investigated and the results are shown in fig s5 from our results it is clear that the am 3 samples synthesized for different hydrothermal treatment times exhibited different adsorption properties their adsorption activities increased with increasing hydrothermal time the am 3 adsorbent synthesized at 180 min showed superior phosphate adsorption activity by removal percent after suspension was agitated in a linear shaker with an agitation speed of 250 rpm and a temperature of 25 c for 2 h it is well known that hollow hierarchical structured materials possess high surface area and provide more active sites for the adsorption of pollutants since with increase in time to 180 min an appropriate amount of co3 2 and oh ions are generated from urea which had facilitated in hollow hierarchical structure formation these hollow structured hydrotalcite had enabled diffusion and mass transportation of phosphate ions and to some extent the surface positive charge in hydrotalcite might have influenced the enhanced adsorption process 3 5 3 effect of solution ph and adsorbent dosage on phosphate uptake the cost of the treatment for a pollutant depends on the amount of adsorbent required therefore it was important to look at how much adsorbent was being used and how it effect the phosphate uptake the phosphate recovery for am 3 at different adsorbent dosages 30 150 mg 20 ml with a phosphate concentration of 50 mg l 1 was assessed fig 7a displays that initially an increase in the adsorbent dosage led to higher phosphate uptake probably as a result of the adsorbents higher number of active sites and lower electrostatic potential close to the particle surface which enhances the adsorbent solute synergy 82 however there was a decline in phosphate adsorption at adsorbent dosages higher than 50 mg this may be due to the reduction in compelling force of the phosphate concentration in the aqueous solution as the dosage is increased 83 in addition the agglomeration of adsorbent particles prompts the total compelling adsorption sites and seldom continuously rises with the dosage 84 since the recommended adsorbent dose was 50 mg it was employed in subsequent analysis the ph of the phosphate solution adversely impacts adsorption course by modifying the surface charge and functional groups on an adsorbent for this reason the influence of the solution ph on phosphate uptake was studied by changing the ph within the range of 2 to 10 using 1 0 m hcl or naoh as seen in fig 7b increasing the ph from 2 to 4 resulted in a modest increase in the adsorption capacity which was in accordance with a previous study that found that the adsorption of phosphate is strongly ph dependent 85 when the ph was 4 the phosphate adsorption reached its maximum level of 19 36 mg p g and then decreased by further increase in ph a similar decrease in phosphate adsorption has also been noticed by other investigators under basic conditions 86 88 the chemistry of both the adsorbate and the adsorbent is what causes the difference in the adsorption ability with respect to ph 89 previous thermodynamic calculations have shown that the low phosphate uptake at a higher ph range is associated with the competition between hydroxide ions and phosphate ions for adsorption sites 90 when the ph is high the negatively charged hpo4 2 and po4 3 anions repel the negatively charged phosphate ions via electrostatic attraction 91 the zeta potential as a function of the solution ph before phosphate adsorption was evaluated to explore the surface charge and the findings are displayed in fig s6 the removal of the surface hydroxide groups caused the positive zeta potential of am 3 to steadily drop with an increase in ph which resulted in significantly less electrostatic contact between the phosphate ions and the am 3 surface 52 generally the negatively charged phosphate groups h2po4 and hpo4 2 are attracted to the positively charged exterior of am 3 leading to adsorption through electrostatic attraction 64 3 5 4 effect of coexisting anions on phosphate uptake real waste water systems often contain diverse mixtures of anions and competition with these anions may influence phosphate adsorption therefore cl no3 so4 2 f and co3 2 at a concentration of 0 3 m were individually added to the phosphate solution to examine how they effected the am 3 samples ability to adsorb substances as displayed in fig 8 the cl no3 and so4 2 anions in the aqueous solution enjoy inhibiting response on the adsorption of phosphate indicating that these anions were adsorbed onto the surface of the hydrotalcite over electrostatic interfaces and later form complexes besides it is described that ldhs have a memory response and the carbonate has a precise attraction in solution 92 of the selected anions co3 2 presence reduces the phosphate uptake it was presumed that the presence of free carbonate would lead to the reduction in the uptake of phosphate although the ligand exchange process would have interfered by anions the adsorption capacity is still able to maintain around 75 compared with controlled experiment 93 94 besides when f ions coexisted in the phosphate solution it showed adverse effect and phosphate removal efficiency was reduced by 25 this is due to the competitive adsorption between fluoride and phosphate onto active sites of the am 3 surface similar findings have also been reported by other researchers 95 96 3 5 5 adsorption kinetics study to ascertain the adsorption kinetics of phosphate uptake by the am 3 m and a samples pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich kinetic models were analysed the non linear form of the pseudo first order pseudo second order and the elovich equations are as follows 7 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 8 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t 9 q t 1 β ln αβt 1 where q t mg g and q e correspond to the phosphate adsorption on the adsorbents at time t and at equilibrium respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg 1 min 1 are the rate constants of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models respectively and α g mg 1 min 1 and β g mg 1 are the initial adsorption rate and desorption constant respectively employed for in the elovich kinetic model the fitting of the phosphate adsorption kinetics is displayed in fig 9 and table 2 displays the relevant parameters and interaction coefficients as shown in fig 9a the adsorption capacity of the am 3 adsorbent improved quickly in the initial 20 min and the slope of the adsorption line was very steep after 20 min the adsorption slowly increased till 120 min when the adsorption time was longer than 120 min the adsorption kinetics tended to stabilize and reach an equilibrium as demonstrated in fig 9b d and table 2 the correlation coefficients r 2 for the pseudo second order model 0 959 was higher than that of pseudo first order model 0 865 in am 3 sample it shows that phosphate has been adsorbed onto the hollow hydrotalcite microspheres was the result of the pseudo second order and elovich model r 2 0 991 suggesting that chemisorption or the chemical bonds between the active sites on the adsorbent and the phosphate may govern the adsorption process 97 98 the elovich model posits that phosphate adsorption is a complex diffusion process in a heterogeneous stage with the chemisorption process producing an uneven energy distribution over the adsorbent surface 99 besides the a and m adsorbent did not closely fit the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models indicating a weaker integration between adsorbent and phosphate ions which might be due to the lower specific area and weaker electrostatic attraction 3 5 6 effect of the starting phosphate concentration and adsorption isotherms to optimize the adsorption process was also important to understand the role of the adsorbate concentration in phosphate adsorption therefore 50 mg of am 3 hydrotalcite was added to 20 ml of po4 3 solution with an initial concentration in the range of 10 to 800 mg l 1 and the outcomes are illustrated in fig 10a it was discovered that a rise in concentration of po4 3 caused active sites to be fill up quickly adsorption isotherms are important indicators for the adsorption ability of an adsorbent which is significant information to determine the feasibility of the use of prepared material in real world applications hence to determine the best fitting model the experimental results were validated using the langmuir freundlich and temkin non linear isotherm models eqs 10 12 respectively 10 n n m kc 1 kc 11 n k f c n 12 n b ln ac where n is the amount of phosphate adsorbed at equilibrium n m is the maximum amount of phosphate adsorbed k is the langmuir constant accompanied with the energy of adsorption l mg c is the equilibrium concentration k f is the 1 n constant for system mg g n is linearity constant b is a constant related to the heat of adsorption and a is temkin isotherm constant l g the constants for the isotherm models and the correlation coefficients are presented in table 3 according to the correlation coefficients r 2 the langmuir isotherm model fit the empirical data more closely than did the freundlich model fig 10 k l was within 0 1 range signifying the promising adsorption of phosphate ions 100 considering the outcomes of the langmuir model the theoretical maximum adsorption ability of the am 3 sample for phosphate ions was 94 08 mg p g at room temperature which is higher than m and a samples as discussed in the introduction section this is a first study related to phosphate recovery using mg al hydrotalcite composite with al oh 3 so we compared the phosphate adsorption efficiency of the am 3 sample with previously reported ldh adsorbents and the results are summarized in table 4 our proposed am 3 adsorbent exhibited a competitive phosphate adsorption ability compared with its counterparts suggesting that its recovery efficiency coincides with its physico chemical characteristics with the hierarchical layered hollow structure generated numerous active sites for pollutant adsorption as shown in table 4 there are few ldhs showing higher p adsorption ability but these adsorbents were modified either by compositing with metal oxides or utilization of higher dosage of adsorbent and adsorption time which increased their adsorption capacity in contrast our green synthesized almg based hollow hydrotalcite composite displayed higher phosphate maximum adsorption ability which is of a great interest for achieving higher recovery of phosphate as illustrated in fig 10b and table 3 the theoretical maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of mgo and al2o3 was 58 97 mg p g and 15 71 mg p g respectively these results collectively suggest that our proposed hydrotalcite is an effective adsorbent for the recovery of phosphate to further conform the adsorption process was indeed chemisorption or physical adsorption the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm model was employed and the corresponding equation is represented as follows 13 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 where q e is amount of adsorbate adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbate at equilibrium mg g 1 q m is the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent mg g 1 β is the activity coefficient related to mean free energy of adsorption kj2 mol 2 ɛ is the polanvi potential kj mol 1 which is expressed as ɛ rt ln 1 1 ce where r is universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is kelvin temperature k c e is equilibrium aqueous phase concentration of adsorbate mg l 1 the mean adsorption free energy is calculated using the following equation 14 e 1 2 k the value of e was used to determine the type of adsorption process if the value of e is 8 kj mol then it s a physical adsorption and if the value is between 8 and 16 kj mol then the process is chemisorption 114 115 the calculated d r mean adsorption energy e kj mol for am 3 is 9 kj mol which clearly illustrate the multilayer character involving heterogeneous surfaces with chemical adsorption process the calculated d r maximum adsorption capacities along with r 2 value are tabulated in table s1 3 5 7 adsorption thermodynamics the results of thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the experimental data obtained at five different temperatures 10 to 50 c using eqs 3 6 and the results are shown in fig s7 and tabulated in table s2 the g 0 values obtained in this study is negative implied that the adsorption nature was thermodynamically spontaneous and po4 3 adsorption processes onto am 3 a and m adsorbents the absolute performance for m sample was slightly decreased as the temperature increased while the value of g 0 increased when the temperature augmented for am 3 and a suggesting more adsorbed amount of po4 3 at higher temperatures these obtained results were similar with previous reports on the adsorption of phosphate on ldhs 9 it is generally if the h 0 value is between 20 kj mol and 0 kj mol it is suggested as physisorption process while the h 0 of am 3 is 22 41 kj mol suggesting chemisorption process is more dominant 116 as shown in table s1 a positive value of δh could be observed revealing the endothermic nature of phosphate adsorption on am 3 and a which was in agreement with the increase of adsorption capacity at higher temperatures 117 the negative value of δs demonstrate decreased randomness in the sorption process based on our thermodynamic results it could be assumed that ion exchange and electrostatic attraction were involved in phosphate adsorption 3 5 8 regeneration of adsorbents the recoverability of the am 3 adsorbent was investigated using regeneration test the am 3 sample was centrifuged and cleaned with 0 3 mol l 1 naoh ethanol solution three times as shown in fig 11 the phosphate recovery efficiency fell from 96 8 to 83 5 after four cycles possibly due to the loss of the adsorbent during the washing process nevertheless this recyclability was sufficiently high to avoid the need for energy intensive heat treatment 3 5 9 adsorption mechanism kinetics analysis is important because it can be used to forecast the adsorption recovery rate of a contaminant from an aqueous solution the am 3 adsorbent demonstrated good adsorption affinity for the recovery of phosphate from simulated wastewater because of its novel hierarchical structure and higher bet to further elucidate the adsorption mechanisms of the as prepared am 2 adsorbent fesem ftir and xps analysis was accomplished before and after phosphate adsorption as observed in the fesem image in fig s8 a structural change occurred during the adsorption process with the original hollow structure distorted and the 2d nanosheets surrounding the exterior falling off the surface functional groups on the am 3 adsorbent were also determined before and after phosphate adsorption using ftir analysis fig 12a the strong absorption band at 3392 or 3413 cm 1 was ascribed to the vibrations of oh radicals 118 while the hydroxyl stretching frequency of the sample after adsorption shifted to higher wavenumber this shift was attributed to the phosphate anions interacting with the hydroxyl group the bond at 1638 cm 1 corresponded to oh vibrations suggested the presence of water molecules on the surface 55 the peak at 1355 cm 1 was assigned to the co3 2 species in the interlayer of the hydrotalcite 2d nanosheets possibly due to the introduction of co2 via the dissociation of urea during the hydrothermal process 119 the characteristic peaks for metal oxygen bonding from 1000 cm 1 to 450 cm 1 suggested the presence of a ldh structure on the surface of the hollow hydrotalcite microspheres 120 after adsorption the peak for oh broadened suggesting that the oh competed in the process of adsorption the stretching vibration bands at 650 850 cm 1 corresponded to mg o mg bond and the spike at 546 and 550 cm 1 was a result of stretching mode of alo bond 121 the minor band at 992 cm 1 was assigned to the bending vibrations of the adsorbed phosphate which after the adsorption process distinctly demonstrated the presence of po4 3 bonds in the sample 122 it is assumed that the metal oxygen bonds between the ldh and the oxygen in the functional groups on the hydrotalcite aided a crucial role in the recovery of phosphate 52 the ftir data revealed that the typical adsorption peaks of hydrotalcite were well preserved the absence of the alo and mgo peaks from the fingerprint part indicated the impairment of the layered structure which was consistent with the morphology observed noticed in the fesem image in fig s8 the presence of hydrotalcite structure after phosphate adsorption was also visible in the xrd results fig s9 where ligand complexation between the metal cations in the hydrotalcite and the phosphate ions resulted in a decrease in the 003 and 006 planes intensity which is consistent with previous results 28 123 124 to further elucidate the exact mechanisms responsible for phosphate adsorption the xps spectra for am 3 before and after phosphate adsorption were recorded the high resolution c 1s spectra are presented in fig 12b the c 1s spectrum of am 3 adsorbent before and after phosphate adsorption exhibited two prominent peaks the major peak at 284 6 ev derived due to the hydrocarbon in the background the minor peak at approximately 289 1 ev indicating the existence of co3 2 on the adsorbent surface 125 the decrease in the ratio of metal carbonate was observed after the phosphate adsorption indicating that the carbonate bound to hydrotalcite was replaced by the phosphate through ion and ligand exchange process 45 the de convoluted high resolution o 1s spectrum fig 12c had peaks at 530 0 530 7 531 6 and 532 5 ev before phosphate adsorption which were attributed to m o oh co3 2 and h2o respectively 67 after phosphate adsorption four peaks were observed at 530 2 530 70 531 45 and 532 2 ev representing m o oh co3 2 and h2o respectively 126 the intensity of the o 1s peaks of the adsorbent thus differed after phosphate adsorption 127 in corresponding ratio of m o fell significantly after phosphate adsorption possibly due to the m o interacting with h2o in the aqueous solution to form metal hydroxides 128 in addition the adsorption of phosphate over anion transfer that co3 2 ions accomplish along the interlayer of hydrotalcite perhaps replaced with the anionic phosphate molecules in solution it is important to note that the water in the hydrotalcite is bonded to the interlayer carbonate or surface hydroxyl groups via hydrogen bonds 129 as shown in fig 12d a unique p 2p peak at 133 4 ev was detected after phosphate adsorption the xps results are consistent with those of ftir analysis indicating that phosphate bonding occurred with the carboxylate ions the phosphate ions quickly occupied the adsorption sites on the am 3 surface because of the hollow hydrotalcite morphology and high bet surface area which both increase the mobility of pollutants similar observations have been observed by previous researchers in removal of pollutants 130 131 a comparison of the phosphate adsorption capacity of previously reported hydrotalcites is presented in table 4 the proposed am 3 adsorbent had a greater capacity for phosphate adsorption than the other adsorbents it is apparent that the ph of the solution and the main phosphate species influence the potency of electrostatic attraction it is well known that phosphate in the solution exists in several forms like h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 at the lower ph the dominant phosphate species was h3po4 which seems to be weakly attached to the am 3 surface because of less electrostatic forces the p species changed into h2po4 and hpo4 2 as the ph of the solution rose and the surface of the am 3 was protonated to become positively charged 93 132 thus h2po4 and hpo4 2 were consequently adsorbed on the am 3 and the main mechanism for the enhanced adsorption of the proposed mg al hydrotalcite was likely to have been controlled by the ion exchange chemisorption mechanism and electrostatic forces which agreed with the results of the adsorption kinetic analysis thus represents a promising adsorbent for use in phosphate recovery 4 conclusions in this work hollow mg al based hydrotalcite microspheres composited with al oh 3 were developed using a simple urea induced hydrothermal method and used for phosphate adsorption the mg al molar ratio plays a crucial role in determining the morphology and phosphate adsorption ability the am 3 sample exhibited a higher phosphate adsorption efficiency reaching a highest langmuir theoretical maximum adsorption of 94 08 mg p g which was roughly 1 59 and 5 98 times higher removal efficiency than that of pure mgo and al2o3 samples the phosphate recovery ability of am 3 depended on the ph dosage level contact time and concentration of adsorbate adsorption kinetics reveals pseudo second order model r2 0 959 and langmuir isotherm r2 0 995 were well fitted with experimental results the phosphate adsorption on the surface of am 3 was due to chemisorption between the phosphate and hydroxyl ions besides the phosphate ions adsorbed onto am 3 adsorbent was effectively recovered by 0 3 m naoh solution the proposed urea induced hydrothermal method can be employed to develop novel oxide and hydroxide microstructures with a high surface area for not only phosphate adsorption but also other environmental and biomedical engineering applications credit authorship contribution

12461,hydrolytic acidification integrated with denitrification den presents a promising treatment strategy for high temperature industrial wastewater such as oil leather and ethanol wastewater this study aimed to investigate the synergistic influence of temperature and the cod no3 n ratio on the nitrogen reduction pathway using a series of semi continuous flow reactors the results revealed that the optimal total nitrogen tn removal performance was achieved under thermophilic t 60 c and cod no3 n ratio of 37 with the highest tn reduction amount of 594 3 41 8 mg l however under other conditions the tn removal efficiency reduced due to nh4 n accumulation higher temperature facilitated the nitrogen reduction rate and butyrate yield rate while inhibiting the dissimilatory reduction to ammonium dnra process to 20 7 furthermore the higher temperature increased the bacterial diversity and the relative abundances of clostridium acidaminococcus and ruminococcus thus enhancing organic matter hydrolysis and nitrogen removal efficiency in contrast carnobacterium with percentage account of 34 4 was only detected under thermophilic conditions with a low cod no3 n ratio the cod no3 n ratio only generated a slight effect on the production of volatile fatty acids vfas and nitrogen reduction pathways but had significant influence on the microbial community these findings provide novel insight into the implementation of hydrolysis acidification coupled with anaerobic denitrification process in thermophilic wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ethanol wastewater nitrogen removal thermophilic denitrification dnra microbial community data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is considered as an attractive and sustainable technology in the treatment of wastewater with high cod concentrations 1 it delivers energy saving 2 carbon degradation 3 and energy reclaim in a synchronized way 4 however ammonia nitrogen accumulation in nitrogen abundant wastewater is detrimental to ad efficiency which requires further treatment technologies 5 6 co degradation of carbon and nitrate where methanogenesis and denitrification den simultaneously occur in the refluxed digestive fluid is regarded as cost effective technology as shortened treatment process 7 volatile fatty acids vfas are important intermediates from anaerobic acidification of carbon source in wastewater and its yield can be promoted with higher temperature exerted 8 vfas also act as the electron donor for denitrifying bacteria to support simultaneous denitrification 9 according to previous research the nitrogen removal efficiency via denitrification reaches approximately 60 in a reactor with heterotrophic denitrifies and anaerobic acidogenesis 10 these findings undoubtedly make great contributions to eliminate the negative impact of nitrogen accumulation during the ad process many studies have been conducted to make insightful understanding of main factors and improve the efficiency of organic acidification and nitrate reduction during the ad process temperature species of carbon source and cod no3 n ratio were 3 keys that determined the ad process 11 higher temperature promotes the hydrolysis and acidification of complex organics and the production of vfas 12 as previous report shows the produced carbon sources in anaerobic bioreactors under thermophilic conditions 55 c successfully improved the nitrogen removal efficiencies from 74 2 5 9 at 20 c to 85 9 5 0 at 50 c 13 furthermore the characteristics of the organic matter are also one of the key factors affecting the efficiency of nitrogen removal easily biodegradable carbon sources with small molecule are regarded as more effective electron donors which enhances nitrogen removal performance 14 a maximum ammonium nitrogen reduction efficiency of 92 1 was observed in ethanol supported systems compared with sodium succinate 71 5 and glucose 66 9 supported systems 15 tang et al 2018 found that the fermentation of lactic acid enriched liquid fared well in the long term denitrification process 16 moreover the imbalance of the cod no3 n ratio mainly affects the nitrogen reduction efficiency under lower c n ratio 2 86 the denitrification process was inhibited due to the lack of carbon source whereas higher c n ratio would cause a shift from denitrification to the dissimilatory reduction to ammonium dnra 17 akunna et al 1992 indicated that the denitrification process was observed only at cod no3 n 8 86 whereas dnra was the main nitrate and nitrite reduction pathway at cod no3 n 53 18 as the cod no3 n ratio increased from 2 5 to 30 the dnra rate was promoted due to the 6 mol electrons were received and reduced to 1 mol no2 in the dnra process whereas only 3 mol electrons were needed in the denitrification process 19 therefore suitable reaction conditions determine the efficiency of the simultaneous removal of carbon and nitrogen in ad process some previous studies have elucidated the influences of the cod no3 n ratio and carbon sources on nitrate reduction coupled with anaerobic digestion under mesophilic conditions 20 however most studies were carried out under mesophilic conditions few studies conducted the transformation mechanisms of organic matter and nitrogen simultaneous acidification and denitrification under thermophilic conditions considering the high temperature 70 90 c property of industrial wastewater such as oil leather and ethanol wastewater thermophilic denitrification ranging from 40 to 60 c with a high nitrogen removal efficiency and lower retention time was recommended 21 22 furthermore temperature had a prior role in both the acidification process and nitrogen reduction process the effect of temperature on the acidification process further influenced the kinds of carbon sources produced which affected the reduction of nitrogen currently the synergistic influence of temperature and the cod no3 n ratio on nitrate reduction pathways and anaerobic acidification is still unknown this problem constrains the treatment efficiency of high temperature industrial wastewater with high carbon and nitrogen concentrations the organic matters and nitrogen from cassava alcohol wastewater can be simultaneously removed by reflowing the aerobic nitrification effluent to the anaerobic acid production phase the optimization of the reaction conditions to achieve a high removal efficiency is of great importance in this study the synergistic effects of temperature 35 and 60 c and the cod no3 n ratio 37 and 62 on nitrogen removal and the transformation between different forms of nitrogen were investigated in semi continuous flow reactors batch tests were designed to identify the no3 n reduction pathway and the acid fermentation process under corresponding temperature and the cod no3 n ratio the proportion of vfa species utilized by dnra and by denitrification processes was compared based on the results of batch tests meanwhile the potential mechanism of microbial metabolism and nitrate removal pathway underlying the synergistic effects of temperature and cod no3 n ratio was also revealed via the investigation of the microbial community the results of this study clarified the synergistic influence of temperature and the cod no3 n ratio on nitrate reduction pathways enhanced understanding of the influence of different cod no3 n ratios and temperatures on acidification and nitrogen reduction processes provide essential guides for improving the efficiency of industrial wastewater with higher carbon and nitrogen concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operational conditions the inoculum sludge was obtained from an anaerobic internal circulation ic reactor from a paper making plant in jiangsu china the raw cassava stillage cs was gotten from an ethanol plant in jiangsu china it contains high amount of tcod 73 200 mg l and scod 40 800 mg l and the detailed characteristics is summarized in table s1 the adjustment of cod no3 n ratios was delivered by adding different amount of nano3 2 2 batch experiments cassava alcohol wastewater is discharged from alcohol distillation towers at 70 90 c whereas the reduction pathway of nitrate at high temperature 55 60 c conditions has rarely been reported therefore in this study batch experiments were conducted to investigate the nitrate reduction pathway with different cod no3 n ratios under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions a series of 500 ml serum bottles with anaerobic granular sludge 50 ml and cs 250 ml were employed as reactors and then the reactors were diluted to a required volume by ultrapure water the cod no3 n ratio were set to 37 and 62 by adding 5 m nano3 the temperature of reactors both at the cod no3 n ratio of 37 and 62 was stabilized at 35 c and 60 c in a constant temperature water bath shaker at a rotation speed of 110 rpm the initial ph was adjusted to 8 0 0 1 by adding 5 m naoh the argon was purged into each bottle for 1 min to prepare an oxygen limited atmosphere for the reaction system a blank group was also set at the same time without nano3 addition during the processing period 15 ml samples were obtained for analysis every 12 h 2 3 semicontinuous experiments in order to investigate the long term operating effects of the reactor a semicontinuous assay was conducted in a series of 300 ml serum bottles the cassava stillage and sludge were completely mixed in the reactors with initial tcod and scod concentrations reached to 40 000 43 000 mg l and 22 000 24 000 mg l respectively both the hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt were set to 3 days and the total solids ts and volatile solids vs concentrations were kept to 52 8 g l and 39 1 g l respectively two blank groups were set up for comparison without nano3 introduction under mesophilic conditions t 35 c and thermophilic conditions t 60 c the cod no3 n in the reactors was controlled to 37 5 and 62 5 under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions by adding different amounts of nano3 reactors with different cod no3 n ratios were conducted under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions the four experimental groups were reactor i t 35 c cod no3 n 37 reactor ii t 35 c cod no3 n 62 reactor iii t 60 c cod no3 n 37 and reactor iv t 60 c cod no3 n 62 to further observe the long term effect of denitrification coupled with anaerobic acidification in the treatment of cassava alcohol wastewater all reactors were operated for 66 days during this period volatile fatty acids vfas and different forms of nitrogen including tn no3 n no2 n and nh4 n were measured for consecutive days 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 measurement of ts vs cod tn nh4 n and vfas the measurements of cod tn nh4 n ts and vs referred to standard methods 23 the species and concentrations of vfas were qualified and quantified by a gas chromatography agilent 7820n thermofisher scientific ma usa the as tested samples were first centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 10 min followed by filtered by a 0 45 μm filter membrane before measurements 2 4 2 measurement of no3 n and no2 n the no3 n and no2 n were determined by a dionex ics 3000 ion chromatograph equipped with two sets of columns and two conductance detectors for the separation and detection of cations and anions during detection cations and anions were simultaneously injected and analyzed the anion column included a guard column ag11 hc 4 50 mm the anion eluent was 18 mm koh with the flow rate of gradient pump set to 1 0 ml min the cation chromatography column also includes a guard column the column type is cg12a 4 50 mm and the cation eluent is 20 mm methanesulfonic acid the gradient pump flow speed was 1 0 ml min the injection volume of the ion chromatography was 1 ml and the background current was suppressed by the automatic suppression mode 2 4 3 16s rdna when the semicontinuous flow reactor was stably operating 1 5 ml mixed samples were obtained from the reactors with medium high temperature blanks cod no3 n of 37 5 and 62 5 for reactor microbial colony analysis centrifuging at 12000 g was used to separate dna from the bacterial mix for 5 min at 4 c and dna was further extracted by qiaamp dna extraction kit qiagen germany dna concentration and integrity were measures by agarose electrophoresis and a qubit 2 0 dna assay ki was employed to quantify genomic dna the primers used for the pcr were fused with the miseq sequencing platform universal primers was provided for pcr and its 16s rdna sequencing were 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc the corresponding pcr products underwent agarose electrophoresis later while the dna was reclaimed by an omega gel extraction kit cat d2500 01 and quantified by qubit 2 0 all samples were fully and evenly mixed at a ratio of 1 1 based on the dna concentration analyzed and the sample library construction sequencing tag addition and sequencing was performed subsequently 2 4 4 statistical analysis in this study all batch experiments were conducted in triplicate the significance of the results were assessed by analysis of variance anova and p 0 05 was considered to significant results 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate reduction and conversion during long term operation to compare the nitrogen removal performances at different cod no3 n ratios under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions the concentration variations in tn no2 n no3 n and nh4 n during the operation period are shown in fig 1 the tn removal efficiency increased swiftly at the early time and then grew into stabilization after a short start up period within 10 days in thermophilic reactors whereas in mesophilic reactors the start up period was delayed to 19 days this demonstrated that microorganisms are more likely to stabilize in a thermophilic environment the tn removal efficiency increased from 45 8 11 5 mesophilic conditions to 63 7 11 3 thermophilic conditions at cod no3 n ratio of 37 same trend was also observed at cod no3 n ratio of 62 fig 1a the tn removal efficiency increased in response to the rising temperature this phenomenon might be attributed to the finding that the microbial communities more easily adapted under thermophilic conditions a previous study also indicated that the nitrate removal rate increased with increasing temperature from 30 c to 50 c 24 the dominant denitrifies such as truepera azoarcus and elioraea were enriched under thermophilic conditions 25 as the cod no3 n ratio climbed from 37 to 62 under mesophilic conditions the removed tn amount reached to 490 2 153 1 mg l and 301 0 54 5 mg l respectively similarly the removed tn amount under thermophilic condition also reached to 594 3 41 8 mg l and 331 9 69 0 mg l respectively higher tn removal performance was achieved in reactors with lower cod no3 n despite thermophilic or mesophilic environments therefore the highest tn removal efficiency was achieved in reactor iii t 60 c cod no3 n 37 which indicated that a lower cod no3 n ratio accompanied by thermophilic conditions facilitated tn removal performance the flows of no2 n no3 n and nh4 n were analyzed to deduce the nitrate reduction pathway as shown in fig 1b no3 n was completely reduced in all reactors both with the cod no3 n ratio was 37 or 62 however the no2 n and nh4 n accumulation occurred almost in all reactors the no2 n accumulation was attributed to the large amount of no3 n to no2 n conversion which delivered by denitrifying bacteria using biodegradable carbon sources generated in the acidification process 26 however the nh4 n accumulation significantly fluctuated under mesophilic conditions higher concentration was appeared during the first 15 days and then the nh4 n accumulation decreased to relatively lower level during the subsequent 15 66 days compared with the process of no2 n accumulation nh4 n accumulation accounted for a larger part in the effluent of the four tested reactors from i to iv with average concentrations of 68 2 36 9 mg l 67 5 38 5 mg l 11 6 12 4 mg l and 24 8 29 6 mg l respectively partially reduction of nh4 n by dnra in the culture contributing to less no2 n accumulation could an answer to this observation previous results also revealed that the no2 n generated in the acidification phase could be reduced under mesophilic conditions 35 c but that nh4 n accumulation also occurred due to the dnra process 10 under thermophilic conditions nh4 n accumulation was effectively alleviated which indicated that no3 n was eventually reduced to nitrogen and released wang et al 2020 also indicated that dnra occurred at temperatures varying from 5 c to 35 c with the rate exponentially increasing as the temperature was elevated 27 3 2 vfa profiles during long term operation vfas are produced through the anaerobic acidification process and serve as electron donors for no3 n reduction 28 fig 2 shows the changes in the main vfas profiles acetate propionate and butyrate with or without no3 n introduction under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions the vfas production came to a plateau after 15 19 days of continuous operation similar trend shared by nitrogen removal in the nitrate free culture the yield of specific vfas species followed the sequence of propionate 2743 3 183 1 mg l acetate 1388 4 171 6 mg l and butyrate 1519 1 174 2 mg l under mesophilic conditions and the sequence of butyrate 3797 7 447 1 mg l propionate 626 4 73 2 mg l and acetate 921 0 359 1 mg l under thermophilic conditions the differences observed in vfas yield implied that higher temperature inhibited the yield of acetate and propionate but promoted the production of butyrate zhang et al 2019 also determined that the yield of acetate from waste activated sludge was at 35 c was approximately 1 5 fold that at 55 c 29 in the reactors with nitrate introduction cod no3 n ratio 37 the concentration of butyrate decreased to 395 6 104 1 and 737 3 172 4 mg l under mesophilic conditions and thermophilic conditions respectively propionate consumption followed the second order and the decreased concentration varied with fermentation temperature acetate became the dominant species and the increased concentration share ranged from 45 7 to 56 1 compared to the values in the blank groups at the corresponding temperature conditions the above results indicated that the introduction of nitrate altered the dominant vfas species from butyrate to acetate in the ad process the changes in cod no3 n whether under mesophilic or thermophilic conditions did not generate a visible influence on the concentration and species of vfas this result suggests that in the coupled reactor of acidification and anaerobic denitrification the acidification process was mainly influenced by temperature rather than the cod no3 n ratio the consumption of vfas by the shift in different forms of nitrogen was also an important factor influencing the variation in the proportion of vfas during fermentation to further evaluate the effects of the cod no3 n ratios and temperature on carbon source utilization by nitrate reduction including denitrification vfas consumption per total nitrogen removal was calculated and compared in table 1 the calculation formula is shown in table s2 as shown in table 1 acetate yield was higher under mesophilic conditions and the introduction of nitrate produced higher concentrations of acetate than in the blank groups which resulted in negative acetate tn and acetate nitrate values in the reactor with nitrate introduction the values of propionate tn and propionate nitrate were higher under mesophilic conditions while under thermophilic conditions higher butyrate tn and butyrate nitrate ratios were reached for example under mesophilic conditions the propionate nitrate reached to 2 1 0 5 and 2 6 1 3 while the ratio of butyrate nitrate reached to 1 6 0 7 and 2 4 1 0 respectively in reactors i and ii whereas under thermophilic conditions the propionate nitrate reached to 0 6 0 3 and 1 5 0 3 while the ratio of butyrate nitrate reached to 5 8 0 6 and 7 8 1 5 respectively in reactors iii and iv the ratio of propionate nitrate was significantly higher under mesophilic conditions than that under thermophilic conditions while the nh4 n accumulation aggregation was also higher in this condition the result indicated that butyrate was the most preferable carbon sources for the den process whereas propionate might be the carbon sources that also contribute to the dnra process as reported in a previous study 10 butyrate and propionate were preferably utilized by the denitrifying bacteria 3 3 nitrate reduction pathway evaluation in the batch tests the aqueous ammonia concentrations in the nitrate amended groups especially at a cod no3 n ratio of 62 were higher than the values in the blank groups indicating that the dnra process occurred and accompanied with the denitrification process batch tests were conducted to further investigate the proportion of denitrification and dnra under the above operational conditions and it helps us to understand the relevant influence of vfas generated by the acidification of organic matter on the nitrogen conversion process during the reaction 3 3 1 transformation processes of nitrogen forms in batch tests as shown in fig 3 no3 n could be completely reduced at reaction times of 60 h and 96 h depending on the initial no3 n concentration however no3 n was not completely reduced to nitrogen gas due to no2 n accumulation in all reactors under mesophilic conditions fig 3a the maximum accumulation concentration of no2 n occurred at reaction times of 72 h and 60 h in batch reactors i 482 7 mg l and ii 245 8 mg l respectively whereas under thermophilic conditions fig 3b no2 n accumulation peaked at 60 h and 48 h in batch reactors iii 698 0 mg l and iv 409 3 mg l respectively the results indicated that higher temperature significantly promoted the no2 n accumulation rate as the temperature conditions shifted from mesophilic to thermophilic the reaction time of maximum no2 n accumulation was reduced by approximately 12 h and the peak of accumulation concentration was also increased by 30 8 39 9 the competition for carbon sources between no2 n and no3 n reductase led to different reduction rates and caused the accumulation phenomenon furthermore the nitrite accumulation in denitrification varied with the succession of the microbial community in response to the variations of temperature and c n 27 in this study temperature appeared to be more important in influencing the shift in nitrogen than the cod no3 n ratio mesophilic conditions enabled denitrification den and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra to bacteria fare well further causing the reduction of no3 n to nh4 n thermophilic conditions inhibited the dnra process during the no2 n accumulation stage whereas it occurred when nitrate became limiting this observation is also consistent with previous studies 30 31 the variation of nh4 n accumulation was closely related to the change in no2 n under mesophilic conditions nh4 n accumulation prevailed during the no2 n accumulation stage 0 72 h the result indicated that under mesophilic conditions no3 n was simultaneously reduced to no2 n and nh4 n during the no2 n accumulation stage 0 72 h the nitrogen transformation process was dominated by denitrification when no2 n accumulated to peak concentration under thermophilic conditions no3 n was mainly reduced to no2 n during the no2 n accumulation stage while the apparent nh4 n accumulation only occurred during the no2 n reduction stage 60 108 h the results indicated that thermophilic conditions inhibited the dnra process in the semicontinuous reaction process of this study fig 1 the accumulation of ammonia nitrogen was effectively avoided as the hrt was set to 72 h this situation further explained why tn removal performance appeared better in the semicontinuous reactor under thermophilic conditions 3 3 2 the proportions variation of den or dnra in batch tests to further clarify the dominant role of den or dnra under different conditions the conversion rates of different nitrogen forms and the proportions of denitrification or dnra processes under different reaction conditions are calculated in table 2 the nitrate reduction efficiency is increased by 16 7 17 2 under higher temperature an increase in temperature also accelerated the nitrite accumulation rate followed by the subsequent rapid nitrite reduction among the four reactors the highest nitrate reduction nitrite accumulation and nitrite reduction rate occurred in batch reactor iii lower cod no3 n ratio was also crucial to nitrogen conversion rate since batch reactor iv shared similar temperature but higher cod no3 n ratio with batch reactor iii when c n is low and the nitrogen source is mainly derived from nitrate ammonia oxidizing bacteria appear to have a comparative advantage in the competition of no2 n 32 and conversely denitrification could have an advantage in the competition of nitrate 33 therefore the higher cod no3 n ratio negatively affected the nitrogen reduction efficiency furthermore the proportion of den and dnra processes was significantly affected by the nitrogen metabolism rate under mesophilic conditions the proportion of dnra increased from 24 4 to 38 7 as the nitrite reduction rate decreased from 11 77 mg l h to 6 07 mg l h and the same trend was also observed in reactors under thermophilic conditions the dnra proportion decreased with a higher nitrogen reduction rate which was more conducive to the removal of tn in the presence of nh4 n no2 n is more liable to convert to ammonia nitrogen than nitrate hence denitrifying heterotrophs are dominant 34 in the absence of nh4 n for growth even if the environmental conditions electron acceptor ph and temperature are not favorable for the dnra process part of the nitrate is induced to be converted to nh4 n via the dnra process which is mainly attributed to the microbial population survival mechanism dnra process played the leading role as no3 n acted as the primary electron acceptor whereas denitrification dominated if no2 n served as the final electron acceptor the carbon source produced by hydrolysis under different reaction conditions also exerted on denitrification the variations of vfas species vs reaction time is presented in fig s1 the acetate propionate and butyrate accounted for a large part in vfas species in the blank group after 108 h operation the acetate amount in reactor i with the no3 n introduction groups enjoyed an increase from 46 0 to 61 0 but the butyrate yield suffered a decline from 11 1 to 2 3 according to the nitrogen reduction process in fig 3 propionate is the preferred carbon source for no3 n reduction under mesophilic conditions whereas butyrate provided sufficient electron donors for nitrite thereby reducing the dnra proportion 3 4 microbial community analysis the number of otus ace chao1 and shannon and good s coverage indices at a level of higher than 3 were calculated table 3 mesophilic condition seemed to benefit bacterial colonies and microbial abundances the total number of otus of bacteria under mesophilic conditions was located at 186 450 compared with mere 116 258 of the total number of otus under thermophilic conditions the chao 1 and ace indices presented a higher microbial abundance in the mesophilic reactors than in the thermophilic reactors the shannon indices varied between 1 9 and 3 2 demonstrated the widely different microbial diversity between the six samples tian et al 2014 also discovered that the shannon index of microbial communities under high temperature conditions was less than that under medium temperature conditions with stable periods of 4 5 and 5 2 respectively 35 the majority of microorganisms with relative abundances was over 1 at the genus level are illustrated in fig 4 for the blank groups bacteroides 53 9 phascolarctobacterium 15 8 parabacteroides 7 7 paludibacter 3 9 and clostridium iv 3 3 were the major species detected under mesophilic conditions whereas bacteroides 57 5 parabacteroides 13 0 pseudomonas 16 2 and prevotella 2 0 were the main microbes detected under thermophilic blank condition the increased temperature changed the main microbial populations to some degree but both bacteroides and parabacteroides were detected in the mesophilic and thermophilic blank reactors according to previous studies bacteroides is species of free living autotrophic bacterial that degrade complex organic matter over the species of macromolecule polysaccharides 34 parabacteroides which is associated with larger amounts of acetate is a typical fermenting bacterium 36 the higher temperature increased the abundance of bacteroides and parabacteroides thereby improving the degradation efficiency of complex organic matter the microbial species were significantly influenced by the introduction of no3 n compared with the microbial community in the blank systems bacteroides 26 1 parabacteroides 24 7 clostridium xlva 17 5 clostridium sensu stricto 6 9 acidaminococcus 3 6 and clostridium iv 3 0 were the major microorganisms in the mesophilic group with a cod no3 n ratio group at 37 under thermophilic conditions carnobacterium 34 4 clostridium sensu stricto 27 6 clostridium iii 24 4 ruminococcus 4 6 and parabacteroides 3 3 were the dominant species the relative abundance of bacteroides declined whereas clostridium including clostridium iii clostridium iv clostridium xlva and clostridium sensu stricto was detected under thermophilic conditions previous studies indicated that clostridium could carry out denitrification or dnra processes while degrading complex organic matter 37 38 this finding further proved that dnra acted as an alternative way of nitrate reduction in the reactors the dnra process was more beneficial for microbial growth and activity than the denitrification process under the condition of a higher c n ratio 12 moreover clostridium iv is the specific functional bacteria for butyrate formation from h2 and co2 39 which further proved that more butyrate was generated under the thermophilic conditions of this study in addition acidaminococcus and ruminococcus were detected only in thermophilic rectors which had positive roles in organic hydrolysis and vfa production 40 combined with the variety of vfas in fig 2b the generation of propionate and butyrate under these conditions reached a relatively higher amount than the formation concentration under mesophilic conditions furthermore the specific microbial communities dominated at different combinations of temperature and cod no3 n ratios for example carnobacterium which was only discovered in thermophilic and low cod no3 n ratio conditions is capable of fermenting complex organics into low molecular weight organics and h2 the result further confirmed that thermophilic conditions and a low cod no3 n ratio were favorable to generate sufficient electron donors for denitrification 3 5 proposed mechanism of the nitrogen transfer process potential mechanism of the nitrogen transfer process was proposed in the fig 5 to shed light on the synergistic impact of temperature and cod no3 n ratio on the biological nitrogen removal mechanism under the mesophilic conditions propionate is the preferred electron donor for nitrogen reduction both the denitrification process and dnra process occurred from the initial stage to the middle stage during this period majority of no3 n was rapidly reduced to no2 n however part of the no3 n and accumulated no2 n were converted to nh4 n by dnra process the subsequent no2 n reduction witnessed a decline in the rate of nh4 n formation suggesting that the remaining no2 n was primarily reduced via the denitrification process and thus the whole reaction was terminated a higher nitrogen reduction rate occurred under the thermophilic conditions coupled with the observations of denitrification or dnra in the main processes at different stages from the initial stage to the mediation stage the denitrification process dominated in reducing no2 n and no3 n and this stage was shortened by 12 h after the mediation stage the accumulated no2 n was simultaneously reduced by the denitrification and dnra processes higher temperature facilitated the formation of butyrate therefore providing sufficient electron donors for reducing nitrite and decreasing the proportion of dnra moreover more energy input was mandate to for systematic maintenance under thermophilic conditions and bacteria adapts to high temperatures by different pathways 21 higher temperatures promoted the reduction rate of no3 n and no2 n thereby increasing the efficiency of nitrogen denitrification in addition from microbial community view clostridium iv acidaminococcus carnobacterium and ruminococcus were the specific functional bacteria in thermophilic rectors clostridium iv is regarded as the species contributing to butyrate formation and acidaminococcus carnobacterium and ruminococcus had positive roles in organic acidification and vfa production the relative abundance of bacteroides declined whereas the increased relative abundance of clostridium acting as complex organic matter decomposers including clostridium iii clostridium iv clostridium xlva and clostridium sensu stricto indicated that denitrification played a dominant role in thermophilic rectors rather than in mesophilic rectors 4 conclusion in this study hydrolytic acidification and anaerobic denitrification were coupled in the same reactor and the influence of temperature and cod no3 n ratio on the nitrogen metabolism pathway was investigated the results indicated that the acidification and nitrogen reduction processes could simultaneously occur in the system the nitrogen removal performance increased with a higher temperature and lower cod no3 n ratio the optimal total nitrogen tn removal performance 594 3 41 8 mg l was achieved under thermophilic t 60 c and cod no3 n ratio of 37 however the tn removal efficiency reduced due to nh4 n accumulation under other conditions thermophilic conditions inhibited the dissimilatory reduction to ammonium dnra process to 20 7 and facilitated the ratio of butyrate nitrate to 5 8 0 6 and 7 8 1 5 respectively furthermore the microbial community analysis further indicated that the higher temperature increased bacterial diversity and the existence of clostridium acidaminococcus and ruminococcus which accelerated the hydrolysis rate of organic matters and improved the nitrogen removal efficiency the influence of cod no3 n on acidification or nitrogen conversion was relatively lower but higher for microbial communities specific microbial species such as carnobacterium 34 4 were only discovered in thermophilic and low cod no3 n ratio conditions which contributed to the higher acidification and nitrogen removal performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

12461,hydrolytic acidification integrated with denitrification den presents a promising treatment strategy for high temperature industrial wastewater such as oil leather and ethanol wastewater this study aimed to investigate the synergistic influence of temperature and the cod no3 n ratio on the nitrogen reduction pathway using a series of semi continuous flow reactors the results revealed that the optimal total nitrogen tn removal performance was achieved under thermophilic t 60 c and cod no3 n ratio of 37 with the highest tn reduction amount of 594 3 41 8 mg l however under other conditions the tn removal efficiency reduced due to nh4 n accumulation higher temperature facilitated the nitrogen reduction rate and butyrate yield rate while inhibiting the dissimilatory reduction to ammonium dnra process to 20 7 furthermore the higher temperature increased the bacterial diversity and the relative abundances of clostridium acidaminococcus and ruminococcus thus enhancing organic matter hydrolysis and nitrogen removal efficiency in contrast carnobacterium with percentage account of 34 4 was only detected under thermophilic conditions with a low cod no3 n ratio the cod no3 n ratio only generated a slight effect on the production of volatile fatty acids vfas and nitrogen reduction pathways but had significant influence on the microbial community these findings provide novel insight into the implementation of hydrolysis acidification coupled with anaerobic denitrification process in thermophilic wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ethanol wastewater nitrogen removal thermophilic denitrification dnra microbial community data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is considered as an attractive and sustainable technology in the treatment of wastewater with high cod concentrations 1 it delivers energy saving 2 carbon degradation 3 and energy reclaim in a synchronized way 4 however ammonia nitrogen accumulation in nitrogen abundant wastewater is detrimental to ad efficiency which requires further treatment technologies 5 6 co degradation of carbon and nitrate where methanogenesis and denitrification den simultaneously occur in the refluxed digestive fluid is regarded as cost effective technology as shortened treatment process 7 volatile fatty acids vfas are important intermediates from anaerobic acidification of carbon source in wastewater and its yield can be promoted with higher temperature exerted 8 vfas also act as the electron donor for denitrifying bacteria to support simultaneous denitrification 9 according to previous research the nitrogen removal efficiency via denitrification reaches approximately 60 in a reactor with heterotrophic denitrifies and anaerobic acidogenesis 10 these findings undoubtedly make great contributions to eliminate the negative impact of nitrogen accumulation during the ad process many studies have been conducted to make insightful understanding of main factors and improve the efficiency of organic acidification and nitrate reduction during the ad process temperature species of carbon source and cod no3 n ratio were 3 keys that determined the ad process 11 higher temperature promotes the hydrolysis and acidification of complex organics and the production of vfas 12 as previous report shows the produced carbon sources in anaerobic bioreactors under thermophilic conditions 55 c successfully improved the nitrogen removal efficiencies from 74 2 5 9 at 20 c to 85 9 5 0 at 50 c 13 furthermore the characteristics of the organic matter are also one of the key factors affecting the efficiency of nitrogen removal easily biodegradable carbon sources with small molecule are regarded as more effective electron donors which enhances nitrogen removal performance 14 a maximum ammonium nitrogen reduction efficiency of 92 1 was observed in ethanol supported systems compared with sodium succinate 71 5 and glucose 66 9 supported systems 15 tang et al 2018 found that the fermentation of lactic acid enriched liquid fared well in the long term denitrification process 16 moreover the imbalance of the cod no3 n ratio mainly affects the nitrogen reduction efficiency under lower c n ratio 2 86 the denitrification process was inhibited due to the lack of carbon source whereas higher c n ratio would cause a shift from denitrification to the dissimilatory reduction to ammonium dnra 17 akunna et al 1992 indicated that the denitrification process was observed only at cod no3 n 8 86 whereas dnra was the main nitrate and nitrite reduction pathway at cod no3 n 53 18 as the cod no3 n ratio increased from 2 5 to 30 the dnra rate was promoted due to the 6 mol electrons were received and reduced to 1 mol no2 in the dnra process whereas only 3 mol electrons were needed in the denitrification process 19 therefore suitable reaction conditions determine the efficiency of the simultaneous removal of carbon and nitrogen in ad process some previous studies have elucidated the influences of the cod no3 n ratio and carbon sources on nitrate reduction coupled with anaerobic digestion under mesophilic conditions 20 however most studies were carried out under mesophilic conditions few studies conducted the transformation mechanisms of organic matter and nitrogen simultaneous acidification and denitrification under thermophilic conditions considering the high temperature 70 90 c property of industrial wastewater such as oil leather and ethanol wastewater thermophilic denitrification ranging from 40 to 60 c with a high nitrogen removal efficiency and lower retention time was recommended 21 22 furthermore temperature had a prior role in both the acidification process and nitrogen reduction process the effect of temperature on the acidification process further influenced the kinds of carbon sources produced which affected the reduction of nitrogen currently the synergistic influence of temperature and the cod no3 n ratio on nitrate reduction pathways and anaerobic acidification is still unknown this problem constrains the treatment efficiency of high temperature industrial wastewater with high carbon and nitrogen concentrations the organic matters and nitrogen from cassava alcohol wastewater can be simultaneously removed by reflowing the aerobic nitrification effluent to the anaerobic acid production phase the optimization of the reaction conditions to achieve a high removal efficiency is of great importance in this study the synergistic effects of temperature 35 and 60 c and the cod no3 n ratio 37 and 62 on nitrogen removal and the transformation between different forms of nitrogen were investigated in semi continuous flow reactors batch tests were designed to identify the no3 n reduction pathway and the acid fermentation process under corresponding temperature and the cod no3 n ratio the proportion of vfa species utilized by dnra and by denitrification processes was compared based on the results of batch tests meanwhile the potential mechanism of microbial metabolism and nitrate removal pathway underlying the synergistic effects of temperature and cod no3 n ratio was also revealed via the investigation of the microbial community the results of this study clarified the synergistic influence of temperature and the cod no3 n ratio on nitrate reduction pathways enhanced understanding of the influence of different cod no3 n ratios and temperatures on acidification and nitrogen reduction processes provide essential guides for improving the efficiency of industrial wastewater with higher carbon and nitrogen concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operational conditions the inoculum sludge was obtained from an anaerobic internal circulation ic reactor from a paper making plant in jiangsu china the raw cassava stillage cs was gotten from an ethanol plant in jiangsu china it contains high amount of tcod 73 200 mg l and scod 40 800 mg l and the detailed characteristics is summarized in table s1 the adjustment of cod no3 n ratios was delivered by adding different amount of nano3 2 2 batch experiments cassava alcohol wastewater is discharged from alcohol distillation towers at 70 90 c whereas the reduction pathway of nitrate at high temperature 55 60 c conditions has rarely been reported therefore in this study batch experiments were conducted to investigate the nitrate reduction pathway with different cod no3 n ratios under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions a series of 500 ml serum bottles with anaerobic granular sludge 50 ml and cs 250 ml were employed as reactors and then the reactors were diluted to a required volume by ultrapure water the cod no3 n ratio were set to 37 and 62 by adding 5 m nano3 the temperature of reactors both at the cod no3 n ratio of 37 and 62 was stabilized at 35 c and 60 c in a constant temperature water bath shaker at a rotation speed of 110 rpm the initial ph was adjusted to 8 0 0 1 by adding 5 m naoh the argon was purged into each bottle for 1 min to prepare an oxygen limited atmosphere for the reaction system a blank group was also set at the same time without nano3 addition during the processing period 15 ml samples were obtained for analysis every 12 h 2 3 semicontinuous experiments in order to investigate the long term operating effects of the reactor a semicontinuous assay was conducted in a series of 300 ml serum bottles the cassava stillage and sludge were completely mixed in the reactors with initial tcod and scod concentrations reached to 40 000 43 000 mg l and 22 000 24 000 mg l respectively both the hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt were set to 3 days and the total solids ts and volatile solids vs concentrations were kept to 52 8 g l and 39 1 g l respectively two blank groups were set up for comparison without nano3 introduction under mesophilic conditions t 35 c and thermophilic conditions t 60 c the cod no3 n in the reactors was controlled to 37 5 and 62 5 under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions by adding different amounts of nano3 reactors with different cod no3 n ratios were conducted under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions the four experimental groups were reactor i t 35 c cod no3 n 37 reactor ii t 35 c cod no3 n 62 reactor iii t 60 c cod no3 n 37 and reactor iv t 60 c cod no3 n 62 to further observe the long term effect of denitrification coupled with anaerobic acidification in the treatment of cassava alcohol wastewater all reactors were operated for 66 days during this period volatile fatty acids vfas and different forms of nitrogen including tn no3 n no2 n and nh4 n were measured for consecutive days 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 measurement of ts vs cod tn nh4 n and vfas the measurements of cod tn nh4 n ts and vs referred to standard methods 23 the species and concentrations of vfas were qualified and quantified by a gas chromatography agilent 7820n thermofisher scientific ma usa the as tested samples were first centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 10 min followed by filtered by a 0 45 μm filter membrane before measurements 2 4 2 measurement of no3 n and no2 n the no3 n and no2 n were determined by a dionex ics 3000 ion chromatograph equipped with two sets of columns and two conductance detectors for the separation and detection of cations and anions during detection cations and anions were simultaneously injected and analyzed the anion column included a guard column ag11 hc 4 50 mm the anion eluent was 18 mm koh with the flow rate of gradient pump set to 1 0 ml min the cation chromatography column also includes a guard column the column type is cg12a 4 50 mm and the cation eluent is 20 mm methanesulfonic acid the gradient pump flow speed was 1 0 ml min the injection volume of the ion chromatography was 1 ml and the background current was suppressed by the automatic suppression mode 2 4 3 16s rdna when the semicontinuous flow reactor was stably operating 1 5 ml mixed samples were obtained from the reactors with medium high temperature blanks cod no3 n of 37 5 and 62 5 for reactor microbial colony analysis centrifuging at 12000 g was used to separate dna from the bacterial mix for 5 min at 4 c and dna was further extracted by qiaamp dna extraction kit qiagen germany dna concentration and integrity were measures by agarose electrophoresis and a qubit 2 0 dna assay ki was employed to quantify genomic dna the

discussion 3 1 nitrate reduction and conversion during long term operation to compare the nitrogen removal performances at different cod no3 n ratios under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions the concentration variations in tn no2 n no3 n and nh4 n during the operation period are shown in fig 1 the tn removal efficiency increased swiftly at the early time and then grew into stabilization after a short start up period within 10 days in thermophilic reactors whereas in mesophilic reactors the start up period was delayed to 19 days this demonstrated that microorganisms are more likely to stabilize in a thermophilic environment the tn removal efficiency increased from 45 8 11 5 mesophilic conditions to 63 7 11 3 thermophilic conditions at cod no3 n ratio of 37 same trend was also observed at cod no3 n ratio of 62 fig 1a the tn removal efficiency increased in response to the rising temperature this phenomenon might be attributed to the finding that the microbial communities more easily adapted under thermophilic conditions a previous study also indicated that the nitrate removal rate increased with increasing temperature from 30 c to 50 c 24 the dominant denitrifies such as truepera azoarcus and elioraea were enriched under thermophilic conditions 25 as the cod no3 n ratio climbed from 37 to 62 under mesophilic conditions the removed tn amount reached to 490 2 153 1 mg l and 301 0 54 5 mg l respectively similarly the removed tn amount under thermophilic condition also reached to 594 3 41 8 mg l and 331 9 69 0 mg l respectively higher tn removal performance was achieved in reactors with lower cod no3 n despite thermophilic or mesophilic environments therefore the highest tn removal efficiency was achieved in reactor iii t 60 c cod no3 n 37 which indicated that a lower cod no3 n ratio accompanied by thermophilic conditions facilitated tn removal performance the flows of no2 n no3 n and nh4 n were analyzed to deduce the nitrate reduction pathway as shown in fig 1b no3 n was completely reduced in all reactors both with the cod no3 n ratio was 37 or 62 however the no2 n and nh4 n accumulation occurred almost in all reactors the no2 n accumulation was attributed to the large amount of no3 n to no2 n conversion which delivered by denitrifying bacteria using biodegradable carbon sources generated in the acidification process 26 however the nh4 n accumulation significantly fluctuated under mesophilic conditions higher concentration was appeared during the first 15 days and then the nh4 n accumulation decreased to relatively lower level during the subsequent 15 66 days compared with the process of no2 n accumulation nh4 n accumulation accounted for a larger part in the effluent of the four tested reactors from i to iv with average concentrations of 68 2 36 9 mg l 67 5 38 5 mg l 11 6 12 4 mg l and 24 8 29 6 mg l respectively partially reduction of nh4 n by dnra in the culture contributing to less no2 n accumulation could an answer to this observation previous results also revealed that the no2 n generated in the acidification phase could be reduced under mesophilic conditions 35 c but that nh4 n accumulation also occurred due to the dnra process 10 under thermophilic conditions nh4 n accumulation was effectively alleviated which indicated that no3 n was eventually reduced to nitrogen and released wang et al 2020 also indicated that dnra occurred at temperatures varying from 5 c to 35 c with the rate exponentially increasing as the temperature was elevated 27 3 2 vfa profiles during long term operation vfas are produced through the anaerobic acidification process and serve as electron donors for no3 n reduction 28 fig 2 shows the changes in the main vfas profiles acetate propionate and butyrate with or without no3 n introduction under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions the vfas production came to a plateau after 15 19 days of continuous operation similar trend shared by nitrogen removal in the nitrate free culture the yield of specific vfas species followed the sequence of propionate 2743 3 183 1 mg l acetate 1388 4 171 6 mg l and butyrate 1519 1 174 2 mg l under mesophilic conditions and the sequence of butyrate 3797 7 447 1 mg l propionate 626 4 73 2 mg l and acetate 921 0 359 1 mg l under thermophilic conditions the differences observed in vfas yield implied that higher temperature inhibited the yield of acetate and propionate but promoted the production of butyrate zhang et al 2019 also determined that the yield of acetate from waste activated sludge was at 35 c was approximately 1 5 fold that at 55 c 29 in the reactors with nitrate introduction cod no3 n ratio 37 the concentration of butyrate decreased to 395 6 104 1 and 737 3 172 4 mg l under mesophilic conditions and thermophilic conditions respectively propionate consumption followed the second order and the decreased concentration varied with fermentation temperature acetate became the dominant species and the increased concentration share ranged from 45 7 to 56 1 compared to the values in the blank groups at the corresponding temperature conditions the above results indicated that the introduction of nitrate altered the dominant vfas species from butyrate to acetate in the ad process the changes in cod no3 n whether under mesophilic or thermophilic conditions did not generate a visible influence on the concentration and species of vfas this result suggests that in the coupled reactor of acidification and anaerobic denitrification the acidification process was mainly influenced by temperature rather than the cod no3 n ratio the consumption of vfas by the shift in different forms of nitrogen was also an important factor influencing the variation in the proportion of vfas during fermentation to further evaluate the effects of the cod no3 n ratios and temperature on carbon source utilization by nitrate reduction including denitrification vfas consumption per total nitrogen removal was calculated and compared in table 1 the calculation formula is shown in table s2 as shown in table 1 acetate yield was higher under mesophilic conditions and the introduction of nitrate produced higher concentrations of acetate than in the blank groups which resulted in negative acetate tn and acetate nitrate values in the reactor with nitrate introduction the values of propionate tn and propionate nitrate were higher under mesophilic conditions while under thermophilic conditions higher butyrate tn and butyrate nitrate ratios were reached for example under mesophilic conditions the propionate nitrate reached to 2 1 0 5 and 2 6 1 3 while the ratio of butyrate nitrate reached to 1 6 0 7 and 2 4 1 0 respectively in reactors i and ii whereas under thermophilic conditions the propionate nitrate reached to 0 6 0 3 and 1 5 0 3 while the ratio of butyrate nitrate reached to 5 8 0 6 and 7 8 1 5 respectively in reactors iii and iv the ratio of propionate nitrate was significantly higher under mesophilic conditions than that under thermophilic conditions while the nh4 n accumulation aggregation was also higher in this condition the result indicated that butyrate was the most preferable carbon sources for the den process whereas propionate might be the carbon sources that also contribute to the dnra process as reported in a previous study 10 butyrate and propionate were preferably utilized by the denitrifying bacteria 3 3 nitrate reduction pathway evaluation in the batch tests the aqueous ammonia concentrations in the nitrate amended groups especially at a cod no3 n ratio of 62 were higher than the values in the blank groups indicating that the dnra process occurred and accompanied with the denitrification process batch tests were conducted to further investigate the proportion of denitrification and dnra under the above operational conditions and it helps us to understand the relevant influence of vfas generated by the acidification of organic matter on the nitrogen conversion process during the reaction 3 3 1 transformation processes of nitrogen forms in batch tests as shown in fig 3 no3 n could be completely reduced at reaction times of 60 h and 96 h depending on the initial no3 n concentration however no3 n was not completely reduced to nitrogen gas due to no2 n accumulation in all reactors under mesophilic conditions fig 3a the maximum accumulation concentration of no2 n occurred at reaction times of 72 h and 60 h in batch reactors i 482 7 mg l and ii 245 8 mg l respectively whereas under thermophilic conditions fig 3b no2 n accumulation peaked at 60 h and 48 h in batch reactors iii 698 0 mg l and iv 409 3 mg l respectively the results indicated that higher temperature significantly promoted the no2 n accumulation rate as the temperature conditions shifted from mesophilic to thermophilic the reaction time of maximum no2 n accumulation was reduced by approximately 12 h and the peak of accumulation concentration was also increased by 30 8 39 9 the competition for carbon sources between no2 n and no3 n reductase led to different reduction rates and caused the accumulation phenomenon furthermore the nitrite accumulation in denitrification varied with the succession of the microbial community in response to the variations of temperature and c n 27 in this study temperature appeared to be more important in influencing the shift in nitrogen than the cod no3 n ratio mesophilic conditions enabled denitrification den and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra to bacteria fare well further causing the reduction of no3 n to nh4 n thermophilic conditions inhibited the dnra process during the no2 n accumulation stage whereas it occurred when nitrate became limiting this observation is also consistent with previous studies 30 31 the variation of nh4 n accumulation was closely related to the change in no2 n under mesophilic conditions nh4 n accumulation prevailed during the no2 n accumulation stage 0 72 h the result indicated that under mesophilic conditions no3 n was simultaneously reduced to no2 n and nh4 n during the no2 n accumulation stage 0 72 h the nitrogen transformation process was dominated by denitrification when no2 n accumulated to peak concentration under thermophilic conditions no3 n was mainly reduced to no2 n during the no2 n accumulation stage while the apparent nh4 n accumulation only occurred during the no2 n reduction stage 60 108 h the results indicated that thermophilic conditions inhibited the dnra process in the semicontinuous reaction process of this study fig 1 the accumulation of ammonia nitrogen was effectively avoided as the hrt was set to 72 h this situation further explained why tn removal performance appeared better in the semicontinuous reactor under thermophilic conditions 3 3 2 the proportions variation of den or dnra in batch tests to further clarify the dominant role of den or dnra under different conditions the conversion rates of different nitrogen forms and the proportions of denitrification or dnra processes under different reaction conditions are calculated in table 2 the nitrate reduction efficiency is increased by 16 7 17 2 under higher temperature an increase in temperature also accelerated the nitrite accumulation rate followed by the subsequent rapid nitrite reduction among the four reactors the highest nitrate reduction nitrite accumulation and nitrite reduction rate occurred in batch reactor iii lower cod no3 n ratio was also crucial to nitrogen conversion rate since batch reactor iv shared similar temperature but higher cod no3 n ratio with batch reactor iii when c n is low and the nitrogen source is mainly derived from nitrate ammonia oxidizing bacteria appear to have a comparative advantage in the competition of no2 n 32 and conversely denitrification could have an advantage in the competition of nitrate 33 therefore the higher cod no3 n ratio negatively affected the nitrogen reduction efficiency furthermore the proportion of den and dnra processes was significantly affected by the nitrogen metabolism rate under mesophilic conditions the proportion of dnra increased from 24 4 to 38 7 as the nitrite reduction rate decreased from 11 77 mg l h to 6 07 mg l h and the same trend was also observed in reactors under thermophilic conditions the dnra proportion decreased with a higher nitrogen reduction rate which was more conducive to the removal of tn in the presence of nh4 n no2 n is more liable to convert to ammonia nitrogen than nitrate hence denitrifying heterotrophs are dominant 34 in the absence of nh4 n for growth even if the environmental conditions electron acceptor ph and temperature are not favorable for the dnra process part of the nitrate is induced to be converted to nh4 n via the dnra process which is mainly attributed to the microbial population survival mechanism dnra process played the leading role as no3 n acted as the primary electron acceptor whereas denitrification dominated if no2 n served as the final electron acceptor the carbon source produced by hydrolysis under different reaction conditions also exerted on denitrification the variations of vfas species vs reaction time is presented in fig s1 the acetate propionate and butyrate accounted for a large part in vfas species in the blank group after 108 h operation the acetate amount in reactor i with the no3 n introduction groups enjoyed an increase from 46 0 to 61 0 but the butyrate yield suffered a decline from 11 1 to 2 3 according to the nitrogen reduction process in fig 3 propionate is the preferred carbon source for no3 n reduction under mesophilic conditions whereas butyrate provided sufficient electron donors for nitrite thereby reducing the dnra proportion 3 4 microbial community analysis the number of otus ace chao1 and shannon and good s coverage indices at a level of higher than 3 were calculated table 3 mesophilic condition seemed to benefit bacterial colonies and microbial abundances the total number of otus of bacteria under mesophilic conditions was located at 186 450 compared with mere 116 258 of the total number of otus under thermophilic conditions the chao 1 and ace indices presented a higher microbial abundance in the mesophilic reactors than in the thermophilic reactors the shannon indices varied between 1 9 and 3 2 demonstrated the widely different microbial diversity between the six samples tian et al 2014 also discovered that the shannon index of microbial communities under high temperature conditions was less than that under medium temperature conditions with stable periods of 4 5 and 5 2 respectively 35 the majority of microorganisms with relative abundances was over 1 at the genus level are illustrated in fig 4 for the blank groups bacteroides 53 9 phascolarctobacterium 15 8 parabacteroides 7 7 paludibacter 3 9 and clostridium iv 3 3 were the major species detected under mesophilic conditions whereas bacteroides 57 5 parabacteroides 13 0 pseudomonas 16 2 and prevotella 2 0 were the main microbes detected under thermophilic blank condition the increased temperature changed the main microbial populations to some degree but both bacteroides and parabacteroides were detected in the mesophilic and thermophilic blank reactors according to previous studies bacteroides is species of free living autotrophic bacterial that degrade complex organic matter over the species of macromolecule polysaccharides 34 parabacteroides which is associated with larger amounts of acetate is a typical fermenting bacterium 36 the higher temperature increased the abundance of bacteroides and parabacteroides thereby improving the degradation efficiency of complex organic matter the microbial species were significantly influenced by the introduction of no3 n compared with the microbial community in the blank systems bacteroides 26 1 parabacteroides 24 7 clostridium xlva 17 5 clostridium sensu stricto 6 9 acidaminococcus 3 6 and clostridium iv 3 0 were the major microorganisms in the mesophilic group with a cod no3 n ratio group at 37 under thermophilic conditions carnobacterium 34 4 clostridium sensu stricto 27 6 clostridium iii 24 4 ruminococcus 4 6 and parabacteroides 3 3 were the dominant species the relative abundance of bacteroides declined whereas clostridium including clostridium iii clostridium iv clostridium xlva and clostridium sensu stricto was detected under thermophilic conditions previous studies indicated that clostridium could carry out denitrification or dnra processes while degrading complex organic matter 37 38 this finding further proved that dnra acted as an alternative way of nitrate reduction in the reactors the dnra process was more beneficial for microbial growth and activity than the denitrification process under the condition of a higher c n ratio 12 moreover clostridium iv is the specific functional bacteria for butyrate formation from h2 and co2 39 which further proved that more butyrate was generated under the thermophilic conditions of this study in addition acidaminococcus and ruminococcus were detected only in thermophilic rectors which had positive roles in organic hydrolysis and vfa production 40 combined with the variety of vfas in fig 2b the generation of propionate and butyrate under these conditions reached a relatively higher amount than the formation concentration under mesophilic conditions furthermore the specific microbial communities dominated at different combinations of temperature and cod no3 n ratios for example carnobacterium which was only discovered in thermophilic and low cod no3 n ratio conditions is capable of fermenting complex organics into low molecular weight organics and h2 the result further confirmed that thermophilic conditions and a low cod no3 n ratio were favorable to generate sufficient electron donors for denitrification 3 5 proposed mechanism of the nitrogen transfer process potential mechanism of the nitrogen transfer process was proposed in the fig 5 to shed light on the synergistic impact of temperature and cod no3 n ratio on the biological nitrogen removal mechanism under the mesophilic conditions propionate is the preferred electron donor for nitrogen reduction both the denitrification process and dnra process occurred from the initial stage to the middle stage during this period majority of no3 n was rapidly reduced to no2 n however part of the no3 n and accumulated no2 n were converted to nh4 n by dnra process the subsequent no2 n reduction witnessed a decline in the rate of nh4 n formation suggesting that the remaining no2 n was primarily reduced via the denitrification process and thus the whole reaction was terminated a higher nitrogen reduction rate occurred under the thermophilic conditions coupled with the observations of denitrification or dnra in the main processes at different stages from the initial stage to the mediation stage the denitrification process dominated in reducing no2 n and no3 n and this stage was shortened by 12 h after the mediation stage the accumulated no2 n was simultaneously reduced by the denitrification and dnra processes higher temperature facilitated the formation of butyrate therefore providing sufficient electron donors for reducing nitrite and decreasing the proportion of dnra moreover more energy input was mandate to for systematic maintenance under thermophilic conditions and bacteria adapts to high temperatures by different pathways 21 higher temperatures promoted the reduction rate of no3 n and no2 n thereby increasing the efficiency of nitrogen denitrification in addition from microbial community view clostridium iv acidaminococcus carnobacterium and ruminococcus were the specific functional bacteria in thermophilic rectors clostridium iv is regarded as the species contributing to butyrate formation and acidaminococcus carnobacterium and ruminococcus had positive roles in organic acidification and vfa production the relative abundance of bacteroides declined whereas the increased relative abundance of clostridium acting as complex organic matter decomposers including clostridium iii clostridium iv clostridium xlva and clostridium sensu stricto indicated that denitrification played a dominant role in thermophilic rectors rather than in mesophilic rectors 4 conclusion in this study hydrolytic acidification and anaerobic denitrification were coupled in the same reactor and the influence of temperature and cod no3 n ratio on the nitrogen metabolism pathway was investigated the results indicated that the acidification and nitrogen reduction processes could simultaneously occur in the system the nitrogen removal performance increased with a higher temperature and lower cod no3 n ratio the optimal total nitrogen tn removal performance 594 3 41 8 mg l was achieved under thermophilic t 60 c and cod no3 n ratio of 37 however the tn removal efficiency reduced due to nh4 n accumulation under other conditions thermophilic conditions inhibited the dissimilatory reduction to ammonium dnra process to 20 7 and facilitated the ratio of butyrate nitrate to 5 8 0 6 and 7 8 1 5 respectively furthermore the microbial community analysis further indicated that the higher temperature increased bacterial diversity and the existence of clostridium acidaminococcus and ruminococcus which accelerated the hydrolysis rate of organic matters and improved the nitrogen removal efficiency the influence of cod no3 n on acidification or nitrogen conversion was relatively lower but higher for microbial communities specific microbial species such as carnobacterium 34 4 were only discovered in thermophilic and low cod no3 n ratio conditions which contributed to the higher acidification and nitrogen removal performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

12462,this study reports on the novel application of sodium carbonate dosing specifically for the semi passive precipitation of zn from circum neutral mine water and demonstrates the use of na2co3 as a readily available safe to handle reagent which can precipitate zn at ph within environmental quality standards 95 zn removal was achieved for each mine drainage investigated requiring differing dosages of na2co3 with residual zn concentrations 1 mgl 1 geochemical modelling and precipitate characterisation using xrd sem eds tga and full chemical digest suggests that the precipitate predominantly comprised of hydrozincite laboratory trials demonstrated that i adding the precipitant dropwise could reduce the sludge volume by circa 50 and ii that following a laboratory protocol for simulating type ii high density sludge hds process resulted in substantial decreases in sludge volumes compared to single pass sludge with 5 3 ml per litre mine water treated compared to 55 3 ml per litre for conventional single pass treatment after 25 cycles such reductions in sludge volume are a very advantageous outcome for practical applications particle size distribution and zeta potential determinations on the resultant hds sludge suggest that increased heterogenous precipitation and decrease in zeta potential are important in the formation of hds when using sodium carbonate to treat zinc bearing waters this work demonstrates that sodium carbonate is an efficacious reagent for semi passive treatment of zinc bearing mine waters and as such could find widescale application to this pressing global problem graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords metal treatment mine zinc pollution hds water precipitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mining influenced waters are a major global contributor to poor freshwater quality current and legacy mines result in many thousands of kilometres of impacted rivers world wide 1 estimates of the total number of abandoned mines globally are not available however it is likely to be in the millions 2 in england and wales alone 2100 km of rivers fail to achieve european union water framework directive standards wfd 2000 60 eu even when excluding coal mine drainage a major pollution source in england and wales 226 water bodies are impacted by pollution from non coal mines with a further 226 probably impacted 3 4 the damaging effects of acid mine drainage amd on receiving water bodies is widely acknowledged but circumneutral mine water also known as neutral mine drainage cnmd can also cause widespread water quality failures this latter type of drainage can occur where pyrite is absent or of subordinate abundance to metal sulphides that do not produce protons upon oxidation e g sphalerite or galena 5 and is prevalent in many parts of the world including the uk cnmd can also arise when amd is subsequently neutralized by the host lithology or after initial mine water treatment e g with limestone in the uk the majority 80 of confirmed abandoned metal mine discharges are circumneutral 6 and although amd is typically more environmentally hazardous cnmd poses significant harm to receiving water bodies and surrounding areas due to the mobilisation and transport of ecotoxic metals metalloids e g zn cd pb cu ni as which remain soluble at circumneutral ph 7 9 the common occurrence of zn as a constituent of cnmd is often due to the presence of sphalerite zns and related minerals in ore and gangue sphalerite undergoes either acid or oxidative dissolution eqs 1 2 the dissolved zn can then be transported into surrounding water bodies causing water quality failures and zn contamination levels above environmental quality standards 10 9 μgl 1 dissolved bioavailable zn water framework directive standard 10 1 zns 2h zn 2 h 2 s 2 zns 2o 2 zn 2 so 4 2 zn is an important micronutrient for both animals 11 and plants 12 however at elevated concentrations zn can have severe adverse effects to aquatic life reducing the abundance and diversity of biota and having a damaging effect on ecosystem functions such as productivity and nutrient cycling 13 due to its environmental persistence mobility toxicity and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms zn is classed as one of the most hazardous metal metalloid pollutants along with cr ni cu cd pb hg and as 14 zn is the most prevalent metal contaminant in metal mine discharge in england and wales where a low end estimate of circa 170 t of zn has been reported to discharge into water bodies each year 3 mine water treatment technologies have been developed to combat the problem of mine water pollution treatment methods are often categorized as either passive or active passive treatment refers to a technology where there is no supply of power or reagents whereas active treatment involves powered operations and the continual addition of chemical reagents 15 passive technologies developed specifically for the removal of zn from cnmd include using flow through bioreactors and low cost reactive or sorbent media 16 22 the disadvantages of these approaches generally relate to the typically lower area or volumetric removal rates in passive systems compared to active treatment systems which translates to requirements for relatively large surface area or volume for treating a given flow and concentration which may not be feasible at a given site active treatment processes specifically for zn removal from cnmd include carbonate coprecipitation 23 and zns precipitation 24 these technologies however require higher levels of operational complexity than passive methods semi passive methods of mine water treatment 25 30 seek to blend active passive methods to combine or balance the benefits and disbenefits of both options the work described herein is considered in the context of semi passive treatment where envisaged treatment method might utilise unmanned dosing stations possibly controlled remotely and powered by renewable energy such as solar periodic reagent deliveries and operational maintenance visits the current work presents an examination of the efficacy of sodium carbonate na2co3 dosing as a semi passive approach to treating zn bearing cnmd na2co3 has been shown to be an effective relatively cheap reagent for the precipitation of metals from waste effluents 31 32 offering high zn removal efficiencies 33 by raising the ph to precipitate zn within environmentally permissible levels 34 circa 7 8 8 5 but has not been applied specifically to zn bearing mine waters one of the key advantages of using na2co3 as a base for mine water treatment particularly in lone person operations in remote locations where the implications of accidents could be worse is its lower chemical hazard compared to other caustic chemicals the hazard statement for na2co3 is h319 causes serious eye irritation 35 the hazards associated with using other alkali reagents such as naoh 36 cao 37 and ca oh 2 38 include h314 skin corrosion h318 serious eye damage and h335 respiratory irritation therefore the use of na2co3 poses a substantially lower risk to the operator than other alkali reagents which is one of the key considerations for remote mine water treatment systems other than our own works 39 40 we can find no literature on the application of na2co3 dosing specifically for zinc bearing circumneutral mine drainage despite the well known decrease in solubility of zinc carbonates such as smithsonite and hydrozincite at moderately alkaline ph alkali dosing precipitation is often the first step in active treatment and additional unit operation s are typically required for subsequent solid liquid separation coagulants and or flocculants are often used to improve separation in gravity based liquid solid separation which can add operational costs reagent and time the residual precipitated sludge can also be voluminous with low density have low solids content circa 1 w v 41 and have a high resistance to filtration making them difficult to dewater therefore increasing solids settling velocity and volume is advantageous cutting cost implications for sludge storage dewatering and disposal the high density sludge hds process is a well established method to reduce the density of sludge generated through an increase in solids content per unit volume the basic principle involves recirculating the sludge to contact raw mine water and or alkali which leads to sludge densification increased settling velocity sludge volume and dewaterability 42 43 zn has been shown to readily form hds in the presence of fe using naoh as the alkali 44 45 however there are no studies on the formation of hds from a zn rich effluent where fe nor flocculant is present and using na2co3 as the alkaline reagent the primary aims of this study were two fold the first was to assess the effectiveness of na2co3 dosing on zinc removal and determine residual zinc concentrations after dosing for a range of real circumneutral zn bearing mine waters and to physiochemically characterize the precipitates the second pertinent to the development of a semi passive approach to mine water treatment using na2co3 was to investigate the influence of dosing strategy and sludge recirculation on particle size distribution and settling properties using synthetic and real circumneutral zn bearing mine water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites zn rich mine waters from a range of locations around wales uk were selected based on locations of known zn bearing mine water discharges 46 a range of mine water chemistries were selected see table 1 the majority were cnmd but these were supplemented by mine water from two acidic sites to assess the wider applicability of na2co3 dosing the primary study site selected for further study into the process chemistry and engineering was a circumneutral zn bearing mine water sourced from abbey consols an abandoned zn and pb mine located in ceredigion wales uk which was operated between 1848 and 1909 drainage from the site is a target for remediation 47 because the mine water is the primary contributory source of zn to the river teifi contributing to exceedances of wfd wqs 100 l of mine water was collected from the discharge adit the mine water was tested for changes in chemistry upon storage which confirmed minimal changes in the mine water chemistry over two weeks table s1 the time period in which the water was used for further experiments 2 2 batch experiments 2 2 1 field tests on site jar tests using a range of na2co3 dosages circa 1 6500 mgl 1 were conducted to assess the effectiveness of na2co3 dosing for the removal zn and other metals the experiments were conducted on site as mine water can be unstable due to fe oxidation co2 degassing 48 49 the doses were based on multiples of the zn molar concentration in each mine water where the zn concentration values were obtained from historical data

treated synthetic mine water for icp oes analysis as described above for laboratory dosing experiments a simulation of a type ii hds process 50 was conducted at laboratory scale on a batch basis where type ii refers to a hds process where the cycled sludge is mixed with the fresh mine water prior to alkali addition the procedure was modified from the method proposed by bosman for type i hds 51 900 ml smw 200 mgl 1 zn was added to a 1 l borosilicate glass beaker and 100 ml na2co3 solution was added 1000 mgl 1 the vessel was stirred at 200 rpm for 2 min using an overhead stirrer and the contents transferred to a 2 l measuring cylinder the suspension was allowed to settle and the time taken for sludge to settle sludge volume was recorded the supernatant was carefully decanted off and added to a fresh solution of smw 200 ppm zn and stirred for 10 min before the next dose of na2co3 solution was added this method was repeated 25 times with subsamples of sludge circa 2 ml and supernatant taken at regular intervals the ph was recorded before and after each dose of na2co3 was added the procedure was performed in triplicate to obtain a mean sludge volume with standard deviation sludge samples were only taken from the first run to eliminate the possibility that sampling was causing the reduction in sludge volume 2 3 physicochemical and mineralogical characterisation of precipitates the particle size distribution of precipitates was measured using a beckman coulter ls 13 320 xr particle sizer and zeta potential measurements were performed using a malvern zetasizer nano series nano 2 particle size measurements and zeta potential were measured directly on precipitate from laboratory dosing experiments suspended in the treated mine water or smw to prepare samples for xrd x ray diffraction spectroscopy tga thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy sem precipitate samples were dried at 40 c for 24 h allowed to cool in a desiccator and finely ground with a pestle and mortar prior to analysis mineralogical characterisation was performed using xrd seimens diffractometer d5000 using the following operating parameters wavelength 1 54 å voltage 40 kv current

dried at 40 c for 24 h was weighed into a 40 ml digestion vessel and hno3 3 ml 68 70 fisher analytical reagent grade for analysis and hcl 3 ml 37 fisher analytical grade was added and digested in an ethos easy microwave at 180 c for 45 min the contents of the vessel were transferred to a volumetric flask and made up to 50 ml using deionized water and analysed using icp oes micro and bulk mineralogical analysis was performed using a tescan maia3 field emission gun scanning electron microscope feg sem for abbey consols and synthetic samples and a zeiss sigma field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds for all other samples the field trial precipitates were analysed at a voltage of 30 kev whereas the synthetic and abbey consols

elemental analysis and mapping with aztec software the elemental composition was determined using an edax octane plus high resolution eds system and data analysis undertaken using the associated edax ametek inc team software for the zeiss fe sem 3 results and discussion 3 1 field campaign zn rich mine waters recorded ph for the mine waters varied between ph 2 99 and ph 7 34 alkalinity ranged from 0 to 235 mgl 1 and fe concentrations varied from 0 1 to 148 mgl 1 the na2co3 dose required to achieve 95 zn removal is presented in table 1 with additional dosing data in table s2 na2co3 is an effective reagent for the precipitation of zn all drainages achieved 95 zn removal with varied na2co3 dosage it is important to note that not all discharges would require this level of removal as it is the residual zn which will impact the receiving water body for example it was reported that at least 70 zn removal would be required at the abbey consols site 40 for the river teifi to meet wfd standards for all sites the residual zn concentration was below 1 mgl 1 which would be likely to meet wfd standards of 10 9 μgl 1 upon combining with the receiving water body providing that the mine discharge flow to be 1 of the river flow when utilising alkaline reagents the ph of the final treated water should in many regulatory juristictions be ph 9 and may require acid addition to meet this ph reduction semi passive treatment approaches seek to minimise reagent addtion importantly data in table 1 shows that for the majority of sites na2co3 dosing can precipitate 95 zn within the typical ph limits environmental standard ph 9 thus negating the need for additional reagent addition for ph reduction for the three mine waters above the acceptable ph limit further process optimisation would be required to obtain the optimum dose where zn removed but there is not an overshoot of the ph this is a limitation of the study where the final dose was excessive to ensure total zn removal although zn was the highest concentration contaminant in the mine drainages other contaminants were present at lower concentrations the removal efficiency for other metals was measured and is shown in table 2 reasonable removal rates table 2 were achieved for cd pb mn ni and cu however poor removal rates were observed for as this is unsurprising as oxyanionic forms of as are soluble at alkaline ph 52 known zn carbonate precipitates include smithsonite hydrozincite and zinc hydroxide which can further dehydrate to zincite 53 geochemical modelling was performed using phreeqci software 54 version 3 7 3 15968 minteq v4 database to identify minerals predicted to be oversaturated and this able to precipitate under defined conditions the database was updated to include hydrozincite using logk value 9 1 and the equilibrium shown in eq 3 55 3 zn 5 co 3 2 oh 6 6h 5zn 2 2co 3 2 6h 2 o for all mine waters modelled hydrozincite was found to be consistently oversaturated along with smithsonite zincite and zinc hydroxide for drainages with elevated levels of fe ferrihydrite hematite and geothite were also found to be oversaturated fig 1 displays data for the residual zn against final ph for the tested mine waters the hydrozincite solubility curve was derived using phreeqci and compared with the residual zn concentrations for all sites residual zn concentrations after precipitation are close to or below those expected from hydrozincite solubility residual concentrations lower than hydrozincite solubility could be attributable to solubility differences from the logk value used in the modelling 56 or the presence of precipitating fe minerals which are known to exert influence on zinc solubility in the circumneutral ph range through sorption and coprecipitation 57 this is notable in mine water where there are elevated levels of fe such as cwm rheidol 9 148 mgl 1 fe xrd analysis identified 2 line ferrihydrite in cwm rheidol 9 precipitate along with hydrozincite fig s4 zn co precipitation with ferrihydrite has been reported to occur at ph 5 58 which is consistent with the ph at which zn starts to precipitate for cwm rheidol 9 although the presence of fe in the mine waters can lower the ph at which zn precipitation occurs it also increases acidity and consequently the dose of na2co3 required to adjust the ph and precipitate the zn the dose required at cwm rheidol 9 to remove the zn was 6001 mgl 1 which equates to a molar ratio zn na2co3 of 1 78 significantly higher than the stoichiometric dose or the dose required for other drainages which generally ratios of circa 1 3 5 table 1 the higher na2co3 dose required is attributable to the high mineral and metal acidity for this mine water xrd analyses demonstrated that most of the precipitates were x ray amorphous however the xrd pattern for frongoch attenuation pond fig s3 showed peaks corresponding to hydrozincite with additional peaks indicative of geothite and rhodochrosite tga of abbey consols precipitate fig 4b shows a mass loss of 19 occurring at 170 270 c which suggests that the major mineral present is hydrozincite 53 59 however the theoretical mass loss should be 25 indicating that only 76 of the precipitate is hydrozincite real mine waters often contain clays and other minerals 60 which do not decompose below 700 c possibly accounting for reduced mass loss in addition phreeqci modelling identified zincite zno as an oversaturated phase which would also not decompose further sem eds was conducted on abbey consols frongoch attenuation pond and nant y mwyn fig s2 and table s4 the overall wt of zn was between 38 82 and 47 66 with low levels of other metals and c and o as other main elements mapping shows zn evenly dispersed throughout the precipitates sem eds analysis and total digest of abbey consols precipitate gives a zn wt of 44 7 and 48 9 respectively this is consistent with the tga finding that 76 of the precipitate is hydrozincite and the remaining material is clay sludge produced in treatment systems can require costly disposal to landfill depending on the metals metalloids it contains and the local landfill waste acceptability criteria 61 it is therefore highly beneficial if the sludge can be reused recycled or if the metal value can be recovered the high proportion of zn present in the precipitates may be promising for zn recovery the effectiveness of na2co3 dosing for all mine waters investigated is promising for its widespread application which would result in the generation of a substantial amount of zn rich sludge with high potential value based on zn removal rates and zn load in the mine discharges it can be estimated that circa 87 000 kg would be removed per year as the same na2co3 treatment scheme would be applied at multiple sites which would use the same reagents and produce similar sludges it is therefore likely that only one post treatment sludge processing zn recovery facility would be required easing the logistics of sludge management the zn is present in form that is amenable to zn recovery processes characterisation indicates mainly hydrozincite 62 63 indicating the potential of the precipitate as a valuable zn resource which may contribute to offsetting remediation costs the field campaign of dosing experiments has demonstrated that na2co3 is an effective zn precipitation reagent which can be used successfully on a range of mine water chemistries during the jar tests it was visually noted that the precipitates were fine and slow to settle improving settling behavior is thus an important aspect to optimise mine water treatability 3 2 impact of reagent dosing on precipitate properties mine water from the abbey consols was used to study how precipitate properties were affected by varying the na2co3 dosing strategy for practical purposes a synthetic equivalent was used for some laboratory experiments due to volume of precipitate mine water required the synthetic analogue responded to na2co3 dosing in the same manner as real abbey consols mine water fig s1a and s1b table s3 and was therefore deemed a reasonable proxy for the real mine water 3 2 1 dosing regimes immediate vs dropwise reagent addition the rate at which the precipitant is added is known to have to the ability to influence precipitation mechanisms 64 this is achieved by controlling the level of supersaturation of the system which influences nucleation growth and aggregation rates 65 typically a high level of supersaturation leads to a faster rate of homogeneous nucleation resulting in many small particles which can then aggregate lower levels of supersaturation typically encourage heterogeneous nucleation on existing particles facilitating particle growth jar tests were conducted using instantaneous and dropwise addition of na2co3 82 mgl 1 into synthetic mine water no difference in settling velocity was observed however particle size and sludge volume were reduced by almost 50 when na2co3 solution was added dropwise table 3 this is counter to the trend expected from crystallization theory where high supersaturation levels from instantaneous addition typically result in a higher degree of homogenous nucleation however particle size analysis of the particles from the two regimes show a higher distribution of particle sizes 6 100 μm with a standard deviation of 16 3 μm from instantaneous addition of na2co3 solution compared to 2 60 μm with a standard deviation of 8 3 μm this may reveal the importance of aggregation and or ph effects on the final particle size distribution produced 66 zhou et al reported a higher rate of heterogeneous precipitation and less homogeneous nucleation with dropwise addition 64 which supports the present findings dropwise addition of na2co3 yielded particles with similar zeta potential 21 mv compared to 28 mv for the instantaneously dosed precipitate indicating similar stability in solution zeta potentials above 30 mv are generally regarded as stable suspensions 67 thus in the measured range of zeta potential the settling rate is likely to be slow 3 2 2 high density sludge hds the densification of sludge using the hds process is a well known method of reducing sludge volume increasing settling velocity and sludge dewaterability characteristics of sludges formed from metal hydroxide precipitation reactions 42 44 however there is no journal literature on the formation hds using na2co3 as the precipitant the hds processes involve cycling previously produced sludges into fresh precipitation reactions a bench scale type ii hds method was trialled where the sludge was mixed with fresh mine water before introducing the na2co3 dose note that no coagulant or flocculant was added fig 2 shows that the zn na2co3 system readily forms hds the sludge volume does not increase linearly with repeated cycles densification appears to begin after cycle 4 where the measured sludge volume starts to deviate from the projected total accumulated sludge volume no hds after cycle 10 the sludge volume increase ceases definition of hds formation yielding a recycle ratio of 10 1 recycle ratios are typically between 10 1 and 30 1 meaning 10 30 kg of solids are recycled for each kg of solids formed in the process 68 after 25 cycles the sludge volume has decreased from the projected accumulated total by a factor of 10 the projected volume of sludge per litre of mine water treated for the hds was found to be circa 5 3 ml l versus circa 55 5 ml l for 25 cycles of conventional single pass sludge a similar bench scale hds trial was conducted by mackie et al 69 using a zn rich amd ca oh 2 and polymer flocculant hds was achieved after 20 cycles with 33 ml l of sludge formed per litre of mine water treated and the final dry solids content was 2 39 although a direct comparison cannot be made na2co3 dosing achieved a higher dry solids content 4 11 with a lower sludge volume per litre of mine water treated without the use of flocculant the settling velocity was found to increase with hds cycles settling velocity increasing to 2 48 mhr 1 at cycle 25 from 1 18 mhr 1 at cycle 1 the mechanism of hds formation is not fully understood however theories centre around slower precipitation due to lower ph of slurry recycled sludge acting as seeds for heterogeneous nucleation ageing dewatering effects and compression effects due to increased ionic concentrations 51 70 71 to assess whether compression effects were occurring the zeta potential of the sludge was measured at regular cycles throughout the hds process table 4 a decrease in the absolute value of the zeta potential was observed as the reaction cycles progress after 1 cycle the zeta potential of the suspension was 28 mv decreasing to 5 6 mv after 25 cycles this supports the theory that the increase in ionic concentration from cations in the slurry e g zn2 na2 decreases the zeta potential which then increases the compression of the double layer and allows the precipitates to pack more closely it is important to note that the ph of the treated sludge samples analysed was constant 9 28 9 78 and therefore zeta potential measured can be considered to be the absolute zeta potential of the particles with no effect from change in ph feg sem was conducted on the single pass sludge fig 3a and the hds sludge after 25 cycles fig 3b to further characterize the precipitate and identify any morphological differences between the sludges both sem images show typical hydrozincite morphology 2 dimensional platelets flattened on 100 55 72 which are cemented together as larger particles however the size of the platelets on the single pass sludge is smaller than the size of platelets on the hds sem image several platelet length measurements were taken averaging 0 13 μm for single pass and 0 57 μm for the hds indicating more long range order in the hds precipitate this was supported by xrd analysis fig 4a the xrd pattern of single pass sludge shows highly amorphous material whereas the xrd of the hds has defined peaks corresponding to hydrozincite fig s5 this coupled with an increase in particle size from 36 to 53 μm indicates that more heterogenous precipitation is occurring with the recycled sludge acting a seed particles tga conducted on single pass and hds shows a total mass loss of circa 25 corresponding to the theoretical mass of seen with hydrozincite for both the single pass and hds sludge the major mass loss occurs between 170 and 270 c corresponding to the loss of chemically bound h2o and co2 in hydrozincite circa 25 however the single pass sludge also sees a 3 mass loss at 150 160 c attributed to the loss of surface bound water the presence of this mass loss seen only in the tga for the single pass sludge supports the theory that there is less surface bound water in hds allowing densification of the particles this is supported by the high dry solids content in the hds compared with the single pass sludge 4 11 compared to 0 36 3 3 implications for semi passive treatment of zinc bearing cnmd the authors anticipate that na2co3 could find application in semi passive treatment of zinc bearing mine waters achieved with no on site operators an automatic dosing system and passive separation process e g gravity separation the only operational input would be replenishing of dosing reagents and sludge management and some general maintenance the data presented in this paper demonstrates the efficacy of na2co3 as a reagent for dosing of zn bearing mine waters na2co3 could be used to reduce dissolved concentrations of zinc and other metals and enabling waterbodies to achieve environmental quality standards eqs whilst staying within environmentally acceptable effluent ph eliminating the need for an additional ph correction process reducing reagent and operational costs it should be noted that some of the sites investigated where the resulting ph was above 9 would need further process optimization with regards to dosage or it may be that na2co3 dosing is not feasible for this particular mine water the authors acknowledge that the addition on na2co3 could increase the salinity in the receiving body however the increased salinity of the effluent would likely be diluted substantially by the receiving water body and currently there is no eqs for salinity in the uk nevertheless in other locations where salinity can pose a significant problem and there are strictly water quality standards for salinity an investigation into the effect of the added salinity on the receiving body would need to be completed as part of the trial process dosing of na2co3 can be achieved in a straightforward way using na2co3 solution which can be made up on site or tankered in in remote locations it may be more feasible for the dosing solution to be made up on site for temperate climates it is recommended that 5 w v solution is used 73 this is to prevent na2co3 crystalizing in the dosing tank when temperatures it is may also be possible to use treated mine water to make up the dosing solution reducing transport costs simple systems involving semi passive dosing of na2co3 in briquette form have already been used in the usa for amd control 74 further work would be required to investigate whether dosing solid na2co3 is as effective for zn and other metal removal when compared to other alkali reagents such as naoh ca oh 2 and cao na2co3 has less severe safety hazard rating meaning it is lower risk reagent for lone operators na2co3 is readily available as it is commonly used in potable water treatment facilities and for ph correction 73 the combination of these factors means that na2co3 dosing can lend itself effectively and practically for the treatment of zn bearing mine waters however whilst the na2co3 can readily remove dissolved zn and other target contaminant metals the resultant precipitate sludge has a high water content 99 and volume which may require extended dewatering times in addition the particles within the sludge were found to be relatively small 2 100 μm and stable zeta potential of 24 28 mv likely to make solid liquid separation difficult the work has established some strategies which should be explored further laboratory trials have shown that by adding the na2co3 precipitant dropwise the sludge volume can be reduced section 3 2 1 for semi passive dosing mine water treatment systems where sludge volumes are high dropwise addition could offer a simple technique that can be employed passively e g multiple dosing points across precipitation tank pond with potential to reduce the cost and operational implications of high sludge volumes contacting the precipitated solids with the mine water during dosing may encourage hds formation whilst this has not been tested passively existing passive mine water technologies that encourage contact with precipitates include vertical flow reactors 75 76 similarly configurations from wastewater treatment such as sludge bed clarification may also be considered here we have shown that hds can readily be formed from the zn na2co3 system proposed without the use of flocculant or other reagents the sludge had better settling characteristics with higher dry solids content showing potential for rapid settling velocities and better dewatering incorporation of a process to encourage hds would result in large reductions in sludge volume na2co3 dosing has been shown to be effective on a range of mine water chemistries and is therefore a promising option for widescale implementation if considering just the mine drainages studied in this paper a total of 3387 million litres of mine water would be treated each year removing circa 87 000 kg zn table 5 the sludge produced has a high in zn content circa 45 zn dry solids which suggests that the sludge could be used as a potential zn resource which might partially offset operational costs and retain zn in a circular economy and prevent pollution the main contributor to the operational cost is the cost of reagents as the scheme is to be operated semi passively from these experiments it can be estimated that the reagent costs to treat mine water with sodium carbonate ranges from 0 01 0 18 per m3 although a direct comparison is not possible other study and reports have shown these values are comparable to other water treatment dosed schemes 77 but do not require additional opex costs such as energy or operating staff 4 conclusions na2co3 dosing was successfully applied to a range of zn rich circum neutral mine waters achieving a final zn concentration of 1 mgl 1 and a final ph 9 precipitates were characterized using elemental digest xrd sem eds and tga indicating that the precipitate was hydrozincite this was corroborated by phreeqci modelling the high zn content in the precipitates and the fact that all sites would produce a precipitate with similar elemental composition is promising for the potential recovery of zn metal sludge volume and settling characteristics were shown to be improved by varying process conditions dropwise addition of precipitate yielded lower sludge volumes with smaller particles a promising simple approach to sludge reduction that easily be implemented semi passively hds was shown to readily form using na2co3 dosing and cycling the zn sludge without flocculant reducing the sludge volume substantially and improving the settling velocity characterisation of the hds sludge was conducted to improve understanding of the mechanism of hds formation in this system the findings of the characterisation provided evidence for increased heterogenous precipitation increased compressibility of particle suspension and increased agglomeration due to decrease in zeta potential the study demonstrates the efficacy and suitability of na2co3 dosing for semi passive treatment of zn offering high removal rates for a range of mine

12462,this study reports on the novel application of sodium carbonate dosing specifically for the semi passive precipitation of zn from circum neutral mine water and demonstrates the use of na2co3 as a readily available safe to handle reagent which can precipitate zn at ph within environmental quality standards 95 zn removal was achieved for each mine drainage investigated requiring differing dosages of na2co3 with residual zn concentrations 1 mgl 1 geochemical modelling and precipitate characterisation using xrd sem eds tga and full chemical digest suggests that the precipitate predominantly comprised of hydrozincite laboratory trials demonstrated that i adding the precipitant dropwise could reduce the sludge volume by circa 50 and ii that following a laboratory protocol for simulating type ii high density sludge hds process resulted in substantial decreases in sludge volumes compared to single pass sludge with 5 3 ml per litre mine water treated compared to 55 3 ml per litre for conventional single pass treatment after 25 cycles such reductions in sludge volume are a very advantageous outcome for practical applications particle size distribution and zeta potential determinations on the resultant hds sludge suggest that increased heterogenous precipitation and decrease in zeta potential are important in the formation of hds when using sodium carbonate to treat zinc bearing waters this work demonstrates that sodium carbonate is an efficacious reagent for semi passive treatment of zinc bearing mine waters and as such could find widescale application to this pressing global problem graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords metal treatment mine zinc pollution hds water precipitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mining influenced waters are a major global contributor to poor freshwater quality current and legacy mines result in many thousands of kilometres of impacted rivers world wide 1 estimates of the total number of abandoned mines globally are not available however it is likely to be in the millions 2 in england and wales alone 2100 km of rivers fail to achieve european union water framework directive standards wfd 2000 60 eu even when excluding coal mine drainage a major pollution source in england and wales 226 water bodies are impacted by pollution from non coal mines with a further 226 probably impacted 3 4 the damaging effects of acid mine drainage amd on receiving water bodies is widely acknowledged but circumneutral mine water also known as neutral mine drainage cnmd can also cause widespread water quality failures this latter type of drainage can occur where pyrite is absent or of subordinate abundance to metal sulphides that do not produce protons upon oxidation e g sphalerite or galena 5 and is prevalent in many parts of the world including the uk cnmd can also arise when amd is subsequently neutralized by the host lithology or after initial mine water treatment e g with limestone in the uk the majority 80 of confirmed abandoned metal mine discharges are circumneutral 6 and although amd is typically more environmentally hazardous cnmd poses significant harm to receiving water bodies and surrounding areas due to the mobilisation and transport of ecotoxic metals metalloids e g zn cd pb cu ni as which remain soluble at circumneutral ph 7 9 the common occurrence of zn as a constituent of cnmd is often due to the presence of sphalerite zns and related minerals in ore and gangue sphalerite undergoes either acid or oxidative dissolution eqs 1 2 the dissolved zn can then be transported into surrounding water bodies causing water quality failures and zn contamination levels above environmental quality standards 10 9 μgl 1 dissolved bioavailable zn water framework directive standard 10 1 zns 2h zn 2 h 2 s 2 zns 2o 2 zn 2 so 4 2 zn is an important micronutrient for both animals 11 and plants 12 however at elevated concentrations zn can have severe adverse effects to aquatic life reducing the abundance and diversity of biota and having a damaging effect on ecosystem functions such as productivity and nutrient cycling 13 due to its environmental persistence mobility toxicity and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms zn is classed as one of the most hazardous metal metalloid pollutants along with cr ni cu cd pb hg and as 14 zn is the most prevalent metal contaminant in metal mine discharge in england and wales where a low end estimate of circa 170 t of zn has been reported to discharge into water bodies each year 3 mine water treatment technologies have been developed to combat the problem of mine water pollution treatment methods are often categorized as either passive or active passive treatment refers to a technology where there is no supply of power or reagents whereas active treatment involves powered operations and the continual addition of chemical reagents 15 passive technologies developed specifically for the removal of zn from cnmd include using flow through bioreactors and low cost reactive or sorbent media 16 22 the disadvantages of these approaches generally relate to the typically lower area or volumetric removal rates in passive systems compared to active treatment systems which translates to requirements for relatively large surface area or volume for treating a given flow and concentration which may not be feasible at a given site active treatment processes specifically for zn removal from cnmd include carbonate coprecipitation 23 and zns precipitation 24 these technologies however require higher levels of operational complexity than passive methods semi passive methods of mine water treatment 25 30 seek to blend active passive methods to combine or balance the benefits and disbenefits of both options the work described herein is considered in the context of semi passive treatment where envisaged treatment method might utilise unmanned dosing stations possibly controlled remotely and powered by renewable energy such as solar periodic reagent deliveries and operational maintenance visits the current work presents an examination of the efficacy of sodium carbonate na2co3 dosing as a semi passive approach to treating zn bearing cnmd na2co3 has been shown to be an effective relatively cheap reagent for the precipitation of metals from waste effluents 31 32 offering high zn removal efficiencies 33 by raising the ph to precipitate zn within environmentally permissible levels 34 circa 7 8 8 5 but has not been applied specifically to zn bearing mine waters one of the key advantages of using na2co3 as a base for mine water treatment particularly in lone person operations in remote locations where the implications of accidents could be worse is its lower chemical hazard compared to other caustic chemicals the hazard statement for na2co3 is h319 causes serious eye irritation 35 the hazards associated with using other alkali reagents such as naoh 36 cao 37 and ca oh 2 38 include h314 skin corrosion h318 serious eye damage and h335 respiratory irritation therefore the use of na2co3 poses a substantially lower risk to the operator than other alkali reagents which is one of the key considerations for remote mine water treatment systems other than our own works 39 40 we can find no literature on the application of na2co3 dosing specifically for zinc bearing circumneutral mine drainage despite the well known decrease in solubility of zinc carbonates such as smithsonite and hydrozincite at moderately alkaline ph alkali dosing precipitation is often the first step in active treatment and additional unit operation s are typically required for subsequent solid liquid separation coagulants and or flocculants are often used to improve separation in gravity based liquid solid separation which can add operational costs reagent and time the residual precipitated sludge can also be voluminous with low density have low solids content circa 1 w v 41 and have a high resistance to filtration making them difficult to dewater therefore increasing solids settling velocity and volume is advantageous cutting cost implications for sludge storage dewatering and disposal the high density sludge hds process is a well established method to reduce the density of sludge generated through an increase in solids content per unit volume the basic principle involves recirculating the sludge to contact raw mine water and or alkali which leads to sludge densification increased settling velocity sludge volume and dewaterability 42 43 zn has been shown to readily form hds in the presence of fe using naoh as the alkali 44 45 however there are no studies on the formation of hds from a zn rich effluent where fe nor flocculant is present and using na2co3 as the alkaline reagent the primary aims of this study were two fold the first was to assess the effectiveness of na2co3 dosing on zinc removal and determine residual zinc concentrations after dosing for a range of real circumneutral zn bearing mine waters and to physiochemically characterize the precipitates the second pertinent to the development of a semi passive approach to mine water treatment using na2co3 was to investigate the influence of dosing strategy and sludge recirculation on particle size distribution and settling properties using synthetic and real circumneutral zn bearing mine water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites zn rich mine waters from a range of locations around wales uk were selected based on locations of known zn bearing mine water discharges 46 a range of mine water chemistries were selected see table 1 the majority were cnmd but these were supplemented by mine water from two acidic sites to assess the wider applicability of na2co3 dosing the primary study site selected for further study into the process chemistry and engineering was a circumneutral zn bearing mine water sourced from abbey consols an abandoned zn and pb mine located in ceredigion wales uk which was operated between 1848 and 1909 drainage from the site is a target for remediation 47 because the mine water is the primary contributory source of zn to the river teifi contributing to exceedances of wfd wqs 100 l of mine water was collected from the discharge adit the mine water was tested for changes in chemistry upon storage which confirmed minimal changes in the mine water chemistry over two weeks table s1 the time period in which the water was used for further experiments 2 2 batch experiments 2 2 1 field tests on site jar tests using a range of na2co3 dosages circa 1 6500 mgl 1 were conducted to assess the effectiveness of na2co3 dosing for the removal zn and other metals the experiments were conducted on site as mine water can be unstable due to fe oxidation co2 degassing 48 49 the doses were based on multiples of the zn molar concentration in each mine water where the zn concentration values were obtained from historical data from the nrw archives stock na2co3 dosing solutions were prepared at 1 10 and 50 gl 1 100 ml of unfiltered mine water was decanted into hdpe sample bottles samples were then dosed with 5 ml of 1 10 or

included reaction vessels were loosely covered and periodically gently swirled for two hours ph was immediately measured for the raw unamended samples and measured after 2 h for the dosed samples the treated and untreated samples 20 ml were filtered using 0 2 μm syringe filters and preserved using 0 1 ml 10 nitric acid and metal concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass

ametek inc team software for the zeiss fe sem 3 results and discussion 3 1 field campaign zn rich mine waters recorded ph for the mine waters varied between ph 2 99 and ph 7 34 alkalinity ranged from 0 to 235 mgl 1 and fe concentrations varied from 0 1 to 148 mgl 1 the na2co3 dose required to achieve 95 zn removal is presented in table 1 with additional dosing data in table s2 na2co3 is an effective reagent for the precipitation of zn all drainages achieved 95 zn removal with varied na2co3 dosage it is important to note that not all discharges would require this level of removal as it is the residual zn which will impact the receiving water body for example it was reported that at least 70 zn removal would be required at the abbey consols site 40 for the river teifi to meet wfd standards for all sites the residual zn concentration was below 1 mgl 1 which would be likely to meet wfd standards of 10 9 μgl 1 upon combining with the receiving water body providing that the mine discharge flow to be 1 of the river flow when utilising alkaline reagents the ph of the final treated water should in many regulatory juristictions be ph 9 and may require acid addition to meet this ph reduction semi passive treatment approaches seek to minimise reagent addtion importantly data in table 1 shows that for the majority of sites na2co3 dosing can precipitate 95 zn within the typical ph limits environmental standard ph 9 thus negating the need for additional reagent addition for ph reduction for the three mine waters above the acceptable ph limit further process optimisation would be required to obtain the optimum dose where zn removed but there is not an overshoot of the ph this is a limitation of the study where the final dose was excessive to ensure total zn removal although zn was the highest concentration contaminant in the mine drainages other contaminants were present at lower concentrations the removal efficiency for other metals was measured and is shown in table 2 reasonable removal rates table 2 were achieved for cd pb mn ni and cu however poor removal rates were observed for as this is unsurprising as oxyanionic forms of as are soluble at alkaline ph 52 known zn carbonate precipitates include smithsonite hydrozincite and zinc hydroxide which can further dehydrate to zincite 53 geochemical modelling was performed using phreeqci software 54 version 3 7 3 15968 minteq v4 database to identify minerals predicted to be oversaturated and this able to precipitate under defined conditions the database was updated to include hydrozincite using logk value 9 1 and the equilibrium shown in eq 3 55 3 zn 5 co 3 2 oh 6 6h 5zn 2 2co 3 2 6h 2 o for all mine waters modelled hydrozincite was found to be consistently oversaturated along with smithsonite zincite and zinc hydroxide for drainages with elevated levels of fe ferrihydrite hematite and geothite were also found to be oversaturated fig 1 displays data for the residual zn against final ph for the tested mine waters the hydrozincite solubility curve was derived using phreeqci and compared with the residual zn concentrations for all sites residual zn concentrations after precipitation are close to or below those expected from hydrozincite solubility residual concentrations lower than hydrozincite solubility could be attributable to solubility differences from the logk value used in the modelling 56 or the presence of precipitating fe minerals which are known to exert influence on zinc solubility in the circumneutral ph range through sorption and coprecipitation 57 this is notable in mine water where there are elevated levels of fe such as cwm rheidol 9 148 mgl 1 fe xrd analysis identified 2 line ferrihydrite in cwm rheidol 9 precipitate along with hydrozincite fig s4 zn co precipitation with ferrihydrite has been reported to occur at ph 5 58 which is consistent with the ph at which zn starts to precipitate for cwm rheidol 9 although the presence of fe in the mine waters can lower the ph at which zn precipitation occurs it also increases acidity and consequently the dose of na2co3 required to adjust the ph and precipitate the zn the dose required at cwm rheidol 9 to remove the zn was 6001 mgl 1 which equates to a molar ratio zn na2co3 of 1 78 significantly higher than the stoichiometric dose or the dose required for other drainages which generally ratios of circa 1 3 5 table 1 the higher na2co3 dose required is attributable to the high mineral and metal acidity for this mine water xrd analyses demonstrated that most of the precipitates were x ray amorphous however the xrd pattern for frongoch attenuation pond fig s3 showed peaks corresponding to hydrozincite with additional peaks indicative of geothite and rhodochrosite tga of abbey consols precipitate fig 4b shows a mass loss of 19 occurring at 170 270 c which suggests that the major mineral present is hydrozincite 53 59 however the theoretical mass loss should be 25 indicating that only 76 of the precipitate is hydrozincite real mine waters often contain clays and other minerals 60 which do not decompose below 700 c possibly accounting for reduced mass loss in addition phreeqci modelling identified zincite zno as an oversaturated phase which would also not decompose further sem eds was conducted on abbey consols frongoch attenuation pond and nant y mwyn fig s2 and table s4 the overall wt of zn was between 38 82 and 47 66 with low levels of other metals and c and o as other main elements mapping shows zn evenly dispersed throughout the precipitates sem eds analysis and total digest of abbey consols precipitate gives a zn wt of 44 7 and 48 9 respectively this is consistent with the tga finding that 76 of the precipitate is hydrozincite and the remaining material is clay sludge produced in treatment systems can require costly disposal to landfill depending on the metals metalloids it contains and the local landfill waste acceptability criteria 61 it is therefore highly beneficial if the sludge can be reused recycled or if the metal value can be recovered the high proportion of zn present in the precipitates may be promising for zn recovery the effectiveness of na2co3 dosing for all mine waters investigated is promising for its widespread application which would result in the generation of a substantial amount of zn rich sludge with high potential value based on zn removal rates and zn load in the mine discharges it can be estimated that circa 87 000 kg would be removed per year as the same na2co3 treatment scheme would be applied at multiple sites which would use the same reagents and produce similar sludges it is therefore likely that only one post treatment sludge processing zn recovery facility would be required easing the logistics of sludge management the zn is present in form that is amenable to zn recovery processes characterisation indicates mainly hydrozincite 62 63 indicating the potential of the precipitate as a valuable zn resource which may contribute to offsetting remediation costs the field campaign of dosing experiments has demonstrated that na2co3 is an effective zn precipitation reagent which can be used successfully on a range of mine water chemistries during the jar tests it was visually noted that the precipitates were fine and slow to settle improving settling behavior is thus an important aspect to optimise mine water treatability 3 2 impact of reagent dosing on precipitate properties mine water from the abbey consols was used to study how precipitate properties were affected by varying the na2co3 dosing strategy for practical purposes a synthetic equivalent was used for some laboratory experiments due to volume of precipitate mine water required the synthetic analogue responded to na2co3 dosing in the same manner as real abbey consols mine water fig s1a and s1b table s3 and was therefore deemed a reasonable proxy for the real mine water 3 2 1 dosing regimes immediate vs dropwise reagent addition the rate at which the precipitant is added is known to have to the ability to influence precipitation mechanisms 64 this is achieved by controlling the level of supersaturation of the system which influences nucleation growth and aggregation rates 65 typically a high level of supersaturation leads to a faster rate of homogeneous nucleation resulting in many small particles which can then aggregate lower levels of supersaturation typically encourage heterogeneous nucleation on existing particles facilitating particle growth jar tests were conducted using instantaneous and dropwise addition of na2co3 82 mgl 1 into synthetic mine water no difference in settling velocity was observed however particle size and sludge volume were reduced by almost 50 when na2co3 solution was added dropwise table 3 this is counter to the trend expected from crystallization theory where high supersaturation levels from instantaneous addition typically result in a higher degree of homogenous nucleation however particle size analysis of the particles from the two regimes show a higher distribution of particle sizes 6 100 μm with a standard deviation of 16 3 μm from instantaneous addition of na2co3 solution compared to 2 60 μm with a standard deviation of 8 3 μm this may reveal the importance of aggregation and or ph effects on the final particle size distribution produced 66 zhou et al reported a higher rate of heterogeneous precipitation and less homogeneous nucleation with dropwise addition 64 which supports the present findings dropwise addition of na2co3 yielded particles with similar zeta potential 21 mv compared to 28 mv for the instantaneously dosed precipitate indicating similar stability in solution zeta potentials above 30 mv are generally regarded as stable suspensions 67 thus in the measured range of zeta potential the settling rate is likely to be slow 3 2 2 high density sludge hds the densification of sludge using the hds process is a well known method of reducing sludge volume increasing settling velocity and sludge dewaterability characteristics of sludges formed from metal hydroxide precipitation reactions 42 44 however there is no journal literature on the formation hds using na2co3 as the precipitant the hds processes involve cycling previously produced sludges into fresh precipitation reactions a bench scale type ii hds method was trialled where the sludge was mixed with fresh mine water before introducing the na2co3 dose note that no coagulant or flocculant was added fig 2 shows that the zn na2co3 system readily forms hds the sludge volume does not increase linearly with repeated cycles densification appears to begin after cycle 4 where the measured sludge volume starts to deviate from the projected total accumulated sludge volume no hds after cycle 10 the sludge volume increase ceases definition of hds formation yielding a recycle ratio of 10 1 recycle ratios are typically between 10 1 and 30 1 meaning 10 30 kg of solids are recycled for each kg of solids formed in the process 68 after 25 cycles the sludge volume has decreased from the projected accumulated total by a factor of 10 the projected volume of sludge per litre of mine water treated for the hds was found to be circa 5 3 ml l versus circa 55 5 ml l for 25 cycles of conventional single pass sludge a similar bench scale hds trial was conducted by mackie et al 69 using a zn rich amd ca oh 2 and polymer flocculant hds was achieved after 20 cycles with 33 ml l of sludge formed per litre of mine water treated and the final dry solids content was 2 39 although a direct comparison cannot be made na2co3 dosing achieved a higher dry solids content 4 11 with a lower sludge volume per litre of mine water treated without the use of flocculant the settling velocity was found to increase with hds cycles settling velocity increasing to 2 48 mhr 1 at cycle 25 from 1 18 mhr 1 at cycle 1 the mechanism of hds formation is not fully understood however theories centre around slower precipitation due to lower ph of slurry recycled sludge acting as seeds for heterogeneous nucleation ageing dewatering effects and compression effects due to increased ionic concentrations 51 70 71 to assess whether compression effects were occurring the zeta potential of the sludge was measured at regular cycles throughout the hds process table 4 a decrease in the absolute value of the zeta potential was observed as the reaction cycles progress after 1 cycle the zeta potential of the suspension was 28 mv decreasing to 5 6 mv after 25 cycles this supports the theory that the increase in ionic concentration from cations in the slurry e g zn2 na2 decreases the zeta potential which then increases the compression of the double layer and allows the precipitates to pack more closely it is important to note that the ph of the treated sludge samples analysed was constant 9 28 9 78 and therefore zeta potential measured can be considered to be the absolute zeta potential of the particles with no effect from change in ph feg sem was conducted on the single pass sludge fig 3a and the hds sludge after 25 cycles fig 3b to further characterize the precipitate and identify any morphological differences between the sludges both sem images show typical hydrozincite morphology 2 dimensional platelets flattened on 100 55 72 which are cemented together as larger particles however the size of the platelets on the single pass sludge is smaller than the size of platelets on the hds sem image several platelet length measurements were taken averaging 0 13 μm for single pass and 0 57 μm for the hds indicating more long range order in the hds precipitate this was supported by xrd analysis fig 4a the xrd pattern of single pass sludge shows highly amorphous material whereas the xrd of the hds has defined peaks corresponding to hydrozincite fig s5 this coupled with an increase in particle size from 36 to 53 μm indicates that more heterogenous precipitation is occurring with the recycled sludge acting a seed particles tga conducted on single pass and hds shows a total mass loss of circa 25 corresponding to the theoretical mass of seen with hydrozincite for both the single pass and hds sludge the major mass loss occurs between 170 and 270 c corresponding to the loss of chemically bound h2o and co2 in hydrozincite circa 25 however the single pass sludge also sees a 3 mass loss at 150 160 c attributed to the loss of surface bound water the presence of this mass loss seen only in the tga for the single pass sludge supports the theory that there is less surface bound water in hds allowing densification of the particles this is supported by the high dry solids content in the hds compared with the single pass sludge 4 11 compared to 0 36 3 3 implications for semi passive treatment of zinc bearing cnmd the authors anticipate that na2co3 could find application in semi passive treatment of zinc bearing mine waters achieved with no on site operators an automatic dosing system and passive separation process e g gravity separation the only operational input would be replenishing of dosing reagents and sludge management and some general maintenance the data presented in this paper demonstrates the efficacy of na2co3 as a reagent for dosing of zn bearing mine waters na2co3 could be used to reduce dissolved concentrations of zinc and other metals and enabling waterbodies to achieve environmental quality standards eqs whilst staying within environmentally acceptable effluent ph eliminating the need for an additional ph correction process reducing reagent and operational costs it should be noted that some of the sites investigated where the resulting ph was above 9 would need further process optimization with regards to dosage or it may be that na2co3 dosing is not feasible for this particular mine water the authors acknowledge that the addition on na2co3 could increase the salinity in the receiving body however the increased salinity of the effluent would likely be diluted substantially by the receiving water body and currently there is no eqs for salinity in the uk nevertheless in other locations where salinity can pose a significant problem and there are strictly water quality standards for salinity an investigation into the effect of the added salinity on the receiving body would need to be completed as part of the trial process dosing of na2co3 can be achieved in a straightforward way using na2co3 solution which can be made up on site or tankered in in remote locations it may be more feasible for the dosing solution to be made up on site for temperate climates it is recommended that 5 w v solution is used 73 this is to prevent na2co3 crystalizing in the dosing tank when temperatures it is may also be possible to use treated mine water to make up the dosing solution reducing transport costs simple systems involving semi passive dosing of na2co3 in briquette form have already been used in the usa for amd control 74 further work would be required to investigate whether dosing solid na2co3 is as effective for zn and other metal removal when compared to other alkali reagents such as naoh ca oh 2 and cao na2co3 has less severe safety hazard rating meaning it is lower risk reagent for lone operators na2co3 is readily available as it is commonly used in potable water treatment facilities and for ph correction 73 the combination of these factors means that na2co3 dosing can lend itself effectively and practically for the treatment of zn bearing mine waters however whilst the na2co3 can readily remove dissolved zn and other target contaminant metals the resultant precipitate sludge has a high water content 99 and volume which may require extended dewatering times in addition the particles within the sludge were found to be relatively small 2 100 μm and stable zeta potential of 24 28 mv likely to make solid liquid separation difficult the work has established some strategies which should be explored further laboratory trials have shown that by adding the na2co3 precipitant dropwise the sludge volume can be reduced section 3 2 1 for semi passive dosing mine water treatment systems where sludge volumes are high dropwise addition could offer a simple technique that can be employed passively e g multiple dosing points across precipitation tank pond with potential to reduce the cost and operational implications of high sludge volumes contacting the precipitated solids with the mine water during dosing may encourage hds formation whilst this has not been tested passively existing passive mine water technologies that encourage contact with precipitates include vertical flow reactors 75 76 similarly configurations from wastewater treatment such as sludge bed clarification may also be considered here we have shown that hds can readily be formed from the zn na2co3 system proposed without the use of flocculant or other reagents the sludge had better settling characteristics with higher dry solids content showing potential for rapid settling velocities and better dewatering incorporation of a process to encourage hds would result in large reductions in sludge volume na2co3 dosing has been shown to be effective on a range of mine water chemistries and is therefore a promising option for widescale implementation if considering just the mine drainages studied in this paper a total of 3387 million litres of mine water would be treated each year removing circa 87 000 kg zn table 5 the sludge produced has a high in zn content circa 45 zn dry solids which suggests that the sludge could be used as a potential zn resource which might partially offset operational costs and retain zn in a circular economy and prevent pollution the main contributor to the operational cost is the cost of reagents as the scheme is to be operated semi passively from these experiments it can be estimated that the reagent costs to treat mine water with sodium carbonate ranges from 0 01 0 18 per m3 although a direct comparison is not possible other study and reports have shown these values are comparable to other water treatment dosed schemes 77 but do not require additional opex costs such as energy or operating staff 4 conclusions na2co3 dosing was successfully applied to a range of zn rich circum neutral mine waters achieving a final zn concentration of 1 mgl 1 and a final ph 9 precipitates were characterized using elemental digest xrd sem eds and tga indicating that the precipitate was hydrozincite this was corroborated by phreeqci modelling the high zn content in the precipitates and the fact that all sites would produce a precipitate with similar elemental composition is promising for the potential recovery of zn metal sludge volume and settling characteristics were shown to be improved by varying process conditions dropwise addition of precipitate yielded lower sludge volumes with smaller particles a promising simple approach to sludge reduction that easily be implemented semi passively hds was shown to readily form using na2co3 dosing and cycling the zn sludge without flocculant reducing the sludge volume substantially and improving the settling velocity characterisation of the hds sludge was conducted to improve understanding of the mechanism of hds formation in this system the findings of the characterisation provided evidence for increased heterogenous precipitation increased compressibility of particle suspension and increased agglomeration due to decrease in zeta potential the study demonstrates the efficacy and suitability of na2co3 dosing for semi passive treatment of zn offering high removal rates for a range of mine

12463,floating treatment wetlands ftw are a promising solution for improving the quality of wastewater discharges yet they exhibit a wide range of total phosphorous tp removal performances raising uncertainty about their reliability this study investigates the potential of enhanced ftw equipped with recycled cellular concrete cc to improve the phosphorous p treatment of agri food wastewater a side by side evaluation of different size ftws representing 24 48 and 72 of pilot lagoons surface with 5 10 and 15 kg cc respectively and a control pilot lagoon without ftw was performed the pilot lagoon with a 72 coverage ratio exhibited the highest tp mass removal averaging 29 9 and resulting in a 16 median increase compared to the control lagoon the 24 and 48 coverage ftw promoted more consistent and less variable tp treatment efficiency than the control lagoon which achieved p removal only during algal blooms phosphorous was mostly sorbed onto cc within ftw min max 79 94 of tp removed plants had little contribution to overall phosphorous removal and were responsible for 4 6 of tp removed depending on plant density sedimentation and algal assimilation and were responsible for 14 of tp removed in the densest ftw and were the main tp removal driving force in the control lagoon from a circular economy perspective up to 31 g p kg cc were sorbed on cc of which 89 weakly and calcium bound p could be available to plant assimilation further investigation over cc could provide insight into the best valorization route graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords treatment wetland wastewater calcium phosphate plant biomass production algal growth data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agri food industrial sites especially meat processing facilities mpf consume large quantities of water and generate wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter and nutrients mpfs are responsible for 24 of the total freshwater consumption by the food and beverage industry and around 29 of the worldwide agriculture sector consumption 1 making them one of the largest wastewater producers additionally mpf contains large amounts of total phosphorous tp total nitrogen tn total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss and biochemical oxygen demand bod as water management practices have shifted toward more sustainable goals such as nutrient recovery water reuse and efficient wastewater treatment recovering valuable by products i e phosphorous from wastewater have gained more attention in recent years indeed while p is a finite and geographically restricted resource 2 it is a fundamental element to all living organisms and largely used in fertilizers application in conventional farming practices under the gradual depletion of phosphorous resources recovering p from mpf could help close the loop and secure global food production in this context selecting the best technology to achieve high treatment efficiency of mpfs effluents while promoting p sustainable management has become necessary in france approximately 7000 agri food industries are potentially concerned by p discharge problems during dry seasons 3 water bodies are known to be more sensitive to eutrophication in summer due to low stream flows and limited dilution hence many agri food wastewater treatment plants wwtp operate under p and n discharge limits during summer and wwtp secondary effluents are often stored in lagoons until the receiving water body s base flow is high enough to allow for the dilution of the treated wastewater discharges as a result doses of iron chloride fecl3 are increased to ensure extensive p removal through chemical physical precipitation in secondary treatment resulting in increased operational cost and sludge volume 4 an innovative and sustainable solution to upgrade existing treatment trains and improve wwtp nutrient removal and recovery performances would be to install floating treatment wetlands ftw on the surface of tertiary lagoons ftws are an intermediate derivative of constructed wetlands and ponds they consist of emergent vegetation planted on a floating structure where roots expand freely into the water body and act as a biofilter for pollutants 5 they are used as a retrofit to stormwater retention ponds rivers and lagoons to improve water quality and treatment efficiency despite increasing experimental works dealing with ftws performances design basics are still unavailable for sizing ftw systems capable of reaching desired pollutant removal objectives for wastewater treatment 6 8 while some ftw field experiments for stormwater treatment are reported in the literature 9 most ftw studies for wastewater applications are conducted at lab or mesocosm scale system volume 5 m3 and under ftw coverage ratio varying from 50 to 100 8 10 in a field experiment for stormwater treatment winston et al 11 found that a low ftw coverage ratio 10 20 could improve pollutant capture within ponds but not always significantly in a lab scale study samal et al 12 suggested that increasing ftw coverage ratio could benefit the removal of some pollutants phosphorous and nitrogen and also alerted that this may come to the expense of other pollutants organic pollutants in absence of field validation these results remain of limited utility in terms of transferability to field implementation hence understanding the effect of coverage ratio on wastewater treatment performances at pilot and field scale is crucial for ftw design optimization for instance determining the required surface area of a ftw to achieve a specific effluent concentration could be essential information to evaluate project feasibility and help practitioners and decision makers successfully implement this technology furthermore while ftws have been identified as capable of removing suspended solids and heavy metals from wastewater their performance in nutrient removal especially phosphorous is highly variable 13 many studies investigated ftw nutrient removal enhancement by adding sorbing materials 14 it is believed that this addition could ensure high removal rates of nutrients particularly phosphorous especially during cold seasons when the plant phytoremediation activity is reduced 15 it also can help optimize the operational cost of an existing wastewater treatment plant by recovering nutrients i e phosphorous the sorbing material could be redirected as a marketable by product of wastewater treatment and used as soil fertilizer without requiring further extraction processes providing p bioavailability and sanitary conditions are met moreover adding a sorbing material can also reduce the volume of chemicals used for p precipitation and their presence in the generated wastewater sludge which could make them more appropriate for agricultural land application among sorbing materials investigated in the literature cellular concrete cc a lightweight building material used in civil construction for insulation and structure reinforcement is considered a good candidate cc has been assessed for its phosphorous retention capacity in many works in the literature given its high content in calcium and silicate 16 19 it was found that cc could achieve phosphorus maximum langmuir capacity ranging from 7 to 19 5 mg po4 p g under reported experimental conditions the results from mesocosm batch tests run over 40 days using synthetic wastewater emphasized the promising use of cellular concrete to improve ftw p removal efficiency 20 however possible sorption competition with other elements present in real effluent effect of various cc dosage and ftw coverage ratio as well as variability in treatment performance over various seasons could not be assessed in this experimental set up in france 170 000 m3 of cc are manufactured annually generating a large volume of material scraps waste 21 while material scraps are marketed to third parties i e backfill substrate mineral mulch cat litter they could also be recycled as a p sorbing material to upgrade ftw promoting the local circular economy the present work investigated the potential of enhanced ftws equipped with cc aggregates to treat and retrieve p in tertiary treatment lagoon implemented for p rich agri food effluent a side by side evaluation of different size ftws and a control lagoon without ftw was performed through a pilot scale experiment to assess cc and ftw coverage ratio effect in real conditions i e real wastewater dynamic condition over 10 months the main objectives of this study were i to assess the performance of enhanced ftw equipped with cc to improve p removal and recovery from agri food effluents at the tertiary stage and under real conditions ii to assess the effect of ftw coverage ratio and cc dosage on the treatment performance through a mass balance approach iii to understand phosphorous removal mechanisms and pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot experiment description a pilot experiment of a total surface of 50 m2 was designed and installed on the site of an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant wwtp of a meat processing facility located in the bretagne region france 47 6080 2 5517 fig 1 the wwtp treats on average 1020 m3 day primary and secondary treatments including phosphorus chemical treatment via fecl3 injection into the activated sludge process take place before the wastewater effluent reaches the tertiary treatment step this step is composed of six lagoons in series to ensure the good

to existing conventional lagoons 3 22 the water operating depth was 1 m typical of the lagoons used in domestic and industrial wastewater treatment lagoons 22 l24 l48 and l72 were equipped with ftw covering 24 48 and 72 of their water surface respectively to assess the effect of ftw size on pollutant removal their treatment benefits were compared to l0 without ftw set as a control one two and three ftw modules length x width 1 3 m 1 2 m were installed on l24 l48 and l72 respectively a 400 l day semi continuous feed i e batch fed every 6 h was applied to obtain a 16 25 days residence time representative of real lagoons operation water from the 2nd real scale lagoons was pumped into four feeding tanks one per pilot lagoon and spiked to 15 mg po4 p l typical of agri food effluents with kh2po4 concentrated solution to simulate the absence of p chemical treatment in the wwtp secondary stage this experimental set up allows assessing the potential of ftw to recover and treat p from agri food effluents at the tertiary stage the spiked effluent was then delivered by gravity to each pilot lagoon 200 l outlet tanks were installed downstream of the pilot lagoons outlet to facilitate water sampling four submersible pressure transducers ptx5032 druck unik5000 series product line output 4 20 ma measurement ranges 0 1 m h2o precision 0 2 of full scale were set up within the outlet tanks to provide instantaneous water level measurements from which outflows volumes were calculated outlet tanks were black filmed to prevent algal proliferation fig 2 they were regularly checked and cleaned with p free detergent to remove organic deposition from the tank s walls ftw modules were supplied by svitec a french engineering consultancy company every ftw module consisted of a molded recycled polyethylene frame on which a honeycomb structure was installed to hold the plants all ftws were planted with emergent and perennial macrophytes carex riparia 10 plants m2 native to northern france 23 the plants were transplanted to the real scale tertiary lagoon for acclimation and establishment in september 2019 plants and roots biofilm were allowed to adapt to the pilot inflow concentration for 1 month before the start of the experiment recycled cc particle size 7 15 mm was purchased from la florentaise company france recycled polyethylene bags mesh size 2 mm were used to hold cc within ftw modules at the start of the experiment march 2021 two bags filled with about 2 5 kg cc each were hung underneath every ftw module using a stainless steel fixing bar hence 5 4 9 5 and 15 8 kg cc were added to l24 l48 and l72 respectively additionally four small bags length x width 13 7 5 cm average thickness 5 cm filled with 30 mg cc were distributed close to the larger cc bags at mid depth 50 cm of water surface to facilitate cc retrieval and analysis throughout the experiment the pilots operation was automated and remotely controllable in addition a mini weather station watchdog micro stations was installed at the experimental site to monitor rainfall and air temperature at 15 min intervals 2 2 physico chemical parameters monitoring in situ multiparameter probes aqua troll multiparameter sonde were installed at 40 cm depth and 25 cm from the lagoons outlet to continuously monitor water ph dissolved oxygen do and water temperature all data were logged at a 15 min intervals as a linear average of 7 measures every 2 min probes were calibrated monthly 2 3 water sampling and analysis the performance of wastewater treatment systems was assessed monthly with flow weighted composite samples collected over 24 h 24 automatic samplers with 24 polypropylene bottles of 1 l volume were installed to collect samples in each outlet tank and the feeding tank of l24 given that the 4 pilot lagoons received the same flow only l24 inflow quality was monitored water samples were sent to an external certified laboratory inovalys nantes france and analyzed for total phosphorous tp and orthophosphate po4 3 concentrations calcium and turbidity measurements were performed at imt atlantique s laboratory according to european methods en iso7980 and en iso7027 respectively additionally chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn concentrations were determined by inovalys one month after the start of the experiment three water column samples were collected with 1 l bailers in each pilot lagoon and composited for further analysis of chlorophyll a by inovalys according to nf t90 117 treatment performances were

outflow volume in l c in and c out inflow and outflow concentration in mg l 1 plants aerial and root tissue cellular concrete and sediments were quarterly sampled to understand removal mechanisms and phosphorous partition samples tp concentrations were determined as detailed in the following sections 2 4 plant monitoring sampling and analysis nutrient uptake by c riparia was determined through analysis of plant tissue samples as the plant harvest cannot be achieved seasonally without penalizing ftw treatment performance a non destructive methodology was adopted to estimate plant biomass production shoots biomass dry weight was predicted from shoot length and density shoots counts measurements as per headley et al 25 similarly the characterization of root network morphology length and perimeter was utilized as an indirect method to assess root biomass dry weight a sub set of plants representative of the plants size variability on the ftws was selected for biomass measurement shoot and root samples were collected for each selected plant 1 per ftw module i e 1 for l24 2 for l48 and 3 for l72 in january june and october 2021 single shoot length and width root network perimeter and majority length of samples were measured all samples were then dried at 105 c until constant weight samples were sent to inovalys laboratory to determine their tn and tp concentrations shoots and roots morphological data were correlated to their respective dry weight this procedure was repeated every sampling mission january june and october 2021 to validate the correlation eqs n 59 for shoots n 16 for root sub samples the shoot and root biomass dry weight of a given plant size type were hence obtained by eqs 2 and 3 2 shoot dry weight g d n 0 0083 l 90 w n r 2 0 96 3 root dry weight g 0 5603 p n r 2 0 97 where dn is the number of shoots per plant for the plant of size type n l90 is the plant majority shoot length below which about 90 of shoots occurred cm wn is the plant mean shoot width cm and pn is the plant root network perimeter for the plant of size type n cm in october 2021 the shoot biomass of ftw modules was harvested dried and weighted to develop further a shoot biomass estimate equation based on the following 1 the theoretical ftw module shoot biomass dry weight is calculated by summing individual shoot biomass estimates eq 2 present on the ftw module 2 and a correction factor rc accounting for the difference between the actual entire shoot biomass dry weight harvested on the module in october 2021 and the theoretical biomass dry weight 1 r c harvested

and need for cc replacement were assessed by monitoring cc p content over time a baseline assessment of initial cc p content was performed at the start of the experiment on a fresh cc sample one small bag per ftw module was retrieved quarterly and analyzed for tp content by inovalys according to nf en 16170 method tp accumulation on the cellular concrete contained in the small bags was assumed representative of p accumulation on cc contained in the cc large bags i e 2 5 kg cc bags in order to confirm this assumption a cc composite sample was collected at the end of the experimental monitoring in one large bag of each ftw module fig 1 and tp concentration was determined tp mass sorbed on cc per ftw module was estimated as follows 9 m tp cc tp cc m cc where m tp cc is the mass of tp sorbed on cc kg p tp cc is the cc tp concentration g p kg 1 and m cc is the cc mass per ftw module kg cc ftw module in addition the forms of p compounds on cc were assessed at the end of the experiment through a sequential chemical extraction as per barca et al 26 four fractions of p were sequentially extracted from 20 g fresh cc granular size 7 15 mm and composite cc sample mixture of cc retrieved from the pilot lagoons l24 l48 and l72 after 10 months i the bicarbonate extractable p fraction was extracted in 200 ml of 0 5 m nahco3 it represents weakly bound p ii the hydroxide extractable p fraction was extracted in 200 ml of 0 1 m naoh it represented fe and al associated p iii the diluted hcl extractable p fraction was extracted in 200 ml of 1 m hcl it is defined as ca associated p iv the hot concentrated hcl extractable p fraction was extracted in 100 ml of 12 m hcl in a 20 min water bath at 80 c it represents p in stable residual form a material to extracting solution ratio of 0 5 kg l was used in the extractions i ii and iii for 16 h extraction time at 20 c and 125 rpm of agitation adapted from en 12457 1 2002 after each extraction the samples were washed with 25 ml of 1 m kcl to recover p re adsorbed on the material surface the kcl washes were added to the supernatant solution as per headley et al 25 all the experiments were performed in duplicate supernatant orthophosphate concentrations were determined using phosver 3 hach tubes for reactive soluble phosphate 0 1 63 mg po4 p l equivalent to usepa method 365 2 and standard ascorbic acid method 4500 p e 27 in addition an x ray diffraction xrd analysis was performed on a cc composite sample and on a fresh cc sample to identify the main p forms sorbed onto the material surface the cc composite sample was prepared from all cc retrieved from pilot lagoons after 11 months of deployment the xrd patterns were obtained with bruker advance diffractometer with a cu kα source operated at 100 kv and 30 ma the minimum and maximum values for 2θ were 5 and 70 respectively the step size was 0 015 the patterns were compared to the reference chemical database for phase identification 2 6 sediment sampling and analysis each pilot lagoon s bottom was divided into 3 successive along the length of the pilot lagoon zones of identical surface area one sediment sample was collected in each zone along the width of the pilot lagoon during the first 2 quarterly sampling missions the sediment layer was extremely loose and thin preventing appropriate sampling and thus was not analyzed all collected samples were kept in polypropylene containers under ice blocks until arrival at the laboratory samples were left to settle overnight then the supernatant was removed using a 200 ml syringe a composite sample was prepared to ensure sufficient sample size for chemical analysis 1 g dry weight half of the composite sample was sent to inovalys for tp analysis while the other half was analyzed for loss on ignition at imt atlantique s laboratory according to the standard european method nf en15935 2 7 tp mass balance a tp mass balance was performed in every pilot lagoon to understand tp pathways within the different system compartments cellular concrete plants and sediments biofilm and algae equal tp inflow mass load was assumed for the four pilot lagoons cumulative tp inflow and outflow loads m tp in out were obtained by integrating the tp mass over the monitoring period using the midpoint rule practically this assumed that the pollutant mass load entering exiting the system between the time ti 1 and ti corresponds to the product of the volume and mean concentration between ti 1 and ti 10 m tp in out t 0 tf c t q t dt i 1 n 1 2 c t i c t i 1 v t i v t i 1 where c t i 1 and c t i

analyses were performed with minitab 19 with a confidence level of α 0 05 the performances of the 4 pilot s lagoons were compared to identify enhancement induced by floating treatment wetlands and the effect of coverage on phosphorous treatment p mass removal efficiencies were tested for normality using the anderson darling test if data were normally distributed repeated measure anova was performed sampling time was set as a random factor while each treatment was considered as a fixed factor when significant differences between treatments were present a bonferroni pairwise comparisons test was performed to identify which pair means differed if data were not normally distributed the non parametric test kruskal wallis was used to compare medians the relationship between pilot lagoons tp removal efficiencies and their respective outflow physico chemical properties was investigated using pearson correlation to provide insight into removal mechanisms only significant correlations are discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic conditions the experiment monitoring started on march 2021 and lasted until december 2021 the experiment ran in a mild oceanic climate where moderate rainfall was frequent in the summer season june august supplementary material s1 water sampling was performed on dry days except in may and july where daily rainfall was 1 2 mm and 0 6 mm respectively fig 3 b during the first 2 months of monitoring air temperature ranged between 3 1 and 27 5 c average temperature 12 7 4 4 c while water temperature varied from 5 4 to 18 c average temperature 11 1 4 c in the pilot lagoons fig 3 a these water temperatures would have slowed the establishment of the system as biological activities are highly influenced by temperature and their metabolism is known to be hindered under 15 c 28 in may the mean temperature increased and plants developed rapidly water temperature followed seasonal air temperature trends and was the highest in june and july fig 3 a the ftws acted as insulation as shown by the lower water temperature in summer in l24 l72 compared to the control lagoon when the maximum air temperature was 34 c in june the maximum water temperature reached 29 8 c in l0 28 c in l24 27 5 c in l48 and 24 8 c in l72 they also exhibited lower temperatures than l0 in the cold season up to 1 4 c lower than the water s mean monthly temperature of l0 3 2 water quality monitoring 3 2 1 inflow composition tertiary effluent was spiked with 1 4 g p l kh2po4 the tp mean concentration averaged 14 0 2 3 mg p l mean sd the main inflow phosphorous form was orthophosphate 96 3 a dysfunction in the metering pump used for the kh2po4 spike resulted in reduced tp concentration in may and june 10 3 mg p l the maximum inflow tp concentration 18 mg p l coincided with the site tertiary effluents high phosphorous concentration in august min max 0 8 2 7 mg p l inflow cod concentrations were consistently lower than the discharge limit 80 mg o2 l with an average of 34 4 7 7 mg o2 l mean tn concentrations was 11 6 7 mg n l table 1 3 2 2 phosphorous removal trends most of the 4 pilot lagoons outflow phosphorous form was in dissolved orthophosphate form 95 2 hence only tp concentrations are presented in this paper all pilot lagoons mean tp outflow concentrations were statistically lower than mean tp inflow concentrations p 0 05 on average 3 1 mg l lower l72 achieved the highest tp mean mre averaging 29 9 compared to 21 11 for l48 18 11 for l24 and 19 21 for l0 fig 3 c although l0 l24 and l48 had comparable mean mre l0 mre was highly variable minimum 1 5 maximum 49 fig 3 c this significant variance prevented the inclusion of l0 data in the repeated measure anova test which only included l24 l48 and l72 mres to assess the coverage ratio and cc effect on treatment efficiency l72 was found to significantly increase tp mre compared to l24 p 0 001 and l48 p 0 016 no statistically significant difference between l24 and l48 mres was observed p 0 482 tp removal efficiency was positively correlated to the daily average water temperature for l48 r2 0 811 p 0 05 and l72 r2 0 856 p 0 05 no significant correlation was found for l24 despite a r2 0 662 and l0 r2 0 052 l24 limited water temperature data compared to the other lagoons due to equipment failure may explain this result in addition tp mre was strongly correlated to water ph values in l0 r2 0 916 p 0 05 while no significant correlation was obtained in l24 l48 and l72 l24 l48 and l72 ph did not significantly vary on sampling days fig 3 d to the authors knowledge the present study is the first to address the treatment of p rich real wastewater effluents 15 mg p l by ftw equipped with cc and under semi continuous flow most of the reported work in the literature assessed upgraded ftw with p sorbing material treatment performances under low tp concentrations ranging from 0 2 to 4 3 mg p l table 2 moreover comparing ftw equipped with cc to traditional ftws phosphorous removal performances should be done with caution design parameters local climatic conditions effluent type and plant species are believed to strongly affect system efficiency for instance tp average mre obtained by l72 was in the same range as the tp concentrations removal efficiency obtained by benvenuti et al 29 in a real scale application for high tp inlet concentration 9 4 mg l removal efficiency 37 however benvenuti et al 29 tested the efficiency of 100 coverage ftw planted with typha domingensis to treat raw wastewater 29 their ftws were not equipped with any phosphorous sorbing material they operated under 11 5 1 3 days average hydraulic retention time 67 8 m3 d loading rate and a recirculation rate of 53 8 m3 d compared to the semi continuous flow rate of 0 4 m3 d in the present study 0 1 m3 every 6 h higher inflow tss 80 200 mg l cod 200 700 mg l and tkn 40 180 mg n l in the work of benvenuti et al 29 would have favored different processes given the different c n p proportions that impact microbial and plant uptake other removal pathways would have occurred phosphorous removal obtained by benvenuti et al 29 without p sorbing material may be due to the increased recirculation rate or higher plant coverage resulting in higher plant density which would have increased the system performance 3 2 3 physico chemical monitoring 3 2 3 1 control lagoon l0 exhibited the highest water column ph 8 2 0 6 mean standard deviation during the monitoring period compared to l24 ph 7 4 0 5 l48 ph 7 3 0 2 and l72 7 2 0 2 fig 3 d l0 was mainly characterized by do oversaturation do concentrations were higher than equilibrium do concentrations at the water s daily average temperature designated by reference do in fig 3 e l0 water ph was positively correlated to do concentrations r 0 802 p 0 004 which fluctuated during the monitoring period from 0 to 20 mg l these observations indicate increased algae activity as algae use co2 during photosynthesis and release it back at night during respiration 28 on different occasions l0 calcium ca outflow concentrations were lower than that at the inflow especially at 20 41 153 and 223 days red arrows on fig 3 f while the remaining time ca outflow concentrations were not significantly different from the inflow concentration 3 2 3 2 pilot lagoons equipped with cc covered lagoons ensured on average lower and more stable ph values than the control lagoon fig 3 d despite the presence of cc bags under the ftw modules l24 l48 and l72 were characterized by depleted do concentrations fig 3 e indeed ftws create low do conditions as they block gaseous exchange along the water surface and shade out the photosynthetic activity and therefore do production in the water column 30 internal oxygen transportation in plants and leakage from roots can provide additional oxygen into the rhizosphere however the extensive root network and attached biofilms beneath the ftws usually have a more considerable respiratory activity o2 consumption reducing the do level in the water column 13 30 31 l24 l48 and l72 outflow ca concentrations followed similar trends as the inflow ca concentration fig 3 f during the first 8 months of operations march october the pilot lagoons equipped with ftws and cc exhibited higher ca concentrations at the outlet than at the inlet and l0 outlet the highest ca concentrations were obtained at l72 followed by l48 and l24 outlets at 41 days from the start of the experiment then outflow ca concentrations progressively decreased approaching the inlet concentration fig 3 c after 150 days no significant difference was observed between inflow and l24 outflow calcium concentrations highlighting the depletion of the calcium release capacity of the 5 kg cc embedded within l24 in contrast a longer period of time i e 260 days was needed before no difference was observed between the calcium concentrations measured at the inflow and outflow of l72 andl48 3 3 plant biomass production and analysis c riparia had satisfactory above ground biomass development during the experiment supplementary material s2 shoot biomass dry weight increased by 4 8 1 6 between january and june 2021 and reached 3 1 0 6 kg d w ftw module in october 2021 despite the root s majority length increase the roots biomass estimate did not show any significant increase and averaged 0 3 0 03 kg ftw module over the monitoring period some roots might have died and settled at the bottom of the pilot lagoon and or been washed out the high tp inflow concentration and limited tn loads compared to p loads may have influenced the root expansion within the water column relatively shorter roots average majority length 38 11 cm were obtained in comparison to the average c riparia root length 48 2 cm reported by barco et al 32 for municipal and agricultural wastewater median water tn and tp ranges 1 7 23 mg n l and 0 004 4 3 mg p l respectively indeed high nutrient concentrations were readily available close to the roots limiting their need to expend resulting in increased shoot biomass production and reduced root expansion similar observations were reported by bauer et al 33 over typha domingensis used for nutrient rich wastewater treatment application yet with different water n p mass ratios n p 18 1 compared to 0 8 1 on average in the present study bauer et al 33 results are in accordance with the findings of barco et al 32 who reported that root length and biomass are negatively correlated to nutrient levels in the water plants are known to adjust to various nutrient concentrations for instance in response to n and p deficiency root systems tend to be more developed 34 and increased growth of root hairs is observed 35 moreover root morphological traits changed over the experiment duration while plants had thin and lateral roots at baseline thick rhizomes gradually appeared supplementary material s2 some shoots emerged at the end of the long rhizome and then developed to produce a new tuft resulting in a matted growth pattern supplementary material s2 these field observations are aligned with the carex reproduction cycle indeed carex is known to be able to reproduce by rhizomes they can produce both relatively long spreading clumping rhizomes 36 roots and shoots tp mean concentrations averaged 6 5 1 8 g p kg and 3 0 8 g p kg respectively during the monitoring period fig 4 b tp concentrations were higher for roots than shoots tissues with a mean difference of 3 5 g kg p value 0 0001 over the whole monitoring period no significant differences were found in roots tp concentrations nor shoots tp concentrations between the different sampling times p 0 402 however roots tp concentration had high variability range compared to a more homogeneous concentration in shoots during the monitoring period for instance in october 50 of root sub samples tp concentrations were lower than the roots mean tp concentration this observation could be explained by roots sloughing off and senescence as the plant approached the dormancy period phosphorous might have also been translocated to shoots as reported by keizer vlek et al 37 to sustain plant development phosphorous concentration in shoots is similar to previous studies evaluating macrophytes in nutrient rich wastewaters 38 39 and stormwater retention ponds 40 they were also within the range of most species used in wetland studies 1 4 g kg dw biomass 28 however barco et al 32 reported shoots and roots tp concentrations 10 times lower than those observed in the present study for carex species this difference could be explained by the low p concentration of the wastewater used in their work compared to the current inflow composition 3 4 cellular concrete analysis cellular concrete tp concentration increased from 0 2 g p kg at baseline up to 31 g p kg over the monitoring period fig 5 a the decreasing tp concentrations of cc samples taken at different longitudinal locations from the system inlet could reflect the hydraulic effect on sorption less phosphorous reached cc bags near the exit compared to the bags placed closer to the inlet this difference could also result from the competition with plant uptake and other physico chemical processes for instance cc sampled under the first ftw in l72 exhibited lower tp concentration than samples obtained at the same location in l24 and l48 fig 5 a cap compound precipitation is known to be positively correlated with temperature increased under basic conditions and highly dependent on ca oh po4 p stoichiometry eq 17 the lower ph and temperature values reported in l72 compared to l24 and l48 may therefore be responsible for the lower cellular concrete p concentration measured in l72 cc performance was compared to other sorbing materials investigated in the literature to enhance ftw tp removal table 2 most of the reported studies investigated the sorbing material potential to increase ftw performances at lower tp concentrations 0 5 mg p l average concentration and higher dosages compared to the current work for instance shen et al 20 used 8 times higher dosage of cc in g m3 of water than the highest cc dosage used in the present study for l72 to remove phosphorous from simulated runoff with p concentration ranging from 1 to 3 mg p l the authors obtained p removal efficiency varying from 67 to 76 their results were obtained under batch conditions for 8 days while the results of the present study were obtained under semi continuous feed and 16 days of residence time wang et al 41 used zeolite and sponge iron to improve ammonia and phosphorous removal from reclaimed water inflow tn 3 7 0 7 mg l and inflow tp 0 75 0 2 mg l the upgraded ftw increased the removal of tp compared to its paired traditional ftw without zeolite nor sponge iron by 29 7 the authors concluded that both zeolite and sponge iron participated in phosphorous sorption for a total inlet load of 858 g tp zeolite and sponge iron p content reached 0 2 g p kg and 0 6 g p kg respectively after 2 years of experiment operation in contrast the high cc p content in the present work 13 31 g p kg d w at only 2 3 kg cc m3 water for l72 under a total of 1171 g tp load after 10 months of operation can underline the great potential of cc for p removal a greater dosage may provide increased tp removal the results of the p sequential extraction on a cc composite sample at the end of the experiment highlighted that 86 12 of sorbed p mean sd was bound to calcium 3 0 02 was weakly bound p 1 0 2 was bound to aluminum and iron fraction while 10 1 2 was in stable residual form fig 5 b the xrd analysis of cc before and after 10 month deployment in the present experiment proved the formation of hydroxyapatite hap like compounds on the material surface fig 6 some calcite bassanite and tobermorite peaks were detected by xrd on the fresh cc sample but not on the cc sample retrieved at the end of the experiment the disappearance of these peaks could be due to calcium release and the formation of crystallization products on the surface of cc 42 additional peaks emerged for cc at the end of the experiment at 25 8 and 32 1 which is characteristic of hap indicating the formation of amorphous hap flattened peak on the cc surface the low labile fraction 3 suggests that p accumulated on cc will not be easily solubilized in water which makes p rich cc a perfect source for p slow release if applied as fertilizer arenas montaño 43 has reviewed the fertilizer replacement potential of various phosphorous saturated media and found that p bound to ca in investigated media is more available to plants than p bound to al fe the cc used in the present experiment is already considered an agriculture medium as per the nf u551 standard 44 while cc is commercialized as a substrate component for green roofs and is integrated into growing media for ornamental nurseries 45 it can be assumed that the resulting p rich cc could be easily applied as fertilizer provided that other requirements for such use are met e g low pathogenic and heavy metal content to ensure sanitary conditions are met a sanitation step may be required prior to cc application on crops e g solar drying 3 5 sediment analysis during the experiment monitoring sediment load kg could not be estimated by direct measurement hence it was impossible to determine the mass of tp accumulated in the sediment however sediment tp concentration and organic content measured in october 2021 were indicators of tp accumulation within the lagoons the higher ftw coverage ratio and cc dosage resulted in the lower sediment tp concentration l0 presented the highest sediment tp concentration 44 6 g p kg followed by l24 18 3 g p kg l48 11 2 g p kg and l72 7 2 g p kg respectively the sediment loss on ignition indicated that at least 50 of the composition of the sediment was organic independently of the pilot lagoons as the organic inflow load was relatively insignificant low cod and bod5 the sediments are likely the result of internal organic matter production and accumulation algae and microorganisms senescence could explain the high organic content of l0 sediments roots exudates slough off biofilm detachment and plant senescence are likely responsible for the high organic content in ftw lagoons sediments soluble phosphorous can be converted by phytoplankton into particulate p and be trapped within plant root network biofilm once they slough off particulate p will settle to the bottom of the lagoon and end up in the sediment layer 40 3 6 tp mass balance tp mass balance in l24 to l72 showed that most phosphorous was removed through sorption precipitation and crystallization on the cc fig 6 a all removed tp in l0 was attributed to the algal and microorganisms activity and sedimentation the relative contribution of each component of the pilot lagoons equipped with cc i e cc plant sediment algae microorganisms to tp removal over the period march october 2021 is summarized in fig 7 b between 78 and 98 of removed tp was accumulated on cc increasing the cc mass to 10 kg in l48 compared to 5 kg in l24 increased the overall tp mass accumulated on cc however a further increase of cc mass to 15 kg in l72 did not result in increased tp accumulation on cc fig 7 a tp mass accumulated in plants showed that c riparia participated less in tp removal than cellular concrete only 4 of removed tp was attributed to plants in l24 and l48 and 6 in l72 sedimentation microorganisms and or biofilm accounted for 2 of l48 tp mre they were responsible for 12 and 16 of tp removal in l24 and l72 respectively 3 7 main tp removal pathways 3 7 1 control lagoon 3 7 1 1 algal activity l0 performed the best when ph and do values were at their highest fig 3 c d and e the simultaneous ph and do peaks in l0 reflect the increasing algal photosynthetic activity indeed high phosphorous loads and high net solar radiation were favorable conditions for algal proliferation in open water surfaces as algae proliferate they get their carbon source from dissolved carbon dioxide in the water increasing water ph 46 and producing oxygen resulting in do oversaturation once algae start to senescence and decompose dissolved oxygen is depleted consequently decreasing tp mre for instance l0 do concentration was consistently lower than the reference do concentration in june july september november and december fig 3 e the senescent algae would have ended up in the sediment layer along with decaying microorganisms biomass 3 7 1 2 cap precipitation simultaneous calcium concentrations reduction was observed with l0 increased ph ph values 9 it is well established in wastewater treatment that increased ph could promote bicarbonate hco3 conversion to carbonate co3 2 and hence favor calcium carbonate precipitation however as water ph remained 10 3 pk hco3 co3 2 10 3 at 20 c the calcium consumption could not be explained by carbonate precipitation nevertheless given that the ca p outflow molar ratio in l0 remained greater than the 1 67 required for p ca precipitation 26 calcium phosphate precipitation may have taken place in this pilot lagoon indeed ca phosphate precipitation could only occur in l0 when water ph was adequate to initiate p removal under inflow calcium concentrations ranging between 37 and 59 mg l fig 3 f 3 7 2 pilot lagoons equipped with cc 3 7 2 1 sorption on cc the mass balance performed for pilot lagoons equipped with cc suggests that the increased cc quantity might have improved tp removal this hypothesis is in accordance with a previous laboratory experiment where cc promoted phosphorous removal by crystallization and surface precipitation under ca2 and oh ions release indeed cc once hydrated increases water ph data not shown following ca oh 2 dissolution eq 16 16 ca oh 2 ca 2 2 oh eq 2 k sp 5 02 10 6 hence more calcium could be released in the water system and be available for phosphorous removal for higher cc dosage provided ph conditions for ca p precipitation are met despite the relatively low ph values in the lagoons equipped with ftws fig 3 d po4 p inlet concentrations and ph were still in the range of values that support calcium phosphate precipitations and crystallization on cc i e po4 p between 10 and 18 mg p l and ph between 7 2 and 8 8 fig 3 b d on the one hand the low ph values in the lagoons equipped with ftws result most probably from the presence of the roots and associated secretion of exudates and microorganisms rhizosphere respiration producing co2 47 plants roots release organic acids exudates in water increasing humic content 48 49 hence root exudation could have buffered the system ph by neutralizing the hydroxide ions introduced in the system by cc hydration on the other hand the ca p molar ratio in l24 l48 and l72 outflow remained 1 67 required for cap precipitation this suggests that conditions were favorable for p removal by precipitation with calcium in all pilot lagoons equipped with cc from a mechanistic perspective calcium phosphate precipitation and crystallization follows ostwald s rule of stages depending on ca p molar ratio and solution ph the least stable cap compounds precipitate first amorphous calcium phosphate acp dicalcium phosphate dcp dicalcium phosphate dihydrate dcpd octacalcium phosphate ocp tricalcium phosphate tcp 26 then these products recrystallize into the most thermodynamically stable hydroxyapatite hap the overall chemical reaction could be summarized by 17 5 ca 2 3 h po 4 2 4 oh ca 5 p o 4 3 oh 3 h 2 o cc has been investigated as a seed surface that can enhance cap crystallization for phosphorous removal by reducing the chemical reaction energy barrier 50 moreover the positive correlation between tp mre and water temperature in l48 and l72 highlights a temperature effect on p removal indeed the calcium phosphate precipitation is favored at high temperatures the solubility of hydroxylapatite hap and its crystal growth are positively correlated to temperature 61 hence the result of the present study underlines the cc s promising application as seeds for cap precipitation and p removal from wastewater 3 7 2 2 plant uptake mass balance showed that plants had less contribution to tp removal than cc these results follow the findings of pishgar et al 51 borne 40 and tanner headley 52 however they are opposed to those of keizer vlek et al 37 and li et al 53 where plants were found to explain 99 of tp removal many factors could explain the disparity between the roles of plants in nutrient removal by ftw one factor is plant species selection as plants have different phosphorous storage capacities physico chemical conditions influence nutrient assimilation i e inflow c n p composition finally the results could be misleading if plant sampling was performed in different seasons nutrients plant s content fluctuates over the plant life cycle 7 40 especially in the cold season as plants become dormant or even die releasing tp into the water system 38 54 it is usually recommended to harvest shoots once to twice a year to prevent nutrient release into the water column 55 the harvested biomass could serve as a nutrient rich source for composting or energy production 56 further evaluation of harvested shoot composition and calorific value can help identify the best biomass valorization route although plants accumulation played a minor role in tp removal they can indirectly improve other particulate particulate n p and tss and dissolved pollutants removal they can release bioactive compounds from the plant roots and modify physico chemical conditions in the water column improving sorption and particulate tp sedimentation processes 52 moreover roots play the role of a physical filter they also serve as an additional surface for biofilm development promoting nitrification denitrification 62 hence the plant s contribution to ftw treatment performances could be underestimated if only their tp uptake were considered 3 7 2 3 other pathways algal growth is believed to be limited in lagoons equipped with ftw as they provide shade over the water column reducing photosynthetic activity however the ph peaks observed in l24 in july and august and l48 in july both measurements performed in the open water section of the pilot lagoons suggest that the available open water surface in these pilot lagoons could still support some algal photosynthetic activity chlorophyll a measurements in april corroborate this conclusion do oversaturation and ph close to 9 1 in l0 were observed simultaneously with higher chlorophyll a concentration 7 3 μg l in l0 compared to 1 6 1 8 and 4 8 μg l in l24 l48 and l72 respectively from what has been presented sedimentation played a modest role in tp removal by ftw equipped with cc the results of cc analysis showed that most of the sorbed phosphorous was retrieved on the cc surface precipitation and crystallization compared to the fraction that would have precipitated in the water column and ended up in the sediments additionally as ftw reduced algal proliferation it is expected that less sediment will be accumulated within pilot lagoons upgraded with ftw compared to the control pilot lagoon sediments are known to remobilize p under anoxic conditions in the long term hence ftw equipped with cc could promote irreversible tp removal provided proper ftw maintenance to prevent plant senescence and p release into the water column it is important to highlight that phosphorous in this work was mainly delivered in bioavailable forms orthophosphate phosphorous in agri food effluent may be in another form organic particulate hence the findings of this study may not fully reflect the dynamics of phosphorous removal biotic decomposition sorption and sedimentation of particulate p inload in real lagoons 4 conclusion the potential of different size ftw equipped with cc to enhance existing lagoons tp removal from agri food wastewater was assessed over 10 months period march december 2021 in northwestern france the pilot lagoon with 72 coverage ftw and 15 kg cc exhibited 29 9 tp average removal resulting in a 16 median increase compared to the control lagoon no ftw 19 21 while 24 and 48 coverage ftw with 5 and 10 kg cc did not significantly improve tp average removal efficiency average mre 18 11 and 21 11 respectively compared to the control pilot lagoon they promoted more consistent and less variable tp treatment efficiency indeed the control pilot lagoon provided good tp removal only during algal bloom and associated p assimilation while tp mre dropped and ranged between 1 5 and 13 3 during the remaining time the majority of phosphorous removed by ftw pilot lagoons was through sorption and precipitation on the cc representing between 79 and 94 of the total p mass removed over the monitoring period plants uptake participated slightly in p removal min max 4 6 of total p mass removed the remaining p fraction was removed through algal and biological assimilation and sedimentation ftw reduced algal growth by providing shade into the water column promoting phosphorous transfer into cc thereby reducing p sediment accumulation for selected cc dosages 5 10 and 15 kg cc plant roots organic secretion and respiration activity in the rhizosphere lowered ph thereby balancing the hydroxide ions released by cc hydration this may have reduced cc tp potential removal capacity as less oh was available to drive cap precipitation if the objective was to achieve p treatment solely by implementing cc improved ftws on the real scale tertiary lagoons i e no iron chloride added to the activated sludge process increasing cc dosage would be needed to meet the discharge limit of 1 mg p l phosphorous sorption onto cc should be considered a promising option for recycling phosphorous from wastewater effluent as soil amendments or fertilizer up to 31 g p kg cc were sorbed on cc of which 89 weakly and calcium bound p could be plant available a further material investigation could provide insight

12463,floating treatment wetlands ftw are a promising solution for improving the quality of wastewater discharges yet they exhibit a wide range of total phosphorous tp removal performances raising uncertainty about their reliability this study investigates the potential of enhanced ftw equipped with recycled cellular concrete cc to improve the phosphorous p treatment of agri food wastewater a side by side evaluation of different size ftws representing 24 48 and 72 of pilot lagoons surface with 5 10 and 15 kg cc respectively and a control pilot lagoon without ftw was performed the pilot lagoon with a 72 coverage ratio exhibited the highest tp mass removal averaging 29 9 and resulting in a 16 median increase compared to the control lagoon the 24 and 48 coverage ftw promoted more consistent and less variable tp treatment efficiency than the control lagoon which achieved p removal only during algal blooms phosphorous was mostly sorbed onto cc within ftw min max 79 94 of tp removed plants had little contribution to overall phosphorous removal and were responsible for 4 6 of tp removed depending on plant density sedimentation and algal assimilation and were responsible for 14 of tp removed in the densest ftw and were the main tp removal driving force in the control lagoon from a circular economy perspective up to 31 g p kg cc were sorbed on cc of which 89 weakly and calcium bound p could be available to plant assimilation further investigation over cc could provide insight into the best valorization route graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords treatment wetland wastewater calcium phosphate plant biomass production algal growth data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agri food industrial sites especially meat processing facilities mpf consume large quantities of water and generate wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter and nutrients mpfs are responsible for 24 of the total freshwater consumption by the food and beverage industry and around 29 of the worldwide agriculture sector consumption 1 making them one of the largest wastewater producers additionally mpf contains large amounts of total phosphorous tp total nitrogen tn total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss and biochemical oxygen demand bod as water management practices have shifted toward more sustainable goals such as nutrient recovery water reuse and efficient wastewater treatment recovering valuable by products i e phosphorous from wastewater have gained more attention in recent years indeed while p is a finite and geographically restricted resource 2 it is a fundamental element to all living organisms and largely used in fertilizers application in conventional farming practices under the gradual depletion of phosphorous resources recovering p from mpf could help close the loop and secure global food production in this context selecting the best technology to achieve high treatment efficiency of mpfs effluents while promoting p sustainable management has become necessary in france approximately 7000 agri food industries are potentially concerned by p discharge problems during dry seasons 3 water bodies are known to be more sensitive to eutrophication in summer due to low stream flows and limited dilution hence many agri food wastewater treatment plants wwtp operate under p and n discharge limits during summer and wwtp secondary effluents are often stored in lagoons until the receiving water body s base flow is high enough to allow for the dilution of the treated wastewater discharges as a result doses of iron chloride fecl3 are increased to ensure extensive p removal through chemical physical precipitation in secondary treatment resulting in increased operational cost and sludge volume 4 an innovative and sustainable solution to upgrade existing treatment trains and improve wwtp nutrient removal and recovery performances would be to install floating treatment wetlands ftw on the surface of tertiary lagoons ftws are an intermediate derivative of constructed wetlands and ponds they consist of emergent vegetation planted on a floating structure where roots expand freely into the water body and act as a biofilter for pollutants 5 they are used as a retrofit to stormwater retention ponds rivers and lagoons to improve water quality and treatment efficiency despite increasing experimental works dealing with ftws performances design basics are still unavailable for sizing ftw systems capable of reaching desired pollutant removal objectives for wastewater treatment 6 8 while some ftw field experiments for stormwater treatment are reported in the literature 9 most ftw studies for wastewater applications are conducted at lab or mesocosm scale system volume 5 m3 and under ftw coverage ratio varying from 50 to 100 8 10 in a field experiment for stormwater treatment winston et al 11 found that a low ftw coverage ratio 10 20 could improve pollutant capture within ponds but not always significantly in a lab scale study samal et al 12 suggested that increasing ftw coverage ratio could benefit the removal of some pollutants phosphorous and nitrogen and also alerted that this may come to the expense of other pollutants organic pollutants in absence of field validation these results remain of limited utility in terms of transferability to field implementation hence understanding the effect of coverage ratio on wastewater treatment performances at pilot and field scale is crucial for ftw design optimization for instance determining the required surface area of a ftw to achieve a specific effluent concentration could be essential information to evaluate project feasibility and help practitioners and decision makers successfully implement this technology furthermore while ftws have been identified as capable of removing suspended solids and heavy metals from wastewater their performance in nutrient removal especially phosphorous is highly variable 13 many studies investigated ftw nutrient removal enhancement by adding sorbing materials 14 it is believed that this addition could ensure high removal rates of nutrients particularly phosphorous especially during cold seasons when the plant phytoremediation activity is reduced 15 it also can help optimize the operational cost of an existing wastewater treatment plant by recovering nutrients i e phosphorous the sorbing material could be redirected as a marketable by product of wastewater treatment and used as soil fertilizer without requiring further extraction processes providing p bioavailability and sanitary conditions are met moreover adding a sorbing material can also reduce the volume of chemicals used for p precipitation and their presence in the generated wastewater sludge which could make them more appropriate for agricultural land application among sorbing materials investigated in the literature cellular concrete cc a lightweight building material used in civil construction for insulation and structure reinforcement is considered a good candidate cc has been assessed for its phosphorous retention capacity in many works in the literature given its high content in calcium and silicate 16 19 it was found that cc could achieve phosphorus maximum langmuir capacity ranging from 7 to 19 5 mg po4 p g under reported experimental conditions the results from mesocosm batch tests run over 40 days using synthetic wastewater emphasized the promising use of cellular concrete to improve ftw p removal efficiency 20 however possible sorption competition with other elements present in real effluent effect of various cc dosage and ftw coverage ratio as well as variability in treatment performance over various seasons could not be assessed in this experimental set up in france 170 000 m3 of cc are manufactured annually generating a large volume of material scraps waste 21 while material scraps are marketed to third parties i e backfill substrate mineral mulch cat litter they could also be recycled as a p sorbing material to upgrade ftw promoting the local circular economy the present work investigated the potential of enhanced ftws equipped with cc aggregates to treat and retrieve p in tertiary treatment lagoon implemented for p rich agri food effluent a side by side evaluation of different size ftws and a control lagoon without ftw was performed through a pilot scale experiment to assess cc and ftw coverage ratio effect in real conditions i e real wastewater dynamic condition over 10 months the main objectives of this study were i to assess the performance of enhanced ftw equipped with cc to improve p removal and recovery from agri food effluents at the tertiary stage and under real conditions ii to assess the effect of ftw coverage ratio and cc dosage on the treatment performance through a mass balance approach iii to understand phosphorous removal mechanisms and pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot experiment description a pilot experiment of a total surface of 50 m2 was designed and installed on the site of an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant wwtp of a meat processing facility located in the bretagne region france 47 6080 2 5517 fig 1 the wwtp treats on average 1020 m3 day primary and secondary treatments including phosphorus chemical treatment via fecl3 injection into the activated sludge process take place before the wastewater effluent reaches the tertiary treatment step this step is composed of six lagoons in series to ensure the good quality of the effluent before discharge into the natural water body la drayac four parallel pilot lagoons l0 l24 l48 and l72 5 m 1 3 m 1 3 m length x width x height were built downstream of the 2nd wwtp real scale lagoon therefore in the early stage of the tertiary treatment step which is representative of expected ftw implementation the ratio length width of pilot lagoons was equal to 3 8 close to existing conventional lagoons 3 22 the water operating depth was 1 m typical of the lagoons used in domestic and industrial wastewater treatment lagoons 22 l24 l48 and l72 were equipped with ftw covering 24 48 and 72 of their water surface respectively to assess the effect of ftw size on pollutant removal their treatment benefits were compared to l0 without ftw set as a control one two and three ftw modules length x width 1 3 m 1 2 m were installed on l24 l48 and l72 respectively a 400 l day semi continuous feed i e batch fed every 6 h was applied to obtain a 16 25 days residence time representative of real lagoons operation water from the 2nd real scale lagoons was pumped into four feeding tanks one per pilot lagoon and spiked to 15 mg po4 p l typical of agri food effluents with kh2po4 concentrated solution to simulate the absence of p chemical treatment in the wwtp secondary stage this experimental set up allows assessing the potential of ftw to recover and treat p from agri food effluents at the tertiary stage the spiked effluent was then delivered by gravity to each pilot lagoon 200 l outlet tanks were installed downstream of the pilot lagoons outlet to facilitate water sampling four submersible pressure transducers ptx5032 druck unik5000 series product line output 4 20 ma measurement ranges 0 1 m h2o precision 0 2 of full scale were set up within the outlet tanks to provide instantaneous water level measurements from which outflows volumes were calculated outlet tanks were black filmed to prevent algal proliferation fig 2 they were regularly checked and cleaned with p free detergent to remove organic deposition from the tank s walls ftw modules were supplied by svitec a french engineering consultancy company every ftw module consisted of a molded recycled polyethylene frame on which a honeycomb structure was installed to hold the plants all ftws were planted with emergent and perennial macrophytes carex riparia 10 plants m2 native to northern france 23 the plants were transplanted to the real scale tertiary lagoon for acclimation and establishment in september 2019 plants and roots biofilm were allowed to adapt to the pilot inflow concentration for 1 month before the start of the experiment recycled cc particle size 7 15 mm was purchased from la florentaise company france recycled polyethylene bags mesh size 2 mm were used to hold cc within ftw modules at the start of the experiment march 2021 two bags filled with about 2 5 kg cc each were hung underneath every ftw module using a stainless steel fixing bar hence 5 4 9 5 and 15 8 kg cc were added to l24 l48 and l72 respectively additionally four small bags length x width 13 7 5 cm average thickness 5 cm filled with 30 mg cc were distributed close to the larger cc bags at mid depth 50 cm of water surface to facilitate cc retrieval and analysis throughout the experiment the pilots operation was automated and remotely controllable in addition a mini weather station watchdog micro stations was installed at the experimental site to monitor rainfall and air temperature at 15 min intervals 2 2 physico chemical parameters monitoring in situ multiparameter probes aqua troll multiparameter sonde were installed at 40 cm depth and 25 cm from the lagoons outlet to continuously monitor water ph dissolved oxygen do and water temperature all data were logged at a 15 min intervals as a linear average of 7 measures every 2 min probes were calibrated monthly 2 3 water sampling and analysis the performance of wastewater treatment systems was assessed monthly with flow weighted composite samples collected over 24 h 24 automatic samplers with 24 polypropylene bottles of 1 l volume were installed to collect samples in each outlet tank and the feeding tank of l24 given that the 4 pilot lagoons received the same flow only l24 inflow quality was monitored water samples were sent to an external certified laboratory inovalys nantes france and analyzed for total phosphorous tp and orthophosphate po4 3 concentrations calcium and turbidity measurements were performed at imt atlantique s laboratory according to european methods en iso7980 and en iso7027 respectively additionally chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn concentrations were determined by inovalys one month after the start of the experiment three water column samples were collected with 1 l bailers in each pilot lagoon and composited for further analysis of chlorophyll a by inovalys according to nf t90 117 treatment performances were

outflow volume in l c in and c out inflow and outflow concentration in mg l 1 plants aerial and root tissue cellular concrete and sediments were quarterly sampled to understand removal mechanisms and phosphorous partition samples tp concentrations were determined as detailed in the following sections 2 4 plant monitoring sampling and analysis nutrient uptake by c riparia was determined through analysis of plant tissue samples as the plant harvest cannot be achieved seasonally without penalizing ftw treatment performance a non destructive methodology was adopted to estimate plant biomass production shoots biomass dry weight was predicted from shoot length and density shoots counts measurements as per headley et al 25 similarly the characterization of root network morphology length and perimeter was utilized as an indirect method to assess root biomass dry weight a sub set of plants representative of the plants size variability on the ftws was selected for biomass measurement shoot and root samples were collected for each selected plant 1 per ftw module i e 1 for l24 2 for l48 and 3 for l72 in january june and october 2021 single shoot length and width root network perimeter and majority length of samples were measured all samples were then dried at 105 c until constant weight samples were sent to inovalys laboratory to determine their tn and tp concentrations shoots and roots morphological data were correlated to their respective dry weight this procedure was repeated every sampling mission january june and october 2021 to validate the correlation eqs n 59 for shoots n 16 for root sub samples the shoot and root biomass dry weight of a given plant size type were hence obtained by eqs 2 and 3 2 shoot dry weight g d n 0 0083 l 90 w n r 2 0 96 3 root dry weight g 0 5603 p n r 2 0 97 where dn is the number of shoots per plant for the plant of size type n l90 is the plant majority shoot length below which about 90 of shoots occurred cm wn is the plant mean shoot width cm and pn is the plant root network perimeter for the plant of size type n cm in october 2021 the shoot biomass of ftw modules was harvested dried and weighted to develop further a shoot biomass estimate equation based on the following 1 the theoretical ftw module shoot biomass dry weight is calculated by summing individual shoot biomass estimates eq 2 present on the ftw module 2 and a correction factor rc accounting for the difference between the actual entire shoot biomass dry weight harvested on the module in october 2021 and the theoretical biomass dry weight 1 r c harvested

and need for cc replacement were assessed by monitoring cc p content over time a baseline assessment of initial cc p content was performed at the start of the experiment on a fresh cc sample one small bag per ftw module was retrieved quarterly and analyzed for tp content by inovalys according to nf en 16170 method tp accumulation on the cellular concrete contained in the small bags was assumed representative of p accumulation on cc contained in the cc large bags i e 2 5 kg cc bags in order to confirm this assumption a cc composite sample was collected at the end of the experimental monitoring in one large bag of each ftw module fig 1 and tp concentration was determined tp mass sorbed on cc per ftw module was estimated as follows 9 m tp cc tp cc m cc where m tp cc is the mass of tp sorbed on cc kg p tp cc is the cc tp concentration g p kg 1 and m cc is the cc mass per ftw module kg cc ftw module in addition the forms of p compounds on cc were assessed at the end of the experiment through a sequential chemical extraction as per barca et al 26 four fractions of p were sequentially extracted from 20 g fresh cc granular size 7 15 mm and composite cc sample mixture of cc retrieved from the pilot lagoons l24 l48 and l72 after 10 months i the bicarbonate extractable p fraction was extracted in 200 ml of 0 5 m nahco3 it represents weakly bound p ii the hydroxide extractable p fraction was extracted in 200 ml of 0 1 m naoh it represented fe and al associated p iii the diluted hcl extractable p fraction was extracted in 200 ml of 1 m hcl it is defined as ca associated p iv the hot concentrated hcl extractable p fraction was extracted in 100 ml of 12 m hcl in a 20 min water bath at 80 c it represents p in stable residual form a material to extracting solution ratio of 0 5 kg l was used in the extractions i ii and iii for 16 h extraction time at 20 c and 125 rpm of agitation adapted from en 12457 1 2002 after each extraction the samples were washed with 25 ml of 1 m kcl to recover p re adsorbed on the material surface the kcl washes were added to the supernatant solution as per headley et al 25 all the experiments were performed in duplicate supernatant orthophosphate concentrations were determined using phosver 3 hach tubes for reactive soluble phosphate 0 1 63 mg po4 p l equivalent to usepa method 365 2 and standard ascorbic acid method 4500 p e 27 in addition an x ray diffraction xrd analysis was performed on a cc composite sample and on a fresh cc sample to identify the main p forms sorbed onto the material surface the cc composite sample was prepared from all cc retrieved from pilot lagoons after 11 months of deployment the xrd patterns were obtained with bruker advance diffractometer with a cu kα source operated at 100 kv and 30 ma the minimum and maximum values for 2θ were 5 and 70 respectively the step size was 0 015 the patterns were compared to the reference chemical database for phase identification 2 6 sediment sampling and analysis each pilot lagoon s bottom was divided into 3 successive along the length of the pilot lagoon zones of identical surface area one sediment sample was collected in each zone along the width of the pilot lagoon during the first 2 quarterly sampling missions the sediment layer was extremely loose and thin preventing appropriate sampling and thus was not analyzed all collected samples were kept in polypropylene containers under ice blocks until arrival at the laboratory samples were left to settle overnight then the supernatant was removed using a 200 ml syringe a composite sample was prepared to ensure sufficient sample size for chemical analysis 1 g dry weight half of the composite sample was sent to inovalys for tp analysis while the other half was analyzed for loss on ignition at imt atlantique s laboratory according to the standard european method nf en15935 2 7 tp mass balance a tp mass balance was performed in every pilot lagoon to understand tp pathways within the different system compartments cellular concrete plants and sediments biofilm and algae equal tp inflow mass load was assumed for the four pilot lagoons cumulative tp inflow and outflow loads m tp in out were obtained by integrating the tp mass over the monitoring period using the midpoint rule practically this assumed that the pollutant mass load entering exiting the system between

analyses were performed with minitab 19 with a confidence level of α 0 05 the performances of the 4 pilot s lagoons were compared to identify enhancement induced by floating treatment wetlands and the effect of coverage on phosphorous treatment p mass removal efficiencies were tested for normality using the anderson darling test if data were normally distributed repeated measure anova was performed sampling time was set as a random factor while each treatment was considered as a fixed factor when significant differences between treatments were present a bonferroni pairwise comparisons test was performed to identify which pair means differed if data were not normally distributed the non parametric test kruskal wallis was used to compare medians the relationship between pilot lagoons tp removal efficiencies and their respective outflow physico chemical properties was investigated using pearson correlation to provide insight into removal mechanisms only significant correlations are discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic conditions the experiment monitoring started on march 2021 and lasted until december 2021 the experiment ran in a mild oceanic climate where moderate rainfall was frequent in the summer season june august supplementary material s1 water sampling was performed on dry days except in may and july where daily rainfall was 1 2 mm and 0 6 mm respectively fig 3 b during the first 2 months of monitoring air temperature ranged between 3 1 and 27 5 c average temperature 12 7 4 4 c while water temperature varied from 5 4 to 18 c average temperature 11 1 4 c in the pilot lagoons fig 3 a these water temperatures would have slowed the establishment of the system as biological activities are highly influenced by temperature and their metabolism is known to be hindered under 15 c 28 in may the mean temperature increased and plants developed rapidly water temperature followed seasonal air temperature trends and was the highest in june and july fig 3 a the ftws acted as insulation as shown by the lower water temperature in summer in l24 l72 compared to the control lagoon when the maximum air temperature was 34 c in june the maximum water temperature reached 29 8 c in l0 28 c in l24 27 5 c in l48 and 24 8 c in l72 they also exhibited lower temperatures than l0 in the cold season up to 1 4 c lower than the water s mean monthly temperature of l0 3 2 water quality monitoring 3 2 1 inflow composition tertiary effluent was spiked with 1 4 g p l kh2po4 the tp mean concentration averaged 14 0 2 3 mg p l mean sd the main inflow phosphorous form was orthophosphate 96 3 a dysfunction in the metering pump used for the kh2po4 spike resulted in reduced tp concentration in may and june 10 3 mg p l the maximum inflow tp concentration 18 mg p l coincided with the site tertiary effluents high phosphorous concentration in august min max 0 8 2 7 mg p l inflow cod concentrations were consistently lower than the discharge limit 80 mg o2 l with an

lower l72 achieved the highest tp mean mre averaging 29 9 compared to 21 11 for l48 18 11 for l24 and 19 21 for l0 fig 3 c although l0 l24 and l48 had comparable mean mre l0 mre was highly variable minimum 1 5 maximum 49 fig 3 c this significant variance prevented the inclusion of l0 data in the repeated measure anova test which only included l24 l48 and l72 mres to assess the coverage ratio and cc effect on treatment efficiency l72 was found to significantly increase tp mre compared to l24 p 0 001 and l48 p 0 016 no statistically significant difference between l24 and l48 mres was observed p 0 482 tp removal efficiency was positively correlated to the daily average water temperature for l48 r2 0 811 p 0 05 and l72 r2 0 856 p 0 05 no significant correlation was found for l24 despite a r2 0 662 and l0 r2 0 052 l24 limited water temperature data compared to the other lagoons due to equipment failure may explain this result in addition tp mre was strongly correlated to water ph values in l0 r2 0 916 p 0 05 while no significant correlation was obtained in l24 l48 and l72 l24 l48 and l72 ph did not significantly vary on sampling days fig 3 d to the authors knowledge the present study is the first to address the treatment of p rich real wastewater effluents 15 mg p l by ftw equipped with cc and under semi continuous flow most of the reported work in the literature assessed upgraded ftw with p sorbing material treatment performances under low tp concentrations ranging from 0 2 to 4 3 mg p l table 2 moreover comparing ftw equipped with cc to traditional ftws phosphorous removal performances should be done with caution design parameters local climatic conditions effluent type and plant species are believed to strongly affect system efficiency for instance tp average mre obtained by l72 was in the same range as the tp concentrations removal efficiency obtained by benvenuti et al 29 in a real scale application for high tp inlet concentration 9 4 mg l removal efficiency 37 however benvenuti et al 29 tested the efficiency of 100 coverage ftw planted with typha domingensis to treat raw wastewater 29 their ftws were not equipped with any phosphorous sorbing material they operated under 11 5 1 3 days average hydraulic retention time 67 8 m3 d loading rate and a recirculation rate of 53 8 m3 d compared to the semi continuous flow rate of 0 4 m3 d in the present study 0 1 m3 every 6 h higher inflow tss 80 200 mg l cod 200 700 mg l and tkn 40 180 mg n l in the work of benvenuti et al 29 would have favored different processes given the different c n p proportions that impact microbial and plant uptake other removal pathways would have occurred phosphorous removal obtained by benvenuti et al 29 without p sorbing material may be due to the increased recirculation rate or higher plant coverage resulting in higher plant density which would have increased the system performance 3 2 3 physico chemical monitoring 3 2 3 1 control lagoon l0 exhibited the highest water column ph 8 2 0 6 mean standard deviation during the monitoring period compared to l24 ph 7 4 0 5 l48 ph 7 3 0 2 and l72 7 2 0 2 fig 3 d l0 was mainly characterized by do oversaturation do concentrations were higher than equilibrium do concentrations at the water s daily average temperature designated by reference do in fig 3 e l0 water ph was positively correlated to do concentrations r 0 802 p 0 004 which fluctuated during the monitoring period from 0 to 20 mg l these observations indicate increased algae activity as algae use co2 during photosynthesis and release it back at night during respiration 28 on different occasions l0 calcium ca outflow concentrations were lower than that at the inflow especially at 20 41 153 and 223 days red arrows on fig 3 f while the remaining time ca outflow concentrations were not significantly different from the inflow concentration 3 2 3 2 pilot lagoons equipped with cc covered lagoons ensured on average lower and more stable ph values than the control lagoon fig 3 d despite the presence of cc bags under the ftw modules l24 l48 and l72 were characterized by depleted do concentrations fig 3 e indeed ftws create low do conditions as they block gaseous exchange along the water surface and shade out the photosynthetic activity and therefore do production in the water column 30 internal oxygen transportation in plants and leakage from roots can provide additional oxygen into the rhizosphere however the extensive root network and attached biofilms beneath the ftws usually have a more considerable respiratory activity o2 consumption reducing the do level in the water column 13 30 31 l24 l48 and l72 outflow ca concentrations followed similar trends as the inflow ca concentration fig 3 f during the first 8 months of operations march october the pilot lagoons equipped with ftws and cc exhibited higher ca concentrations at the outlet than at the inlet and l0 outlet the highest ca concentrations were obtained at l72 followed by l48 and l24 outlets at 41 days from the start of the experiment then outflow ca concentrations progressively decreased approaching the inlet concentration fig 3 c after 150 days no significant difference was observed between inflow and l24 outflow calcium concentrations highlighting the depletion of the calcium release capacity of the 5 kg cc embedded within l24 in contrast a longer period of time i e 260 days was needed before no difference was observed between the calcium concentrations measured at the inflow and outflow of l72 andl48 3 3 plant biomass production and analysis c riparia had satisfactory above ground biomass development during the experiment supplementary material s2 shoot biomass dry weight increased by 4 8 1 6 between january and june 2021 and reached 3 1 0 6 kg d w ftw module in october 2021 despite the root s majority length increase the roots biomass estimate did not show any significant increase and averaged 0 3 0 03 kg ftw module over the monitoring period some roots might have died and settled at the bottom of the pilot lagoon and or been washed out the high tp inflow concentration and limited tn loads compared to p loads may have influenced the root expansion within the water column relatively shorter roots average majority length 38 11 cm were obtained in comparison to the average c riparia root length 48 2 cm reported by barco et al 32 for municipal and agricultural wastewater median water tn and tp ranges 1 7 23 mg n l and 0 004 4 3 mg p l respectively indeed high nutrient concentrations were readily available close to the roots limiting their need to expend resulting in increased shoot biomass production and reduced root expansion similar observations were reported by bauer et al 33 over typha domingensis used for nutrient rich wastewater treatment application yet with different water n p mass ratios n p 18 1 compared to 0 8 1 on average in the present study bauer et al 33 results are in accordance with the findings of barco et al 32 who reported that root length and biomass are negatively correlated to nutrient levels in the water plants are known to adjust to various nutrient concentrations for instance in response to n and p deficiency root systems tend to be more developed 34 and increased growth of root hairs is observed 35 moreover root morphological traits changed over the experiment duration while plants had thin and lateral roots at baseline thick rhizomes gradually appeared supplementary material s2 some shoots emerged at the end of the long rhizome and then developed to produce a new tuft resulting in a matted growth pattern supplementary material s2 these field observations are aligned with the carex reproduction cycle indeed carex is known to be able to reproduce by rhizomes they can produce both relatively long spreading clumping rhizomes 36 roots and shoots tp mean concentrations averaged 6 5 1 8 g p kg and 3 0 8 g p kg respectively during the monitoring period fig 4 b tp concentrations were higher for roots than shoots tissues with a mean difference of 3 5 g kg p value 0 0001 over the whole monitoring period no significant differences were found in roots tp concentrations nor shoots tp concentrations between the different sampling times p 0 402 however roots tp concentration had high variability range compared to a more homogeneous concentration in shoots during the monitoring period for instance in october 50 of root sub samples tp concentrations were lower than the roots mean tp concentration this observation could be explained by roots sloughing off and senescence as the plant approached the dormancy period phosphorous might have also been translocated to shoots as reported by keizer vlek et al 37 to sustain plant development phosphorous concentration in shoots is similar to previous studies evaluating macrophytes in nutrient rich wastewaters 38 39 and stormwater retention ponds 40 they were also within the range of most species used in wetland studies 1 4 g kg dw biomass 28 however barco et al 32 reported shoots and roots tp concentrations 10 times lower than those observed in the present study for carex species this difference could be explained by the low p concentration of the wastewater used in their work compared to the current inflow composition 3 4 cellular concrete analysis cellular concrete tp concentration increased from 0 2 g p kg at baseline up to 31 g p kg over the monitoring period fig 5 a the decreasing tp concentrations of cc samples taken at different longitudinal locations from the system inlet could reflect the hydraulic effect on sorption less phosphorous reached cc bags near the exit compared to the bags placed closer to the inlet this difference could also result from the competition with plant uptake and other physico chemical processes for instance cc sampled under the first ftw in l72 exhibited lower tp concentration than samples obtained at the same location in l24 and l48 fig 5 a cap compound precipitation is known to be positively correlated with temperature increased under basic conditions and highly dependent on ca oh po4 p stoichiometry eq 17 the lower ph and temperature values reported in l72 compared to l24 and l48 may therefore be responsible for the lower cellular concrete p concentration measured in l72 cc performance was compared to other sorbing materials investigated in the literature to enhance ftw tp removal table 2 most of the reported studies investigated the sorbing material potential to increase ftw performances at lower tp concentrations 0 5 mg p l average concentration and higher dosages compared to the current work for instance shen et al 20 used 8 times higher dosage of cc in g m3 of water than the highest cc dosage used in the present study for l72 to remove phosphorous from simulated runoff with p concentration ranging from 1 to 3 mg p l the authors obtained p removal efficiency varying from 67 to 76 their results were obtained under batch conditions for 8 days while the results of the present study were obtained under semi continuous feed and 16 days of residence time wang et al 41 used zeolite and sponge iron to improve ammonia and phosphorous removal from reclaimed water inflow tn 3 7 0 7 mg l and inflow tp 0 75 0 2 mg l the upgraded ftw increased the removal of tp compared to its paired traditional ftw without zeolite nor sponge iron by 29 7 the authors concluded that both zeolite and sponge iron participated in phosphorous sorption for a total inlet load of 858 g tp zeolite and sponge iron p content reached 0 2 g p kg and 0 6 g p kg respectively after 2 years of experiment operation in contrast the high cc p content in the present work 13 31 g p kg d w at only 2 3 kg cc m3 water for l72 under a total of 1171 g tp load after 10 months of operation can underline the great potential of cc for p removal a greater dosage may provide increased tp removal the results of the p sequential extraction on a cc composite sample at the end of the experiment highlighted that 86 12 of sorbed p mean sd was bound to calcium 3 0 02 was weakly bound p 1 0 2 was bound to aluminum and iron fraction while 10 1 2 was in stable residual form fig 5 b the xrd analysis of cc before and after 10 month deployment in the present experiment proved the formation of hydroxyapatite hap like compounds on the material surface fig 6 some calcite bassanite and tobermorite peaks were detected by xrd on the fresh cc sample but not on the cc sample retrieved at the end of the experiment the disappearance of these peaks could be due to calcium release and the formation of crystallization products on the surface of cc 42 additional peaks emerged for cc at the end of the experiment at 25 8 and 32 1 which is characteristic of hap indicating the formation of amorphous hap flattened peak on the cc surface the low labile fraction 3 suggests that p accumulated on cc will not be easily solubilized in water which makes p rich cc a perfect source for p slow release if applied as fertilizer arenas montaño 43 has reviewed the fertilizer replacement potential of various phosphorous saturated media and found that p bound to ca in investigated media is more available to plants than p bound to al fe the cc used in the present experiment is already considered an agriculture medium as per the nf u551 standard 44 while cc is commercialized as a substrate component for green roofs and is integrated into growing media for ornamental nurseries 45 it can be assumed that the resulting p rich cc could be easily applied as fertilizer provided that other requirements for such use are met e g low pathogenic and heavy metal content to ensure sanitary conditions are met a sanitation step may be required prior to cc application on crops e g solar drying 3 5 sediment analysis during the experiment monitoring sediment load kg could not be estimated by direct measurement hence it was impossible to determine the mass of tp accumulated in the sediment however sediment tp concentration and organic content measured in october 2021 were indicators of tp accumulation within the lagoons the higher ftw coverage ratio and cc dosage resulted in the lower sediment tp concentration l0 presented the highest sediment tp concentration 44 6 g p kg followed by l24 18 3 g p kg l48 11 2 g p kg and l72 7 2 g p kg respectively the sediment loss on ignition indicated that at least 50 of the composition of the sediment was organic independently of the pilot lagoons as the organic inflow load was relatively insignificant low cod and bod5 the sediments are likely the result of internal organic matter production and accumulation algae and microorganisms senescence could explain the high organic content of l0 sediments roots exudates slough off biofilm detachment and plant senescence are likely responsible for the high organic content in ftw lagoons sediments soluble phosphorous can be converted by phytoplankton into particulate p and be trapped within plant root network biofilm once they slough off particulate p will settle to the bottom of the lagoon and end up in the sediment layer 40 3 6 tp mass balance tp mass balance in l24 to l72 showed that most phosphorous was removed through sorption precipitation and crystallization on the cc fig 6 a all removed tp in l0 was attributed to the algal and microorganisms activity and sedimentation the relative contribution of each component of the pilot lagoons equipped with cc i e cc plant sediment algae microorganisms to tp removal over the period march october 2021 is summarized in fig 7 b between 78 and 98 of removed tp was accumulated on cc increasing the cc mass to 10 kg in l48 compared to 5 kg in l24 increased the overall tp mass accumulated on cc however a further increase of cc mass to 15 kg in l72 did not result in increased tp accumulation on cc fig 7 a tp mass accumulated in plants showed that c riparia participated less in tp removal than cellular concrete only 4 of removed tp was attributed to plants in l24 and l48 and 6 in l72 sedimentation microorganisms and or biofilm accounted for 2 of l48 tp mre they were responsible for 12 and 16 of tp removal in l24 and l72 respectively 3 7 main tp removal pathways 3 7 1 control lagoon 3 7 1 1 algal activity l0 performed the best when ph and do values were at their highest fig 3 c d and e the simultaneous ph and do peaks in l0 reflect the increasing algal photosynthetic activity indeed high phosphorous loads and high net solar radiation were favorable conditions for algal proliferation in open water surfaces as algae proliferate they get their carbon source from dissolved carbon dioxide in the water increasing water ph 46 and producing oxygen resulting in do oversaturation once algae start to senescence and decompose dissolved oxygen is depleted consequently decreasing tp mre for instance l0 do concentration was consistently lower than the reference do concentration in june july september november and december fig 3 e the senescent algae would have ended up in the sediment layer along with decaying microorganisms biomass 3 7 1 2 cap precipitation simultaneous calcium concentrations reduction was observed with l0 increased ph ph values 9 it is well established in wastewater treatment that increased ph could promote bicarbonate hco3 conversion to carbonate co3 2 and hence favor calcium carbonate precipitation however as water ph remained 10 3 pk hco3 co3 2 10 3 at 20 c the calcium consumption could not be explained by carbonate precipitation nevertheless given that the ca p outflow molar ratio in l0 remained greater than the 1 67 required for p ca precipitation 26 calcium phosphate precipitation may have taken place in this pilot lagoon indeed ca phosphate precipitation could only occur in l0 when water ph was adequate to initiate p removal under inflow calcium concentrations ranging between 37 and 59 mg l fig 3 f 3 7 2 pilot lagoons equipped with cc 3 7 2 1 sorption on cc the mass balance performed for pilot lagoons equipped with cc suggests that the increased cc quantity might have improved tp removal this hypothesis is in accordance with a previous laboratory experiment where cc promoted phosphorous removal by crystallization and surface precipitation under ca2 and oh ions release indeed cc once hydrated increases water ph data not shown following ca oh 2 dissolution eq 16 16 ca oh 2 ca 2 2 oh eq 2 k sp 5 02 10 6 hence more calcium could be released in the water system and be available for phosphorous removal for higher cc dosage provided ph conditions for ca p precipitation are met despite the relatively low ph values in the lagoons equipped with ftws fig 3 d po4 p inlet concentrations and ph were still in the range of values that support calcium phosphate precipitations and crystallization on cc i e po4 p between 10 and 18 mg p l and ph between 7 2 and 8 8 fig 3 b d on the one hand the low ph values in the lagoons equipped with ftws result most probably from the presence of the roots and associated secretion of exudates and microorganisms rhizosphere respiration producing co2 47 plants roots release organic acids exudates in water increasing humic content 48 49 hence root exudation could have buffered the system ph by neutralizing the hydroxide ions introduced in the system by cc hydration on the other hand the ca p molar ratio in l24 l48 and l72 outflow remained 1 67 required for cap precipitation this suggests that conditions were favorable for p removal by precipitation with calcium in all pilot lagoons equipped with cc from a mechanistic perspective calcium phosphate precipitation and crystallization follows ostwald s rule of stages depending on ca p molar ratio and solution ph the least stable cap compounds precipitate first amorphous calcium phosphate acp dicalcium phosphate dcp dicalcium phosphate dihydrate dcpd octacalcium phosphate ocp tricalcium phosphate tcp 26 then these products recrystallize into the most thermodynamically stable hydroxyapatite hap the overall chemical reaction could be summarized by 17 5 ca 2 3 h po 4 2 4 oh ca 5 p o 4 3 oh 3 h 2 o cc has been investigated as a seed surface that can enhance cap crystallization for phosphorous removal by reducing the chemical reaction energy barrier 50 moreover the positive correlation between tp mre and water temperature in l48 and l72 highlights a temperature effect on p removal indeed the calcium phosphate precipitation is favored at high temperatures the solubility of hydroxylapatite hap and its crystal growth are positively correlated to temperature 61 hence the result of the present study underlines the cc s promising application as seeds for cap precipitation and p removal from wastewater 3 7 2 2 plant uptake mass balance showed that plants had less contribution to tp removal than cc these results follow the findings of pishgar et al 51 borne 40 and tanner headley 52 however they are opposed to those of keizer vlek et al 37 and li et al 53 where plants were found to explain 99 of tp removal many factors could explain the disparity between the roles of plants in nutrient removal by ftw one factor is plant species selection as plants have different phosphorous storage capacities physico chemical conditions influence nutrient assimilation i e inflow c n p composition finally the results could be misleading if plant sampling was performed in different seasons nutrients plant s content fluctuates over the plant life cycle 7 40 especially in the cold season as plants become dormant or even die releasing tp into the water system 38 54 it is usually recommended to harvest shoots once to twice a year to prevent nutrient release into the water column 55 the harvested biomass could serve as a nutrient rich source for composting or energy production 56 further evaluation of harvested shoot composition and calorific value can help identify the best biomass valorization route although plants accumulation played a minor role in tp removal they can indirectly improve other particulate particulate n p and tss and dissolved pollutants removal they can release bioactive compounds from the plant roots and modify physico chemical conditions in the water column improving sorption and particulate tp sedimentation processes 52 moreover roots play the role of a physical filter they also serve as an additional surface for biofilm development promoting nitrification denitrification 62 hence the plant s contribution to ftw treatment performances could be underestimated if only their tp uptake were considered 3 7 2 3 other pathways algal growth is believed to be limited in lagoons equipped with ftw as they provide shade over the water column reducing photosynthetic activity however the ph peaks observed in l24 in july and august and l48 in july both measurements performed in the open water section of the pilot lagoons suggest that the available open water surface in these pilot lagoons could still support some algal photosynthetic activity chlorophyll a measurements in april corroborate this conclusion do oversaturation and ph close to 9 1 in l0 were observed simultaneously with higher chlorophyll a concentration 7 3 μg l in l0 compared to 1 6 1 8 and 4 8 μg l in l24 l48 and l72 respectively from what has been presented sedimentation played a modest role in tp removal by ftw equipped with cc the results of cc analysis showed that most of the sorbed phosphorous was retrieved on the cc surface precipitation and crystallization compared to the fraction that would have precipitated in the water column and ended up in the sediments additionally as ftw reduced algal proliferation it is expected that less sediment will be accumulated within pilot lagoons upgraded with ftw compared to the control pilot lagoon sediments are known to remobilize p under anoxic conditions in the long term hence ftw equipped with cc could promote irreversible tp removal provided proper ftw maintenance to prevent plant senescence and p release into the water column it is important to highlight that phosphorous in this work was mainly delivered in bioavailable forms orthophosphate phosphorous in agri food effluent may be in another form organic particulate hence the findings of this study may not fully reflect the dynamics of phosphorous removal biotic decomposition sorption and sedimentation of particulate p inload in real lagoons 4 conclusion the potential of different size ftw equipped with cc to enhance existing lagoons tp removal from agri food wastewater was assessed over 10 months period march december 2021 in northwestern france the pilot lagoon with 72 coverage ftw and 15 kg cc exhibited 29 9 tp average removal resulting in a 16 median increase compared to the control lagoon no ftw 19 21 while 24 and 48 coverage ftw with 5 and 10 kg cc did not significantly improve tp average removal efficiency average mre 18 11 and 21 11 respectively compared to the control pilot lagoon they promoted more consistent and less variable tp treatment efficiency indeed the control pilot lagoon provided good tp removal only during algal bloom and associated p assimilation while tp mre dropped and ranged between 1 5 and 13 3 during the remaining time the majority of phosphorous removed by ftw pilot lagoons was through sorption and precipitation on the cc representing between 79 and 94 of the total p mass removed over the monitoring period plants uptake participated slightly in p removal min max 4 6 of total p mass removed the remaining p fraction was removed through algal and biological assimilation and sedimentation ftw reduced algal growth by providing shade into the water column promoting phosphorous transfer into cc thereby reducing p sediment accumulation for selected cc dosages 5 10 and 15 kg cc plant roots organic secretion and respiration activity in the rhizosphere lowered ph thereby balancing the hydroxide ions released by cc hydration this may have reduced cc tp potential removal capacity as less oh was available to drive cap precipitation if the objective was to achieve p treatment solely by implementing cc improved ftws on the real scale tertiary lagoons i e no iron chloride added to the activated sludge process increasing cc dosage would be needed to meet the discharge limit of 1 mg p l phosphorous sorption onto cc should be considered a promising option for recycling phosphorous from wastewater effluent as soil amendments or fertilizer up to 31 g p kg cc were sorbed on cc of which 89 weakly and calcium bound p could be plant available a further material investigation could provide insight into p enriched cc valorization routes funds this work is part of the flowat project floating treatment wetland for agrifood tertiary wastewater conducted by imt atlantique in collaboration with the

12464,the focus of this study is to investigate the effects of ph of the precursor solution and the addition of vermiwash on the photocatalytic and certain biomedical applications of zinc oxide zno and tin oxide sno2 nanopowders prepared via co precipitation method the ph of the starting solution was varied as 8 9 and 10 through the addition of suitable amount of sodium hydroxide naoh and vermiwash these vermiwash derived enzymes activated zno and sno2 nanopowders prepared at different ph values were applied for biomedical applications viz antibacterial antioxidant and antidiabetic activity for the first time the prepared samples were also characterized using various analytical techniques viz xrd sem tem eds ftir xps bet and uv vis spectra the results of these analytical studies are correlated with their photocatalytic degradation abilities and also biological applications the photocatalytic activity of the nanoparticle were analyzed using a visible annular type photo reactor by degrading methylene blue mb a standard cationic dye under uv visible irradiation a remarkable dye degradation efficiency of 98 and 94 were achieved for the best samples of vermiwash activated zno and sno2 prepared from starting solution with ph 9 respectively the lower band gap values 2 97 and 3 1 ev of these samples as calculated from tauc s plots and their enhanced surface area as observed from the bet analysis play crucial roles in improving their photocatalytic efficiency remarkable antibacterial antioxidant and antidiabetic activities were also recorded for the samples prepared at ph 9 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords semiconductors nanomaterials enzymes stabilizing agent dye degradation data availability the datasets generated during and or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction clean and toxic free environment is of paramount importance for all living beings on this planet as the basic needs viz air water and food depend mainly on the environment therefore all forms of pollutants that affect the environment and the sources that generate these pollutants should be addressed with utmost care effluents discharged from petroleum textile glass plastic tanning and sugar industries are the main pollution causing sources that affect the environment severely especially effluents from the textile industry release organic materials which are toxic and potentially carcinogenic they not only affect human beings but also all living beings decontaminating the waste water has emerged as one of the pressing needs all over the globe as there is a gradual decline in the resources of ground fresh water 1 in this context various conventional physical chemical and biological methods like sedimentation irradiation electrochemical destruction direct chemical oxidation aerobic and anaerobic have been attempted in the recent past decades for water treatment 2 4 however these methods are expensive owing to their high operating cost and or require tedious operating procedures for instance irradiation method is expensive and requires a huge amount of dissolved oxygen sedimentation method is not suitable for acid azo basic and reactive dyes and results in toxic end products electrochemical destruction and direct chemical oxidation processes are high power consuming aerobic and anaerobic methods generate sludge and require large area of land 5 in this scenario photocatalysis approach seems to be a desirable alternative in view of its cost effective feature 6 moreover in this method the toxic dye molecules that generally affect the environment heavily are decomposed into harmless end products despite its many advantages it has some demerits too most of the common semiconductor photocatalysts respond only under ultra violet radiation hence material scientists working in this field all around the world are focusing their research towards making them respond even under visible light so as to make them to attain high photocatalytic efficiency and fit for commercial applications 7 among the several semiconductors tin oxide sno2 and zinc oxide zno have been proved to be promising photocatalysts for waste water treatment 8 10 zinc oxide an n type semiconductor band gap of 3 37 ev 11 has ground state exciton binding energy of 60 mev moreover it can create electron hole pairs in the presence of uv light and thus can be used as a photocatalyst for water splitting degradation of textile wastes and related applications zinc oxide offers many advantages promising material for the photocatalytic application because of its non toxic cost effective and nature friendly features in addition zno has higher electron mobility 200 cm2 v 1 s 1 compared to that of tio2 30 cm2 v 1 s 1 its unique features like low cost direct band gap enabling easy tailoring of properties anisotropic growth and ease of crystallization make zno to have an edge over tio2 for photocatalytic applications 12 similarly sno2 another n type semiconductor material is a potential photocatalyst with band gap of 3 6 4 0 ev 8 when compared to other semiconductor materials like tio2 it has outstanding advantages such as good chemical stability high electron mobility suitable energy level alignment and a simple preparation process furthermore sno2 has higher light adsorption efficiency due to its relatively lesser refractive index 2 than that of tio2 2 5 2 7 13 although sno2 can act as a photocatalyst for dye degradation the recombination pace of the photogenerated electron hole pairs should be reduced in order to improve its degradation efficacy as per the reports the enhancement in efficiency of zno and sno2 can be achieved by adding supporting co catalysts like enzymes 14 17 currently the combination of semiconductor photocatalysts and enzymes called photo biocatalysts are gaining much attention for the treatment of hazardous colored compounds 18 in general enzymes exhibit highly efficient catalytic activity moreover certain enzymes have been successfully coupled with semiconductor materials for the effective degradation of toxic effluents 15 various process parameters like concentration of source materials 19 dopants 20 solvents operating temperature and ph of the starting solution can be varied suitably to improve the photocatalytic efficiency to some extent as per the reports 16 21 22 nanoparticles synthesized from various metal oxides are attracting increasing attention in the development of drugs for treating various diseases many researchers explained the applications of nanoparticles synthesized via different chemical physical and bio assisted green chemistry approaches 14 23 24 in the bio assisted approaches nanoparticles of various metal oxides can be synthesized using a wide range of biogenic materials including plants bacteria fungi bio molecules and enzymes of diverse organic substances one of the important features of biogenic method of synthesis is the influence of organic materials or enzymes on the process of detoxification in addition to the role of reducing capping and stabilizing agents 25 for the synthesis of nanomaterials from metal oxides bio products are considered as promising catalyst candidates due to their unique features like easy availability higher sustainability bio compatibility cost effectiveness with higher chemical and mechanical stability when compared to the chemical catalysts 26 the surface composition and morphology of synthesized nanoparticles can be tuned by appropriately changing various factors including the concentration of precursors temperature ph and extract metal ratio 25 27 keeping all these points in mind in the present study three sets of zno and sno2 nanopowder samples were prepared via a co precipitation method by varying ph 8 9 and 10 through the addition of suitable amount of sodium hydroxide naoh and vermiwash an aqueous co product of vermicompost it was found that enzymes like phosphatase and protease prevalent in the vermiwash can act as co catalysts and thereby play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of the main photocatalyst 17 28 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of vermiwash in this study vermiwash was extracted from the vermicomposting unit where culturing the earthworm eudrilus eugineae to prepare vermiwash a pot container with a hole at the bottom was filled with small pebbles as the first layer and composting leaf litter loamy soil sand and cow dung as the next layers fig 1 about 150 to 200 earthworms were introduced into the vermin reactor pot then water was sprayed at regular intervals to maintain its optimum moisture level 70 after 15 20 days the vermiwash was collected and used for the synthesis of zno and sno2 nanopowders 2 2 synthesis of zno and sno2 nanoparticles nps fig 2 represents the schematic diagram of preparation of zno and sno2 nanopowders via a co precipitation method zinc acetate dihydrate and tin chloride dihydrate were used as source materials for the synthesis of zno and sno2 nanopowders respectively the purity of source materials was 99 9 merck the concentration of the starting solution was kept as 0 2 m for the preparation of starting solutions of zno and sno2 nanopowders 300 and 200 ml of vermiwash was added to de ionized water respectively as these volumes were found as the best in our previous studies 17 28 three sets of starting precursor solutions with ph 8 9 and 10 were prepared by adding required quantity of naoh solution drop wise the resultant solution was magnetically stirred at temperature 85 c stirring time 2 h after the completion of stirring process the precipitate was separated by filtration and washed with ethanol and distilled water kept in the ratio of 1 3 the precipitate collected was dried at room temperature which resulted in the final product 2 3 characterization techniques the structural

prepared from starting solutions with ph 8 9 and 10 respectively as per the observed patterns the lattice planes corresponding to the prominent diffraction peaks can be arranged in the descending order of intensity as follows 101 100 002 for zno and 110 101 211 for sno2 nps these three prominent peaks in the observed patterns are in the top three positions in the standard patterns the observed patterns confirm the hexagonal wurtzite crystalline structure of zno nps 19 20 32 and the tetragonal structure of sno2 nps 32 34 the additional peaks observed in the case of vermiwash powered zno nps are related to crystallized enzymes 28 whereas no enzyme related peaks are observed for sno2 nps 17 this absence may be due to the possible overlapping of the enzyme related peaks with the 101 peak of sno2 scherrer s formula was used to calculate the crystallite size 3 d 0 9λ β cosθ the average crystallite size of the vermiwash activated zno for ph values 8 9 and 10 are 37 36 and 28 nm respectively and the corresponding values for sno2 nps are 56 39 and 33 nm the results show that there is a decrease in crystallite size when the ph value increases interestingly the biosynthesized vermiwash activated zno and sno2 nps are crystalline in nature even without any calcination process it is also observed that the intensity of the peaks is not affected by the increase in ph values similarly the interplanar distance of the prominent planes also not affected by the change in ph values as presented in the supplementary data table s1 3 2 surface morphological studies scanning electron microscope was used to observe the morphological variation of the prepared vermiwash activated zno and sno2 nanopowder samples the fig 5 a c shows a mixture of ellipsoidal needle and oval shaped granules formed in the case of zno prepared with ph 8 at ph 9 well defined rod shaped smaller grains are found as seen in fig 5 b whereas agglomerated and not well defined grains are noticed at ph 10 fig 5 c similarly different morphological structures are observed for sno2 nps while larger irregular grains are seen for ph 8 fig 5 g rectangular bar like structures with finely carved ends occur in the case of ph 9 this structure is slightly disturbed when the ph is increased to 10 fig 5 i the tem images of zno and sno2 nps are found to be consistent with the respective sem images fig 5 d f and j l 3 3 eds spectra the elemental composition of the synthesized zno and sno2 nps at ph 9 was studied by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds fig 6 shows the atomic and weight percentage of each element present in the prepared zno and sno2 ph 9 samples the emission spectra exhibit peaks corresponding to the elements zinc zn oxygen o and tin sn 3 4 ftir studies ftir spectra of enzyme activated zno and sno2 nps recorded in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 are shown in fig 7 the peaks present at 3438 cm 1 and 3428 cm 1 show the oh stretching which has hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups in zno and sno2 nps the absorption peaks appear at 1393 cm 1 and 2420 cm 1are owing to the vibrations of ch stretching and bending respectively the peaks appear around 2900 cm 1 and 1420 cm 1 are related to ch2 stretching and bending vibrations of zno and 2928 cm 1 and 1385 cm 1 are related to those of sno2 nanoparticles respectively 28 33 the appearance of peaks at 827 cm 1 and 945 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of the co group the peaks occurring at 555 cm 1 and 622 cm 1 are related to stretching vibrations of zno and o sn o 3 5 bet analysis bet results fig 8 show the comparison of n2 adsorption desorption isotherms for the three sets of vermiwash activated zno and sno2 samples the specific surface area of the sample prepared with ph 9 112 03 m2 g is greater than the other two zinc oxide samples similarly specific surface area of the tin oxide at ph 9 87 85 m2 g is greater than the other two samples the higher surface area of this sample suggests the influence of optimum level of reducing agent used in this case we believe that this higher surface area facilitates more active sites for the adsorption desorption of the test dye molecules and thereby results in an improved photocatalytic activity as discussed in photocatalytic activity section this increase in surface area and decrease in pore size and density is ideal for the photocatalytic and biological applications 35 table 1 displays the values of surface area pore volume and pore diameter of vermiwash activated zno and sno2 3 6 xps analysis the x ray photoelectron spectra xps of the zno and sno2 nps at ph 9 are shown in fig 9 a f the existence of the photoelectron peaks of zn 3d zn 3p zn 3s c 1s zn 2p and o 1s confirms the presence of zinc carbon and oxygen in the zno sample and sn 4d sn 4p sn 4s c 1s sn 3d o 1s and sn 3p confirms the presence of tin carbon and oxygen in the sno2 sample respectively the high intensity peaks at 1021 47 ev and 1044 61 ev ascribed to the zn 2p3 2 and zn 2p1 2 are consistent with the zn2 ions in the nps the oxygen strong peak at 530 25 ev corresponds to o2 ions are attributed to the zno bond linkage in the hexagonal structure of zno 36 similarly for sno2 nps peaks are observed at 486 82 and 495 26 ev ascribed to the sn 3d5 2 and sn 3d3 2 are consistent with the sn4 ions in the nps the strong oxygen peak at 530 7 ev corresponds to the o2 ions are attributed to the sno bond linkage in the tetragonal structure of sno2 37 3 7 uv vis spectra the fig 10 shows the tauc s plots drawn for the samples prepared from starting solutions having different ph values from the tauc s plots the band gap values of the z8 z9 z10 zno samples are found as 3 4 2 97 and 3 6 respectively 38 and the corresponding band gap values of p8 p9 p10 sno2 are 3 2 2 7 and 3 1 39 this relatively lower band gap value of zno and sno2 corresponding to ph 9 is one of the major reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of these samples it is well known that materials with lower band gap can absorb light photons with higher wavelength even in the visible range and thus can act as visible light responsive photocatalyst 40 3 8 proposed mechanism of photocatalytic dye degradation the photocatalytic activity occurs when the following two reactions take place due to the interaction of light with the semiconductor materials sno2 and zno i oxidation reaction with the help of holes h ii reduction reaction with the help of electrons e when a photocatalyst is illuminated with a light source it will produce pairs of electrons and holes by absorbing the photon energy the electrons are excited from the valence band of the photocatalyst sno2 and zno and thereby create the electron e hole h pairs the photogenerated holes h react with water molecule to form radicals oh the electrons react with oxygen molecules to form superoxide anions o2 these oh and o2 radicals degrade the molecules of dye to result in co2 and h2o fig 11 the ph of the starting solution plays a strong role in the photocatalytic dye degradation process at ph 9 the surface area of the nanomaterial is relatively high as observed from the bet analysis and thus facilitates more adsorption of the dye molecules during the photocatalytic process which in turn enhance the dye degradation efficiency 41 moreover the enzymes supplied by the vermiwash can act as a co catalyst of zno and sno2 enhancing the degradation of dye molecules further 3 9 photocatalytic activity photocatalytic dye degradation activity of all the three sets of zno and sno2 samples were evaluated against mb dye under visible light irradiation the absorption spectra of mb dye for all the prepared photocatalytic samples are shown in fig 12 as mb is a cationic dye the dye molecules are easily adsorbed on the negatively charged surface of the catalyst due to the strong coulombic charge interaction between the surface of the catalyst and the mb dye molecules when compared to ph 8 and 10 the samples zno and sno2 correspond to ph 9 exhibit high absorption and consequently enhance the photocatalytic activity dye degradation efficiency of the prepared samples were calculated using the following equation 42 4 degradation efficiency η c 0 c t c 0 100 here c o is the initial concentration and c t is final concentrations during irradiation the degradation efficiency of zno and sno2 is the highest for ph 9 98 and 94 respectively when compared to the ph 8 and ph 10 counterparts the bar diagram fig 13 shows the photocatalytic efficiency of the zno and sno2 samples from these observations we can conclude that the addition of optimal reducing agent during preparation and a suitable bio catalyst play prominent roles in decomposing the dye molecules photocatalytically 3 10 biological properties of zno and sno2 nps with varied ph values 3 10 1 antibacterial activity by disc diffusion method the zno nanopowders possess anti bacterial activity across multi drug resistant bacteria at increasing concentration 43 as bacterial surface has negative charge the zn2 ions can easily penetrate into the cell wall and thereby results in a complete destruction of the lipid layer present inside the cell 44 the related mechanism based on reactive oxygen species has been proposed in the literature 45 as the liberated zn2 ions caused initial damages to the cell wall the probability of penetration of zno nanoparticles into the cell membrane increases and consequently the cytoplasm also gets damaged figs 14 and 15 illustrates the antibacterial activity of zno and sno2 np samples against the bacterial strains e coli and p aeruginosa gram negative as well as b subtilis gram positive all the nanopowders prepared with varied ph values exhibited significant antibacterial activity at higher concentrations 40 mg ml which revealed the efficiency of zno and sno2 nanopowders against the bacterial cell systems supplementay table s2 the zno nanopowders prepared at ph 9 showed better antibacterial efficiency against the bacterial strains b subtilis 26 46 0 11 mm e coli 25 43 0 15 mm and p aeruginosa 23 30 0 17 mm similarly sno2 nanopowder prepared at ph 9 displayed a strong inhibition effect against the growth of b subtilis 26 30 0 20 mm e coli 21 46 0 15 mm and p aeruginosa 22 60 0 10 mm the nanoscale and large surface area of the zno and sno2 nanopowders as evinced by bet analysis may be one of the main reasons for the interaction of nanoparticles with the cell walls of bacteria and the consequent enhanced damage to the cells the interaction of nanoparticles against both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains which has been reported in the literature emphasizes the effective application of nanoparticles nanopowders as antibiotics 46 the antibacterial activity of zno and sno2 nanopowders was slightly higher against the gram positive bacterium than the gram negative bacteria owing to the presence of lipopolysaccharide in the cell wall structure of gram negative bacterium which delineates the entry of nanoparticles across the outer cell membrane of the bacterial cell 47 3 10 2 antioxidant activity by dpph and superoxide free radical scavenging assays the antioxidant activity of nanoparticles usually involves the formation of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide nitric oxide hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals singlet oxygen etc these radicals are responsible for the inhibitory property in transcription translation electron transport chain inside the cells inactivation of proteins and eventually leads to destruction of dna and cell death 48 in the present work antioxidant potential of zno and sno2 nanopowders which are prepared via co precipitation method with varying ph 8 9 and 10 by the addition of naoh and vermiwash were tested by dpph and superoxide free radical scavenging assays in both the assays zno and sno2 nanopowders displayed significant antioxidant activity at ph 9 0 than the nanopowders prepared at the ph of 8 0 and 10 0 and comparable to the standard ascorbic acid fig 16a between the two materials zno nanopowders ph 9 0 recorded higher antioxidant potential with an ic50 of 93 51 0 81 μg ml in dpph assay and 96 59 1 46 μg ml in superoxide radical scavenging assay the sno2 nanopowders ph 9 0 showed obvious antioxidant potential in dpph assay ic50 of 102 61 1 37 μg ml and superoxide ic50 of 97 05 0 97 μg ml free radical scavenging assay when compared to the standard and other samples prepared with the ph of 8 0 and 10 0 these results confirmed that the zno and sno2 nanopowders prepared with the ph of 9 0 have potential antioxidant action on the free radical scavenging behavior the above mentioned results are consistent with the previous studies on antioxidant potential of nanoparticles prepared from various metal oxides 49 most of the previous research reveals that the higher the concentration of nanoparticle samples the higher the antioxidant activity which may be due to the capacity of nanoparticles to transfer the electron density to free radicals in a dose dependent manner 50 as seen in literature the nanopowders enhance the cellular oxidative stress through various mechanisms which include i creating pores on the surface of the host cells ii enabling more dispersal due to increased surface area and iii enabling absorption of oxygen on the surface 51 the nanopowders also has the capacity to enhance the antioxidant properties by activating the enzymes like ascorbate peroxidase peroxidase dismutase and catalase enzymes that leads to the inhibition of free radicals 52 3 10 3 antidiabetic activity by α glucosidase enzyme inhibition assay enzyme and precursor mediated synthesis of nps always have a significant effect on the treatment of various diseases including diabetes diabetes mellitus type i and type ii is a metabolic disorder associated with the dysfunction of insulin secretion and varied blood glucose level the important enzymes involved in the breakdown of polysaccharides and disaccharides into simple monosaccharaides for easy digestion and controlled blood glucose level are α amylases and α glucosidases hence the hydrolysis of complex molecules of carbohydrates into simple carbohydrates with the aid of nps can alleviates the diabetic complications when such nanoparticles are stabilized or conjugated with various catalysts the fig 16b further authenticated the antidiabetic efficacy of zno and sno2 nanopowders by α glucosidase enzyme inhibition assay with acarbose as reference antidiabetic drug the zno and sno2 nanopowders at ph 9 0 showed higher α glucosidase enzyme inhibition effect with an ic50 of 91 23 1 78 and 96 52 1 13 μg ml respectively which has relatively prominent antidiabetic effect compared to acarbose 116 31 1 66 μg ml the inhibition effect was relatively low in zno and sno2 nanopowders prepared with the ph of 8 0 and 10 0 as zinc involves in the synthesis storage and secretion of insulin in the body it can be used as a potential candidate in developing antidiabetic drugs 53 looking at the results of the α glucosidase enzyme inhibition assay and the stability and compatibility of these nps revealed through the characterization techniques zno and sno2 nanopowders prepared at ph 9 0 could be used as an effective antidiabetic drug as these properties of the materials are the essential measures for preparing the drugs in np form associated with insulin metabolism 4 conclusions the study on the effect of ph of the starting solution on the photocatalytic antibacterial antioxidant and antidiabetic activities of vermiwash derived enzyme activated zno and sno2 nanopowders prepared via co precipitation method showed that the ph of the starting solution plays a strong role on the abilities of these materials the degradation efficiency is maximum zno 98 and sno2 94 at ph 9 similarly exceptional pharmacological properties were recorded at this ph level the study also showed that the photocatalytic efficiency and therapeutic properties of zno and sno2 nanopowders were significantly influenced by the enzymes inherited from the vermiwash from these observations we can conclude that the optimal ph value of the precursor solution and the vermiwash which acts as both reducing agent during preparation and a suitable bio catalyst during photocatalysis play prominent roles in dye degradation and biomedical applications credit authorship contribution statement rajagopal shalini conceptualization methodology preparation of manuscript

12464,the focus of this study is to investigate the effects of ph of the precursor solution and the addition of vermiwash on the photocatalytic and certain biomedical applications of zinc oxide zno and tin oxide sno2 nanopowders prepared via co precipitation method the ph of the starting solution was varied as 8 9 and 10 through the addition of suitable amount of sodium hydroxide naoh and vermiwash these vermiwash derived enzymes activated zno and sno2 nanopowders prepared at different ph values were applied for biomedical applications viz antibacterial antioxidant and antidiabetic activity for the first time the prepared samples were also characterized using various analytical techniques viz xrd sem tem eds ftir xps bet and uv vis spectra the results of these analytical studies are correlated with their photocatalytic degradation abilities and also biological applications the photocatalytic activity of the nanoparticle were analyzed using a visible annular type photo reactor by degrading methylene blue mb a standard cationic dye under uv visible irradiation a remarkable dye degradation efficiency of 98 and 94 were achieved for the best samples of vermiwash activated zno and sno2 prepared from starting solution with ph 9 respectively the lower band gap values 2 97 and 3 1 ev of these samples as calculated from tauc s plots and their enhanced surface area as observed from the bet analysis play crucial roles in improving their photocatalytic efficiency remarkable antibacterial antioxidant and antidiabetic activities were also recorded for the samples prepared at ph

study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction clean and toxic free environment is of paramount importance for all living beings on this planet as the basic needs viz air water and food depend mainly on the environment therefore all forms of pollutants that affect the environment and the sources that generate these pollutants should be addressed with utmost care effluents discharged from petroleum textile glass plastic tanning and sugar industries are the main pollution causing sources that affect the environment severely especially effluents from the textile industry release organic materials which are toxic and potentially carcinogenic they not only affect human beings but also all living beings decontaminating the waste water has emerged as one of the pressing needs all over the globe as there is a gradual decline in the resources of ground fresh water 1 in this context various conventional physical chemical and biological methods like sedimentation irradiation electrochemical destruction direct chemical oxidation aerobic and anaerobic have been attempted in the recent past decades for water treatment 2 4 however these methods are expensive owing to their high operating cost and or require tedious operating procedures for instance irradiation method is expensive and requires a huge amount of dissolved oxygen sedimentation method is not suitable for acid azo basic and reactive dyes and results in toxic end products electrochemical destruction and direct chemical oxidation processes are high power consuming aerobic and anaerobic methods generate sludge and require large area of land 5 in this scenario photocatalysis approach seems to be a desirable alternative in view of its cost effective feature 6 moreover in this method the toxic dye molecules that generally affect the environment heavily are decomposed into harmless end products despite its many advantages it has some demerits too most of the common semiconductor photocatalysts respond only under ultra violet radiation hence material scientists working in this field all around the world are focusing their research towards making them respond even under visible light so as to make them to attain high photocatalytic efficiency and fit for commercial applications 7 among the several semiconductors tin oxide sno2 and zinc oxide zno have been proved to be promising photocatalysts for waste water treatment 8 10 zinc oxide an n type semiconductor band gap of 3 37 ev 11 has ground state exciton binding energy of 60 mev moreover it can create electron hole pairs in the presence of uv light and thus can be used as a photocatalyst for water splitting degradation of textile wastes and related applications zinc oxide offers many advantages promising material for the photocatalytic application because of its non toxic cost effective and nature friendly features in addition zno has higher electron mobility 200 cm2 v 1 s 1 compared to that of tio2 30 cm2 v 1 s 1 its unique features like low cost direct band gap enabling easy tailoring of properties anisotropic growth and ease of crystallization make zno to have an edge over tio2 for photocatalytic applications 12 similarly sno2 another n type semiconductor material is a potential photocatalyst with band gap of 3 6 4 0 ev 8 when compared to other semiconductor materials like tio2 it has outstanding advantages such as good chemical stability high electron mobility suitable energy level alignment and a simple preparation process furthermore sno2 has higher light adsorption efficiency due to its relatively lesser refractive index 2 than that of tio2 2 5 2 7 13 although sno2 can act as a photocatalyst for dye degradation the recombination pace of the photogenerated electron hole pairs should be reduced in order to improve its degradation efficacy as per the reports the enhancement in efficiency of zno and sno2 can be achieved by adding supporting co catalysts like enzymes 14 17 currently the combination of semiconductor photocatalysts and enzymes called photo biocatalysts are gaining much attention for the treatment of hazardous colored compounds 18 in general enzymes exhibit highly efficient catalytic activity moreover certain enzymes have been successfully coupled with semiconductor materials for the effective degradation of toxic effluents 15 various process parameters like concentration of source materials 19 dopants 20 solvents operating temperature and ph of the starting solution can be varied suitably to improve the photocatalytic efficiency to some extent as per the reports 16 21 22 nanoparticles synthesized from various metal oxides are attracting increasing attention in the development of drugs for treating various diseases many researchers explained the applications of nanoparticles synthesized via different chemical physical and bio assisted green chemistry approaches 14 23 24 in the bio assisted approaches nanoparticles of various metal oxides can be synthesized using a wide range of biogenic materials including plants bacteria fungi bio molecules and enzymes of diverse organic substances one of the important features of biogenic method of synthesis is the influence of organic materials or enzymes on the process of detoxification in addition to the role of reducing capping and stabilizing agents 25 for the synthesis of nanomaterials from metal oxides bio products are considered as promising catalyst candidates due to their unique features like easy availability higher sustainability bio compatibility cost effectiveness with higher chemical and mechanical stability when compared to the chemical catalysts 26 the surface composition and morphology of synthesized nanoparticles can be tuned by appropriately changing various factors including the concentration of precursors temperature ph and extract metal ratio 25 27 keeping all these points in mind in the present study three sets of zno and sno2 nanopowder samples were prepared via a co precipitation method by varying ph 8 9 and 10 through the addition of suitable amount of sodium hydroxide naoh and vermiwash an aqueous co product of vermicompost it was found that enzymes like phosphatase and protease prevalent in the vermiwash can act as co catalysts and thereby play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of the main photocatalyst 17 28 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of vermiwash in this study vermiwash was extracted from the vermicomposting unit where culturing the earthworm eudrilus eugineae to prepare vermiwash a pot container with a hole at the bottom was filled with small pebbles as the first layer and composting leaf litter loamy soil sand and cow dung as the next layers fig 1 about 150 to 200 earthworms were introduced into the vermin reactor pot then water was sprayed at regular intervals to maintain its optimum moisture level 70 after 15 20 days the vermiwash was collected and used for the synthesis of zno and sno2 nanopowders 2 2 synthesis of zno and sno2 nanoparticles nps fig 2 represents the schematic diagram of preparation of zno and sno2 nanopowders via a co precipitation method zinc acetate dihydrate and tin chloride dihydrate were used as source materials for the synthesis of zno and sno2 nanopowders respectively the purity of source materials was 99 9 merck the concentration of the starting solution was kept as 0 2 m for the preparation of starting solutions of zno and sno2 nanopowders 300 and 200 ml of vermiwash was added to de ionized water respectively as these volumes were found as the best in our previous studies 17 28 three sets of starting precursor solutions with ph 8 9 and 10 were prepared by adding required quantity of naoh solution drop wise the resultant solution was magnetically stirred at temperature 85 c stirring time 2 h after the completion of stirring process the precipitate was separated by filtration and washed with ethanol and distilled water kept in the ratio of 1 3 the precipitate collected was dried at room temperature which resulted in the final product 2 3 characterization techniques the structural

prepared from starting solutions with ph 8 9 and 10 respectively as per the observed patterns the lattice planes corresponding to the prominent diffraction peaks can be arranged in the descending order of intensity as follows 101 100 002 for zno and 110 101 211 for sno2 nps these three prominent peaks in the observed patterns are in the top three positions in the standard patterns the observed patterns confirm the hexagonal wurtzite crystalline structure of zno nps 19 20 32 and the tetragonal structure of sno2 nps 32 34 the additional peaks observed in the case of vermiwash powered zno nps are related to crystallized enzymes 28 whereas no enzyme related peaks are observed for sno2 nps 17 this absence may be due to the possible overlapping of the enzyme related peaks with the 101 peak of sno2 scherrer s formula was used to calculate the crystallite size 3 d 0 9λ β cosθ the average crystallite size of the vermiwash activated zno for ph values 8 9 and 10 are 37 36 and 28 nm respectively and the corresponding values for sno2 nps are 56 39 and 33 nm the results show that there is a decrease in crystallite size when the ph value increases interestingly the biosynthesized vermiwash activated zno and sno2 nps are crystalline in nature even without any calcination process it is also observed that the intensity of the peaks is not affected by the increase in ph values similarly the interplanar distance of the prominent planes also not affected by the change in ph values as presented in the supplementary data table s1 3 2 surface morphological studies scanning electron microscope was used to observe the morphological variation of the prepared vermiwash activated zno and sno2 nanopowder samples the fig 5 a c shows a mixture of ellipsoidal needle and oval shaped granules formed in the case of zno prepared with ph 8 at ph 9 well defined rod shaped smaller grains are found as seen in fig 5 b whereas agglomerated and not well defined grains are noticed at ph 10 fig 5 c similarly different morphological structures are observed for sno2 nps while larger irregular grains are seen for ph 8 fig 5 g rectangular bar like structures with finely carved ends occur in the case of ph 9 this structure is slightly disturbed when the ph is increased to 10 fig 5 i the tem images of zno and sno2 nps are found to be consistent with the respective sem images fig 5 d f and j l 3 3 eds spectra the elemental composition of the synthesized zno and sno2 nps at ph 9 was studied by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds fig 6 shows the atomic and weight percentage of each element present in the prepared zno and sno2 ph 9 samples the emission spectra exhibit peaks corresponding to the elements zinc zn oxygen o and tin sn 3 4 ftir studies ftir spectra of enzyme activated zno and sno2 nps recorded in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 are shown in fig 7 the peaks present at 3438 cm 1 and 3428 cm 1 show the oh stretching which has hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups in zno and sno2 nps the absorption peaks appear at 1393 cm 1 and 2420 cm 1are owing to the vibrations of ch stretching and bending respectively the peaks appear around 2900 cm 1 and 1420 cm 1 are related to ch2 stretching and bending vibrations of zno and 2928 cm 1 and 1385 cm 1 are related to those of sno2 nanoparticles respectively 28 33 the appearance of peaks at 827 cm 1 and 945 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of the co group the peaks occurring at 555 cm 1 and 622 cm 1 are related to stretching vibrations of zno and o sn o 3 5 bet analysis bet results fig 8 show the comparison of n2 adsorption desorption isotherms for the three sets of vermiwash activated zno and sno2 samples the specific surface area of the sample prepared with ph 9 112 03 m2 g is greater than the other two zinc oxide samples similarly specific surface area of the tin oxide at ph 9 87 85 m2 g is greater than the other two samples the higher surface area of this sample suggests the influence of optimum level of reducing agent used in this case we believe that this higher surface area facilitates more active sites for the adsorption desorption of the test dye molecules and thereby results in an improved photocatalytic activity as discussed in photocatalytic activity section this increase in surface area and decrease in pore size and density is ideal for the photocatalytic and biological applications 35 table 1 displays the values of surface area pore volume and pore diameter of vermiwash activated zno and sno2 3 6 xps analysis the x ray photoelectron spectra xps of the zno and sno2 nps at ph 9 are shown in fig 9 a f the existence of the photoelectron peaks of zn 3d zn 3p zn 3s c 1s zn 2p and o 1s confirms the presence of zinc carbon and oxygen in the zno sample and sn 4d sn 4p sn 4s c 1s sn 3d o 1s and sn 3p confirms the presence of tin carbon and oxygen in the sno2 sample respectively the high intensity peaks at 1021 47 ev and 1044 61 ev ascribed to the zn 2p3 2 and zn 2p1 2 are consistent with the zn2 ions in the nps the oxygen strong peak at 530 25 ev corresponds to o2 ions are attributed to the zno bond linkage in the hexagonal structure of zno 36 similarly for sno2 nps peaks are observed at 486 82 and 495 26 ev ascribed to the sn 3d5 2 and sn 3d3 2 are consistent with the sn4 ions in the nps the strong oxygen peak at 530 7 ev corresponds to the o2 ions are attributed to the sno bond linkage in the tetragonal structure of sno2 37 3 7 uv vis spectra the fig 10 shows the tauc s plots drawn for the samples prepared from starting solutions having different ph values from the tauc s plots the band gap values of the z8 z9 z10 zno samples are found as 3 4 2 97 and 3 6 respectively 38 and the corresponding band gap values of p8 p9 p10 sno2 are 3 2 2 7 and 3 1 39 this relatively lower band gap value of zno and sno2 corresponding to ph 9 is one of the major reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of these samples it is well known that materials with lower band gap can absorb light photons with higher wavelength even in the visible range and thus can act as visible light responsive photocatalyst 40 3 8 proposed mechanism of photocatalytic dye degradation the photocatalytic activity occurs when the following two reactions take place due to the interaction of light with the semiconductor materials sno2 and zno i oxidation reaction with the help of holes h ii reduction reaction with the help of electrons e when a photocatalyst is illuminated with a light source it will produce pairs of electrons and holes by absorbing the photon energy the electrons are excited from the valence band of the photocatalyst sno2 and zno and thereby create the electron e hole h pairs the photogenerated holes h react with water molecule to form radicals oh the electrons react with oxygen molecules to form superoxide anions o2 these oh and o2 radicals degrade the molecules of dye to result in co2 and h2o fig 11 the ph of the starting solution plays a strong role in the photocatalytic dye degradation process at ph 9 the surface area of the nanomaterial is relatively high as observed from the bet analysis and thus facilitates more adsorption of the dye molecules during the photocatalytic process which in turn enhance the dye degradation efficiency 41 moreover the enzymes supplied by the vermiwash can act as a co catalyst of zno and sno2 enhancing the degradation of dye molecules further 3 9 photocatalytic activity photocatalytic dye degradation activity of all the three sets of zno and sno2 samples were evaluated against mb dye under visible light irradiation the absorption spectra of mb dye for all the prepared photocatalytic samples are shown in fig 12 as mb is a cationic dye the dye molecules are easily adsorbed on the negatively charged surface of the catalyst due to the strong coulombic charge interaction between the surface of the catalyst and the mb dye molecules when compared to ph 8 and 10 the samples zno and sno2 correspond to ph 9 exhibit high absorption and consequently enhance the photocatalytic activity dye degradation efficiency of the prepared samples were calculated using the following equation 42 4 degradation efficiency η c 0 c t c 0 100 here c o is the initial concentration and c t is final concentrations during irradiation the degradation efficiency of zno and sno2 is the highest for ph 9 98 and 94 respectively when compared to the ph 8 and ph 10 counterparts the bar diagram fig 13 shows the photocatalytic efficiency of the zno and sno2 samples from these observations we can conclude that the addition of optimal reducing agent during preparation and a suitable bio catalyst play prominent roles in decomposing the dye molecules photocatalytically 3 10 biological properties of zno and sno2 nps with varied ph values 3 10 1 antibacterial activity by disc diffusion method the zno nanopowders possess anti bacterial activity across multi drug resistant bacteria at increasing concentration 43 as bacterial surface has negative charge the zn2 ions can easily penetrate into the cell wall and thereby results in a complete destruction of the lipid layer present inside the cell 44 the related mechanism based on reactive oxygen species has been proposed in the literature 45 as the liberated zn2 ions caused initial damages to the cell wall the probability of penetration of zno nanoparticles into the cell membrane increases and consequently the cytoplasm also gets damaged figs 14 and 15 illustrates the antibacterial activity of zno and sno2 np samples against the bacterial strains e coli and p aeruginosa gram negative as well as b subtilis gram positive all the nanopowders prepared with varied ph values exhibited significant antibacterial activity at higher concentrations 40 mg ml which revealed the efficiency of zno and sno2 nanopowders against the bacterial cell systems supplementay table s2 the zno nanopowders prepared at ph 9 showed better antibacterial efficiency against the bacterial strains b subtilis 26 46 0 11 mm e coli 25 43 0 15 mm and p aeruginosa 23 30 0 17 mm similarly sno2 nanopowder prepared at ph 9 displayed a strong inhibition effect against the growth of b subtilis 26 30 0 20 mm e coli 21 46 0 15 mm and p aeruginosa 22 60 0 10 mm the nanoscale and large surface area of the zno and sno2 nanopowders as evinced by bet analysis may be one of the main reasons for the interaction of nanoparticles with the cell walls of bacteria and the consequent enhanced damage to the cells the interaction of nanoparticles against both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains which has been reported in the literature emphasizes the effective application of nanoparticles nanopowders as antibiotics 46 the antibacterial activity of zno and sno2 nanopowders was slightly higher against the gram positive bacterium than the gram negative bacteria owing to the presence of lipopolysaccharide in the cell wall structure of gram negative bacterium which delineates the entry of nanoparticles across the outer cell membrane of the bacterial cell 47 3 10 2 antioxidant activity by dpph and superoxide free radical scavenging assays the antioxidant activity of nanoparticles usually involves the formation of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide nitric oxide hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals singlet oxygen etc these radicals are responsible for the inhibitory property in transcription translation electron transport chain inside the cells inactivation of proteins and eventually leads to destruction of dna and cell death 48 in the present work antioxidant potential of zno and sno2 nanopowders which are prepared via co precipitation method with varying ph 8 9 and 10 by the addition of naoh and vermiwash were tested by dpph and superoxide free radical scavenging assays in both the assays zno and sno2 nanopowders displayed significant antioxidant activity at ph 9 0 than the nanopowders prepared at the ph of 8 0 and 10 0 and comparable to the standard ascorbic acid fig 16a between the two materials zno nanopowders ph 9 0 recorded higher antioxidant potential with an ic50 of 93 51 0 81 μg ml in dpph assay and 96 59 1 46 μg ml in superoxide radical scavenging assay the sno2 nanopowders ph 9 0 showed obvious antioxidant potential in dpph assay ic50 of 102 61 1 37 μg ml and superoxide ic50 of 97 05 0 97 μg ml free radical scavenging assay when compared to the standard and other samples prepared with the ph of 8 0 and 10 0 these results confirmed that the zno and sno2 nanopowders prepared with the ph of 9 0 have potential antioxidant action on the free radical scavenging behavior the above mentioned results are consistent with the previous studies on antioxidant potential of nanoparticles prepared from various metal oxides 49 most of the previous research reveals that the higher the concentration of nanoparticle samples the higher the antioxidant activity which may be due to the capacity of nanoparticles to transfer the electron density to free radicals in a dose dependent manner 50 as seen in literature the nanopowders enhance the cellular oxidative stress through various mechanisms which include i creating pores on the surface of the host cells ii enabling more dispersal due to increased surface area and iii enabling absorption of oxygen on the surface 51 the nanopowders also has the capacity to enhance the antioxidant properties by activating the enzymes like ascorbate peroxidase peroxidase dismutase and catalase enzymes that leads to the inhibition of free radicals 52 3 10 3 antidiabetic activity by α glucosidase enzyme inhibition assay enzyme and precursor mediated synthesis of nps always have a significant effect on the treatment of various diseases including diabetes diabetes mellitus type i and type ii is a metabolic disorder associated with the dysfunction of insulin secretion and varied blood glucose level the important enzymes involved in the breakdown of polysaccharides and disaccharides into simple monosaccharaides for easy digestion and controlled blood glucose level are α amylases and α glucosidases hence the hydrolysis of complex molecules of carbohydrates into simple carbohydrates with the aid of nps can alleviates the diabetic complications when such nanoparticles are stabilized or conjugated with various catalysts the fig 16b further authenticated the antidiabetic efficacy of zno and sno2 nanopowders by α glucosidase enzyme inhibition assay with acarbose as reference antidiabetic drug the zno and sno2 nanopowders at ph 9 0 showed higher α glucosidase enzyme inhibition effect with an ic50 of 91 23 1 78 and 96 52 1 13 μg ml respectively which has relatively prominent antidiabetic effect compared to acarbose 116 31 1 66 μg ml the inhibition effect was relatively low in zno and sno2 nanopowders prepared with the ph of 8 0 and 10 0 as zinc involves in the synthesis storage and secretion of insulin in the body it can be used as a potential candidate in developing antidiabetic drugs 53 looking at the results of the α glucosidase enzyme inhibition assay and the stability and compatibility of these nps revealed through the characterization techniques zno and sno2 nanopowders prepared at ph 9 0 could be used as an effective antidiabetic drug as these properties of the materials are the essential measures for preparing the drugs in np form associated with insulin metabolism 4 conclusions the study on the effect of ph of the starting solution on the photocatalytic antibacterial antioxidant and antidiabetic activities of vermiwash derived enzyme activated zno and sno2 nanopowders prepared via co precipitation method showed that the ph of the starting solution plays a strong role on the abilities of these materials the degradation efficiency is maximum zno 98 and sno2 94 at ph 9 similarly exceptional pharmacological properties were recorded at this ph level the study also showed that the photocatalytic efficiency and therapeutic properties of zno and sno2 nanopowders were significantly influenced by the enzymes inherited from the vermiwash from these observations we can conclude that the optimal ph value of the precursor solution and the vermiwash which acts as both reducing agent during preparation and a suitable bio catalyst during photocatalysis play prominent roles in dye degradation and biomedical applications credit authorship contribution statement rajagopal shalini conceptualization methodology preparation of manuscript
