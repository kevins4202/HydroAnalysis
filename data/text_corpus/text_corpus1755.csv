8775,the major hurdle to the implementation of wastewater treatment plants byproducts reuse schemes resides in public s acceptance this study explores the attitudes of people towards using recycled water and bio solids generated from oil and gas industries through surveying an ethnically diverse population novel to this study is the interaction between age and education which have not been investigated in depth moreover this is the first study that explores the reason behind women s reluctance in reusing treated wastewater as it looks at maternal and paternal altruism promising parameters in predicting the acceptance level findings indicate that respondents are relatively optimistic in the reuse of tiw and bio solids especially for low contact level applications furthermore parental altruism has been demonstrated to be a factor to predict the acceptance of the public females with children are found to be less likely to accept the use of tiw for high contact level applications keywords wastewater reuse bio solids public acceptance survey social study 1 introduction water scarcity represents a major threat to water and food security in multiple regions and countries in order to reduce water stress levels various measures have been introduced around the globe for instance countries in the gcc gulf cooperation council currently perform extensive desalination to meet most of their water demands and hold the highest global desalination capacity 10 alternately the small city of windhoek in namibia has been using wastewater treatment for direct potable reuse for over 51 years 26 the main difference between the various water provision methods is the source of water and the energy required for treatment in fact the cost of energy for desalination by thermal methods can reach up to nine times the energy requirement for wastewater treatment plants to produce the same amount of water 29 the use of treated wastewater as an alternative water resource and of biosolids an organic rich by product of wastewater treatment as a soil conditioner have been thoroughly investigated from a technical standpoint these resources have been shown to play an prominent role in achieving water security food security and sustainable development while suitable technologies exist to safely use these resources there are inherent social barriers which hinder the implementation and utilisation of treated wastewater and other by products such as biosolids based on their origin understanding the reasons behind these social impediments is crucial before planning the implementation of any wastewater or bio solids reuse scheme treated wastewater tw and biosolids are generally produced from wastewater treatment facilities in both the industrial and municipal sectors biosolids have a high nutrient composition enabling the substitution of energy intensive commercial fertilisers therefore the use of both tw and biosolids generated from either the municipalities or the different industries could potentially offset large quantities of co2 eq emissions 23 for example the largest gas to liquid plant in the world which happens to be situated in the state of qatar has a wastewater treatment facility that includes an ultrafiltration unit and reverse osmosis to meet water of similar quality to seawater desalination plants and produces enough high quality water to meet the consumption needs of 140 000 people 36 the basf s wastewater water treatment plant one of the largest in europe is another example to the potential of treated wastewater resource the facility purifies about 100 million m3 of water yearly 4 treated wastewater can also be beneficial for its high nutrient contents if treated to a sufficient level for organic and pathogen removal without eliminating all nutrients 24 a study about pepper fertigation using purified wastewater found that 66 of nitrogen n requirements were met through this technique 14 another published work which reviewed the role of treated wastewater in achieving carbon and water neutral agricultural systems concluded that the use of tw could potentially replace energy intensive commercial fertilizers as well as enhance carbon sequestration which reduces the emissions related to food prodcution 45 considering the importance of wastewater reuse in modern society and sustainable development the purpose of this study is to investigate for the first time the social acceptance towards use of treated industrial wastewater tiw and biosolids generated from the oil and gas sector which is the primary economic sector in qatar but is also a significant wastewater producer in addition the case study is of significant value to the country as it is one of the most water scarce countries in the world 43 this study is also beneficial for the gcc region and wider middle east and north african region as most of the neighbouring countries are characterized with the same primary economic sector as qatar and similar environmental constraints lastly qatar makes an excellent location to perform such a study as the population is estimated to be roughly 85 expatriates who come from around the globe 38 this makes for a very diverse ethnic demographic pool allowing greater insight into the roles of different cultures on acceptance this study utilised a survey instrument to explore social perceptions within a gcc state qatar towards both tiw and biosolids reuse for benefit to the country across a range of end uses the survey was conducted on the whole representative population of qatar and was not limited to a particular group within the society this article is composed of two major sections the first presents research findings from an extensive literature review about research conducted on the public acceptance of reusing treated wastewater and bio solids the section focuses on the different inconsistencies between the various articles published in this field of study and it reveals the possible reasons behind these varying results finally the following section details the methodology of the social study and discusses the results drawn from the survey analysis 2 review of public acceptance whilst technical elements related to wastewater treatment are well advanced no reuse scheme can be implemented as long as public relunctance to reusing wastewater treatment byproducts persists different studies have investigated the public opinion regarding the utilisation of treated wastewater and other by products of the treatment process of which many have attempted to identify characteristics that may influence the acceptance level 2 1 research method in the last five years a total of 50 peer reviewed journal articles have been published in this field the keywords used for the search are public opinion public perception attitude acceptance reclaimed recycled reuse treated water wastewater effluent greywater bio solids biosludge the factors investigated in the gathered articles can be categorised into three main groups 11 the first two categories the socio demographic factors and the psychological factors are the most investigated as more than 90 of the published articles tackled these parameters fig 1 the socio demographic factors category includes age education ethnicity religion and any other social or demographic characteristic as for the psychological factors they encompass predictors of the behaviour such as risk perceived trust in public authorities and water distribution bodies social norms and influences etc finally the last category deals with the water characteristics which mainly consist of water attributes water pricing and treatment methods this last category was investigated the least as only 20 of the articles looked at its influence on public attitude the next section describes outcomes from previous studies on social acceptance of water reuse and biosolids it should be noted that this section reports results related to treated water and by products from municipal wastewater or greywater treatment plants which contain pollutants of human origin compared with tiw which does not 2 2 discussion 2 2 1 age and education previous studies have been trying to determine correlations between age which is within the socio demographic group of factors and attitudes towards using recycled water results obtained vary depending on the location and the period of study fig 2 illustrates the age of the most accepting group in different studies that have investigated this factor most of the older studies that have explored the different factors that influence the acceptance of recycled water were conducted in the usa and confirmed a negative relationship between age and acceptance the most recent studies which were conducted in australia reported a rather positive correlation of acceptance with age 11 these findings contradict a recent study conducted in the united kingdom where younger people seemed to be more receptive to recycled water use 20 a further study evaluated the acceptance of recycled water as a function of the perception of water shortages and water conservation behaviour 13 the latter did not report any association between age and acceptance the different findings detailed above engender two hypotheses either age does not represent a parameter influencing the acceptance or the influence of age depends on one or more mediating parameters in other words the impact of age on the acceptance might be shifted when another parameter is prevalent such as education this hypothesis can be supported with a study conducted in the united kingdom approximately 135 university students whose ages varied between 18 and 30 participated in a survey that investigated their acceptance of using recycled water for multiple uses 20 only 4 of the respondents opposed the idea of adopting recycled wastewater this low rejection rate might be due to the fact that younger people who have medium to high educational level are more likely to accept recycled water one can draw the same conclusion from the findings of 11 about the studies conducted in the usa prior to the beginning of the 21st century these studies found that age was negatively correlated to acceptance taking into consideration the education level of the population during the same period the hypothesis about the interaction between age and education is reinforced during that period less than 25 of the population held a bachelor degree or equivalent 40 the older generation surveyed in the 1980s were born at the beginning of the 20th century during which less than 10 held a bachelor diploma or equivalent 2 2 2 gender gender is one of the factors which have been extensively investigated in the studies conducted prior to 2018 conclusions indicated that acceptance was not influenced by gender or that males were more likely to accept the use of recycled water out of the 62 studies completed between 1973 and 2017 26 found that males are more likely to accept the use of recycled water whilst the remainder did not report any association between gender and acceptance 11 these results seem to have shifted in the past year as three out of four studies conducted in 2018 exploring the correlations between gender and acceptance determined that females are more likely to accept using recycled wastewater 18 34 44 something that has not been considered to date but could be a confounding factor is paternal and maternal altruism which is related to whether the respondent has children paternal and maternal altruism can perhaps drive enhanced scepticism within parents when adopting new technologies this factor will be explored further within this study 2 2 3 water scarcity and economic aspects this factor was already investigated in a study by ref 25 who explored the social acceptance of using treated greywater in the state of qatar the study demonstrated that acceptance increases when the reuse of treated greywater is framed as a water conservation measure a study that investigated the factors associated with the success of reuse schemes found that even though water quality and pricing are excellent in qatar the societal preferences as to the water sources favours fresh and desalinated seawater 8 9 table 1 summarises the studies that have investigated water scarcity factors when analysing social acceptance 2 2 4 other factors various other drivers and refrainers have been investigated and reported in the literature for instance italian farmer s acceptance of treated wastewater reuse was assessed 34 the authors found that the lack of knowledge had a clear impact on attitudes the same was observed in a study that attempted to understand the variables influencing the public acceptance in iran 31 the authors reported that improving the knowledge is crucial to encourage reuse this could involve education about the wastewater purifying process or reuse schemes previously implemented as was argued by ref 19 this factor is interrelated with the perception of health risk which is the most stated reason behind the social reluctance in accepting the use of treated wastewater 2 20 22 33 41 the risks associated with recycled water reuse should be well perceived and its benefits should be promoted to enhance acceptance 20 trust especially in science technology or in local authorities can also be linked to health risk perception thus to acceptance 12 15 for instance a study conducted in the uk found that trust is highly related to perception of risk 16 social influence is a factor that has not widely been investigated since 2015 only one study reported this parameter the latter was conducted in china and it concluded that the attitudes of chinese citizen s towards the use of treated wastewater can be influenced through social obligation as importance to other s interests is an important aspect of chinese culture 27 3 social study 3 1 methodology the survey questions were developed based on the extensive literature review and on the hypothesis driven from the analysis of the findings reported in order to be able to test for the new factors identified the survey questions were then reviewed by the planning and statistics authority of the state of qatar before being sent for irb approval the survey responses verify the possible drivers and refrainers of using tiw and biosolids generated from oil and gas industries in 16 uses for tiw and 4 uses for biosolids to ensure the response time does not represent a hurdle to respondents two versions of the survey were available a short version and a long version to allow a wider scope of questions while not dissuading people to complete the survey the short version collected some demographic factors age education level nationality while the longer version provides more insights regarding the respondent s profile and motivations due to the additional questions a reward was provided to encourage respondents to go for the longer version of the survey the survey was launched during a public annual research event held by hamad bin khalifa university in 2019 responses were collected from guests during the event to increase the number of responses a social media campaign was run from may 1st till june 1st of 2019 the coverage promoted the survey on linkedin facebook google and twitter in addition influencers were involved to encourage their followers to complete the survey by highlighting its importance on social media platforms the survey was also shared amongst the employees of different companies through mass emails finally flyers were designed to be distributed in mosques and malls the data collected was screened based on the ip address and on the time spent conducting the survey respondents who took less than 1 and 4 min to complete the short and long version of the survey respectively were removed the tests used to determine the representativeness of the sample when comparing the respondents set with the population is the χ2 multinomial test as for the associations between the multiple factors and the level of acceptance for tiw and biosolids ordinal logistic regression was used contingency tables were also used to shed more light on the interaction between the variables the analysis was performed using spss and jasp 0 11 1 and a significance level of α 0 05 was used throughout the study to distinguish significant observations 3 2 findings 3 2 1 representativeness of the sample the total number of qatar residents is 2 753 045 as of october 2019 according to the planning and statistics authority the total number of respondents that completed either of the short or long survey is 1352 of which 1040 completed the long version considering a confidence interval of 95 the margin of error is found to be 3 the gender age and nationality distribution amongst the respondents is shown in table 2 gender and age data were retrieved from the planning and statistics authority psa report 32 data describing the nationality distribution was retrieved from ref 38 the proportion of male respondents is higher than that of females which accurately represents the male to female distribution in the population of qatar χ2 0 041 p 0 839 the surveyed age range of the participants is also representative of the population χ2 1 335 p 0 987 however the nationality distribution amongst the survey respondents was statistically different compared to the best reports of the population χ2 1554 8 p 0 001 it should be noted however that there is no updated or reliable census data about the nationalities present in qatar and their portions the source used was compiled from the embassy and the ministry of foreign affairs reports communications from the respective countries and it includes some statistics that date back to 2013 in addition the survey was presented in english and arabic which could have been a barrier to respondents from regions of the world where these languages are not widely spoken thus limiting the involvement of particular groups in the study this seems a likely cause as the regional groups where english or arabic are widely spoken tended to be better represented and those where english or arabic are not widely spoken were underrepresented such observations are important for any future studies and public awareness campaigns it is recommended at least that urdu and or hindi are considered in future finally the difference between the socio economic groups within the qatar society could have refrained some people from participating in the survey overall it is fair to conclude that the sample is representative of the population 3 2 2 acceptance in the use of treated industrial wastewater the acceptance towards the use of tiw is illustrated in fig 3 it is found that the acceptance is highly dependent on the level of human contact as was reported in previous studies 16 35 the tiw application that received the highest rate of acceptance is firefighting with almost 82 acceptance in contrast the application that received the lowest acceptance was cooking with only 19 of the respondents willing to use tiw for cooking on average 20 of the respondents have either a neutral opinion or do not know implying that if well informed about the safety of using such sources of water their acceptance could be more favourable a key observation is that as the contact level increases the level of acceptance reduces and this is also noticed in the acceptance level of bio solids use urban landscaping received the higher acceptance rate while food crops received the lowest fig 4 3 2 3 association of acceptance and demographic factors the association tests between the demographic factors and the acceptance level for both of tiw and biosolids were investigated using ordinal regression and contingency table the respondents who selected i don t know it does not apply to me were removed in order to have a better visualization of the acceptance rate acceptance level of tiw had association with age gender education level area of education and nationality in comparison biosolids acceptance only had an association with age and nationality 3 2 3 1 age age is found to have an association with acceptance in almost all the low contact uses district cooling car washing firefighting public parks and athletic fields and cleaning the exterior of the house as reported in table 3 it is noticed that as age increases the acceptance follows this finding is similar to the studies conducted in australia which were reported earlier however for the high contact uses there is no significance between the demographic parameter and acceptance except for cooking where the opposite is witnessed in fact it is observed that as age increases the acceptance level drops the lowest acceptance level being observed for those aged between 18 and 23 years old p 0 01 estimate 0 664 compared to the respondents aged 50 and over for the case of biosolids only the two high contact uses had an association with age almost the same trend is observed as that of tiw uses respondents that are between 18 and 23 or are older than 60 are less likely to tick not acceptable alternately those aged between 50 and 59 are more likely to do so for growing both of livestock feed p 0 001 ϕ 0 118 and food crops p 0 028 ϕ 0 100 considering the degrees of freedom which are equal to 2 the cramer s v effect ϕ is considered to be moderate 3 2 3 2 level of education and its interaction with age this demographic parameter does not seem to influence the acceptance level for low contact uses however its association with the acceptance level is significant for high contact uses for instance for the case of bathing the p value observed is p 0 002 such that those holding high school level of equivalent are the ones manifesting the highest acceptance level with an estimate of 0 784 compared to those holding a doctorate degree the same is observed for filling the swimming pool and dish washing when adding age as a layer the p value is no longer significant for bathing and clothes washing is added to the list of uses that have an association it is observed that for filling the swimming pool dish washing and clothes washing the most accepting group is the older age group 50 and over who hold a bachelor or graduate diploma for the case of bio solids the younger age group 18 29 with lower educational level are less likely to accept while those who hold a master s of doctorate degree are more likely to do so as reported in table 4 as for other age groups and education levels insignificant or inconsistent results are obtained as such adding education as a layer to age provides greater clarity on who should be targeted in awareness campaigns 3 2 3 3 gender and parent altruism the only tiw applications that have an association with gender are clothes washing p 0 009 estimate 0 272 food crops irrigation p 0 002 estimate 0 322 and bathing p 0 015 estimate 0 262 females are observed to be less likely to accept compared to males in these specific uses association was found between parents and the acceptance level of both district cooling estimate 0 358 std error 0 103 wald 11 96 p 0 001 and cooking estimate 0 397 std error 0 111 wald 12 73 p 0 001 where respondents without children were more likely to accept as gender is added as a layer the regression results change association becomes significant for more uses as illustrated in table 5 in most uses listed it is witnessed that males without children are more likely to accept the use of tiw compared to those with children while for two of the low contact level applications females with children are less likely to accept 3 2 3 4 area of education the only use where acceptance had an association with the area of education is growing livestock feed p 0 001 ϕ 0 143 for this particular application people from the health sector are less likely to accept as compared to people with a background in architecture who are found to be more likely to accept those with an engineering background leaned towards neutrality 3 2 3 5 nationality due to the reduced number of counts for some regions some of the nationalities were combined to be able to conduct the contingency table test which requires less than 20 of the expected counts to be lower than 5 30 χ2 continuity correction was applied when required nationality had association with most of the uses table 6 illustrates the significance and the effect for each of the tiw and biosolids applications the most consistent attitudes were for people originating from the gcc countries who demonstrated reluctance in almost all uses as for the other regions different attitudes were observed depending on the level of contact for the case of east and southeast asia respondents originating from this region in the world were less likely to accept tiw uses with low contact levels and more likely to accept higher contact level uses and all biosolids applications as for those originating from europe oceania russia and central asia they are likely to accept some of the low contact levels however as the contact level increases they either accept or choose neutrality for biosolids uses respondents from europe russia oceania central asia and from the indian subcontinent are less likely to be against the use of biosolids 3 2 4 potential drivers the main driver that motivates the respondents to consider the use of tiw is the alleviation of water stress in the state of qatar fig 5 the knowledge about tap water origin does not play a role as 62 of those who do not accept at least one use are familiar with the source of their tap water and almost the same percentage is observed for those who accept the use of tiw in all applications the second most cited motivator was related to the eco friendliness of tiw compared to other alternatives in qatar finally the response which obtained the lowest rate is the economic benefit reuse engenders for the country due to its reduced energy requirements this may be due to the already high standard of living within the country and plentiful energy supply approximately 23 of the respondents will support the use of tiw for the three reasons in contrast less than 9 of the respondents claim that they will not support the use of tiw despite this about half of this group claiming they will not support tiw use 4 1 indicated they would accept to use it in at least one of the applications investigated this may be a result of interpreting the support of tiw question as for all applications or an unknown implementation of tiw reuse it should be noted that those who defined the practise as being an opportunity to reduce water scarcity were significantly more likely to accept the use of tiw for low contact level uses district cooling p 0 001 car washing p 0 001 toilet flushing p 0 001 and firefighting p 0 001 on the other hand those who selected it as an environmentally friendly practise were more likely to accept compared to the rest for the highest contact level uses clothes washing p 0 050 dish washing p 0 003 filling the swimming pool p 0 001 bathing p 0 005 food crops irrigation p 0 012 and cooking p 0 001 that said framing the use of tiw as a solution to water scarcity and to environmental protection could potentially influence the public attitude the perception of water scarcity is tested against the acceptance level for the different tiw uses the survey results conclude that no consistent association between the responses and the attitudes exists in fact for low contact level uses such as car washing firefighting and cleaning the exterior of the house it is noticed that those who believe the country is extremely water scarce are more likely to accept as for the higher contact level application food crops irrigation it is found that those who think the country is not water scarce are those who are the most likely to accept finally those who have previously lived outside the country are more likely to accept the use of tiw for clothes washing p 0 046 filling the swimming pool p 0 041 and food crops irrigation p 0 020 while for the other uses there was no association between the two 3 2 5 potential refrainers the respondents who selected not acceptable at least once represent approximately 74 of the total sample size these participants were subsequently requested to provide a reason for their reluctance the answer that received the lowest number of responses was their belief that there is no need to use the tiw table 7 when testing whether these respondents are also those who believe that the country is not water scarce no significant difference is found in fact the respondents who believe reuse of tiw is not necessary do not have a particular perception about qatar s water resources the study did not specifically prompt respondents to determine their religion unless they chose religious principles as reason behind their reluctance therefore the number of respondents for each religion is unclear across all the surveyed people however it is likely that a large portion if not the majority will be of islamic faith since it is reported that 65 5 of the residents in qatar are muslim 46 according to the survey 7 3 of the respondents state their reluctance to use treated water due to religious principles while most of the latter stated that they are muslim they represent an insignificant portion of the total respondents therefore for the purposes of this survey it can be deduced that religious principles are not a refrainer from treated wastewater reuse the most dominant reason for not accepting to reuse tiw was due to perception of health risk in fact 58 of the those who do not accept at least one use have concerns that the practice may cause health problems fig 6 illustrates the reasons that drive health concerns most of the respondents claim that full removal of contaminants is not assured and that the use of the water can have long term risks or that the treatment may add or form dangerous compounds to the water the sources that influence the respondents views include in decreasing significance psychological 28 educational background 26 intuition 23 news 15 social media 12 or their previous experiences 10 it should be noted that 40 of those who claim the tiw represents a risk to their safety also selected that they do not have sufficient information highlighting the need for public awareness campaigns around what pollutants are in tiw how they are removed and how the water is indeed safe to use in a variety of applications with high contact levels out of those who do not accept to use tiw for at least one application they are found overall to be more reluctant to use treated greywater tgw and treated sewage effluent tse compared to those who accept only 42 3 and 41 7 of those who don t accept tiw at least once designate that they will be more likely to use tse and tgw respectively while amongst the rest 63 7 and 60 8 are more likely to use tse and tgw respectively as for those who accept all uses 77 of them claim they are more likely to use tse and tgw social influence is a potential driver to use tiw it is found that 45 9 of those who do not accept at least one use claim that they might be less reluctant if a large proportion of qatar population also uses tiw alternately if their families and friends start using it only 38 confirm that they will change their behaviour in the long survey the respondents were queried whether they have previously or still work in an ornamental garden or a vegetable garden farm their responses were tested against their acceptance it is found that those who own or work in an ornamental garden are more likely to select not acceptable compared to the others this indicates that even if the public accepted use of tiw for crop or fodder irrigation there may be challenges from the primary end user possibly due to fears about how that would affect the value of the product they are producing in the consumer s perception for the case of bio solids respondents were asked about the country of origin for the crops they consume the respondents who have a preferred region from where they buy their food tend to be less likely to accept p 0 019 p 0 021 p 0 012 for home yard landscaping growing livestock feed and food crops production respectively however no significant difference was found in the acceptance level of using biosolids between those who buy organic food and those who do not 3 2 6 communication of information respondents were queried about their level of reliance and trust on certain sources for satisfying their information needs on the reuse of tiw and biosolids scientific and research institutions as well as public health officials and health practitioners were the most highly regarded professions entities to source information from with roughly three quarters for respondents relying on each of these two groups table 8 oil and gas companies from where the tiw would come were the least popular in terms of reliance for information followed by farmers and food producers there is no difference in the responses of those who do not accept at least once and the others χ2 0 067 p 0 839 4 conclusion water scarcity threatens many countries and regions around the globe in order to ensure food and water security which are part of the sustainable development goals it is important to develop and implement various methods to reduce the pressure on natural water resources and to integrate solutions which are more energy efficient for instance whilst desalination technology has provided an alternative source of water it remains energy intensive and results in greater harm to the environment when compared to other methods such as the treatment of wastewater which can then be reintegrated into the water system while technical challenges related to wastewater treatment can be overcome it has not been widely adopted in mainstream water networks due to social barriers related to the acceptance of the general public which depends on various variables in the literature these parameters have always been considered to independently influence the acceptance of recycled water however this research indicates some of the factors seem to be dependent on one another giving way to interactions for instance age and education were identified in the review of the existing research and were tested in addition a new factor has been identified in this presented study which is parental altruism where parents particularly mothers are less likely to accept use of tiw the survey outcomes highlight that the acceptance level decreases as the contact level increases generally for low contact uses respondents accept to use both tiw and bio solids yet approximately 10 15 of the respondents had a moderate degree of resistance the latter is mainly due to the perception of health risks however most of the respondents declare they do not have sufficient information framing the reuse practise as a solution to water scarcity and to environmental issues has been identified to be a significant motivator for public acceptance of tiw as such educational and awareness campaigns which allude to the need to combat water scarcity and are supported by scientific data from research institutes and health practitioners addressing risks related to the use of the by products are necessary as these entities are highly trusted by respondents the respondents who demonstrated the highest reluctance were from middle eastern countries including the gcc countries therefore targeted campaigns are necessary in order to overcome negative perceptions educated middle aged respondents also demonstrated lower acceptance and are also easy to target as they are highly active and responsive on social media the results from this survey could be used and tested in awareness or educational campaigns to assess their prevalences this study can be improved by conducting a survey that focuses on one of the factors investigated in order to fully and more rigorously understand how it influences respondent s attitudes toward the use if tiw and bio solids declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the abdullah bin hamad al attiyah international foundation for energy and sustainable development for funding this research 
8775,the major hurdle to the implementation of wastewater treatment plants byproducts reuse schemes resides in public s acceptance this study explores the attitudes of people towards using recycled water and bio solids generated from oil and gas industries through surveying an ethnically diverse population novel to this study is the interaction between age and education which have not been investigated in depth moreover this is the first study that explores the reason behind women s reluctance in reusing treated wastewater as it looks at maternal and paternal altruism promising parameters in predicting the acceptance level findings indicate that respondents are relatively optimistic in the reuse of tiw and bio solids especially for low contact level applications furthermore parental altruism has been demonstrated to be a factor to predict the acceptance of the public females with children are found to be less likely to accept the use of tiw for high contact level applications keywords wastewater reuse bio solids public acceptance survey social study 1 introduction water scarcity represents a major threat to water and food security in multiple regions and countries in order to reduce water stress levels various measures have been introduced around the globe for instance countries in the gcc gulf cooperation council currently perform extensive desalination to meet most of their water demands and hold the highest global desalination capacity 10 alternately the small city of windhoek in namibia has been using wastewater treatment for direct potable reuse for over 51 years 26 the main difference between the various water provision methods is the source of water and the energy required for treatment in fact the cost of energy for desalination by thermal methods can reach up to nine times the energy requirement for wastewater treatment plants to produce the same amount of water 29 the use of treated wastewater as an alternative water resource and of biosolids an organic rich by product of wastewater treatment as a soil conditioner have been thoroughly investigated from a technical standpoint these resources have been shown to play an prominent role in achieving water security food security and sustainable development while suitable technologies exist to safely use these resources there are inherent social barriers which hinder the implementation and utilisation of treated wastewater and other by products such as biosolids based on their origin understanding the reasons behind these social impediments is crucial before planning the implementation of any wastewater or bio solids reuse scheme treated wastewater tw and biosolids are generally produced from wastewater treatment facilities in both the industrial and municipal sectors biosolids have a high nutrient composition enabling the substitution of energy intensive commercial fertilisers therefore the use of both tw and biosolids generated from either the municipalities or the different industries could potentially offset large quantities of co2 eq emissions 23 for example the largest gas to liquid plant in the world which happens to be situated in the state of qatar has a wastewater treatment facility that includes an ultrafiltration unit and reverse osmosis to meet water of similar quality to seawater desalination plants and produces enough high quality water to meet the consumption needs of 140 000 people 36 the basf s wastewater water treatment plant one of the largest in europe is another example to the potential of treated wastewater resource the facility purifies about 100 million m3 of water yearly 4 treated wastewater can also be beneficial for its high nutrient contents if treated to a sufficient level for organic and pathogen removal without eliminating all nutrients 24 a study about pepper fertigation using purified wastewater found that 66 of nitrogen n requirements were met through this technique 14 another published work which reviewed the role of treated wastewater in achieving carbon and water neutral agricultural systems concluded that the use of tw could potentially replace energy intensive commercial fertilizers as well as enhance carbon sequestration which reduces the emissions related to food prodcution 45 considering the importance of wastewater reuse in modern society and sustainable development the purpose of this study is to investigate for the first time the social acceptance towards use of treated industrial wastewater tiw and biosolids generated from the oil and gas sector which is the primary economic sector in qatar but is also a significant wastewater producer in addition the case study is of significant value to the country as it is one of the most water scarce countries in the world 43 this study is also beneficial for the gcc region and wider middle east and north african region as most of the neighbouring countries are characterized with the same primary economic sector as qatar and similar environmental constraints lastly qatar makes an excellent location to perform such a study as the population is estimated to be roughly 85 expatriates who come from around the globe 38 this makes for a very diverse ethnic demographic pool allowing greater insight into the roles of different cultures on acceptance this study utilised a survey instrument to explore social perceptions within a gcc state qatar towards both tiw and biosolids reuse for benefit to the country across a range of end uses the survey was conducted on the whole representative population of qatar and was not limited to a particular group within the society this article is composed of two major sections the first presents research findings from an extensive literature review about research conducted on the public acceptance of reusing treated wastewater and bio solids the section focuses on the different inconsistencies between the various articles published in this field of study and it reveals the possible reasons behind these varying results finally the following section details the methodology of the social study and discusses the results drawn from the survey analysis 2 review of public acceptance whilst technical elements related to wastewater treatment are well advanced no reuse scheme can be implemented as long as public relunctance to reusing wastewater treatment byproducts persists different studies have investigated the public opinion regarding the utilisation of treated wastewater and other by products of the treatment process of which many have attempted to identify characteristics that may influence the acceptance level 2 1 research method in the last five years a total of 50 peer reviewed journal articles have been published in this field the keywords used for the search are public opinion public perception attitude acceptance reclaimed recycled reuse treated water wastewater effluent greywater bio solids biosludge the factors investigated in the gathered articles can be categorised into three main groups 11 the first two categories the socio demographic factors and the psychological factors are the most investigated as more than 90 of the published articles tackled these parameters fig 1 the socio demographic factors category includes age education ethnicity religion and any other social or demographic characteristic as for the psychological factors they encompass predictors of the behaviour such as risk perceived trust in public authorities and water distribution bodies social norms and influences etc finally the last category deals with the water characteristics which mainly consist of water attributes water pricing and treatment methods this last category was investigated the least as only 20 of the articles looked at its influence on public attitude the next section describes outcomes from previous studies on social acceptance of water reuse and biosolids it should be noted that this section reports results related to treated water and by products from municipal wastewater or greywater treatment plants which contain pollutants of human origin compared with tiw which does not 2 2 discussion 2 2 1 age and education previous studies have been trying to determine correlations between age which is within the socio demographic group of factors and attitudes towards using recycled water results obtained vary depending on the location and the period of study fig 2 illustrates the age of the most accepting group in different studies that have investigated this factor most of the older studies that have explored the different factors that influence the acceptance of recycled water were conducted in the usa and confirmed a negative relationship between age and acceptance the most recent studies which were conducted in australia reported a rather positive correlation of acceptance with age 11 these findings contradict a recent study conducted in the united kingdom where younger people seemed to be more receptive to recycled water use 20 a further study evaluated the acceptance of recycled water as a function of the perception of water shortages and water conservation behaviour 13 the latter did not report any association between age and acceptance the different findings detailed above engender two hypotheses either age does not represent a parameter influencing the acceptance or the influence of age depends on one or more mediating parameters in other words the impact of age on the acceptance might be shifted when another parameter is prevalent such as education this hypothesis can be supported with a study conducted in the united kingdom approximately 135 university students whose ages varied between 18 and 30 participated in a survey that investigated their acceptance of using recycled water for multiple uses 20 only 4 of the respondents opposed the idea of adopting recycled wastewater this low rejection rate might be due to the fact that younger people who have medium to high educational level are more likely to accept recycled water one can draw the same conclusion from the findings of 11 about the studies conducted in the usa prior to the beginning of the 21st century these studies found that age was negatively correlated to acceptance taking into consideration the education level of the population during the same period the hypothesis about the interaction between age and education is reinforced during that period less than 25 of the population held a bachelor degree or equivalent 40 the older generation surveyed in the 1980s were born at the beginning of the 20th century during which less than 10 held a bachelor diploma or equivalent 2 2 2 gender gender is one of the factors which have been extensively investigated in the studies conducted prior to 2018 conclusions indicated that acceptance was not influenced by gender or that males were more likely to accept the use of recycled water out of the 62 studies completed between 1973 and 2017 26 found that males are more likely to accept the use of recycled water whilst the remainder did not report any association between gender and acceptance 11 these results seem to have shifted in the past year as three out of four studies conducted in 2018 exploring the correlations between gender and acceptance determined that females are more likely to accept using recycled wastewater 18 34 44 something that has not been considered to date but could be a confounding factor is paternal and maternal altruism which is related to whether the respondent has children paternal and maternal altruism can perhaps drive enhanced scepticism within parents when adopting new technologies this factor will be explored further within this study 2 2 3 water scarcity and economic aspects this factor was already investigated in a study by ref 25 who explored the social acceptance of using treated greywater in the state of qatar the study demonstrated that acceptance increases when the reuse of treated greywater is framed as a water conservation measure a study that investigated the factors associated with the success of reuse schemes found that even though water quality and pricing are excellent in qatar the societal preferences as to the water sources favours fresh and desalinated seawater 8 9 table 1 summarises the studies that have investigated water scarcity factors when analysing social acceptance 2 2 4 other factors various other drivers and refrainers have been investigated and reported in the literature for instance italian farmer s acceptance of treated wastewater reuse was assessed 34 the authors found that the lack of knowledge had a clear impact on attitudes the same was observed in a study that attempted to understand the variables influencing the public acceptance in iran 31 the authors reported that improving the knowledge is crucial to encourage reuse this could involve education about the wastewater purifying process or reuse schemes previously implemented as was argued by ref 19 this factor is interrelated with the perception of health risk which is the most stated reason behind the social reluctance in accepting the use of treated wastewater 2 20 22 33 41 the risks associated with recycled water reuse should be well perceived and its benefits should be promoted to enhance acceptance 20 trust especially in science technology or in local authorities can also be linked to health risk perception thus to acceptance 12 15 for instance a study conducted in the uk found that trust is highly related to perception of risk 16 social influence is a factor that has not widely been investigated since 2015 only one study reported this parameter the latter was conducted in china and it concluded that the attitudes of chinese citizen s towards the use of treated wastewater can be influenced through social obligation as importance to other s interests is an important aspect of chinese culture 27 3 social study 3 1 methodology the survey questions were developed based on the extensive literature review and on the hypothesis driven from the analysis of the findings reported in order to be able to test for the new factors identified the survey questions were then reviewed by the planning and statistics authority of the state of qatar before being sent for irb approval the survey responses verify the possible drivers and refrainers of using tiw and biosolids generated from oil and gas industries in 16 uses for tiw and 4 uses for biosolids to ensure the response time does not represent a hurdle to respondents two versions of the survey were available a short version and a long version to allow a wider scope of questions while not dissuading people to complete the survey the short version collected some demographic factors age education level nationality while the longer version provides more insights regarding the respondent s profile and motivations due to the additional questions a reward was provided to encourage respondents to go for the longer version of the survey the survey was launched during a public annual research event held by hamad bin khalifa university in 2019 responses were collected from guests during the event to increase the number of responses a social media campaign was run from may 1st till june 1st of 2019 the coverage promoted the survey on linkedin facebook google and twitter in addition influencers were involved to encourage their followers to complete the survey by highlighting its importance on social media platforms the survey was also shared amongst the employees of different companies through mass emails finally flyers were designed to be distributed in mosques and malls the data collected was screened based on the ip address and on the time spent conducting the survey respondents who took less than 1 and 4 min to complete the short and long version of the survey respectively were removed the tests used to determine the representativeness of the sample when comparing the respondents set with the population is the χ2 multinomial test as for the associations between the multiple factors and the level of acceptance for tiw and biosolids ordinal logistic regression was used contingency tables were also used to shed more light on the interaction between the variables the analysis was performed using spss and jasp 0 11 1 and a significance level of α 0 05 was used throughout the study to distinguish significant observations 3 2 findings 3 2 1 representativeness of the sample the total number of qatar residents is 2 753 045 as of october 2019 according to the planning and statistics authority the total number of respondents that completed either of the short or long survey is 1352 of which 1040 completed the long version considering a confidence interval of 95 the margin of error is found to be 3 the gender age and nationality distribution amongst the respondents is shown in table 2 gender and age data were retrieved from the planning and statistics authority psa report 32 data describing the nationality distribution was retrieved from ref 38 the proportion of male respondents is higher than that of females which accurately represents the male to female distribution in the population of qatar χ2 0 041 p 0 839 the surveyed age range of the participants is also representative of the population χ2 1 335 p 0 987 however the nationality distribution amongst the survey respondents was statistically different compared to the best reports of the population χ2 1554 8 p 0 001 it should be noted however that there is no updated or reliable census data about the nationalities present in qatar and their portions the source used was compiled from the embassy and the ministry of foreign affairs reports communications from the respective countries and it includes some statistics that date back to 2013 in addition the survey was presented in english and arabic which could have been a barrier to respondents from regions of the world where these languages are not widely spoken thus limiting the involvement of particular groups in the study this seems a likely cause as the regional groups where english or arabic are widely spoken tended to be better represented and those where english or arabic are not widely spoken were underrepresented such observations are important for any future studies and public awareness campaigns it is recommended at least that urdu and or hindi are considered in future finally the difference between the socio economic groups within the qatar society could have refrained some people from participating in the survey overall it is fair to conclude that the sample is representative of the population 3 2 2 acceptance in the use of treated industrial wastewater the acceptance towards the use of tiw is illustrated in fig 3 it is found that the acceptance is highly dependent on the level of human contact as was reported in previous studies 16 35 the tiw application that received the highest rate of acceptance is firefighting with almost 82 acceptance in contrast the application that received the lowest acceptance was cooking with only 19 of the respondents willing to use tiw for cooking on average 20 of the respondents have either a neutral opinion or do not know implying that if well informed about the safety of using such sources of water their acceptance could be more favourable a key observation is that as the contact level increases the level of acceptance reduces and this is also noticed in the acceptance level of bio solids use urban landscaping received the higher acceptance rate while food crops received the lowest fig 4 3 2 3 association of acceptance and demographic factors the association tests between the demographic factors and the acceptance level for both of tiw and biosolids were investigated using ordinal regression and contingency table the respondents who selected i don t know it does not apply to me were removed in order to have a better visualization of the acceptance rate acceptance level of tiw had association with age gender education level area of education and nationality in comparison biosolids acceptance only had an association with age and nationality 3 2 3 1 age age is found to have an association with acceptance in almost all the low contact uses district cooling car washing firefighting public parks and athletic fields and cleaning the exterior of the house as reported in table 3 it is noticed that as age increases the acceptance follows this finding is similar to the studies conducted in australia which were reported earlier however for the high contact uses there is no significance between the demographic parameter and acceptance except for cooking where the opposite is witnessed in fact it is observed that as age increases the acceptance level drops the lowest acceptance level being observed for those aged between 18 and 23 years old p 0 01 estimate 0 664 compared to the respondents aged 50 and over for the case of biosolids only the two high contact uses had an association with age almost the same trend is observed as that of tiw uses respondents that are between 18 and 23 or are older than 60 are less likely to tick not acceptable alternately those aged between 50 and 59 are more likely to do so for growing both of livestock feed p 0 001 ϕ 0 118 and food crops p 0 028 ϕ 0 100 considering the degrees of freedom which are equal to 2 the cramer s v effect ϕ is considered to be moderate 3 2 3 2 level of education and its interaction with age this demographic parameter does not seem to influence the acceptance level for low contact uses however its association with the acceptance level is significant for high contact uses for instance for the case of bathing the p value observed is p 0 002 such that those holding high school level of equivalent are the ones manifesting the highest acceptance level with an estimate of 0 784 compared to those holding a doctorate degree the same is observed for filling the swimming pool and dish washing when adding age as a layer the p value is no longer significant for bathing and clothes washing is added to the list of uses that have an association it is observed that for filling the swimming pool dish washing and clothes washing the most accepting group is the older age group 50 and over who hold a bachelor or graduate diploma for the case of bio solids the younger age group 18 29 with lower educational level are less likely to accept while those who hold a master s of doctorate degree are more likely to do so as reported in table 4 as for other age groups and education levels insignificant or inconsistent results are obtained as such adding education as a layer to age provides greater clarity on who should be targeted in awareness campaigns 3 2 3 3 gender and parent altruism the only tiw applications that have an association with gender are clothes washing p 0 009 estimate 0 272 food crops irrigation p 0 002 estimate 0 322 and bathing p 0 015 estimate 0 262 females are observed to be less likely to accept compared to males in these specific uses association was found between parents and the acceptance level of both district cooling estimate 0 358 std error 0 103 wald 11 96 p 0 001 and cooking estimate 0 397 std error 0 111 wald 12 73 p 0 001 where respondents without children were more likely to accept as gender is added as a layer the regression results change association becomes significant for more uses as illustrated in table 5 in most uses listed it is witnessed that males without children are more likely to accept the use of tiw compared to those with children while for two of the low contact level applications females with children are less likely to accept 3 2 3 4 area of education the only use where acceptance had an association with the area of education is growing livestock feed p 0 001 ϕ 0 143 for this particular application people from the health sector are less likely to accept as compared to people with a background in architecture who are found to be more likely to accept those with an engineering background leaned towards neutrality 3 2 3 5 nationality due to the reduced number of counts for some regions some of the nationalities were combined to be able to conduct the contingency table test which requires less than 20 of the expected counts to be lower than 5 30 χ2 continuity correction was applied when required nationality had association with most of the uses table 6 illustrates the significance and the effect for each of the tiw and biosolids applications the most consistent attitudes were for people originating from the gcc countries who demonstrated reluctance in almost all uses as for the other regions different attitudes were observed depending on the level of contact for the case of east and southeast asia respondents originating from this region in the world were less likely to accept tiw uses with low contact levels and more likely to accept higher contact level uses and all biosolids applications as for those originating from europe oceania russia and central asia they are likely to accept some of the low contact levels however as the contact level increases they either accept or choose neutrality for biosolids uses respondents from europe russia oceania central asia and from the indian subcontinent are less likely to be against the use of biosolids 3 2 4 potential drivers the main driver that motivates the respondents to consider the use of tiw is the alleviation of water stress in the state of qatar fig 5 the knowledge about tap water origin does not play a role as 62 of those who do not accept at least one use are familiar with the source of their tap water and almost the same percentage is observed for those who accept the use of tiw in all applications the second most cited motivator was related to the eco friendliness of tiw compared to other alternatives in qatar finally the response which obtained the lowest rate is the economic benefit reuse engenders for the country due to its reduced energy requirements this may be due to the already high standard of living within the country and plentiful energy supply approximately 23 of the respondents will support the use of tiw for the three reasons in contrast less than 9 of the respondents claim that they will not support the use of tiw despite this about half of this group claiming they will not support tiw use 4 1 indicated they would accept to use it in at least one of the applications investigated this may be a result of interpreting the support of tiw question as for all applications or an unknown implementation of tiw reuse it should be noted that those who defined the practise as being an opportunity to reduce water scarcity were significantly more likely to accept the use of tiw for low contact level uses district cooling p 0 001 car washing p 0 001 toilet flushing p 0 001 and firefighting p 0 001 on the other hand those who selected it as an environmentally friendly practise were more likely to accept compared to the rest for the highest contact level uses clothes washing p 0 050 dish washing p 0 003 filling the swimming pool p 0 001 bathing p 0 005 food crops irrigation p 0 012 and cooking p 0 001 that said framing the use of tiw as a solution to water scarcity and to environmental protection could potentially influence the public attitude the perception of water scarcity is tested against the acceptance level for the different tiw uses the survey results conclude that no consistent association between the responses and the attitudes exists in fact for low contact level uses such as car washing firefighting and cleaning the exterior of the house it is noticed that those who believe the country is extremely water scarce are more likely to accept as for the higher contact level application food crops irrigation it is found that those who think the country is not water scarce are those who are the most likely to accept finally those who have previously lived outside the country are more likely to accept the use of tiw for clothes washing p 0 046 filling the swimming pool p 0 041 and food crops irrigation p 0 020 while for the other uses there was no association between the two 3 2 5 potential refrainers the respondents who selected not acceptable at least once represent approximately 74 of the total sample size these participants were subsequently requested to provide a reason for their reluctance the answer that received the lowest number of responses was their belief that there is no need to use the tiw table 7 when testing whether these respondents are also those who believe that the country is not water scarce no significant difference is found in fact the respondents who believe reuse of tiw is not necessary do not have a particular perception about qatar s water resources the study did not specifically prompt respondents to determine their religion unless they chose religious principles as reason behind their reluctance therefore the number of respondents for each religion is unclear across all the surveyed people however it is likely that a large portion if not the majority will be of islamic faith since it is reported that 65 5 of the residents in qatar are muslim 46 according to the survey 7 3 of the respondents state their reluctance to use treated water due to religious principles while most of the latter stated that they are muslim they represent an insignificant portion of the total respondents therefore for the purposes of this survey it can be deduced that religious principles are not a refrainer from treated wastewater reuse the most dominant reason for not accepting to reuse tiw was due to perception of health risk in fact 58 of the those who do not accept at least one use have concerns that the practice may cause health problems fig 6 illustrates the reasons that drive health concerns most of the respondents claim that full removal of contaminants is not assured and that the use of the water can have long term risks or that the treatment may add or form dangerous compounds to the water the sources that influence the respondents views include in decreasing significance psychological 28 educational background 26 intuition 23 news 15 social media 12 or their previous experiences 10 it should be noted that 40 of those who claim the tiw represents a risk to their safety also selected that they do not have sufficient information highlighting the need for public awareness campaigns around what pollutants are in tiw how they are removed and how the water is indeed safe to use in a variety of applications with high contact levels out of those who do not accept to use tiw for at least one application they are found overall to be more reluctant to use treated greywater tgw and treated sewage effluent tse compared to those who accept only 42 3 and 41 7 of those who don t accept tiw at least once designate that they will be more likely to use tse and tgw respectively while amongst the rest 63 7 and 60 8 are more likely to use tse and tgw respectively as for those who accept all uses 77 of them claim they are more likely to use tse and tgw social influence is a potential driver to use tiw it is found that 45 9 of those who do not accept at least one use claim that they might be less reluctant if a large proportion of qatar population also uses tiw alternately if their families and friends start using it only 38 confirm that they will change their behaviour in the long survey the respondents were queried whether they have previously or still work in an ornamental garden or a vegetable garden farm their responses were tested against their acceptance it is found that those who own or work in an ornamental garden are more likely to select not acceptable compared to the others this indicates that even if the public accepted use of tiw for crop or fodder irrigation there may be challenges from the primary end user possibly due to fears about how that would affect the value of the product they are producing in the consumer s perception for the case of bio solids respondents were asked about the country of origin for the crops they consume the respondents who have a preferred region from where they buy their food tend to be less likely to accept p 0 019 p 0 021 p 0 012 for home yard landscaping growing livestock feed and food crops production respectively however no significant difference was found in the acceptance level of using biosolids between those who buy organic food and those who do not 3 2 6 communication of information respondents were queried about their level of reliance and trust on certain sources for satisfying their information needs on the reuse of tiw and biosolids scientific and research institutions as well as public health officials and health practitioners were the most highly regarded professions entities to source information from with roughly three quarters for respondents relying on each of these two groups table 8 oil and gas companies from where the tiw would come were the least popular in terms of reliance for information followed by farmers and food producers there is no difference in the responses of those who do not accept at least once and the others χ2 0 067 p 0 839 4 conclusion water scarcity threatens many countries and regions around the globe in order to ensure food and water security which are part of the sustainable development goals it is important to develop and implement various methods to reduce the pressure on natural water resources and to integrate solutions which are more energy efficient for instance whilst desalination technology has provided an alternative source of water it remains energy intensive and results in greater harm to the environment when compared to other methods such as the treatment of wastewater which can then be reintegrated into the water system while technical challenges related to wastewater treatment can be overcome it has not been widely adopted in mainstream water networks due to social barriers related to the acceptance of the general public which depends on various variables in the literature these parameters have always been considered to independently influence the acceptance of recycled water however this research indicates some of the factors seem to be dependent on one another giving way to interactions for instance age and education were identified in the review of the existing research and were tested in addition a new factor has been identified in this presented study which is parental altruism where parents particularly mothers are less likely to accept use of tiw the survey outcomes highlight that the acceptance level decreases as the contact level increases generally for low contact uses respondents accept to use both tiw and bio solids yet approximately 10 15 of the respondents had a moderate degree of resistance the latter is mainly due to the perception of health risks however most of the respondents declare they do not have sufficient information framing the reuse practise as a solution to water scarcity and to environmental issues has been identified to be a significant motivator for public acceptance of tiw as such educational and awareness campaigns which allude to the need to combat water scarcity and are supported by scientific data from research institutes and health practitioners addressing risks related to the use of the by products are necessary as these entities are highly trusted by respondents the respondents who demonstrated the highest reluctance were from middle eastern countries including the gcc countries therefore targeted campaigns are necessary in order to overcome negative perceptions educated middle aged respondents also demonstrated lower acceptance and are also easy to target as they are highly active and responsive on social media the results from this survey could be used and tested in awareness or educational campaigns to assess their prevalences this study can be improved by conducting a survey that focuses on one of the factors investigated in order to fully and more rigorously understand how it influences respondent s attitudes toward the use if tiw and bio solids declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the abdullah bin hamad al attiyah international foundation for energy and sustainable development for funding this research 
8776,chitosan iron silver cs fe ag nanocomposite was synthesized by a simple green synthetic method the bimetallic fecore agshell nanoparticles nps were synthesized through a simple reduction of equimolar amounts of their salt mixture with alchornea laxiflora leaf extract at 100 c the resulting bimetallic nanoparticles and nanocomposite were characterized with fourier transform infrared ftir and uv visible spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd techniques the evidence for the formation of fecore agshell nps within the chitosan polymer matrix was confirmed by uv visible xrd and ftir spectra where the bonding of the bimetallic shell agshell with carboxyl group to form ag o was confirmed the effect of dosage ph and agitation time on turbidity reduction of wastewater was studied to determine optimum conditions for the determination of water quality parameters the cs fe ag nanocomposite gave higher maximum removals of bod 48 7 cod 15 5 and tds 54 9 than pure cs with bod 25 5 cod 3 6 and tds 38 9 at optimum conditions keywords chitosan iron silver nanoparticles chitosan iron silver nanocomposite wastewater treatment 1 introduction the nanotechnology is aimed at producing nanostructures or nano arrays with unique properties that always put them in good stead over their bulk or single particle types various physical and chemical methods 1 3 have been developed for the synthesis of nanoparticles where most of them are either expensive or use chemicals that are harmful to the environment the increasing concern on how to reduce or eliminate the use of environmental threatening substances in compliance with green chemistry principles 4 has necessitated the need for the development of novel green syntheses that are inexpensive and non hazardous 5 7 bimetallic nanoparticles have attracted the interest of scientists for use in a wide range of catalytic and electrocatalytic applications over their monometallic metals due to the synergistic relationship that exists between the two metals 6 8 9 chitosan cs poly β 1 4 2 amino 2 deoxy d glucopyranose is a natural cationic cellulose biopolymer of high molecular weight obtained from deacetylation of chitin and is abundant in chitinous material chitosan cs is a non toxic biocompatible inexpensive hydrophilic and biodegradable polymer 10 12 the excellent adsorptive capacity of highly reactive amino and carboxyl groups in chitosan molecular structure 13 15 has paved way for their utilization as an adsorbent and as a flocculent in the field of water and wastewater treatment 16 18 chitosan also possesses antibacterial properties 19 21 the adsorptive capacity and antibacterial activity can be enhanced by combining chitosan with other metal nanoparticles most especially bimetallic nanoparticles such as fecore agshell nanoparticles the environmental issues related to the consequences of anthropogenic impact on the environment are given adequate attention because of the alarming increase in the degree of pollution of aquatic media these contaminants are hazardous to humans and earth s ecosystem thus various methods have been reported to address challenges of water pollution in recent times 22 27 adsorption has been ranked as the best approach amongst various methods of wastewater treatment because of its simplicity of implementation cost effectiveness and high process efficiency 25 28 30 the current state of anthropogenic pollution of fresh water ecosystem by discharge of untreated industrial wastewaters into the seas and lagoon is worrisome and most of the existing adsorbent materials are not capable of purifying industrial wastewaters to the required concentration of harmful impurities therefore it is sacrosanct to use novel material that have been modified with nanoparticles to enhance adsorption and oxidative activity the nanoparticles are gaining ground in water management system via adsorption method 27 31 34 and research activities are aimed at synthesizing nanostructure sorbent materials having adsorption and oxidative activity that are several times greater than the conventional adsorbents such as activated carbon zeolites clays etc used in the industry 25 26 29 30 also despite the promising features of the newly developed nanostructure sorbent materials a systematic investigation into their synthetic routes is scanty chitosan based nanoparticles using metal nanoparticles such as ag 35 36 zno 37 38 fe 39 40 and ago 41 have been reported for water treatment however all the above mentioned papers used monometallic nanoparticles to modify chitosan and model wastewaters containing specific concentration of a target pollutant which does not represent a real industrial wastewater where the presence of other polluting substances might affect the adsorptive capacity of the chitosan based nanoparticles to advance knowledge in the synthesis of nanostructure sorbent for use in wastewater treatment and to evaluate their performance in real wastewater sample the pure chitosan cs was modified with bimetallic fecore agshell nanoparticles to form cs fe ag nanocomposite through the green approach the prepared adsorbent was then used for the removal of bod cod tds and turbidity in wastewater sample collected from nestle food processing industry in a coagulation flocculation process the impregnation of fecore agshell into the cs surface will combine the synergistic effects of fecore agshell and cs to exceedingly enhance the performance cs fe ag nanocomposite for wastewater treatment the effects of chitosan dosage ph and settling time were considered to determine the optimum conditions to achieve the best performance for cs fe ag nanocomposite in the treatment of wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents powder chitosan lactate halo klear dg5100 85 deacetylated was purchased from dober chemical corp usa silver nitrate and iron sulfate salts were purchased from emsure and qualikems respectively acetic acid was of analytical grade from british petrochemicals uk while the leaf of alchornea laxiflora was obtained from the university campus all reagents were used without further treatments 2 2 synthesis of the cs fe ag nanocomposite the nanocomposite was synthesized as described by govindan et al 36 typically 0 5 g of the pure cs powder was dissolved in 100 ml of 1 acetic acid and the solution was vortexed to aid complete dissolution and then centrifuged for 2 h at 150 rpm to this solution 0 5 g each of feso4 7h2o and agno3 salts was added and the solution was stirred for 2 h then freshly prepared alchornea laxiflora leaf extract broth was added dropwise to this mixture where a dark grey precipitate was observed with gas evolution the mixture was further stirred for another 1 h until entire reduction of the metal salts was achieved the dark greyish solid obtained was washed three times with distilled water to get rid of impurities the cs fe ag nanocomposite was dried at 100 c for 4 h and stored in a plastic sample bottle under dry conditions for characterization 2 3 synthesis of fecore agshell nanoparticles the nanoparticles were prepared as described by olajire and mohammed 42 the fecore agshell nanoparticles were synthesized by mixing 40 ml of the 1 mm each of the aqueous solutions of agno3 and feso4 7h2o with magnetic stirring this is followed by addition of 20 ml of alchornea laxiflora aqueous leaf extract to the mixture the mixture was heated at 100 c in a covered conical flask to prevent evaporation for 5 h on a hot plate the color of the solution changes with increasing temperature indicating the formation of fecore agshell nanoparticles the nanoparticles were dispersed in liquids by centrifuging at 2000 rpm for 30 min and then purified by repeated centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 15 min the impurities were removed by washing the pellets of the nanoparticles with distilled water the purified fecore agshell nanoparticles were subjected to characterization studies 2 4 characterization uv vis spectra were recorded with a b uv1800c spectrophotometer biobase corp china operating in the wavelength range 200 700 nm fourier transform infrared ftir analyses were carried out using m 530 infrared spectrophotometer buck scientific corp usa in the range 400 4000 cm 1 region x ray diffraction xrd analysis was done to evaluate the crystallinity of the samples using miniflex benchtop x ray diffratometer rigaku corp japan operated with cu ka as a source and k α radiation was maintained at 1 54060 å the xrd data were recorded at 2θ values between 10 and 40 in continuous mode the crystallinity index cri was determined using the following equation 43 1 c r i i 110 i a m i 110 x 100 where i 110 is the maximum intensity of the 110 diffraction peak at 2θ 25 and i a m is that of the amorphous diffraction signal at 2θ 14 the surface morphology was examined by sem instrument sem model phenom prox phenom world einhoven the netherlands before examination chitosan sample was coated with 5 nm of gold by a sputter coater quorum technologies model q150r thereafter it was taken to the chamber of sem machine where it was viewed via navcam for focusing and little adjustment 2 5 wastewater sampling five liters of wastewater samples were collected in 20 l capacity container at three different locations of the effluent treatment facilities of the nestle nig plc agbara ogun state the wastewater samples were stored at 4 0 2 c for a period of 48 h after collection the wastewater from the different locations were mixed together in a container of 50 l capacity and kept at 4 0 2 c until analysis 2 6 preparation of chitosan solution chitosan solution was prepared by placing 100 mg of chitosan in a glass beaker and mixed with 1 g acetic acid and stirred for 1 h to completely dissolve the chitosan powder the solution was diluted to 100 ml with deionized distilled water to obtain 1 mg ml or 1000 mg l stock solution of chitosan 2 7 coagulation flocculation process coagulation flocculation of the wastewater was carried out in the laboratory using a jar test apparatus the ph of 50 ml wastewater was adjusted to ph 5 5 by adding hcl or naoh solution and the wastewater was introduced into 1 l capacity glass vessel after adding the desired amount of chitosan the beakers were agitated at high and slow speed comprising of 120 rpm for 10 min and 30 rpm for 40 min respectively with settling time of 30 min finally supernatant was withdrawn for turbidity measurement all tests were carried out at ambient temperature of 25 2 c the study was conducted by varying a few experimental parameters including chitosan dosage 10 60 mg l ph 2 10 and contact time 10 60 min in order to study their effects on turbidity and to obtain optimum conditions for the determination of quality parameters of the wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv visible analysis the bioreduction of fe2 ag ion mixture within the chitosan cs matrix and formation of cs fe ag nanocomposite on addition of aqueous solution of alchornea laxiflora leaf extract were monitored with uv visible spectroscopy and visual inspection of the color changes fig 1 an off white color was obtained on addition of aqueous solution of the salt mixture fe2 ag to the chitosan solution fig 1a which then turned to dark white after stirring for 2 h fig 1b and the final dark grey color was obtained on dropwise addition of the aqueous leaf extract of a laxiflora fig 1c the dark whitish color obtained after stirring for 2 h fig 1b represents the first stage of iron sulfate silver nitrate reduction reaction which dissociated into fe2 s o 4 2 ag and n o 3 ions then with the dropwise addition of the aqueous leaf extract a dark grey color was formed due to the formation of fecore agshell nanoparticles nps within the chitosan polymer matrix which is also acting as stabilizing agent 44 chitosan contributed the steric hindrance to stabilize the nanoparticles as shown in fig 2 however the presence of the amino group in the polycationic structure of chitosan activates the steric hindrance to ensure strong stability over a long period 45 the bio reduction of mixed fe and ag ions in aqueous solution was monitored by measuring uv vis spectra the uv vis spectral analysis was done at a wavelength range of 200 700 nm to study the absorption spectrum of as synthesized fecore agshell nps fig 3 a and the absorption peaks were observed at 308 376 nm ranges due to the excitation of surface plasmon vibrations in fe nps 308 358 and ag nps 376 nm as previously reported 5 the interaction between the two metals might probably accounts for the hypsochromic blue shift of the spr position of agshell nps from the expected 420 nm 376 nm the pure cs gave absorption bands at wavelength range of 204 296 nm fig 3 b which are similitude to the absorption bands observed in the cs fe ag nanocomposite with slight hypsochromic shift of some absorption bands however cs fe ag nanocomposite gave additional absorption bands at wavelength range of 304 360 nm which also indicate the formation of fecore agshell nps within the chitosan polymer matrix that led to the hypsochromic shift of the spr of agshell nps from the usual wavelength of 420 nm 360 nm 3 2 ftir analysis the ftir spectrum fig 4 a of the fecore agshell nps shows peaks at 3817 and 3055 cm 1 which can be respectively ascribed to the free o h or n h and c h or c n stretching vibrations of aromatic compound the peaks at 1673 and 1090 cm 1 can be attributed to co conjugated stretching and c o stretching vibration of aromatic compound respectively the ftir spectra of pure cs fig 4 b show n h stretching at 3577 cm 1 o h stretching at 3450 cm 1 c h stretching at 3001 cm 1 the co amide 1 stretching vibration occurs at 1735 cm 1 and n h stretch amide ii occurs at 1657 cm 1 the band at 1735 cm 1 indicates the presence of carboxylic acids chitosan lactate belonging to the ester of carboxylic group of oligo lactic acid existing as free or side chain 46 the n h angular deformation in conh plane occurs at 1468 and 1388 cm 1 while the c o c band stretching occurs at 1079 cm 1 the out of plane oop bending o h vibrations were observed at 898 cm 1 all the vibrational frequencies agree closely with the studies of saraswathy et al 47 and wazed et al 48 the shifts observed in the absorption peaks of pure cs on the ftir spectra of cs fe ag nanocomposite fig 4b could be attributed to the interaction of fecore agshell and cs in the nanocomposite the strong broad bands at 3619 and 3591 cm 1 are characteristic of n h and o h stretching vibrations respectively the other noticeable changes are the shift in the absorption peaks of the co amide 1 stretching vibration from 1735 cm 1 in pure cs to 1710 cm 1 in cs fe ag nanocomposite and complete disappearance of n h stretch amide ii that occurred at 1657 cm 1 in pure cs the new peaks at 626 cm 1 in the ftir spectra of cs fe ag nanocomposite could be ascribed to ag o stretching vibration 49 50 however the absence of peak at 263 cm 1 indicates the absence of fe n or ag n bond 49 therefore these observations further supported the interaction of the fecore agshell nanoparticles with the o h or c o functional groups of the chitosan molecules 3 3 xrd analysis the crystalline nature of the as synthesized fecore agshell nps was investigated with xrd analysis fig 5 a the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 38 11 44 29 and 64 5 corresponding to hkl values 111 200 and 220 miller indices respectively have been identified to be attributed to ag nps these indices depict the face centred cubic fcc structure of ag nps jcpds file no 04 0783 the peak at 2θ value of 44 29 indicates the presence of zero valent iron 51 52 however the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 21 7 and 34 25 were attributed to iron hydroxides feooh and magnetite fe3o4 respectively jcpds card no 01 1030 39 the crystallite size of fecore agshell nps d was calculated using the debye scherrer s equation eqn 2 53 as follows 2 d k λ β c o s θ where k is the shape dependent scherrer s constant 0 98 λ is the wavelength of radiation 0 15406 nm used for the xrd analysis β is the full peak width at half maximum fwhm of the peak and θ is the bragg s diffraction angle table 1 the crystallite size was estimated as 66 3 nm the pure cs and the cs fe ag nanocomposite have two crystalline peaks at 14 and 25 2 corresponding to the crystallographic planes of 020 and 110 respectively the higher angles obtained for these crystallographic planes than the usual two crystalline peaks of chitosan at 2θ of 9 and 20 reported in the literature for planes 020 and 110 respectively might be due to the degree of n deacetylation of chitosan 54 or the source of chitin 55 56 the incorporation of fecore agshell nps into the chitosan lowers the crystallinity index cri of chitosan from 84 8 to 70 2 which thus leads to higher adsorption ability of cs fe ag nanocomposite than pure cs 57 the peaks at near 2θ 30 observed for both pure cs and cs fe ag nanocomposite might be an indication of the presence of some inorganic materials that are left behind in the chitosan sample 58 the cs fe ag nanocomposite also registered many additional peaks fig 5 b which are similitude to peaks observed in the xrd of the fecore agshell nps the estimated crystallite size of cs fe ag nanocomposite is 14 7 nm lower than the crystallite size of fe ag nps 3 4 scanning electron microscope sem the surface morphologies of the fecore agshell nps pure cs and cs fe ag nanocomposite were investigated with scanning electron microscopy sem the sem of fecore agshell fig 6 a revealed monodispersed particles with an almost uniform size the sem of pure cs fig 6b shows rough and heterogeneous surface the sem image of cs fe ag nanocomposite revealed a mixture of pure cs and fe ag nps wherein the iron silver bimetallic nanoparticles were believed to be embedded in the pure cs polymer matrix in a restricted nano range 59 however the nanocomposite was also found to be less agglomerated probably as a result of the presence of chitosan acting as stabilizing agent the non uniformity of the bimetallic nanoparticles in chitosan polymer matrix is also observed in the sem micrographs of the cs fe ag nanocomposite 3 5 effect of chitosan dosage it is crucial to determine the optimum dosage of chitosan for its performance in coagulation flocculation process as overdosing or under dosing could lead to poor performance of the process the effect of dosage on turbidity of 50 ml of wastewater at ph 5 was conducted at 120 rpm for 10 min and slowly at 30 rpm for 40 min under the settling time of 30 min for a range of chitosan dosage that spans from 10 mg l to 60 mg l the results were presented in fig 7 showing the effects of chitosan dosage on percent reduction in turbidity levels for both pure cs and cs fe ag nanocomposite it is evident from the figure that 72 and 84 5 turbidity removals were obtained for cs and cs fe ag nanocomposite respectively at dosage concentration of 40 mg l which could be due to high charge density phenomenon that assisted in rapid destabilization of particles at moderately low chitosan dosage 60 the percent turbidity reduction then decreased more with pure cs than cs fe ag nanocomposite when the concentration exceeded 40 mg l this could be attributed to filling of colloidal surfaces of suspended particles with adsorbents during dispersive process and the excess chitosan has tendency to destroy the polymer bridging between the suspended particles which then remained floated leading to increase in the residual turbidity of the wastewater and decreases the percent reduction in turbidity levels 3 5 1 effect of ph the percentage turbidity level reduction with 50 ml of wastewater using chitosan dosage of 40 mg l was conducted at 120 rpm for 10 min and slowly at 30 rpm for 40 min under the settling time of 30 min for ph value of wastewater that ranges from 2 to 10 and adjusted with dilute hcl or naoh solution the coagulants provide the best results of turbidity level reduction in slightly acidic environment ph 5 6 with optimum turbidity reduction levels of 67 2 and 85 1 for pure cs and cs fe ag nanocomposite fig 8 the turbidity reduction level is decreased when the ph values is higher than 8 which is consistent with rizzo et al 61 this observation could be due to reduction in positive charges on the chitosan surface as ph increases and thus lowers the attraction of the negatively charged suspended particles or reverse the particle charge and re stabilize them 62 thereby increases the turbidity of wastewater see fig 9 3 5 2 effect of contact time the effect of agitation time in minutes with 50 ml wastewater at ph 5 and chitosan dosage of 40 mg l was investigated at 120 rpm for 10 min and slowly at 30 rpm for 40 min under the settling time of 30 min for the agitation time that ranges from 10 to 60 min the result showed that 65 and 85 of turbidity reductions for pure cs and cs fe ag nanocomposite respectively were achieved in 30 min due to a higher collision between coagulant and suspended particles that leads to formation of dense flocs that settled within the settling period there was no observed change in the removal percentage of turbidity reduction level after 30 min and this could be due to the formation of small flocs that are not dense enough to settle in the wastewater which indirectly cause the sample to remain turbid 63 3 5 3 wastewater treatment process the quality parameters of the wastewater at optimum conditions were examined for bod5 tds and cod removal using pure cs and cs fe ag nanocomposite the result is as presented in fig 10 the cs fe ag nanocomposite was found to be more effective with removal of 48 7 of bod 15 5 of cod and 54 9 tds than pure cs with 25 5 of bod 3 6 of cod and 38 9 of tds in the wastewater at the optimum conditions the introduction of fe ag nps into the chitosan matrix improves its crystallinity a characteristic that significantly influence the physical chemical properties of chitosan also impregnation of fecore agshell nps into the cs surface combines the synergistic effects of strong antibacterial properties of ag nps oxidation properties of fe nps and properties of cs to enhance the performance of cs fe ag nanocomposite in improving the quality parameters of the wastewater 4 conclusion fecore agshell nps and cs fe ag nanocomposites were synthesized using simple green synthetic method the observed shifts in the peaks of pure cs and the hypsochromic shift in the spr wavelength of ag nps on the ftir spectrum of cs fe ag nanocomposite indicate the formation of cs fe ag nanocomposites the xrd patterns of the cs fe ag nanocomposite show the presence of cs fe and ag nps the reduction in the crystallite size of fe ag nps from 66 3 nm to 14 7 nm in the cs fe ag nanocomposite was ascribed to the presence of chitosan acting as a stabilizer to reduce the agglomeration rate of the nanocomposite synthesized it is clear from the characterization studies that the cs fe ag nanocomposite has been successfully synthesized the research also highlights the practicability and efficiency of the synthesized cs fe ag nanocomposite as a coagulant for the removal of bod cod turbidity and tds in industrial wastewater hence cs fe ag could be applied as natural coagulant aid in effluent treatment plant etp used for wastewater treatment with lowest risks of organic release and can serve as best substitute

wastewater was studied to determine optimum conditions for the determination of water quality parameters the cs fe ag nanocomposite gave higher maximum removals of bod 48 7 cod 15 5 and tds 54 9 than pure cs with bod 25 5 cod 3 6 and tds 38 9 at optimum conditions keywords chitosan iron silver nanoparticles chitosan iron silver nanocomposite wastewater treatment 1 introduction the nanotechnology is aimed at producing nanostructures or nano arrays with unique properties that always put them in good stead over their bulk or single particle types various physical and chemical methods 1 3 have been developed for the synthesis of nanoparticles where most of them are either expensive or use chemicals that are harmful to the environment the increasing concern on how to reduce or eliminate the use of environmental threatening substances in compliance with green chemistry principles 4 has necessitated the need for the development of novel green syntheses that are inexpensive and non hazardous 5 7 bimetallic nanoparticles have attracted the interest of scientists for use in a wide range of catalytic and electrocatalytic applications over their monometallic metals due to the synergistic relationship that exists between the two metals 6 8 9 chitosan cs poly β 1 4 2 amino 2 deoxy d glucopyranose is a natural cationic cellulose biopolymer of high molecular weight obtained from deacetylation of chitin and is abundant in chitinous material chitosan cs is a non toxic biocompatible inexpensive hydrophilic and biodegradable polymer 10 12 the excellent adsorptive capacity of highly reactive amino and carboxyl groups in chitosan molecular structure 13 15 has paved way for their utilization as an adsorbent and as a flocculent in the field of water and wastewater treatment 16 18 chitosan also possesses antibacterial properties 19 21 the adsorptive capacity and antibacterial activity can be enhanced by combining chitosan with other metal nanoparticles most especially bimetallic nanoparticles such as fecore agshell nanoparticles the environmental issues related to the consequences of anthropogenic impact on the environment are given adequate attention because of the alarming increase in the degree of pollution of aquatic media these contaminants are hazardous to humans and earth s ecosystem thus various methods have been reported to address challenges of water pollution in recent times 22 27 adsorption has been ranked as the best approach amongst various methods of wastewater treatment because of its simplicity of implementation cost effectiveness and high process efficiency 25 28 30 the current state of anthropogenic pollution of fresh water ecosystem by discharge of untreated industrial wastewaters into the seas and lagoon is worrisome and most of the existing adsorbent materials are not capable of purifying industrial wastewaters to the required concentration of harmful impurities therefore it is sacrosanct to use novel material that have been modified with nanoparticles to enhance adsorption and oxidative activity the nanoparticles are gaining ground in water management system via adsorption method 27 31 34 and research activities are aimed at synthesizing nanostructure sorbent materials having adsorption and oxidative activity that are several times greater than the conventional adsorbents such as activated carbon zeolites clays etc used in the industry 25 26 29 30 also despite the promising features of the newly developed nanostructure sorbent materials a systematic investigation into their synthetic routes is scanty chitosan based nanoparticles using metal nanoparticles such as ag 35 36 zno 37 38 fe 39 40 and ago 41 have been reported for water treatment however all the above mentioned papers used monometallic nanoparticles to modify chitosan and model wastewaters containing specific concentration of a target pollutant which does not represent a real industrial wastewater where the presence of other polluting substances might affect the adsorptive capacity of the chitosan based nanoparticles to advance knowledge in the synthesis of nanostructure sorbent for use in wastewater treatment and to evaluate their performance in real wastewater sample the pure chitosan cs was modified with bimetallic fecore agshell nanoparticles to form cs fe ag nanocomposite through the green approach the prepared adsorbent was then used for the removal of bod cod tds and turbidity in wastewater sample collected from nestle food processing industry in a coagulation flocculation process the impregnation of fecore agshell into the cs surface will combine the synergistic effects of fecore agshell and cs to exceedingly enhance the performance cs fe ag nanocomposite for wastewater treatment the effects of chitosan dosage ph and settling time were considered to determine the optimum conditions to achieve the best performance for cs fe ag nanocomposite in the treatment of wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents powder chitosan lactate halo klear dg5100 85 deacetylated was purchased from dober chemical corp usa silver nitrate and iron sulfate salts were purchased from emsure and qualikems respectively acetic acid was of analytical grade from british petrochemicals uk while the leaf of alchornea laxiflora was obtained from the university campus all reagents were used without further treatments 2 2 synthesis of the cs fe ag nanocomposite the nanocomposite was synthesized as described by govindan et al 36 typically 0 5 g of the pure cs powder was dissolved in 100 ml of 1 acetic acid and the solution was vortexed to aid complete dissolution and then centrifuged for 2 h at 150 rpm to this solution 0 5 g each of feso4 7h2o and agno3 salts was added and the solution was stirred for 2 h then freshly prepared alchornea laxiflora leaf extract broth was added dropwise to this mixture where a dark grey precipitate was observed with gas evolution the mixture was further stirred for another 1 h until entire reduction of the metal salts was achieved the dark greyish solid obtained was washed three times with distilled water to get rid of impurities the cs fe ag nanocomposite was dried at 100 c for 4 h and stored in a plastic sample bottle under dry conditions for characterization 2 3 synthesis of fecore agshell nanoparticles the nanoparticles were prepared as described by olajire and mohammed 42 the fecore agshell nanoparticles were synthesized by mixing 40 ml of the 1 mm each of the aqueous solutions of agno3 and feso4 7h2o with magnetic stirring this is followed by addition of 20 ml of alchornea laxiflora aqueous leaf extract to the mixture the mixture was heated at 100 c in a covered conical flask to prevent evaporation for 5 h on a hot plate the color of the solution changes with increasing temperature indicating the formation of fecore agshell nanoparticles the nanoparticles were dispersed in liquids by centrifuging at 2000 rpm for 30 min and then purified by repeated centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 15 min the impurities were removed by washing the pellets of the nanoparticles with distilled water the purified fecore agshell nanoparticles were subjected to characterization studies 2 4 characterization uv vis spectra were recorded with a b uv1800c spectrophotometer biobase corp china operating in the wavelength range 200 700 nm fourier

the suspended particles which then remained floated leading to increase in the residual turbidity of the wastewater and decreases the percent reduction in turbidity levels 3 5 1 effect of ph the percentage turbidity level reduction with 50 ml of wastewater using chitosan dosage of 40 mg l was conducted at 120 rpm for 10 min and slowly at 30 rpm for 40 min under the settling time of 30 min for ph value of wastewater that ranges from 2 to 10 and adjusted with dilute hcl or naoh solution the coagulants provide the best results of turbidity level reduction in slightly acidic environment ph 5 6 with optimum turbidity reduction levels of 67 2 and 85 1 for pure cs and cs fe ag nanocomposite fig 8 the turbidity reduction level is decreased when the ph values is higher than 8 which is consistent with rizzo et al 61 this observation could be due to reduction in positive charges on the chitosan surface as ph increases and thus lowers the attraction of the negatively charged suspended particles or reverse the particle charge and re stabilize them 62 thereby increases the turbidity of wastewater see fig 9 3 5 2 effect of contact time the effect of agitation time in minutes with 50 ml wastewater at ph 5 and chitosan dosage of 40 mg l was investigated at 120 rpm for 10 min and slowly at 30 rpm for 40 min under the settling time of 30 min for the agitation time that ranges from 10 to 60 min the result showed that 65 and 85 of turbidity reductions for pure cs and cs fe ag nanocomposite respectively were achieved in 30 min due to a higher collision between coagulant and suspended particles that leads to formation of dense flocs that settled within the settling period there was no observed change in the removal percentage of turbidity reduction level after 30 min and this could be due to the formation of small flocs that are not dense enough to settle in the wastewater which indirectly cause the sample to remain turbid 63 3 5 3 wastewater treatment process the quality parameters of the wastewater at optimum conditions were examined for bod5 tds and cod removal using pure cs and cs fe ag nanocomposite the result is as presented in fig 10 the cs fe ag nanocomposite was found to be more effective with removal of 48 7 of bod 15 5 of cod and 54 9 tds than pure cs with 25 5 of bod 3 6 of cod and 38 9 of tds in the wastewater at the optimum conditions the introduction of fe ag nps into the chitosan matrix improves its crystallinity a characteristic that significantly influence the physical chemical properties of chitosan also impregnation of fecore agshell nps into the cs surface combines the synergistic effects of strong antibacterial properties of ag nps oxidation properties of fe nps and properties of cs to enhance the performance of cs fe ag nanocomposite in improving the quality parameters of the wastewater 4 conclusion fecore agshell nps and cs fe ag nanocomposites were synthesized using simple green synthetic method the observed shifts in the peaks of pure cs and the hypsochromic shift in the spr wavelength of ag nps on the ftir spectrum of cs fe ag nanocomposite indicate the formation of cs fe ag nanocomposites the xrd patterns of the cs fe ag nanocomposite show the presence of cs fe and ag nps the reduction in the crystallite size of fe ag nps from 66 3 nm to 14 7 nm in the cs fe ag nanocomposite was ascribed to the presence of chitosan acting as a stabilizer to reduce the agglomeration rate of the nanocomposite synthesized it is clear from the characterization studies that the cs fe ag nanocomposite has been successfully synthesized the research also highlights the practicability and efficiency of the synthesized cs fe ag nanocomposite as a coagulant for the removal of bod cod turbidity and tds in industrial wastewater hence cs fe ag could be applied as natural coagulant aid in effluent treatment plant etp used for wastewater treatment with lowest risks of organic release and can serve as best substitute to conventional synthetic polyelectrolyte used in etp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

8777,road construction has a negative environmental impact on the surrounding aquatic environment requiring the continuous monitoring of surface water quality here optimization of the water quality monitoring network wqmn is an essential step in supporting the sustainable development of road construction projects this study introduces gamma test theory gtt as a practical method for optimizing the wqmn of surface waters during road construction the water quality index wqi was computed in 48 monitoring stations for six monitoring periods from 2017 to 2019 data was acquired from a primary monitoring network over a new highway in southern norway based on the results it is possible to reduce the number of stations by 23 in comparison with the original empirical network the proposed method could be useful to design the monitoring networks of projects with limited construction time and budget as well as projects lacking enough data keywords gamma test theory water quality surface water monitoring network water quality index optimization sustainable development 1 introduction one of the most important challenges of road construction projects is waste discharge due to various construction works which negatively affects the physical chemical and biological quality of receiving surface water bodies in addition it may pose serious health and safety risks to consumers 1 over the course of a road construction project the volume and quality of the waste discharge and its impacts on surface water bodies vary spatiotemporally due to road construction works as well as the weather conditions in the catchment and construction areas therefore the right design of a water quality monitoring network wqmn is needed to provide useful input on spatial temporal variations of surface water quality during construction projects this may support decision makers in terms of managing the health risks of stakeholders self purification capacity of the environment and implementation of remedial policies 2 5 unfortunately the optimal design of wqmn is a complicated process firstly the uneven distribution of monitoring stations or their insufficient number provides a limited understanding of the surface water system of the study area 6 on the other hand if the number of monitoring stations is too large additional information may be obtained making the monitoring network costly and inefficient 6 in road construction projects sometimes after a long monitoring period and spending a lot of time and money it becomes clear that the number of monitoring stations is large and consequently a lot of money has been wasted in addition to this the number of stations is insufficient and the collected information gives a rudimentary understanding of the environmental impact of the construction works therefore finding a method to determine the optimal number and location of stations after the first monitoring period gives valuable assistance to local authorities in managing the costs and environment the primary point for optimization of wqmn is designing a network with the maximum possible number of monitoring stations by empirical 7 statistical 4 and ranking methods 8 for empirical methods the wqmn is designed based on technical knowledge the location of main streams and tributaries and the distribution of pollution sources 9 while for statistical methods different design scenarios are considered by assessing the ratio of explained data through the selected wqmn to the spatiotemporal variations of the water quality in the monitored catchment 10 finally for ranking methods the zoning layer of effective parameters in surface water quality is developed and by weighing each layer and combining them a monitoring priority map is then drawn 3 after the initial design of the monitoring stations the surface water quality is monitored for several periods and the monitoring network is then optimized using several methods such as fuzzy clustering 8 11 12 genetic algorithms 13 16 multi objective discrete particle swarm optimization 17 the value of information 18 20 entropy 20 23 optimal partition analysis 24 and strategic decision analysis 25 however there is evidence that most of the proposed methods are incapable to determine the optimal number of monitoring stations and consequently this number is often selected empirically or based on available data and related design limitations e g project budget and the value of provided data 15 25 furthermore few studies have determined the optimal number of monitoring stations in which the optimization process has been conducted using data of whole monitoring periods after the completion of the project 20 in this condition the results are less feasible to be applied since the authorities realize that the monitoring network presents issues once the project has been completed and there is no way back to improve the monitoring network and data collection to solve these problems and determine the optimal number and location of monitoring stations after the first monitoring period this paper presents the idea to apply gamma test theory gtt which is a nonlinear modeling tool that can be used to determine the minimum set of data needed to create a smooth model lacking in any knowledge of the equations that describes the phenomenon 26 28 gtt was first introduced by ref 29 and it was examined and used in more detail years later by ref 30 this study evaluates the ability of gtt to determine the optimal number and location of surface water monitoring stations in a construction project for this purpose the proposed method was applied to optimize a wqmn after the first monitoring period in the construction project of the arendal tvedestrand highway in norway the construction of this highway took about three years from 2017 to 2019 over this time 28 physical chemical and biological parameters were monitored every four months at 48 stations in the catchment area of this highway then the water quality index wqi was computed for each station and monitoring period subsequently gtt was applied to determine the optimal surface water monitoring network using the data of the first monitoring period finally the proposed optimal monitoring network was systematically verified using the data from the second to the sixth monitoring period the paper also contributes to addressing the knowledge gap in finding an optimal monitoring network for short and mid term projects in the shortest possible time via gtt 2 methods the proposed methodology consists of two main steps i determining the wqi in all stations based on the existing network generating the required data for the second step and ii optimizing the number and location of monitoring stations in different periods based on gtt 2 1 data collection in the first step qualitative information of surface water along the road construction site was collected fig 1 illustrates the location of the construction site which is a new 22 km long section of the arendal tvedestrand highway in norway the drainage area of the highway ca 7180 ha consists of seven catchment areas including storelva 1 vennevann 2 langangselva 3 sagene 4 mørfjær 5 songebekken 6 and longum barbu 7 fig 1 also indicates the main and side streams of different catchments and their connections with the road various road construction works including area cleaning blasting drilling water management asphalting culvert work and bridge construction were carried out during the three years of construction between 2017 and 2019 considering the requirements of the department of environment county governor of aust agder norway and based on the type of activities in different parts of the road the surface water quality was monitored over different periods of the project accordingly six time periods of one month each at four month intervals were considered during the construction phase from 2017 to 2019 the first period i e 4 2017 included preparation and mobilization steps most of the construction works were initiated from the second period i e 10 2017 and by then as the project progressed one month periods of monitoring continued which were separated by four month periods i e 2 2018 6 2018 10 2018 2 2019 different qualitative parameters including physical properties total suspended solids tss turbidity

ba pb cd cu co mn hg cr ni and zn were monitored at 48 stations in the catchment area of the highway the monitoring stations in the primary wqmn see fig 1 were established based on the catchment topography the direction of main and side streams and experts experiences for evaluating the spatiotemporal variation in surface water quality during road construction 2 2 water quality index the wqi is a management tool that makes a reasonable interpretation to assess water quality based on qualitative data 20 in this study the relative weighting method was applied to calculate the wqi in each station and monitoring period herein the quantity rating scale q i was calculated according to eq 1 for all parameters except for ph which was determined by eq 2 31 32 as follows 1 q i c i s i 2 q i p h c i 7 s i 7 where c i represents the measured value for each parameter and s i corresponds to the maximum acceptable limit of each parameter the value of s i for all 28 parameters applied in this study table 1 was determined based on the who guidelines for drinking water 2017 50 51 together with the regulations of water quality for the construction phase of the arendal tvedestrand highway established by department of environment county governor of aust agder norway then a normalized weight ranged from 1 to 4 for the lowest and highest negative impacts on water quality is assigned to each parameter based on experts opinions in this study the normalized weight of each parameter was collected from various studies and the average of the collected values w i was assigned as the normalized weight for each parameter see table 1 afterward the relative weight of each parameter w i as reported in the last column of table 1 was calculated according to eq 3 3 w i w i i 1 28 w i 100 as observed in table 1 specific parameters such as as pb and cr with the relative weight of 5 3 followed by cu and ni 5 and 4 9 respectively present the highest importance while total p zn and mg2 1 2 1 4 and 1 5 respectively have minor importance in water quality importantly it is extremely needed to consider the negative effects of heavy metals with greater impact than other parameters in water quality calculations lastly the wqi was calculated according to eq 4 4 w q i i 1 28 w i q i in principle the larger the wqi value the lower the water quality to determine the significance of the difference among the calculated wqi data in two different monitoring periods the probability distribution of the wqi data in each monitoring period must be first determined using the kolmogorov smirnov test k s test 52 53 if the data are normally distributed the paired t test can be used for specifying the significance of the difference among the wqi data in two periods 54 otherwise data distribution must be normalized using transformation functions 2 3 gamma test theory gtt is a statistical method of analysis used to specify three critical issues before developing a model this method implies the following steps 1 the adequacy of datasets to develop a causal model 2 the maximum reachable accuracy of a smooth model to estimate a dependent variable and 3 the best and minimum datasets applicable for training a model 55 56 in this method it is supposed that if the two points are close together in the input space their outputs should be close in the output space unless they contain noise for gtt data analysis is conducted based on the calculation of a statistic number named gamma therefore for each vector of independent variables i e x i 1 i m and scalar of the dependent variable y i the nearest k t h neighbor for x i i e x n i k must be determined then the delta δ and gamma γ functions are calculated according to eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 δ k 1 m i 1 m x n i k x i 2 1 k p 6 γ k 1 2 m i 1 m y n i k y i 2 1 k p where represents the euclidean distance m is the number of datasets and y n i k is the y value corresponding to x n i k and i is the index of observations in the previous equations it is suggested to consider 10 p 20 55 57 after that a linear regression line γ a δ g t which provides useful input about the datasets before developing a model is fitted to the p points of δ k γ k the slope of the regression line a indicates the complexity of the relationship between dependent and independent variables the higher the a value the greater the complexity 55 58 furthermore the intercept of the regression line δ 0 which is equal to the gamma statistic g t shows the maximum reachable accuracy by smooth modeling tools the higher the gt value the weaker the modeling performance which is mainly due to 1 much noise in measured data 2 a low number of datasets and 3 the low number of independent variables in the model 59 in theory increasing the m in modeling leads to a rise in the degree of reliability however increasing the m above the minimum number does not increase the modeling accuracy 55 56 m test as a gtt tool determines the minimum required number of training datasets m m i n in a given order of datasets to develop a model with maximum reachable accuracy directly from the dataset 55 56 for this purpose gt is computed for an increasing number of datasets and gt is then plotted against the number of datasets as the number of datasets reaches the m m i n the graph is stabilized to an asymptote 60 the moving window test mw test is another tool in gtt which indicates the variation of gt value for different subsets of the datasets displaying the same size 61 in mw test a virtual window with the length of m m i n is moved along the datasets with a special order and the g t value is computed for the datasets in the window here the datasets with the lowest g t value are selected as the best training set for modeling 61 2 4 optimization of the surface water monitoring network using gtt the surface water quality monitoring network can be substantially optimized using gtt for this the minimum and the best required number of monitoring stations or datasets is specified using m and mw tests however the results strongly depend on the order of datasets while evaluating all possible permutations of orders is extremely complicated and time consuming interestingly a gtt based optimization algorithm proposed by ref 62 see fig 2 was applied to optimize the number and location of monitoring stations the algorithm consisted of seven major steps initially the total datasets are randomized to create a random order of datasets in the second step m m i n is determined by the m test tool then the mw test is conducted with the m m i n to specify a group of datasets with the least g t value in the fourth step the specified group is located at the beginning of the rest of the datasets after that steps 2 to 4 are repeated to put the minimum number of stations m min with the lowest value of g t at the beginning of the total datasets this process is repeated several times by randomizing the datasets and changing the initial order of the datasets lastly the group of datasets with the lowest number and g t value is selected as the optimal group in this study a gtt based optimization algorithm was applied to optimize the number and location of surface water monitoring stations during the construction of the 22 km long highway in southern norway the latitude and longitude of stations were considered as independent variables while wqi was the dependent variable 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality index from different stations as mentioned previously the wqi was calculated based on 28 qualitative parameters of surface water at 48 monitoring stations in the catchment area of the arendal tvedestrand highway for six monitoring periods over the highway construction project wqi presents spatiotemporal variations depending on the type of construction works the maximum value of wqi ca 1259 was recorded on 10 2017 at station 4 5 due to the explosions for tunneling due to construction works in the vicinity of this station the concentration of tn tss mn and ec in surface water increased by 200 000 μg l 86 mg l 600 μg l and 161 ms cm respectively table 2 reports the maximum minimum mean wqi values and coefficient of variation cv for all calculated wqis in each monitoring period the cv which is the ratio of the standard deviation of the mean defines the degree of variation of two or more data series as reported in table 2 the highest average value ca 99 3 and degree of variation of 187 9 were recorded in the second period i e 10 2017 indicating that this period had the highest range of variation in wqi and created the highest average pollution load to receiving streams compared to the other periods table 3 presents the water classification based on wqi and the wqi classification for different water samples in six monitoring periods by comparing the data reported in tables 2 and 3 it becomes clear that during the road construction process the average water quality in all monitoring periods was found as good while in the second monitoring period the average water quality was close to the poor category during this period two monitoring stations had very polluted quality which led to an increase in the average wqi throughout the second period in addition the number of stations with excellent water quality was 21 which was the lowest in all periods compared to all monitoring periods surface water in the first monitoring period had the best quality which means the water from 30 monitoring stations had excellent quality in the sixth monitoring period which was related to the activities at the end of the project the water quality in most of the stations was mostly rated from good to excellent indicating a decrease in road construction works the paired t test is used to evaluate the statistical significance of the difference between two related data series unfortunately this test is limited to data with a normal distribution therefore in this study the normality of the wqi data of the six monitoring periods was first checked by means of k s test the results indicated that the wqi data did not have a normal distribution as a consequence a logarithmic transformation was applied to the wqi data to convert their distribution to a normal distribution once again the k s test was conducted for instance table 4 reports the results of the k s test coming from the logarithmic transformed wqi data in the six monitoring periods it was observed that the sig parameter values from the first to sixth monitoring periods were 0 15 0 13 0 16 0 27 0 06 and 0 32 respectively since all these values are higher than 0 05 the logarithmic transformed wqi data possess normal distribution at a significant level of 0 05 table 4 presents the mean standard deviation and k s z parameters of the logarithmic transformed wqi data for the six monitoring periods the statistical significance and sig parameter values were determined by comparing k s z with standard values since the transformed wqi data in the six monitoring periods had a normal distribution the paired t test was then used to determine the statistical significance of the difference as shown in table 5 if the sig parameter value is greater than 0 05 the difference between the two data series will be insignificant according to table 5 there are significant differences between the first and second second and third and third and fourth monitoring periods while the differences between the fourth and fifth and fifth and sixth periods are insignificant from april 2017 to june 2018 there were several changes in road construction works leading to significant differences in surface water quality in contrast during the fourth fifth and sixth monitoring periods from june 2018 to february 2019 different construction works did not show any significant difference in surface water quality table 5 also presents the mean d standard deviation sd and standard error means s d of the paired differences as well as t statistic d s d and degree of freedom i e number of data series minus one sig parameter of the paired t test was determined by comparing the calculated t statistic with standard t value to 47 degrees of freedom fig 3 illustrates the spatiotemporal variation of wqi during the six monitoring periods 3 2 determination of the optimal wqmn using gtt to achieve the optimal wqmn with the best spatial distribution using the minimum amount of available data wqi data in the first monitoring period i e 4 2017 was analyzed first 48 datasets including latitude and longitude of stations as independent variables and wqi as a dependent variable were amassed then gtt was conducted on the datasets fig 4 shows the scatter plot and the regression line fitted to the points with coordinates of δ k γ k in the scatter plot the black dots indicate the euclidean distance of each monitoring station from each neighboring station the red dots represent the average euclidean distance of the monitoring stations from the surrounding stations as the neighborhood radius increases the gamma statistic gt is equal to the intercept of the regression line fitted to the red dots δ 0 since the regression line does not present a steep slope creating an expected modeling function is not difficult and does not need a large number of wqi data importantly the scatter plot should have no input data with small x i x j values and large values of y i y j as corresponding output the upper left corner of the δ γ scatter plot since they reflect relatively high intrinsic noise of the data and thus negatively affect developing a smooth model as shown in fig 4 some points are in the upper left corner of the δ γ distribution diagram displaying the noise in wqi data from monitoring stations to find the optimum number and location of monitoring stations m and mw tests were performed on the datasets of the first monitoring period and a group of datasets which could best represent the total condition was placed at the beginning of the total datasets using the proposed method as shown in fig 2 in this way the m test chart tends to be asymptotic faster and the mw test chart rises showing the lowest gt in the initial data fig 5 a displays the gt variation for the best order of data since the gt tends to be asymptotic the number of monitoring stations is more than the optimum number based on figure 5a and 37 stations were selected as the optimum stations to monitor the wqi and hence determine its spatial distribution additionally fig 5b indicates the result of the mw test for 37 monitoring stations based on fig 5a as can be seen the first 37 stations present the lowest gt and consequently they were selected as the optimum monitoring stations as depicted in fig 6 the selection process of the number of monitoring stations and location was performed simultaneously for gtt the optimal number and location of stations resulted from the data analysis of the first monitoring period which must also provide the spatial distribution of wqi with appropriate accuracy in other monitoring periods hence to validate the results m and mw test were conducted on wqi data coming from the selected 37 stations in the other five periods see fig 7 according to fig 7a e gt tends to be asymptotic confirming that the selected number of stations is optimum in all periods and there is no need for more stations by comparing gt and the asymptote location from the different periods it can be concluded that it is possible to have a smaller number of monitoring stations for developing an optimal wqmn however given the m test results in the 6th monitoring period fig 7e at least 37 stations are required to achieve an asymptote in this period therefore after the first monitoring period the initial asymptotic threshold is not necessarily the optimal number of monitoring stations in other periods the application of gtt has not been documented in the literature to determine the optimal monitoring network however 20 successfully applied the transinformation entropy technique and value of information to achieve the optimum surface water quality monitoring network by using the data of multiple monitoring periods in general their selected network consisted of 33 stations that provided the minimum redundant information among stations while maximizing the value of information for the monitoring stations our best results which were obtained using the data of the first monitoring period revealed 37 stations for the monitoring network covering the same stations as reported by ref 20 along with four more stations which are well distributed in all catchment areas 4 conclusions the design and optimization of a surface water quality monitoring network in construction projects is a serious concern of decision makers this becomes even more relevant when it comes to projects with limited time and budget as well as projects with the lack of enough data for the optimal design of a monitoring network the main goal of the current study was to evaluate the ability of gtt in determining the optimal number and location of surface water monitoring stations in a road construction project the proposed method was successfully applied to optimize wqmn after the first monitoring period in the construction project of the arendal tvedestrand highway in norway a primary monitoring network containing 48 stations was established based on the hydrogeological feature of the highway catchment while the surface water quality was monitored in six periods the water quality index wqi calculated based on the 28 physical chemical and biological parameters was used to assess the quality of surface water then the m and mw tests were performed on data coming from the first monitoring period to achieve the optimum number and location of monitoring stations the results reveal that 37 monitoring stations 23 less than the number of stations in the primary wqmn are enough to assess wqi with sufficient accuracy additionally they present an optimal distribution over seven discharge areas the proposed monitoring network was verified using the monitoring data of the next five monitoring periods the results indicated that the optimal number and spatial arrangement of monitoring stations in a road construction project can be determined using the data of one monitoring period in particular some uncertainties such as large changes in the location and type of construction works or variation of precipitation patterns in different periods can make a difference in the results therefore the proposed method is feasible to establish a wqmn in short and mid term construction projects such as road construction tunneling and mining definitely further research must be carried out to establish a basis for gtt in different environmental impact assessment eia projects and design of monitoring networks in urban projects dealing with air pollution quantitative and qualitative quality of surface water groundwater and soil finally this study confirmed that the developed

of the construction site which is a new 22 km long section of the arendal tvedestrand highway in norway the drainage area of the highway ca 7180 ha consists of seven catchment areas including storelva 1 vennevann 2 langangselva 3 sagene 4 mørfjær 5 songebekken 6 and longum barbu 7 fig 1 also indicates the main and side streams of different catchments and their connections with the road various road construction works including area cleaning blasting drilling water management asphalting culvert work and bridge construction were carried out during the three years of construction between 2017 and 2019 considering the requirements of the department of environment county governor of aust agder norway and based on the type of activities in different parts of the road the surface water quality was monitored over different periods of the project accordingly six time periods of one month each at four month intervals were considered during the construction phase from 2017 to 2019 the first period i e 4 2017 included preparation and mobilization steps most of the construction works were initiated from the second period i e 10 2017 and by then as the project progressed one month periods of monitoring continued which were separated by four month periods i e 2 2018 6 2018 10 2018 2 2019 different qualitative parameters including physical properties total suspended solids tss turbidity

ba pb cd cu co mn hg cr ni and zn were monitored at 48 stations in the catchment area of the highway the monitoring stations in the primary wqmn see fig 1 were established based on the catchment topography the direction of main and side streams and experts experiences for evaluating the spatiotemporal variation in surface water quality during road construction 2 2 water quality index the wqi is a management tool that makes a reasonable interpretation to assess water quality based on qualitative data 20 in this study the relative weighting method was applied to calculate the wqi in each station and monitoring period herein the quantity rating scale q i was calculated according to eq 1 for all parameters except for ph which was determined by eq 2 31 32 as follows 1 q i c i s i 2 q i p h c i 7 s i 7 where c i represents the measured value for each parameter and s i corresponds to the maximum acceptable limit of each parameter the value of s i for all 28 parameters applied in this study table 1 was determined based on the who guidelines for drinking water 2017 50 51 together with the regulations of water quality for the construction phase of the arendal tvedestrand highway established by department of environment county governor of aust agder norway then a normalized weight ranged from 1 to 4 for the lowest and highest negative impacts on water quality is assigned to each parameter based on experts opinions in this study the normalized weight of each parameter was collected from various studies and the average of the collected values w i was assigned as the normalized weight for each parameter see table 1 afterward the relative weight of each parameter w i as reported in the last column of table 1 was calculated according to eq 3 3 w i w i i 1 28 w i 100 as observed in table 1 specific parameters such as as pb and cr with the relative weight of 5 3 followed by cu and ni 5 and 4 9 respectively present the highest importance while total p zn and mg2 1 2 1 4 and 1 5 respectively have minor importance in water quality importantly it is extremely needed to consider the negative effects of heavy metals with greater impact than other parameters in water quality calculations lastly the wqi was calculated according to eq 4 4 w q i i 1 28 w i q i in principle the larger the wqi value the lower the water quality to determine the significance of the difference among the calculated wqi data in two different monitoring periods the probability distribution of the wqi data in each monitoring period must be first determined using the kolmogorov smirnov test k s test 52 53 if the data are normally distributed the paired t test can be used for specifying the significance of the difference among the wqi data in two periods 54 otherwise data distribution must be normalized using transformation functions 2 3 gamma test theory gtt is a statistical method of analysis used to specify three critical issues before developing a model this method implies the following steps 1 the adequacy of datasets to develop a causal model 2 the maximum reachable accuracy of a smooth model to estimate a dependent variable and 3 the best and minimum datasets applicable for training a model 55 56 in this method it is supposed that if the two points are close together in the input space their outputs should be close in the output space unless they contain noise for gtt data analysis is conducted based on the calculation of a statistic number named gamma therefore for each vector of independent variables i e x i 1 i m and scalar of the dependent variable y i the nearest k t h neighbor for x i i e x n i k must be determined then the delta δ and gamma γ functions are calculated according to eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 δ k 1 m i 1 m x n i k x i 2 1 k p 6 γ k 1 2 m i 1 m y n i k y i 2 1 k p where represents the euclidean distance m is the number of datasets and y n i k is the y value corresponding to x n i k and i is the index of observations in the previous equations it is suggested to consider 10 p 20 55 57 after that a linear regression line γ a δ g t which provides useful input about the datasets before developing a model is fitted to the p points of δ k γ k the slope of the regression line a indicates the complexity of the relationship between dependent and independent variables the higher the a value the greater the complexity 55 58 furthermore the intercept of the regression line δ 0 which is equal to the gamma statistic g t shows the maximum reachable accuracy by smooth modeling tools the higher the gt value the weaker the modeling performance which is mainly due to 1 much noise in measured data 2 a low number of datasets and 3 the low number of independent variables in the model 59 in theory increasing the m in modeling leads to a rise in the degree of reliability however increasing the m above the minimum number does not increase the modeling accuracy 55 56 m test as a gtt tool determines the minimum required number of training datasets m m i n in a given order of datasets to develop a model with maximum reachable accuracy directly from the dataset 55 56 for this purpose gt is computed for an increasing number of datasets and gt is then plotted against the number of datasets as the number of datasets reaches the m m i n the graph is stabilized to an asymptote 60 the moving window test mw test is another tool in gtt which indicates the variation of gt value for different subsets of the datasets displaying the same size 61 in mw test a virtual window with the length of m m i n is moved along the datasets with a special order and the g t value is computed for the datasets in the window here the datasets with the lowest g t value are selected as the best training set for modeling 61 2 4 optimization of the surface water monitoring network using gtt the surface water quality monitoring network can be substantially optimized using gtt for this the minimum and the best required number of monitoring stations or datasets is specified using m and mw tests however the results strongly depend on the order of datasets while evaluating all possible permutations of orders is extremely complicated and time consuming interestingly a gtt based optimization algorithm proposed by ref 62 see fig 2 was applied to optimize the number and location of monitoring stations the algorithm consisted of seven major steps initially the total datasets are randomized to create a random order of datasets in the second step m m i n is determined by the m test tool then the mw test is conducted with the m m i n to specify a group of datasets with the least g t value in the fourth step the specified group is located at the beginning of the rest of the datasets after that steps 2 to 4 are repeated to put the minimum number of stations m min with the lowest value of g t at the beginning of the total datasets this process is repeated several times by randomizing the datasets and changing the initial order of the datasets lastly the group of datasets with the lowest number and g t value is selected as the optimal group in this study a gtt based optimization algorithm was applied to optimize the number and location of surface water monitoring stations during the construction of the 22 km long highway in southern norway the latitude and longitude of stations were considered as independent variables while wqi was the dependent variable 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality index from different stations as mentioned previously the wqi was calculated based on 28 qualitative parameters of surface water at 48 monitoring stations in the catchment area of the arendal tvedestrand highway for six monitoring periods over the highway construction project wqi presents spatiotemporal variations depending on the type of construction works the maximum value of wqi ca 1259 was recorded on 10 2017 at station 4 5 due to the explosions for tunneling due to construction works in the vicinity of this station the concentration of tn tss mn and ec in surface water increased by 200 000 μg l 86 mg l 600 μg l and 161 ms cm respectively table 2 reports the maximum minimum mean wqi values and coefficient of variation cv for all calculated wqis in each monitoring period the cv which is the ratio of the standard deviation of the mean defines the degree of variation of two or more data series as reported in table 2 the highest average value ca 99 3 and degree of variation of 187 9 were recorded in the second period i e 10 2017 indicating that this period had the highest range of variation in wqi and created the highest average pollution load to receiving streams compared to the other periods table 3 presents the water classification based on wqi and the wqi classification for different water samples in six monitoring periods by comparing the data reported in tables 2 and 3 it becomes clear that during the road construction process the average water quality in all monitoring periods was found as good while in the second monitoring period the average water quality was close to the poor category during this period two monitoring stations had very polluted quality which led to an increase in the average wqi throughout the second period in addition the number of stations with excellent water quality was 21 which was the lowest in all periods compared to all monitoring periods surface water in the first monitoring period had the best quality which means the water from 30 monitoring stations had excellent quality in the sixth monitoring period which was related to the activities at the end of the project the water quality in most of the stations was mostly rated from good to excellent indicating a decrease in road construction works the paired t test is used to evaluate the statistical significance of the difference between two related data series unfortunately this test is limited to data with a normal distribution therefore in this study the normality of the wqi data of the six monitoring periods was first checked by means of k s test the results indicated that the wqi data did not have a normal distribution as a consequence a logarithmic transformation was applied to the wqi data to convert their distribution to a normal distribution once again the k s test was conducted for instance table 4 reports the results of the k s test coming from the logarithmic transformed wqi data in the six monitoring periods it was observed that the sig parameter values from the first to sixth monitoring periods were 0 15 0 13 0 16 0 27 0 06 and 0 32 respectively since all these values are higher than 0 05 the logarithmic transformed wqi data possess normal distribution at a significant level of 0 05 table 4 presents the mean standard deviation and k s z parameters of the logarithmic transformed wqi data for the six monitoring periods the statistical significance and sig parameter values were determined by comparing k s z with standard values since the transformed wqi data in the six monitoring periods had a normal distribution the paired t test was then used to determine the statistical significance of the difference as shown in table 5 if the sig parameter value is greater than 0 05 the difference between the two data series will be insignificant according to table 5 there are significant differences between the first and second second and third and third and fourth monitoring periods while the differences between the fourth and fifth and fifth and sixth periods are insignificant from april 2017 to june 2018 there were several changes in road construction works leading to significant differences in surface water quality in contrast during the fourth fifth and sixth monitoring periods from june 2018 to february 2019 different construction works did not show any significant difference in surface water quality table 5 also presents the mean d standard deviation sd and standard error means s d of the paired differences as well as t statistic d s d and degree of freedom i e number of data series minus one sig parameter of the paired t test was determined by comparing the calculated t statistic with standard t value to 47 degrees of freedom fig 3 illustrates the spatiotemporal variation of wqi during the six monitoring periods 3 2 determination of the optimal wqmn using gtt to achieve the optimal wqmn with the best spatial distribution using the minimum amount of available data wqi data in the first monitoring period i e 4 2017 was analyzed first 48 datasets including latitude and longitude of stations as independent variables and wqi as a dependent variable were amassed then gtt was conducted on the datasets fig 4 shows the scatter plot and the regression line fitted to the points with coordinates of δ k γ k in the scatter plot the black dots indicate the euclidean distance of each monitoring station from each neighboring station the red dots represent the average euclidean distance of the monitoring stations from the surrounding stations as the neighborhood radius increases the gamma statistic gt is equal to the intercept of the regression line fitted to the red dots δ 0 since the regression line does not present a steep slope creating an expected modeling function is not difficult and does not need a large number of wqi data importantly the scatter plot should have no input data with small x i x j values and large values of y i y j as corresponding output the upper left corner of the δ γ scatter plot since they reflect relatively high intrinsic noise of the data and thus negatively affect developing a smooth model as shown in fig 4 some points are in the upper left corner of the δ γ distribution diagram displaying the noise in wqi data from monitoring stations to find the optimum number and location of monitoring stations m and mw tests were performed on the datasets of the first monitoring period and a group of datasets which could best represent the total condition was placed at the beginning of the total datasets using the proposed method as shown in fig 2 in this way the m test chart tends to be asymptotic faster and the mw test chart rises showing the lowest gt in the initial data fig 5 a displays the gt variation for the best order of data since the gt tends to be asymptotic the number of monitoring stations is more than the optimum number based on figure 5a and 37 stations were selected as the optimum stations to monitor the wqi and hence determine its spatial distribution additionally fig 5b indicates the result of the mw test for 37 monitoring stations based on fig 5a as can be seen the first 37 stations present the lowest gt and consequently they were selected as the optimum monitoring stations as depicted in fig 6 the selection process of the number of monitoring stations and location was performed simultaneously for gtt the optimal number and location of stations resulted from the data analysis of the first monitoring period which must also provide the spatial distribution of wqi with appropriate accuracy in other monitoring periods hence to validate the results m and mw test were conducted on wqi data coming from the selected 37 stations in the other five periods see fig 7 according to fig 7a e gt tends to be asymptotic confirming that the selected number of stations is optimum in all periods and there is no need for more stations by comparing gt and the asymptote location from the different periods it can be concluded that it is possible to have a smaller number of monitoring stations for developing an optimal wqmn however given the m test results in the 6th monitoring period fig 7e at least 37 stations are required to achieve an asymptote in this period therefore after the first monitoring period the initial asymptotic threshold is not necessarily the optimal number of monitoring stations in other periods the application of gtt has not been documented in the literature to determine the optimal monitoring network however 20 successfully applied the transinformation entropy technique and value of information to achieve the optimum surface water quality monitoring network by using the data of multiple monitoring periods in general their selected network consisted of 33 stations that provided the minimum redundant information among stations while maximizing the value of information for the monitoring stations our best results which were obtained using the data of the first monitoring period revealed 37 stations for the monitoring network covering the same stations as reported by ref 20 along with four more stations which are well distributed in all catchment areas 4 conclusions the design and optimization of a surface water quality monitoring network in construction projects is a serious concern of decision makers this becomes even more relevant when it comes to projects with limited time and budget as well as projects with the lack of enough data for the optimal design of a monitoring network the main goal of the current study was to evaluate the ability of gtt in determining the optimal number and location of surface water monitoring stations in a road construction project the proposed method was successfully applied to optimize wqmn after the first monitoring period in the construction project of the arendal tvedestrand highway in norway a primary monitoring network containing 48 stations was established based on the hydrogeological feature of the highway catchment while the surface water quality was monitored in six periods the water quality index wqi calculated based on the 28 physical chemical and biological parameters was used to assess the quality of surface water then the m and mw tests were performed on data coming from the first monitoring period to achieve the optimum number and location of monitoring stations the results reveal that 37 monitoring stations 23 less than the number of stations in the primary wqmn are enough to assess wqi with sufficient accuracy additionally they present an optimal distribution over seven discharge areas the proposed monitoring network was verified using the monitoring data of the next five monitoring periods the results indicated that the optimal number and spatial arrangement of monitoring stations in a road construction project can be determined using the data of one monitoring period in particular some uncertainties such as large changes in the location and type of construction works or variation of precipitation patterns in different periods can make a difference in the results therefore the proposed method is feasible to establish a wqmn in short and mid term construction projects such as road construction tunneling and mining definitely further research must be carried out to establish a basis for gtt in different environmental impact assessment eia projects and design of monitoring networks in urban projects dealing with air pollution quantitative and qualitative quality of surface water groundwater and soil finally this study confirmed that the developed

8778,titanium dioxide tio2 nanotubes were synthesized using thin titanium sheets instead of conventional titanium foil by electrochemical anodization under voltages of 20 30 40 and 50 v the higher anodization voltages increased the inner diameter and depth of the tio2 nanotubes but decreased the wall thickness the anodization influenced the oxidation of titanium to form tio2 on the surface of the thin titanium sheets the tio2 nanotubes anodized at 50 v achieved the highest decolorization efficiencies of 74 14 and 65 71 for indigo carmine ic and reactive black 5 rb5 respectively under 180 min uva irradiation and 4 μm initial dye concentration the transformation of dyes into structures with simpler by products was observed the kinetics of the process were characterized using the langmuir hinshelwood l h model the highest specific reaction rates were 1 33 and 0 77 min 1 w 1 for ic and rb5 respectively the l h reaction rate constants were compared with the first order reaction rate constants graphical abstract image 1 keywords anodization indigo carmine modified photocatalyst photooxidation reactive black 5 1 introduction the use of nano titanium dioxide tio2 catalysts in photocatalytic processes has grown steadily in recent years the advantages of nano tio2 catalysts include a high surface area to volume ratio high optical reactivity low toxicity and low synthesis cost 1 6 of particular interest are tio2 nanotubes which are a type of photocatalyst with a high surface area to volume ratio good adsorption and numerous active sites 7 10 although there are several synthetic methods for tio2 nanotubes electrochemical anodization is commonly used because of its ease of implementation electrochemical anodization can be performed at room temperature to improve the surface porosity and morphology of the photocatalyst 11 13 anodizing thin titanium sheets to induce the formation of well aligned horizontally and perpendicularly structured tio2 nanotubes on the sheet surface enhances the photocatalytic reaction as a result of improved electron transport 14 15 electrochemical anodization is also a straightforward and low cost strategy for synthesizing tio2 nanotubes 16 17 moreover the separation and recovery of tio2 nanotube sheets is simple unlike the powder form 18 the treatment of dye wastewater requires advanced treatment technology because dye wastewater contains toxic and highly conjugated structure compounds and nonbiodegradable molecules that are harmful to human health and the environment 5 19 21 in this study on photocatalytic decolorization we experimented with two extensively used dyes indigo carmine ic and reactive black 5 rb5 which belong to the acid and reactive groups respectively the molecular structures of ic and rb5 are sulfonic acid and amine groups on the aromatic rings 22 these complex molecules inhibit the growth of microorganisms thus hindering their removal efficiency 20 23 24 the objectives of this research were to synthesize tio2 nanotubes using electrochemical anodization and to investigate the photocatalytic activity of tio2 nanotubes in dye decolorization using synthetic dye wastewater with different initial dye concentrations irradiated with uva light for 180 min the transformation of the dye precursors into intermediate products was monitored throughout the experiment the photocatalytic decolorization efficiency and langmuir hinshelwood l h kinetics of the heterogeneous reaction mechanism of tio2 nanotube photocatalysts were also investigated 2 experimental setup and methods 2 1 tio2 nanotube synthesis in this study electrochemical anodization was used to synthesize tio2 nanotubes on thin titanium sheets prior to synthesis thin titanium sheets of 99 purity and with dimensions of 3 4 0 08 cm w l t prolog titanium corporation co ltd thailand were polished from very coarse to very fine grit using metallographic abrasive paper numbers 240 400 1000 and 1500 the sheets were then ultrasonicated in acetone and ethanol and washed with deionized di water for 15 min before drying with n2 gas at room temperature the thin titanium sheets were used as the anode working electrode and graphite sheets with dimensions of 3 4 1 00 cm w l t kimtech technology thailand served as the cathode counter electrode electrochemical anodization was carried out in a mixture of 90 v v ethylene glycol 0 3 wt nh4f and 0 05 wt hf as the electrolyte for 1 h at room temperature the distance between the two electrodes was 3 cm fig 1 a the anodization voltage was varied between 20 30 40 and 50 v the anodized thin titanium sheets were subsequently ultrasonicated with di water for 15 min and dried with n2 gas 2 2 tio2 nanotube characterization the surface morphology and elemental composition of the tio2 nanotube photocatalysts were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem jsm 7800fprime the multiplatform modular software gwyddion version 2 54 r27 http gwyddion net was used to characterize the surface area inner diameter wall thickness and depth of the tio2 nanotubes 2 3 photocatalytic decolorization test the experimental photocatalytic decolorization of the tio2 nanotubes was carried out using ic and rb5 dyes in a batch scale photoreactor fig 1 b shows the photoreactor which consisted of a glass dish containing 50 ml of synthetic dye wastewater a tio2 nanotube photocatalyst and a uva light source with a light intensity of 10 w m2 the glass dish was irradiated by the uva light source which was 15 cm from the dish the concentrations of the dyes were measured using a spectrophotometer spectroquant prove 300 in the photocatalytic decolorization experiments the initial concentrations of ic or rb5 in the synthetic dye wastewater 50 ml were varied between 4 6 8 and 10 μm the initial dye concentrations were measured prior to the uva irradiation photocatalytic decolorization experiments were performed for 180 min at room temperature and the dye concentrations were measured at 0 10 20 30 60 90 120 and 180 min the transformation of dye precursors into intermediate products during the photocatalytic decolorization was monitored using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms model gc 6890 n agilent equipped with an agilent g1888 headspace sampler as the injection source agilent hp 5ms as the capillary column and msd 5973 n ionsource ei single quat as the detector water loss through evaporation as a result of uva irradiation was compensated for by adding an equal amount of di water using a 1 5 ml cuvette to restore the water level to its previous level prior to sample collection as a result the subsequent starting water levels for uva irradiation were approximately 1 5 ml less than the previous levels to verify the photocatalytic decolorization performance of the tio2 nanotubes two control experiments were carried out in parallel decolorization using the tio2 nanotube catalysts in the absence of uva light in the dark and decolorization without the tio2 nanotube catalysts in the presence of uva light the results of all experiments were then compared the l h kinetic model was used to determine the specific reaction rates of the photocatalytic decolorization of tio2 nanotubes for systematic comparison the kinetic rate constants k k of the l h model in this study were converted to first order kinetic rate constants i e k k however owing to different light intensities and surface areas as a result of the different catalyst types the specific reaction rates under various photocatalytic conditions were calculated and compared 3 results and discussion 3 1 tio2 nanotube characterization electrochemical anodization improved the surface of the thin titanium sheets by inducing ti o bonds to form tio2 nanotubes 25 26 fig 2 a d show the fe sem images of tio2 nanotubes on the surface of thin titanium sheets anodized at 20 30 40 and 50 v dc respectively as shown in fig 2 electrochemical anodization induced the formation of small pits that developed into pores and then into a tubular nanostructure network on the surface of the thin titanium sheets as shown in the figure the anodization voltage influenced the inner diameters of the small pits pore separation tubular nanostructure network formation wall thickness and depth of the nanotubes the wall thickness of the nanotubes was inversely correlated with the anodization voltage whereas the rest were positively correlated table 1 presents the inner diameter wall thickness and depth of the tio2 nanotubes the results showed that at 20 v there were no measurable changes on the surface of the thin titanium sheet except for slight surface roughness fig 2 a as shown in fig 2 b d higher anodization voltages 30 50 v decreased the wall thickness but increased the depth of the tio2 nanotubes consistent with 25 27 a higher anodization voltage also affected the elemental composition of the tio2 nanotube photocatalysts the elemental composition was determined by measuring four locations on the tio2 nanotube sheets and the results were averaged as shown in fig 3 the fe sem patterns of the tio2 nanotube photocatalysts anodized at 20 50 v confirmed the presence of ti o and f the elemental composition of the tio2 nanotube photocatalysts indicated the formation of tio2 nanotubes on the surface of the thin tio2 sheets as a result of electrochemical anodization the anodization voltage was a crucial factor in generating a powerful electric field that induced the oxidation of ti to form tio2 in the hf electrolyte as evidenced by the increased oxygen element as the anodization voltage increased table 1 28 30 3 2 photocatalytic decolorization experiment the photocatalytic activity of the tio2 nanotubes was evaluated in terms of the decolorization of the ic and rb5 dyes at 180 min table 2 the experiments were carried out in triplicate as shown in table 2 the highest decolorization efficiencies for ic and rb5 of 74 14 and 65 71 respectively were achieved at an initial dye concentration of 4 μm using the tio2 nanotube photocatalyst anodized at 50 v the decolorization efficiencies for all initial dye concentrations 4 10 μm of both dyes for the control experiments were negligible the control experiments were decolorization using tio2 nanotube catalysts in the absence of uva light in the dark and decolorization without tio2 nanotube catalysts in the presence of uva light the results also indicated that the decolorization efficiency was positively correlated with the anodization voltage used in the synthesis of the tio2 nanotubes the enhanced decolorization efficiency was attributed to the improved physical characteristics of the tio2 nanotubes including the inner diameter wall thickness and depth of the nanotubes as the anodization voltage increased the tubular structured network of tio2 nanotubes became more evenly distributed over a larger surface area which increased the electron transfer potential and ion accommodation on the active sites of the tio2 nanotube sheets when irradiated with uva light 31 33 moreover electrochemical anodization created a nanotube array structure with more active sites that trapped and adsorbed dye molecules on the nanotube surface where the electrons in the valence band could transfer in parallel and vertically this increased the photon efficiency and reduced the recombination of electron hole pairs 31 34 as shown in table 2 and fig 4 the initial dye concentration played a role in the decolorization efficiency higher dye concentrations exhibited inhibitory effects whereby the light source was prevented from reaching the active sites on the photocatalyst surface specifically higher dye concentrations prevented superoxide radicals o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh from developing on active sites 35 37 the complexity and size of dye molecules also affected the decolorization efficiency 38 41 the molecular structure of rb5 is more complex and larger than that of ic making rb5 more difficult to degrade than ic in this study the degradation of ic and rb5 dyes as evidenced by the rapid transformation of chromophores resulted in less complex dye structures as shown in figs 5 and 6 decolorization was more pronounced during the early photocatalytic reaction the ic and rb5 dyes demonstrated similar patterns of photocatalytic decolorization relative to the irradiation time as shown in fig 4 the dye concentrations decreased rapidly in the first 30 min because of the very low accumulation of dissolved organic matter dom on the photocatalyst surface the decolorization rate decelerated afterward because of the accumulation of dom that occurred during the photocatalytic reaction the accumulated dom blocked the active sites and inhibited reactive oxidant species 42 despite their lighter color certain intermediate products in treated wastewater are toxic thus posing potential health risks to humans and harm to aquatic life if found in large quantities 4 43 first order kinetics are commonly used to characterize photocatalytic reaction behavior however because we investigated the decolorization efficiency of tio2 nanotube photocatalysts in this study first order kinetics might not adequately describe the photocatalytic reaction behavior of the tio2 nanotubes as a result the l h model was used to describe the kinetics of the heterogeneous reaction mechanism including adsorption absorption and photooxidation the l h model can describe the chemisorption on the active sites of a photocatalyst surface before the initiation of the photocatalytic reaction given the following assumptions i there are a limited number of active sites on the photocatalyst surface ii the photocatalyst surface can be covered to a maximum of one single layer with each space capable of adsorbing only one molecule iii the adsorption reaction is reversible iv the photocatalyst surface is homogeneous and v there are no interactions between adsorbed molecules 44 45 in this study the photocatalytic decolorization mechanism was described by the l h kinetic model 46 47 which can be mathematically written as 1 r 0 k k c 1 k c 0 where r 0 is the initial photocatalytic decolorization rate μm min k is the apparent reaction rate constant μm min k is the adsorption to desorption equilibrium rate constant μm 1 c 0 is the initial concentration of dye in the solution μm and c is the final concentration of dye in the solution μm the mathematical expression can be further simplified into a linear form as in eq 2 2 1 r 0 1 k k c 0 1 k fig 7 shows the l h kinetics of the photocatalytic decolorization of the tio2 nanotubes for the ic and rb5 dyes table 3 summarizes the kinetic parameters and l h kinetic rate constants k and k of the photocatalytic decolorization reaction the photocatalytic decolorization efficiency as indicated by k and k increased with increasing anodization voltage in the synthesis of the tio2 nanotubes this was attributed to the improved physical characteristics of the tio2 nanotubes associated with a higher anodization voltage the product of the l h model kinetic constants k k is equivalent to the first order kinetic rate constant k 1st with the same order of magnitude of 10 2 min 1 in table 3 owing to the different photocatalyst types and forms and uva light intensities k k was converted into specific reaction rates to compare the photocatalytic decolorization performance in this study the maximum decolorization efficiencies for the ic and rb5 dyes of 1 33 and 0 77 min 1 w 1 respectively were achieved with tio2 nanotube photocatalysts anodized at 50 v the higher photocatalytic decolorization efficiencies of the tio2 nanotube photocatalysts were attributable to their tubular structure unlike in other studies that used different forms of catalysts for example films and powders table 3 4 conclusion in this study tio2 nanotubes were synthesized on the surface of thin titanium sheets using electrochemical anodization the anodization voltage was varied between 20 30 40 and 50 v the experiments showed that higher anodization voltages improved the physical characteristics of the tio2 nanotubes resulting in higher photocatalytic decolorization efficiency of synthetic dye wastewater containing various initial concentrations of ic and rb5 furthermore the l h kinetic model was used to describe the heterogeneous reaction mechanism of photocatalytic decolorization using the tio2 nanotube photocatalysts the results indicated that the photocatalytic decolorization performance of the tio2 nanotubes was positively correlated with the anodization voltage as evidenced by the higher specific reaction rates

8778,titanium dioxide tio2 nanotubes were synthesized using thin titanium sheets instead of conventional titanium foil by electrochemical anodization under voltages of 20 30 40 and 50 v the higher anodization voltages increased the inner diameter and depth of the tio2 nanotubes but decreased the wall thickness the anodization influenced the oxidation of titanium to form tio2 on the surface of the thin titanium sheets the tio2 nanotubes anodized at 50 v achieved the highest decolorization efficiencies of 74 14 and 65 71 for indigo carmine ic and reactive black 5 rb5 respectively under 180 min uva irradiation and 4 μm initial dye concentration the transformation of dyes into structures with simpler by products was observed the kinetics of the process were characterized using the langmuir hinshelwood l h model the highest specific reaction rates were 1 33 and 0 77 min 1 w 1 for ic and rb5 respectively the l h reaction rate constants were compared with the first order reaction rate constants graphical abstract image 1 keywords anodization indigo carmine modified photocatalyst photooxidation reactive black 5 1 introduction the use of nano titanium dioxide tio2 catalysts in photocatalytic processes has grown steadily in recent years the advantages of nano tio2 catalysts include a high surface area to volume ratio high optical reactivity low toxicity and low synthesis cost 1 6 of particular interest are tio2 nanotubes which are a type of photocatalyst with a high surface area to volume ratio good adsorption and numerous active sites 7 10 although there are several synthetic methods for tio2 nanotubes electrochemical anodization is commonly used because of its ease of implementation electrochemical anodization can be performed at room temperature to improve the surface porosity and morphology of the photocatalyst 11 13 anodizing thin titanium sheets to induce the formation of well aligned horizontally and perpendicularly structured tio2 nanotubes on the sheet surface enhances the photocatalytic reaction as a result of improved electron transport 14 15 electrochemical anodization is also a straightforward and low cost strategy for synthesizing tio2 nanotubes 16 17 moreover the separation and recovery of tio2 nanotube sheets is simple unlike the powder form 18 the treatment of dye wastewater requires advanced treatment technology because dye wastewater contains toxic and highly conjugated structure compounds and nonbiodegradable molecules that are harmful to human health and the environment 5 19 21 in this study on photocatalytic decolorization we experimented with two extensively used dyes indigo carmine ic and reactive black 5 rb5 which belong to the acid and reactive groups respectively the molecular structures of ic and rb5 are sulfonic acid and amine groups on the aromatic rings 22 these complex molecules inhibit the growth of microorganisms thus hindering their removal efficiency 20 23 24 the objectives of this research were to synthesize tio2 nanotubes using electrochemical anodization and to investigate the photocatalytic activity of tio2 nanotubes in dye decolorization using synthetic dye wastewater with different initial dye concentrations irradiated with uva light for 180 min the transformation of the dye precursors into intermediate products was monitored throughout the experiment the photocatalytic decolorization efficiency and langmuir hinshelwood l h kinetics of the heterogeneous reaction mechanism of tio2 nanotube photocatalysts were also investigated 2 experimental setup and methods 2 1 tio2 nanotube synthesis in this study electrochemical anodization was used to synthesize tio2 nanotubes on thin titanium sheets prior to synthesis thin titanium sheets of 99 purity and with dimensions of 3 4 0 08 cm w l t prolog titanium corporation co ltd thailand were polished from very coarse to very fine grit using metallographic abrasive paper numbers 240 400 1000 and 1500 the sheets were then ultrasonicated in acetone and ethanol and washed with deionized di water for 15 min before drying with n2 gas at room temperature the thin titanium sheets were used as the anode working electrode and graphite sheets with dimensions of 3 4 1 00 cm w l t kimtech technology thailand served as the cathode counter electrode electrochemical anodization was carried out in a mixture of 90 v v ethylene glycol 0 3 wt nh4f and 0 05 wt hf as the electrolyte for 1 h at room temperature the distance between the two electrodes was 3 cm fig 1 a the anodization voltage was varied between 20 30 40 and 50 v the anodized thin titanium sheets were subsequently ultrasonicated with di water for 15 min and dried with n2 gas 2 2 tio2 nanotube characterization the surface morphology and elemental composition of the tio2 nanotube photocatalysts were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem jsm 7800fprime the multiplatform modular software gwyddion version 2 54 r27 http gwyddion net was used to characterize the surface area inner diameter wall thickness and depth of the tio2 nanotubes 2 3 photocatalytic decolorization test the experimental photocatalytic decolorization of the tio2 nanotubes was carried out using ic and rb5 dyes in a batch scale photoreactor fig 1 b shows the photoreactor which consisted of a glass dish containing 50 ml of synthetic dye wastewater a tio2 nanotube photocatalyst and a uva light source with a light intensity of 10 w m2 the glass dish was irradiated by the uva light source which was 15 cm from the dish the concentrations of the dyes were measured using a spectrophotometer spectroquant prove 300 in the photocatalytic decolorization experiments the initial concentrations of ic or rb5 in the synthetic dye wastewater 50 ml were varied between 4 6 8 and 10 μm the initial dye concentrations were measured prior to the uva irradiation photocatalytic decolorization experiments were performed for 180 min at room temperature and the dye concentrations were measured at 0 10 20 30 60 90 120 and 180 min the transformation of dye precursors into intermediate products during the photocatalytic decolorization was monitored using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms model gc 6890 n agilent equipped with an agilent g1888 headspace sampler as the injection source agilent hp 5ms as the capillary column and msd 5973 n ionsource ei single quat as the detector water loss through evaporation as a result of uva irradiation was compensated for by adding an equal amount of di water using a 1 5 ml cuvette to restore the water level to its previous level prior to sample collection as a result the subsequent starting water levels for uva irradiation were approximately 1 5 ml less than the previous levels to verify the photocatalytic decolorization performance of the tio2 nanotubes two control experiments were carried out in parallel decolorization using the tio2 nanotube catalysts in the absence of uva light in the dark and decolorization without the tio2 nanotube catalysts in the presence of uva light the results of all experiments were then compared the l h kinetic model was used to determine the specific reaction rates of the photocatalytic decolorization of tio2 nanotubes for systematic comparison the kinetic rate constants k k of the l h model in this study were converted to first order kinetic rate constants i e k k however owing to different light intensities and surface areas as a result of the different catalyst types the specific reaction rates under various photocatalytic conditions were calculated and compared 3 results and discussion 3 1 tio2 nanotube characterization electrochemical anodization improved the surface of the thin titanium sheets by inducing ti o bonds to form tio2 nanotubes 25 26 fig 2 a d show the fe sem images of tio2 nanotubes on the surface of thin titanium sheets anodized at 20 30 40 and 50 v dc respectively as shown in fig 2 electrochemical anodization induced the formation of small pits that developed into pores and then into a tubular nanostructure network on the surface of the thin titanium sheets as shown in the figure the anodization voltage influenced the inner diameters of the small pits pore separation tubular nanostructure network formation wall thickness and depth of the nanotubes the wall thickness of the nanotubes was inversely correlated with the anodization voltage whereas the rest were positively correlated table 1 presents the inner diameter wall thickness and depth of the tio2 nanotubes the results showed that at 20 v there were no measurable changes on the surface of the thin titanium sheet except for slight surface roughness fig 2 a as shown in fig 2 b d higher anodization voltages 30 50 v decreased the wall thickness but increased the depth of the tio2 nanotubes consistent with 25 27 a higher anodization voltage also affected the elemental composition of the tio2 nanotube photocatalysts the elemental composition was determined by measuring four locations on the tio2 nanotube sheets and the results were averaged as shown in fig 3 the fe sem patterns of the tio2 nanotube photocatalysts anodized at 20 50 v confirmed the presence of ti o and f the elemental composition of the tio2 nanotube photocatalysts indicated the formation of tio2 nanotubes on the surface of the thin tio2 sheets as a result of electrochemical anodization the anodization voltage was a crucial factor in generating a powerful electric field that induced the oxidation of ti to form tio2 in the hf electrolyte as evidenced by the increased oxygen element as the anodization voltage increased table 1 28 30 3 2 photocatalytic decolorization experiment the photocatalytic activity of the tio2 nanotubes was evaluated in terms of the decolorization of the ic and rb5 dyes at 180 min table 2 the experiments were carried out in triplicate as shown in table 2 the highest decolorization efficiencies for ic and rb5 of 74 14 and 65 71 respectively were achieved at an initial dye concentration of 4 μm using the tio2 nanotube photocatalyst anodized at 50 v the decolorization efficiencies for all initial dye concentrations 4 10 μm of both dyes for the control experiments were negligible the control experiments were decolorization using tio2 nanotube catalysts in the absence of uva light in the dark and decolorization without tio2 nanotube catalysts in the presence of uva light the results also indicated that the decolorization efficiency was positively correlated with the anodization voltage used in the synthesis of the tio2 nanotubes the enhanced decolorization efficiency was attributed to the improved physical characteristics of the tio2 nanotubes including the inner diameter wall thickness and depth of the nanotubes as the anodization voltage increased the tubular structured network of tio2 nanotubes became more evenly distributed over a larger surface area which increased the electron transfer potential and ion accommodation on the active sites of the tio2 nanotube sheets when irradiated with uva light 31 33 moreover electrochemical anodization created a nanotube array structure with more active sites that trapped and adsorbed dye molecules on the nanotube surface where the electrons in the valence band could transfer in parallel and vertically this increased the photon efficiency and reduced the recombination of electron hole pairs 31 34 as shown in table 2 and fig 4 the initial dye concentration played a role in the decolorization efficiency higher dye concentrations exhibited inhibitory effects whereby the light source was prevented from reaching the active sites on the photocatalyst surface specifically higher dye concentrations prevented superoxide radicals o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh from developing on active sites 35 37 the complexity and size of dye molecules also affected the decolorization efficiency 38 41 the molecular structure of rb5 is more complex and larger than that of ic making rb5 more difficult to degrade than ic in this study the degradation of ic and rb5 dyes as evidenced by the rapid transformation of chromophores resulted in less complex dye structures as shown in figs 5 and 6 decolorization was more pronounced during the early photocatalytic reaction the ic and rb5 dyes demonstrated similar patterns of photocatalytic decolorization relative to the irradiation time as shown in fig 4 the dye concentrations decreased rapidly in the first 30 min because of the very low accumulation of dissolved organic matter dom on the photocatalyst surface the decolorization rate decelerated afterward because of the accumulation of dom that occurred during the photocatalytic reaction the accumulated dom blocked the active sites and inhibited reactive oxidant species 42 despite their lighter color certain intermediate products in treated wastewater are toxic thus posing potential health risks to humans and harm to aquatic life if found in large quantities 4 43 first order kinetics are commonly used to characterize photocatalytic reaction behavior however because we investigated the decolorization efficiency of tio2 nanotube photocatalysts in this study first order kinetics might not adequately describe the photocatalytic reaction behavior of the tio2 nanotubes as a result the l h model was used to describe the kinetics of the heterogeneous reaction mechanism including adsorption absorption and photooxidation the l h model can describe the chemisorption on the active sites of a photocatalyst surface before the initiation of the photocatalytic reaction given the following assumptions i there are a limited number of active sites on the photocatalyst surface ii the photocatalyst surface can be covered to a maximum of one single layer with each space capable of adsorbing only one molecule iii the adsorption reaction is reversible iv the photocatalyst surface is homogeneous and v there are no interactions between adsorbed molecules 44 45 in this study the photocatalytic decolorization mechanism was described by the l h kinetic model 46 47 which can be mathematically written as 1 r 0 k k c 1 k c 0 where r 0 is the initial photocatalytic decolorization rate μm min k is the apparent reaction rate constant μm min k is the adsorption to desorption equilibrium rate constant μm 1 c 0 is the initial concentration of dye in the solution μm and c is the final concentration of dye in the solution μm the mathematical expression can be further simplified into a linear form as in eq 2 2 1 r 0 1 k k c 0 1 k fig 7 shows the l h kinetics of the photocatalytic decolorization of the tio2 nanotubes for the ic and rb5 dyes table 3 summarizes the kinetic parameters and l h kinetic rate constants k and k of the photocatalytic decolorization reaction the photocatalytic decolorization efficiency as indicated by k and k increased with increasing anodization voltage in the synthesis of the tio2 nanotubes this was attributed to the improved physical characteristics of the tio2 nanotubes associated with a higher anodization voltage the product of the l h model kinetic constants k k is equivalent to the first order kinetic rate constant k 1st with the same order of magnitude of 10 2 min 1 in table 3 owing to the different photocatalyst types and forms and uva light intensities k k was converted into specific reaction rates to compare the photocatalytic decolorization performance in this study the maximum decolorization efficiencies for the ic and rb5 dyes of 1 33 and 0 77 min 1 w 1 respectively were achieved with tio2 nanotube photocatalysts anodized at 50 v the higher photocatalytic decolorization efficiencies of the tio2 nanotube photocatalysts were attributable to their tubular structure unlike in other studies that used different forms of catalysts for example films and powders table 3 4 conclusion in this study tio2 nanotubes were synthesized on the surface of thin titanium sheets using electrochemical anodization the anodization voltage was varied between 20 30 40 and 50 v the experiments showed that higher anodization voltages improved the physical characteristics of the tio2 nanotubes resulting in higher photocatalytic decolorization efficiency of synthetic dye wastewater containing various initial concentrations of ic and rb5 furthermore the l h kinetic model was used to describe the heterogeneous reaction mechanism of photocatalytic decolorization using the tio2 nanotube photocatalysts the results indicated that the photocatalytic decolorization performance of the tio2 nanotubes was positively correlated with the anodization voltage as evidenced by the higher specific reaction rates

8779,this paper assesses a bench scale carwash wastewater treatment system s removal efficiency based on coagulation flocculation and a household type activated carbon filter and water ozonator for the experiment the wastewater that went through an oil water separator ows from a medium sized carwash facility located in a dense commercial area in barranquilla colombia was collected the study evaluates the following parameters water quality indicators recommended by the u s environmental protection agency and literature related to carwash water reclamation the treatment results are compared to related regional studies in latin america and colombian legislation in force experimental results evidence that reclaimed water s characteristics are similar to those of a groundwater source for most analyzed variables and the system was able to reduce organic matter concentrations considerably regarding the organoleptic characteristics the system eliminated foaming and generated a transparent and odorless product the coliform test showed that reclaimed water has an average total coliform count of around 5800 mpn 100 ml which is above the proposed health risk limit per most international standards for water reuse but as it complies with industrial wastewater and non food irrigation purposes in colombia additional disinfection is recommended depending on the reuse purpose the results from this research may assist future carwash wastewater reclamation regulations in colombia and the latin american region keywords water reclamation wastewater reuse carwash ozonation activated carbon 1 introduction the effects of climate change coupled with the increasing human population and its living standards have a significant impact on water availability and quality as they aggravate the unequal distribution of this resource worldwide 1 the challenges posed by water scarcity and increasing demands lead many countries to consider water reuse as the sustainable development of cities critically depends on water availability 2 3 water reclamation used synonymously with water recycling is the process of treating wastewater to enable its reuse by satisfying fit for purpose water quality criteria 4 around 80 of the total wastewater of the world is released directly to the environment without any treatment 5 by the beginning of the century the estimated wastewater reuse volume was less than 1 of the world s total water withdrawal 6 currently and led by china israel and some european countries around 5 of the global treated wastewater is reused in agriculture and for industrial applications 7 wastewater reclamation and reuse increase water supplies and might help reduce the pressure on aquifers and freshwater sources according to ref 8 the cost of recycled water can be as low as us 0 32 m³ for agricultural and industrial purposes and us 0 45 m³ for potable water which in some cases is cheaper than desalination us 0 50 m³ on average or than exploiting new water bodies or depleting existing resources recent studies have proven that most consumers are willing to pay and use reclaimed water only if the price is lower than that of conventional water 9 10 besides the economic aspect and based on surveys conducted in the united states over two decades other factors affecting the public acceptance of reclaimed water include the degree of human contact health risks clear definition of environmental and water conservation benefits high quality standards of the product and confidence in the authorities and technologies involved 11 the most common uses for recycled wastewater include irrigation 12 15 non drinkable household uses 16 18 environmental management and recreational uses 19 23 aquifer recharge 24 25 aquaculture 26 27 drinking water production 9 28 and industrial applications 29 31 according to the review paper by ref 32 non potable reuse is the most common usage for reclaimed water in small medium and large scale applications in most developing countries wastewater reclamation is not a common practice yet however many countries have made efforts in this direction by setting regulations encouraging water reuse following global trends around environmental protection and circular economy 33 34 carwashing is one of the regular daily life activities that consume large water volumes thus justifying efforts for reducing its impact on natural resources 35 36 wastewater from this process might include several pollutants including detergents high oil and grease concentrations fuel residues metals salts and organic matter 37 based on a sample of 3657 regular vehicles in ghana 38 determined that the average water consumption in the carwash process ranges within 70 l for motorbikes and 365 l for buses and vans with manual washing stations consuming between 30 and 50 more water than semi automated stations for a family car home carwashing consumes around 440 l of water 30 coupled with such a high level of water consumption the carwash industry in low income countries usually extracts unmetered groundwater for free and releases polluted wastewater into sewer systems and urban waterways negative consequences of such behavior include uncontrolled depletion of aquifers and potential pollution of soil and water bodies 38 therefore industry specific legislation is often required to minimize these risks along with water saving initiatives and practices examples from australia and some european countries show that it is possible to limit the maximum freshwater carwash consumption to less than 70 l per an average car or achieve a water recycling percentage of up to 80 observing significant revenue increases at the same time 4 38 there are many industrial water recycling systems developed for potable and non potable uses the review paper by ref 39 summarizes leading water treatment technologies producing recycled water of various qualities and varying range of technical and energy requirements for the carwash industry the most common technologies are coagulation adsorption membrane filtration electrochemical processes and methods that combine multiple technologies 40 besides studies aiming at maximizing water recycling water saving initiatives in the carwash industry include the efforts to achieve an optimal design of pipe nozzles and control devices for automated systems 41 several household water treatment technologies have been developed to improve drinking water quality and its organoleptic characteristics with different degrees of effectiveness in removing contaminants 42 among these technologies two are of particular interest for this research activated carbon filters and ozonation as they are widely available and often locally produced even in low income countries activated carbon filters are commonly employed in water and wastewater treatment both for households and industries as they can treat general taste and odor problems and remove impurities such as certain organic compounds and heavy metals 43 these devices enhance water quality through physical filtration as the porous structure of the carbonaceous material adsorbs most of the pollutants in the water flow nevertheless activated carbon filters are unsuitable for removing microbial contaminants and both the u s environmental protection agency u s epa and the world health organization recommend using additional treatment to reduce microbial risks 44 in use since the late 1800s ozonation is a water treatment process with an efficient microbicidal effect against bacteria viruses and protozoan 45 ozonation oxidizes micropollutants through a direct reaction with highly reactive ozone molecules or indirectly through hydroxyl radicals therefore the transformation of compounds usually results only in their partial removal from the effluent 46 since the early 2000s it has been the subject of research related to the carwash industry wastewater treatment the findings of many reports indicate that ozonation performs better than chlorination in clarifying water while having an additional advantage it does not leave undesirable odors nor does it generate carcinogenic compounds called trihalomethanes 4 47 this study evaluates a bench scale carwash wastewater treatment system s pollutant removal efficiency based on coagulation flocculation activated carbon and water ozonation technologies the analyzed arrangement comprises equipment commonly employed for household water treatment and purification this paper contributes to the literature on wastewater treatment and reclamation by assessing economic and already available alternatives which is especially relevant for developing countries where environmental legislation gaps limited access to state of the art technologies and inadequate local technical training are frequent constituting a combination that poses a risk to sustainability and future access to water resources additionally the reclaimed water characteristics from this work are compared with the existing colombian legislation related to water for human consumption wastewater disposal and reuse over the last ten years studies conducted in latin america around carwash wastewater recycling have combined different treatment technologies including flocculation column flotation fcf sand filtration chlorination 48 flocculation flotation ozonation 49 electrocoagulation electrooxidation 50 coagulation flocculation sedimentation 51 and rotating biological contactor filtration chlorination 52 the wastewater and reclaimed water characteristics reported in these papers are summarized in table 1 enabling a comparison with the results of this research especially in developing countries such as those of the latin american region 2 materials and method 2 1 evaluated parameters the pollutants found in carwash wastewater originate mainly from road surface contaminants atmospheric fallout combustion derived contaminants and carwash chemicals 53 the parameters evaluated in this study are in line with u s epa guidelines the 54 and existing literature regarding carwash wastewater treatment 4 30 48 49 table 2 presents the parameters under analysis and the examination methods 55 as well as equipment employed for conducting the task 2 2 case study and sampling this study employed wastewater collected from a 450 m2 carwash facility located in a dense commercial area in barranquilla colombia to test the described system the carwash does not include any automatic equipment the city s growth and the abundance of groundwater resources have stimulated the propagation of this type of economic activity these features coupled with legislative shortcomings and limited supervision from the authorities produce negative externalities with environmental impacts such as health and safety concerns caused by untreated effluent being discharged directly to the streets uncontrolled depletion of aquifers and squandering of local water resources 30 56 57 79 the samples were collected based on the procedures described in standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater between july and september 2019 thirteen batches of at least 40 liter wastewater units were gathered with the corresponding experimental run and analysis of the parameters under evaluation conducted within 24 h of collection for each experimental run three samples were collected and tested at each sampling point 1 downstream the oil water separator ows in the carwash facility 2 after the coagulation flocculation process 3 from the ozonator the tests related to total coliforms and oil and grease concentration were conducted only for three experimental runs because of logistical difficulties 2 3 the wastewater treatment system the system s main components include technologies commonly available for household applications and fig 1 shows the schematic representation of the carwash wastewater treatment system under study with the process described in the following subsections the capital cost of the equipment used in this bench scale experiment grease trap tanks filters pipe fittings pump and ozonator was about us 900 with the sum of the ozonator and the activated carbon filter accounting for 40 of the total 2 3 1 wastewater batch collection at the carwash facility a pump directly draws groundwater from a borehole storing the resource in an elevated tank to meet the business s operational requirements wastewater derived from the carwashing process pre soak wash and rinse is collected by an in bay pit which serves as a desander and coarse material separator following the pit the carwash employed as the case study currently disposes wastewater directly to the city sewage system water extracted from the in bay pit is passed through a 95 liter polyethylene ows to reduce the equipment s clogging risk each experimental run requires a minimum of 40 liters of wastewater to be treated by the system and the batches are collected downstream of the ows which is also the first sampling point these volumes are taken directly to the laboratory of the universidad de la costa for the treatment process to be continued 2 3 2 coagulation flocculation process for the system s 40 l coagulation flocculation tank two airstone bubblers replicate gentle mixing conducted in the jar test this aerator type is extensively used in house aquariums and for the experiment the bubblers were set 10 cm above the tank s bottom allowing for sedimentation to occur the jar tests followed the procedures described by the colombian institute of technical standards and certification 58 which constitute an equivalent to the practices described in astm d 2035 90 based on previous research 51 59 the 1 ferric chloride fecl3 solution was chosen as the coagulant for this experiment it is worth mentioning that fecl3 is highly corrosive thus reclaimed water should be avoided for the final rinse 52 60 ten possible dosages within the range of 20 mg l and 120 mg l mg of fecl3 per liter of wastewater were tested on nine preliminary wastewater samples from the site before the actual experimental runs were conducted from these analyses an initial dose of 90 mg l allowed for the best clarification conditions for the combined assessment of ph absorbancy color and alkalinity once the operation was complete and the flocs settled the clarified water second sampling point was passed on to another tank and the sediments from the coagulation flocculation process were safely discarded 2 3 3 activated carbon and ozonation besides the ows and the coagulation flocculation tank the system s configuration comprises two additional household water treatment devices an activated water carbon filter flow rate capacity 4 l min and a water ozonator nominal power 12 w flow rate capacity 2 l min research related to utility scale wastewater treatment plants has previously evaluated this technology combination 61 62 the system analyzed in this paper includes granular multimedia filters installed in both devices to extend these pieces of equipment s service life a ½ hp pump flow rate 40 l circulates water from the clarified water recirculation tank to the rest of the system the ozonator s flow rate determines the system s output resulting in an estimated residence time of 20 min for a 40 liter wastewater batch volume as the flow provided by the pump is higher than that of the ozonator the excess is recirculated reducing cavitation risks at the same time water coming from the ozonator is then sampled for the third and final time 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall system performance as previously mentioned in the method s description most of the parameters were analyzed for thirteen experimental runs except for total coliforms and oil and grease tested only in the last three with three samples taken at each corresponding point additionally we tested nine samples from a groundwater well and wastewater downstream of the ows to set a baseline before initiating the experiment table 3 summarizes this information and presents the treatment s efficiency by comparing wastewater from the ows and reclaimed water as shown in table 3 the average ph for all stages stood at medium range values 6 6 7 8 with low coefficients of variation for each sampling point allowing ozone to oxidize dissolved organic matter in neutral ph 49 alkalinity is a measure of water s capacity to resist sudden changes in ph and it is determined primarily by the presence of hydroxides carbonates and bicarbonates 63 alkalinity levels in typical drinking water range between 20 and 200 mg l low ph and alkalinity levels in water lead to corrosion in pipes whereas high values cause precipitation which is also detrimental 64 in our experiment the alkalinity behavior is consequent with ph and both parameters values in reclaimed water are similar to those from a groundwater source dissolved oxygen is a water quality indicator because it directly influences aquatic ecosystems and wastewater treatment processes it is also a parameter included in water reclamation standards 65 the carwashing process reduces the concentration of dissolved oxygen to less than half of that measured in groundwater still the system s coagulation flocculation procedures help restore the values to adequate levels reported in carwash wastewater literature 66 an effect that might be an additional benefit of employing the airstone bubblers to perform the mixing a high cod to bod ratio cod bod 2 5 characterizes wastewater with a significant non biodegradable organics fraction 67 based on table 3 wastewater produced in the carwashing process falls within the cod bod medium range with untreated domestic sewage characteristics with a low concentration of organics 63 the results show that most organic matter removal occurs during the coagulation flocculation process 69 for cod 55 for bod the system was able to considerably reduce the bod and cod concentrations in reclaimed water resulting in levels comparable to those from the studies summarized in table 1 and in terms of these two organic matter indicators the average end product is of better quality than the groundwater resource one of the major concerns regarding water reuse for irrigation in developing countries is that raw or inadequately treated wastewater contains numerous pathogens and infectious agents posing health risks for crop consumers and producers 63 coliform bacteria are considered reliable water quality indicators based on the hypothesis that these organisms presence in water could indicate recent fecal contamination 55 for this experiment we conducted coliform tests on samples from the final three experimental runs with reclaimed water having an average total coliform count of around 5800 mpn 100 ml which is above the proposed health risk limit of 1000 mpn 100 ml indicating the need for additional disinfection 48 63 we achieved similar removal rates and a lower final total coliform count than those reported in previous studies summarized in table 1 and adding chlorination to the system could further reduce the count additionally 4 state that 200 mpn 100 ml of e coli poses a low microbiological risk for car wash operators a consideration to include in future studies the results in table 3 indicate that oil and grease removal occurred in the filters and ozonator which is in line with previous research findings 68 69 as in the case of the coliform tests oil and grease quantification was conducted only in the final experimental runs and future studies would require determining the backwash or replacement periodicity of the equipment based on more extensive data series total dissolved solids tds encompass inorganic salts and small quantities of organic matter dissolved in water regardless of the lack of specific health based guidelines tds levels below 600 mg l are considered suitable for drinking water and inadmissible when they reach values above 1000 mg l 70 both tds and ec are employed as water quality parameters as salinity indicators and can be measured directly by the equipment according to the classification by ref 71 the average ec values at all sampling points correspond to those of slightly saline waters apt for crop irrigation we set the ecosense ec300a to perform conductivity measurements with the temperature compensated to 25 c besides an almost perfect correlation between the two series r2 0 97 the tds ec ratio remained consistent throughout all stages with an average of 0 68 and a standard deviation equal to 0 08 comparable to natural water values 72 indicates that the correlation between tds and ec in wastewater is usually low due to the influence of many contaminants and the activity of specific dissolved ions but the results suggest that this was not the case with our experiment comparing wastewater from the ows and reclaimed water from the ozonator the treatment s efficiency did not exhibit clear increasing or decreasing trends in ten parameters monitored during the thirteen experimental runs fig 2 presents the behavior of these series even if the sample size is relatively small the absence of early clogging signs or a decline of the treatment capacity is a promising aspect of the system to be assessed in upcoming research to estimate the equipment s service life a piece of essential information to evaluate the long term or large scale feasibility of the arrangement also from a techno economical perspective and based on a 170 l average of water needed to wash a small car 30 57 the output from an employed ozonator would enable the treatment of the amount of wastewater equivalent to that required to wash 7 cars over a 10 h operation time however it is worth mentioning that the pump s flow rate enables upscaling of the overall system output by increasing the quantity or the size

resolution still requires further considerations and clarifications to encourage water reuse on a larger scale 56 for instance it does not specify which wastewater types are subject to reclamation and only considers reclaimed water for its reuse on a limited set of industrial and irrigation activities and carwashing is not among them the results of this study might serve as a starting point for addressing this issue besides resolution 1207 2014 for treated wastewater reuse colombian legislation includes resolution 2115 2007 which defines water s minimum characteristics required for human consumption 76 and resolution 631 2015 which regulates parameter limits for wastewater disposal 77 even if this study did not evaluate the complete set of microbiological and chemical variables listed

minimize the health risks stemming from irrigation with recycled water such as gastrointestinal and dermal diseases 4 conclusions this paper aimed to evaluate a bench scale system s carwash wastewater reclamation potential based on coagulation flocculation and household grade activated carbon filter and water ozonation the results from 13 experimental runs indicate that the reclamation system achieved a treatment efficiency of more than 70 for organic matter and 90 in color and turbidity with similar removal rates in the last three experimental runs that also tested the elimination of coliforms and oil and grease for most water quality variables under analysis the reclaimed water exhibited characteristics comparable to those of a groundwater source suggesting promising signs for similar carwash wastewater treatment systems nevertheless a more extended observation period in future research would help determine the equipment s effective service life a piece of essential information for its long term techno economic viability and implementation the reclaimed water meets most agricultural industrial and even drinkable water quality standards provided in the colombian legislation in force for water quality variables specified in this study the total coliforms count is above the acceptable limit for fire sprinkler systems and water for human consumption indicating that the system might benefit from chlorination or another process improving the removal rate of this pollutant additional research directions might include the potential reuse of the sludge produced

8779,this paper assesses a bench scale carwash wastewater treatment system s removal efficiency based on coagulation flocculation and a household type activated carbon filter and water ozonator for the experiment the wastewater that went through an oil water separator ows from a medium sized carwash facility located in a dense commercial area in barranquilla colombia was collected the study evaluates the following parameters water quality indicators recommended by the u s environmental protection agency and literature related to carwash water reclamation the treatment results are compared to related regional studies in latin america and colombian legislation in force experimental results evidence that reclaimed water s characteristics are similar to those of a groundwater source for most analyzed variables and the system was able to reduce organic matter concentrations considerably regarding the organoleptic characteristics the system eliminated foaming and generated a transparent and odorless product the coliform test showed that reclaimed water has an average total coliform count of around 5800 mpn 100 ml which is above the proposed health risk limit per most international standards for water reuse but as it complies with industrial wastewater and non food irrigation purposes in colombia additional disinfection is recommended depending on the reuse purpose the results from this research may assist future carwash wastewater reclamation regulations in colombia and the latin american region keywords water reclamation wastewater reuse carwash ozonation activated carbon 1 introduction the effects of climate change coupled with the increasing human population and its living standards have a significant impact on water availability and quality as they aggravate the unequal distribution of this resource worldwide 1 the challenges posed by water scarcity and increasing demands lead many countries to consider water reuse as the sustainable development of cities critically depends on water availability 2 3 water reclamation used synonymously with water recycling is the process of treating wastewater to enable its reuse by satisfying fit for purpose water quality criteria 4 around 80 of the total wastewater of the world is released directly to the environment without any treatment 5 by the beginning of the century the estimated wastewater reuse volume was less than 1 of the world s total water withdrawal 6 currently and led by china israel and some european countries around 5 of the global treated wastewater is reused in agriculture and for industrial applications 7 wastewater reclamation and reuse increase water supplies and might help reduce the pressure on aquifers and freshwater sources according to ref 8 the cost of recycled water can be as low as us 0 32 m³ for agricultural and industrial purposes and us 0 45 m³ for potable water which in some cases is cheaper than desalination us 0 50 m³ on average or than exploiting new water bodies or depleting existing resources recent studies have proven that most consumers are willing to pay and use reclaimed water only if the price is lower than that of conventional water 9 10 besides the economic aspect and based on surveys conducted in the united states over two decades other factors affecting the public acceptance of reclaimed water include the degree of human contact health risks clear definition of environmental and water conservation benefits high quality standards of the product and confidence in the authorities and technologies involved 11 the most common uses for recycled wastewater include irrigation 12 15 non drinkable household uses 16 18 environmental management and recreational uses 19 23 aquifer recharge 24 25 aquaculture 26 27 drinking water production 9 28 and industrial applications 29 31 according to the review paper by ref 32 non potable reuse is the most common usage for reclaimed water in small medium and large scale applications in most developing countries wastewater reclamation is not a common practice yet however many countries have made efforts in this direction by setting regulations encouraging water reuse following global trends around environmental protection and circular economy 33 34 carwashing is one of the regular daily life activities that consume large water volumes thus justifying efforts for reducing its impact on natural resources 35 36 wastewater from this process might include several pollutants including detergents high oil and grease concentrations fuel residues metals salts and organic matter 37 based on a sample of 3657 regular vehicles in ghana 38 determined that the average water consumption in the carwash process ranges within 70 l for motorbikes and 365 l for buses and vans with manual washing stations consuming between 30 and 50 more water than semi automated stations for a family car home carwashing consumes around 440 l of water 30 coupled with such a high level of water consumption the carwash industry in low income countries usually extracts unmetered groundwater for free and releases polluted wastewater into sewer systems and urban waterways negative consequences of such behavior include uncontrolled depletion of aquifers and potential pollution of soil and water bodies 38 therefore industry specific legislation is often required to minimize these risks along with water saving initiatives and practices examples from australia and some european countries show that it is possible to limit the maximum freshwater carwash consumption to less than 70 l per an average car or achieve a water recycling percentage of up to 80 observing significant revenue increases at the same time 4 38 there are many industrial water recycling systems developed for potable and non potable uses the review paper by ref 39 summarizes leading water treatment technologies producing recycled water of various qualities and varying range of technical and energy requirements for the carwash industry the most common technologies are coagulation adsorption membrane filtration electrochemical processes and methods that combine multiple technologies 40 besides studies aiming at maximizing water recycling water saving initiatives in the carwash industry include the efforts to achieve an optimal design of pipe nozzles and control devices for automated systems 41 several household water treatment technologies have been developed to improve drinking water quality and its organoleptic characteristics with different degrees of effectiveness in removing contaminants 42 among these technologies two are of particular interest for this research activated carbon filters and ozonation as they are widely available and often locally produced even in low income countries activated carbon filters are commonly employed in water and wastewater treatment both for households and industries as they can treat general taste and odor problems and remove impurities such as certain organic compounds and heavy metals 43 these devices enhance water quality through physical filtration as the porous structure of the carbonaceous material adsorbs most of the pollutants in the water flow nevertheless activated carbon filters are unsuitable for removing microbial contaminants and both the u s environmental protection agency u s epa and the world health organization recommend using additional treatment to reduce microbial risks 44 in use since the late 1800s ozonation is a water treatment process with an efficient microbicidal effect against bacteria viruses and protozoan 45 ozonation oxidizes micropollutants through a direct reaction with highly reactive ozone molecules or indirectly through hydroxyl radicals therefore the transformation of compounds usually results only in their partial removal from the effluent 46 since the early 2000s it has been the subject of research related to the carwash industry wastewater treatment the findings of many reports indicate that ozonation performs better than chlorination in clarifying water while having an additional advantage it does not leave undesirable odors nor does it generate carcinogenic compounds called trihalomethanes 4 47 this study evaluates a bench scale carwash wastewater treatment system s pollutant removal efficiency based on coagulation flocculation activated carbon and water ozonation technologies the analyzed arrangement comprises equipment commonly employed for household water treatment and purification this paper contributes to the literature on wastewater treatment and reclamation by assessing economic and already available alternatives which is especially relevant for developing countries where environmental legislation gaps limited access to state of the art technologies and inadequate local technical training are frequent constituting a combination that poses a risk to sustainability and future access to water resources additionally the reclaimed water characteristics from this work are compared with the existing colombian legislation related to water for human consumption wastewater disposal and reuse over the last ten years studies conducted in latin america around carwash wastewater recycling have combined different treatment technologies including flocculation column flotation fcf sand filtration chlorination 48 flocculation flotation ozonation 49 electrocoagulation electrooxidation 50 coagulation flocculation sedimentation 51 and rotating biological contactor filtration chlorination 52 the wastewater and reclaimed water characteristics reported in these papers are summarized in table 1 enabling a comparison with the results of this research especially in developing countries such as those of the latin american region 2 materials and method 2 1 evaluated parameters the pollutants found in carwash wastewater originate mainly from road surface contaminants atmospheric fallout combustion derived contaminants and carwash chemicals 53 the parameters evaluated in this study are in line with u s epa guidelines the 54 and existing literature regarding carwash wastewater treatment 4 30 48 49 table 2 presents the parameters under analysis and the examination methods 55 as well as equipment employed for conducting the task 2 2 case study and sampling this study employed wastewater collected from a 450 m2 carwash facility located in a dense commercial area in barranquilla colombia to test the described system the carwash does not include any automatic equipment the city s growth and the abundance of groundwater resources have stimulated the propagation of this type of economic activity these features coupled with legislative shortcomings and limited supervision from the authorities produce negative externalities with environmental impacts such as health and safety concerns caused by untreated effluent being discharged directly to the streets uncontrolled depletion of aquifers and squandering of local water resources 30 56 57 79 the samples were collected based on the procedures described in standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater between july and september 2019 thirteen batches of at least 40 liter wastewater units were gathered with the corresponding experimental run and analysis of the parameters under evaluation conducted within 24 h of collection for each experimental run three samples were collected and tested at each sampling point 1 downstream the oil water separator ows in the carwash facility 2 after the coagulation flocculation process 3 from the ozonator the tests related to total coliforms and oil and grease concentration were conducted only for three experimental runs because of logistical difficulties 2 3 the wastewater treatment system the system s main components include technologies commonly available for household applications and fig 1 shows the schematic representation of the carwash wastewater treatment system under study with the process described in the following subsections the capital cost of the equipment used in this bench scale experiment grease trap tanks filters pipe fittings pump and ozonator was about us 900 with the sum of the ozonator and the activated carbon filter accounting for 40 of the total 2 3 1 wastewater batch collection at the carwash facility a pump directly draws groundwater from a borehole storing the resource in an elevated tank to meet the business s operational requirements wastewater derived from the carwashing process pre soak wash and rinse is collected by an in bay pit which serves as a desander and coarse material separator following the pit the carwash employed as the case study currently disposes wastewater directly to the city sewage system water extracted from the in bay pit is passed through a 95 liter polyethylene ows to reduce the equipment s clogging risk each experimental run requires a minimum of 40 liters of wastewater to be treated by the system and the batches are collected downstream of the ows which is also the first sampling point these volumes are taken directly to the laboratory of the universidad de la costa for the treatment process to be continued 2 3 2 coagulation flocculation process for the system s 40 l coagulation flocculation tank two airstone bubblers replicate gentle mixing conducted in the jar test this aerator type is extensively used in house aquariums and for the experiment the bubblers were set 10 cm above the tank s bottom allowing for sedimentation to occur the jar tests followed the procedures described by the colombian institute of technical standards and certification 58 which constitute an equivalent to the practices described in astm d 2035 90 based on previous research 51 59 the 1 ferric chloride fecl3 solution was chosen as the coagulant for this experiment it is worth mentioning that fecl3 is highly corrosive thus reclaimed water should be avoided for the final rinse 52 60 ten possible dosages within the range of 20 mg l and 120 mg l mg of fecl3 per liter of wastewater were tested on nine preliminary wastewater samples from the site before the actual experimental runs were conducted from these analyses an initial dose of 90 mg l allowed for the best clarification conditions for the combined assessment of ph absorbancy color and alkalinity once the operation was complete and the flocs settled the clarified water second sampling point was passed on to another tank and the sediments from the coagulation flocculation process were safely discarded 2 3 3 activated carbon and ozonation besides the ows and the coagulation flocculation tank the system s configuration comprises two additional household water treatment devices an activated water carbon filter flow rate capacity 4 l min and a water ozonator nominal power 12 w flow rate capacity 2 l min research related to utility scale wastewater treatment plants has previously evaluated this technology combination 61 62 the system analyzed in this paper includes granular multimedia filters installed in both devices to extend these pieces of equipment s service life a ½ hp pump flow rate 40 l circulates water from the clarified water recirculation tank to the rest of the system the ozonator s flow rate determines the system s output resulting in an estimated residence time of 20 min for a 40 liter wastewater batch volume as the flow provided by the pump is higher than that of the ozonator the excess is recirculated reducing cavitation risks at the same time water coming from the ozonator is then sampled for the third and final time 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall system performance as previously mentioned in the method s description most of the parameters were analyzed for thirteen experimental runs except for total coliforms and oil and grease tested only in the last three with three samples taken at each corresponding point additionally we tested nine samples from a groundwater well and wastewater downstream of the ows to set a baseline before initiating the experiment table 3 summarizes this information and presents the treatment s efficiency by comparing wastewater from the ows and reclaimed water as shown in table 3 the average ph for all stages stood at medium range values 6 6 7 8 with low coefficients of variation for each sampling point allowing ozone to oxidize dissolved organic matter in neutral ph 49 alkalinity is a measure of water s capacity to resist sudden changes in ph and it is determined primarily by the presence of hydroxides carbonates and bicarbonates 63 alkalinity levels in typical drinking water range between 20 and 200 mg l low ph and alkalinity levels in water lead to corrosion in pipes whereas high values cause precipitation which is also detrimental 64 in our experiment the alkalinity behavior is consequent with ph and both parameters values in reclaimed water are similar to those from a groundwater source dissolved oxygen is a water quality indicator because it directly influences aquatic ecosystems and wastewater treatment processes it is also a parameter included in water reclamation standards 65 the carwashing process reduces the concentration of dissolved oxygen to less than half of that measured in groundwater still the system s coagulation flocculation procedures help restore the values to adequate levels reported in carwash wastewater literature 66 an effect that might be an additional benefit of employing the airstone bubblers to perform the mixing a high cod to bod ratio cod bod 2 5 characterizes wastewater with a significant non biodegradable organics fraction 67 based on table 3 wastewater produced in the carwashing process falls within the cod bod medium range with untreated domestic sewage characteristics with a low concentration of organics 63 the results show that most organic matter removal occurs during the coagulation flocculation process 69 for cod 55 for bod the system was able to considerably reduce the bod and cod concentrations in reclaimed water resulting in levels comparable to those from the studies summarized in table 1 and in terms of these two organic matter indicators the average end product is of better quality than the groundwater resource one of the major concerns regarding water reuse for irrigation in developing countries is that raw or inadequately treated wastewater contains numerous pathogens and infectious agents posing health risks for crop consumers and producers 63 coliform bacteria are considered reliable water quality indicators based on the hypothesis that these organisms presence in water could indicate recent fecal contamination 55 for this experiment we conducted coliform tests on samples from the final three experimental runs with reclaimed water having an average total coliform count of around 5800 mpn 100 ml which is above the proposed health risk limit of 1000 mpn 100 ml indicating the need for additional disinfection 48 63 we achieved similar removal rates and a lower final total coliform count than those reported in previous studies summarized in table 1 and adding chlorination to the system could further reduce the count additionally 4 state that 200 mpn 100 ml of e coli poses a low microbiological risk for car wash operators a consideration to include in future studies the results in table 3 indicate that oil and grease removal occurred in the filters and ozonator which is in line with previous research findings 68 69 as in the case of the coliform tests oil and grease quantification was conducted only in the final experimental runs and future studies would require determining the backwash or replacement periodicity of the equipment based on more extensive data series total dissolved solids tds encompass inorganic salts and small quantities of organic matter dissolved in water regardless of the lack of specific health based guidelines tds levels below 600 mg l are considered suitable for drinking water and inadmissible when they reach values above 1000 mg l 70 both tds and ec are employed as water quality parameters as salinity indicators and can be measured directly by the equipment according to the classification by ref 71 the average ec values at all sampling points correspond to those of slightly saline waters apt for crop irrigation we set the ecosense ec300a to perform conductivity measurements with the temperature compensated to 25 c besides an almost perfect correlation between the two series r2 0 97 the tds ec ratio remained consistent throughout all stages with an average of 0 68 and a standard deviation equal to 0 08 comparable to natural water values 72 indicates that the correlation between tds and ec in wastewater is usually low due to the influence of many contaminants and the activity of specific dissolved ions but the results suggest that this was not the case with our experiment comparing wastewater from the ows and reclaimed water from the ozonator the treatment s efficiency did not exhibit clear increasing or decreasing trends in ten parameters monitored during the thirteen experimental runs fig 2 presents the behavior of these series even if the sample size is relatively small the absence of early clogging signs or a decline of the treatment capacity is a promising aspect of the system to be assessed in upcoming research to estimate the equipment s service life a piece of essential information to evaluate the long term or large scale feasibility of the arrangement also from a techno economical perspective and based on a 170 l average of water needed to wash a small car 30 57 the output from an employed ozonator would enable the treatment of the amount of wastewater equivalent to that required to wash 7 cars over a 10 h operation time however it is worth mentioning that the pump s flow rate enables upscaling of the overall system output by increasing the quantity or the size of the water treatment equipment regarding the organoleptic characteristics of reclaimed water the results indicate that the system can control the malodor sources eliminate foaming and generate an aesthetically favorable product which is in line with previous research on wastewater treatment that included ozonation 49 61 for illustration purposes fig 3 displays one beaker with water from each sampling point obtained from the twelfth experimental run whose initial color and turbidity are similar to the mean values obtained from 48 samples collected downstream the ows the success of water recycling initiatives depends heavily on public acceptance and the aesthetic characteristics of reclaimed water including turbidity color and odor are fundamental for this receptivity mainly for
