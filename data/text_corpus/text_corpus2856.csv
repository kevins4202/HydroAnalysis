liquefaction co product hydrothermal liquefaction htl biochar methylene blue 1 introduction currently the energy crisis mainly relates to emissions from burning fossil fuel in power plants and from an increasing number of cars and trucks both problems are closely related to life quality and environmental challenges 1 biofuel could be considered as an alternative to conventional fuels because of their properties such as low emissions lower sox carbon monoxide and particulate matter and biodegradability 2 3 biofuel can be produced by different biomass types as raw material and several different methods can be utilized for biomass to energy conversion recent studies have focused on algae as the feedstock for biofuel production because of their fast growth rate high biomass productivity adaptability to various climates and ability to thrive on lands not suitable for agriculture desert or useless seashore they use less water than other biomasses furthermore they can be utilized in wastewater treatment they are also known for their co2 capturing ability o2 production and harvesting success without dependency on the seasons 4 5 in the htl process harmful byproducts such as sox and nox are much lower than those in other methods and also heteroatoms materials in the feedstock are degraded into harmless byproducts 6 7 currently bio oil production by htl process from algae is very common most researches have been focused on microalgae as raw material however utilizing macroalgae instead of microalgae can reduce the harvesting cost in the biofuel production system because of their easy separation from cultivation media as a result of larger size 8 the biochemical composition of macroalgae differs in that it is mostly made up of biochemical compounds that usually include protein and carbohydrates such as laminarin and mannitol 9 macroalgae biomass typically does not take up areas that can be used for growing food in addition several forms of macroalgae biomass are used in carbon fixation i e bioremediation 10 further research has focused on the liquid phase of macroalgae or bio oil as the main product 7 12 however the application of other co products of biofuel production can further reduce the cost of hydrothermal conversion integrated systems biochar is the most important co product of macroalgae hydrothermal liquefaction biochar a pyrogenic black carbon is porous and has several oxygen functional groups as well as a large specific surface area and high mineral content 13 it has different physical and chemical characteristics depending on the feedstock utilized in the htl process 14 the biochar yield or solid residue of htl reaction directly relates to ash and the carbohydrate content in raw materials both of which in most of the macroalgae species are more than those in microalgae species 8 the produced biochar from a thermochemical conversion process can adsorb wastewater contaminants including organic pollutants 15 heavy metals 16 and other pollutants 17 the presence of organic pollutants such as dyes in industrial effluents causes serious environmental problems wastewater containing a high amount of dye compounds occur extremely in the textile paper leather plastic printing and cosmetic industries commercial activated carbon usually used as an effective adsorbent for removal of this type of pollutants 18 however the high cost of activated carbon and its non renewable nature are the main drawbacks that have caused the attention of researchers to be attracted to other materials 19 the objective of this study is to investigate the adsorption capabilities of hydrothermally produced biochar of the two species of macroalgae we used methylene blue dye mb as adsorbate in aqueous solutions the physical and chemical properties of the obtained biochars were determined through elemental analysis chns bet surface area fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermal gravity

dosage ph and contact time were investigated to find out the behavior of each biochar in different operational conditions the equilibrium and kinetics of the adsorption process were also investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 feedstock samples of red macroalgae gracilaria gracilis and green macroalgae cladophora glomerata were collected during the summer june 2015 from sisangan and dastak north coastal area of iran respectively these biomass feedstocks were dried in open air and at 60 c for 6 h and then ground to a mean particle size of 150 μm 2 2 production of macroalgae biochar the hydrothermal liquefaction process was performed in a stainless steel reactor 75 ml with the heating rate of 20 c min the reactor was charged with 3 g of dried macroalgae and 30 ml of water 12 then it was purged with n2 to remove the residual air present in the free volume of the reactor before closing it the reactor was heated to 350 c for 15 min because these conditions were found to give the maximum bio oil yield in previous study 12 after that the reactor was cooled by ice and water and the solid phase biochar was separated from liquid phase finally the biochars were washed several times with di water until the ph value of wash water was in the range of 7 7 5 2 3 characterization elemental composition of materials was analyzed by using a thermo finnegan flashea 1112 series fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of biochar samples were obtained using a bruker ft ir spectrometer proximate analysis was achieved using a tga analyzer netzsch sta 449 f3 the metal contents of the ashes were evaluated by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry icp with optical emission spectroscopy oes on a perkin elmer optima 5300dv the moisture content mc volatile matter vm fixed carbon fc and ash content were determined by the mass loss after heating the sample to 800 c under n2 atmosphere the surface morphology of biochars was tested by the hitachi s 4160 scanning electron microscope sem the surface area and porosity of the biochars were obtained from an n2 adsorptive at 196 c using a belsorp mini surface area analyzer belsorp mini japan the contents of oxygen containing acidic surface functional groups of biochars were determined according to the boehm s titration method 20 21 briefly 0 2 g of prepared biochar samples were added to a dilute hcl solution ph 2 and shaken for two days after filtering the samples were washed several times with deionized water until neutralized afterward they were added to 25 ml portions of the 0 05 mol l solutions of nahco3 neutralizes carboxyl groups only na2co3 neutralizes carboxyl and lactonic groups and naoh neutralizes carbonyl lactonic and phenolic groups after that the mixture was shaken for 48 h at room temperature and then filtered to neutralize the remaining base the filtrates were titrated with 0 05 mol l hcl the contents of functional groups were calculated using the titration data the point of zero charge phpzc of biochars were measured based on the method reported by tan et al 22 in brief the ph of 0 01 m nacl solutions were adjusted to different values between 2 and 11 by the addition of 0 1 m hcl or naoh solutions then these solutions were mixed with the biochars after a contact time of 48 h under shaking the final ph values were determined and plotted against the initial ph 2 4 adsorption studies methylene blue mb dye was selected for biochar adsorption studies the important operational parameters for investigation of mb adsorption were adsorbent dosage 0 3 1 8 g l contact time 15 180 min ph 2 10 adjusted by 0 1 mol l hcl or naoh and initial mb concentration 25 450 mg l all batch experiments carried out using 50 ml portions of dye solution containing a known amount of biochars after achieving equilibrium the samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm and analyzed with a hach dr 5000 spectrophotometer loveland colo usa at a wavelength of 665 nm the adsorption capacity qe mg g was calculated by 1 q e c 0 c e m v where co is the initial dye concentration mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration in the solution mg l v is the volume of solution ml and m is the biochar mass mg in the desorption studies the potential of biochar reusability was investigated through five cycles of dye adsorption desorption for this purpose 0 06 g of each biochar sample was utilized in 50 ml of mb with an initial concentration of 25 mg l the removal efficiency was determined to observe the sustainable operation of the biochar samples for removal of mb for several cycles 3 results 3 1 characterization of biochar 3 1 1 chemical composition analysis table 1 shows the yield and elemental analysis of macroalgae biochar samples the higher carbohydrate and ash content can lead to higher biochar yields 23 the yields of biochar production were 15 1 and 15 0 wt for g gracilis and c glomerata macroalgae respectively the derived biochar samples from both macroalgae species had more carbon hydrogen and ash content than their feedstock but their oxygen contents decreased after the htl process the high carbon content of biochar samples resulted from the condensation and carbonization reaction under htl condition the h c and o c ratios in biochar samples were decreased by demethylation and decarboxylation during htl reaction 24 the inorganics content of the biomass and the biochar is dependent on the feedstock as has been shown in table 1 the ash recovery which obtain from the ratio of the ash content of biochar to the ash content of macroalgae samples multiplied by yield of biochar was 25 2 for g gracilis and 25 75 for c glomerata the major ash forming elements within biochars are presented in table 2 biomasses with higher concentrations of silicon and metal elements specially iron appear to result in an increasingly high amount of ash within the biochar while those without high amount of silicon and iron have a decreasing content of ash within the biochars 25 on the other hand precipitates of some inorganic species could be formed under hydrothermal conditions which can result in the decrease of inorganics solubility dai et al concluded that when there are enough anions such as phosphate and carbonate ca precipitates could be formed under hydrothermal conditions 26 as can be seen from table 2 the significant amount of silica within the ashes is one of the main reason for the high ash content of biochars the role of silica is to form molecular bonds with carbon which are not easily broken even at gasification temperatures 27 3 1 2 tga analysis fig 1 a illustrates the decomposition of macroalgae and related biochar samples under thermogravimetric analysis the most thermal degradation of g gracilis and c glomerata occurred at 200 400 c the residue content of biochar samples after heating up to 800 c reached 44 8 and 59 96 from 26 1 and 36 in related raw materials i e g gracilis and c glomerata macroalgae respectively tga analysis showed that most macroalgae functional groups decomposition occurred at 350 c higher ash content will result in higher inorganic compounds and ph of a solution the ph of the reactors content were measured at the end of htl process the ph values of the reactors content which contain g gracilis and c glomerata were 11 2 and 11 respectively because of the decomposition of organic acids and carbonates through the htl process the alkali salts were released in ash and increases the ph of products 29 30 3 1 3 ftir analysis oxygen containing acidic surface functional groups hydroxyl phenolic aldehydic ketonic and carboxylic on the surface of biochar which are active binding sites for the adsorption process were derived from macromolecules in macroalgae 31 the ftir spectra of g gracilis and c glomerata fig 1 b showed the intense bonds at 3400 1 cm oh stretching vibration which can be allocated to hydroxyl functional groups 32 the absorbance bonds at 2900 1 cm 1600 1 cm and 1100 1 cm were assigned to vibration modes of c h aromatic cc and coc bonds respectively 33 34 furthermore the intense peak at 1069 1 cm siosi stretching vibration is due to high silica content of the biomasses and consequently the ash content of the biochars 35 the following indices obtained from the integration of absorbance peak regions were utilized to evaluate the chemical properties of biochars aromaticity the degree of the aromatic ring aliphatic chain length oxygen function groups and c factor 36 the ratio of the co to cc stretching group c factor was used as a criterion for describing oxygen containing groups in samples 37 38 the selected regions of functional groups and the semi quantitative ratios of integrated areas are presented in fig 1 and table 3 respectively as shown in table 3 the aliphatic ch2 stretching 2900 2940 1 cm aliphatic ch3 stretching 2940 3000 1 cm ratio increased these ratios indicated a decrease in aliphatic chain length and degree of branching of aliphatic side groups after htl conversion the c factor for c glomerata macroalgae did not show a significant difference however this value for g gracilismacroalgae showed a clear increase and also showed that the htl process led to the formation of higher amounts of oxygen containing groups on the basis of two aromaticity indices the aromaticity of samples under htl conditions decreased significantly and the aliphatic content increased for biochar samples 3 1 4 biochar surface properties the biochar surface properties of macroalgae depend on the production procedure and raw material properties table 4 shows the surface area average pore size and total pore volume of each biochar sample obtained by brunauer emmett and teller method bet the bet surface area of c glomeratabiochar 6 45 m2 g was larger than that of the g gracilisbiochar 2 11 m2 g as reported in other research the biochars obtained from macroalgae typically have small surface area 39 after the htl process the surface area increases due to the escape of volatile materials produced from cellulose and hemicellulose contents of macroalgae the biochars produced from g gracilis and c glomerata had pore diameters of 15 08 and 9 43 nm respectively consequently they were classified as mesoporous material between 2 and 50 nm the boehm titration data results are shown in table 4 the total oxygenated groups in both biochar samples were as high as 3 08 and 3 59 meq g for g gracilis and c glomerata respectively the results of boehm titration were consistent with the ftir analysis data of biochars as can be seen from fig 1 b the surface functional groups of the biochars are mostly oxygen containing acidic groups more oxygen containing acidic functional groups on the surface of biochars provide more negative active sites due to the deprotonation of functional groups in aqueous environment the phpzc illustrates the surface charge of adsorbent in different solution ph the phpzc values of g gracilis and c glomerata biochars were obtained 2 6 and 2 8 respectively the surface of g gracilis and c glomerata become negatively charged when the ph of solutions is above 2 6 and 2 8 respectively therefore both biochars are favorable for efficient adsorption of cationic ions by electrostatic attraction in alkaline environment under the htl process raw material structure and composition can greatly change it is clear from the sem images fig 2 that both macroalgae samples had the smooth surface with a sheet like structure which was destroyed after the htl process instead small and porous particles with rough surfaces were obtained the dust on the biochar surface may be related to decomposition of the small size sheets in the macroalgae as feedstock in the htl reaction 3 2 adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph investigation of the ph is inevitable because of its significant influence on the ionization of the dye molecules as well as on the binding functional groups of the adsorbent hence the solubility of the dye and the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent are directly affected by the ph of the solution 40 fig 3 a shows the effect of solution ph on the adsorption capacity of g gracilis and c glomerata biochars for both biochars the removal efficiencies increased significantly by increasing the ph from 2 to 3 since the surface charge of biochars changed from positive to negative phsolution phpzc and the electrostatic attraction between mb ions and the surface of biochars was developed nevertheless in acidic medium the concentration of h is high which compete with mb for adsorption hence the removal efficiency in acidic medium was relatively lower than in the alkali environment 41 however the deprotonation of oxygen containing acidic groups at higher ph values increases the number of negatively charged sites and enhances the attraction between dye cations and the biochars surface 42 initial ph of mb solutions before adding biochars was 6 7 so this ph without further adjustment was chosen for the subsequent experiments 3 2 2 effect of initial mb concentration as shown in fig 3 b the removal efficiency decreased significantly with an increase in the initial mb concentration because the amount of the adsorbent s reactive sites is constant in addition an increase in the dye concentration provides a driving force for mb ions to be adsorbed on the available reactive sites 43 at lower initial dye concentrations the removal efficiency was relatively high due to the availability of sufficient unoccupied reactive sites to adsorb mb ions 44 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent dosage fig 3 c shows the effect of adsorbent dosage ranging from 0 3 to 1 8 g l on the removal efficiency of mb as can be seen the removal efficiency increased significantly by increasing the adsorbent dosage from 0 3 to 1 2 g l due to increasing active sites for adsorption of dye ions on the other hand the adsorbate mb ions concentration provides the necessary driving force to surmount the resistance to mass transfer of adsorbate ions between the solution bulk and the adsorbent surface which plays a key role in the adsorption efficiency 45 therefore at the higher dosage of the adsorbent with many vacant active sites if the concentration and the availability of dye ions are not sufficient for appropriate mass transfer the removal efficiency remains approximately constant in other words by increasing the concentration of adsorbate to a certain amount the adsorption capacity of adsorbent will increase similar results have been reported in previous studies 46 47 3 2 4 effects of contact time and temperature fig 3 d provides the effect of contact time on the removal efficiency of mb by biochars the high adsorption rate was observed within 60 min after the start of mixing which was due to the availability of abundant vacant active sites and a high concentration of dye ions after 60 min the adsorption rate increased slowly due to saturation of active sites and reduction of mb concentration and the adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 2 h the increase of contact time from 2 to 24 did not have any significant effect on the removal efficiency therefore the contact time of 2 h was selected for subsequent adsorption isotherm experiments 3 2 5 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms have been used to estimate the maximum adsorption capacity and to study the behavior of biochars in the adsorption process the langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin models were used to fit the experimental data for each model linear regression was used to compare and find the best model the correlation coefficient r2 the residual root mean square error rmse and the chi square test χ2 were applied to investigate the fitting of the adsorption isotherms to the equilibrium data eqs 2 and 3 2 r m e s 1 n p i 1 n q e e x p q e c a l i 2 3 χ 2 i 1 n q e e x p q e c a l 2 q e c a l i where qe exp is the experimental adsorption capacity qe cal is the calculated adsorption capacity n is the number of experimental data p is the number of parameters within model equation the linear forms of studied models and the obtained results are presented in table 5 the comparison of r2 values indicated the langmuir model with the r2 value of 0 995 was the best fitting model for the g gracilis biochar s equilibrium data furthermore the langmuir model exhibited lower χ2 and rmse values than the other isotherm models however in the case of c glomeratabiochar the freundlich model with the r2 value of 0 999 was found to fit the data well as can be seen from table 5 the x 2 and rmse values of the freundlich model were lower than those of other models accordingly the langmuir and freundlich models were considered as the best fitting models to describe the adsorption behavior of mb onto g gracilis and c glomerata biochars respectively furthermore the predicted maximum adsorption capacities were very close to the experimentally obtained data the calculated maximum adsorption capacity of c glomerata and g gracilis biochars using langmuir model were 226 28 and 104 07 mg g respectively fig 4 a and b show the experimental and corresponding calculated data through the mentioned adsorption isotherm models which confirms the results of error analysis as can be seen at low concentrations more than one isotherm model has good agreement with the experimental data however by increasing the concentration of adsorbate the actual behavior of the adsorbents can be determined hence the range of dye concentration was chosen wide enough to provide a significant difference between isotherm models as can be seen from table 5 under the same conditions the adsorption capacity of c glomerata biochar was greater than g gracilis biochar as the specific surface area of the biochars was low the difference between their adsorption capacity cannot be due to the difference between specific surface area however the higher adsorption capacity of c glomerata can be attributed to their different adsorptive behavior freundlich against langmuir model and the higher amount of oxygen containing acidic surface functional groups table 4 3 2 6 adsorption kinetics to investigate the characteristic adsorption mechanism the applicability of the pseudo first order pseudo second order intraparticle diffusion and elovich kinetic models were tested for the mb adsorption onto c glomerata and g gracilis biochars the linear forms of investigated models calculated kinetic parameters and their corresponding error analysis parameters including r2 χ2 and rmse are summarized in table 6 with regard to the r2 χ2 and rmse values it can be concluded that the pseudo first order intraparticle diffusion and elovich models have exhibited poor fit to the experimental data of both biochars however the r2 χ2 and rmse values of the pseudo second order model confirmed that this model exhibited a very good fitting with the experimental data of both biochars furthermore the estimated adsorption capacity by this model had a good agreement with the obtained experimental data as a result the pseudo second order model was considered to be the best fitting model for both biochars fig 4 c and d show the experimental and predicted data using investigated kinetic models at a dye concentration of 450 mg l as can be seen all data were well predicted by the pseudo second order model indeed the pseudo second model represents the external liquid film diffusion surface adsorption and intra particle diffusion processes 48 and confirms that in the adsorption process the rate limiting step is chemisorption 49 to recognize the adsorption mechanism in different phases over the time the intraparticle kinetic model was investigated separately as can be seen in fig 4 f the adsorption process can be divided into two phases the initial phase up to 60 min had a steep slope which is related to the fast diffusion of adsorbate across the external boundary layer to the surface of biochars however the second phase from 60 to 180 min with a gentle slope is related to diffusion into the pores of biochars 50 the linear plots did not pass through the origin indicating that the adsorption rate using biochars did not control only through intraparticle diffusion 50 3 3 desorption and regeneration of biochars investigation of biochar reusability was conducted by using the acidic solution as the desorption agent in this study desorption of mb ions from exhausted adsorbents was performed using a 0 1 mol l hcl solution and the results showed that c glomerata and g gracilis biochars were regenerable as can be seen from fig 5 after five repeated adsorption and desorption cycles the adsorption efficiency of c glomerata and g gracilis iochars reduced to 90 and 80 respectively as a consequence the concentration of h was high enough to provide a large driving force toward the active sites of the adsorbent therefore the mb ions were desorbed from the surface of the adsorbent these results indicated that the electrostatic interaction was one of the main driving force for the adsorption of mb 3 4 possible mechanisms of mb adsorption onto c glomerata and g graciis biochar there are several possible mechanisms for adsorption of mb onto biochars therefore the adsorption of mb by biochars is a complicated process according to the pseudo second order kinetic model the adsorption process of mb onto biochars includes physical acting and chemical bonding 51 in other words the involved processes in the adsorption by biochars are external liquid film diffusion surface adsorption and intra particle diffusion processes based on the effect of ph on the adsorption process and also desorption study it can be concluded that the adsorption mechanism of mb onto biochars includes electrostatic interaction the htl process for the production of macroalgae biochar can be affected by many parameters such as reaction temperature time salt content inorganic materials and biochemical composition of the macroalgae feedstock 52 inorganic materials may have a catalytic role in htl reaction biochemical composition of macroalgae is an important factor in biochar characteristics and properties 23 functional groups on the biochar surface directly relate to compounds present in macroalgae such as carbohydrate and protein all pathways of biochar formation are related to the production of soluble polymers in the reaction 53 a nucleation growth mechanism can explain the production of solid biochar from soluble polymers in the solution phase 54 when the concentration of pahs increases and then reaches a critical saturation point a burst nucleation process can be accomplished thus biochar is formed by several species in aqueous solution the type of these species has a significant effect on reactive oxygen functional groups hydroxyl carbonyl carboxylic etc these functional groups were detected on the biochar surface by ftir analysis and determined using the boehm titration method according to ftir analysis fig 1 b surface complexation including hydrogen bonding and electronic attraction and functional groups as active sites such as oh cooh co ch participate in the adsorption process of mb onto the biochars 51 furthermore the produced biochars have an aromatic structure therefore mb with an aromatic structure can be adsorbed through π π stacking interaction onto the biochars 55 fig 6 schematically illustrates the possible mechanisms of mb adsorption onto c glomerata and g gracilis biochars including surface complexation electrostatic interaction physical function and π π stacking interaction 3 5 comparison with other biochars for the removal of mb up to now many biochars as adsorbent have been reported for the adsorption of mb the maximum adsorption capacities of c glomerata and g gracilis and other biochars for removal of mb are summarized in table 6 as it can be observed the adsorption capacities of the investigated biochars were significantly higher than those of other biochars reported previously table 7 4 conclusions two biochar samples derived from c glomerata and g gracilis macroalgae as the main co products of htl process for biofuel production were effectively applied for mb removal from aqueous solutions the removal efficiency decreased by decreasing ph the adsorption equilibrium data of c glomerata and g gracilis biochars were in agreement with the freundlich and langmuir isotherms respectively in addition the maximum adsorption capacities for methylene blue were 226 and 104 mg g for c glomerata and g gracilis respectively the experimental results for both biochars were fitted to the pseudo second order model desorption and regeneration experiments illustrated that prepared biochars could be a reusable adsorbent for mb adsorption compared with other biochars c glomerata and g gracilis have superior adsorption capacities according to the obtained results electrostatic interaction surface complexation physical function and π π stacking interaction involved in the mechanism of mb adsorption onto biochars as a result the biochar or solid residue produced from htl processing of macroalgae had a potential to be an attractive adsorbent for the removal of contaminants from wastewater acknowledgment the authors wish to acknowledge the nanotechnology and waste to energy research centers of college of engineering

showed that c glomerata and g gracilis biochars were regenerable and after five adsorption and desorption cycles their adsorption efficiencies reduced to 90 and 89 respectively keywords macroalgae

biochars were measured based on the method reported by tan et al 22 in brief the ph of 0 01 m nacl solutions were adjusted to different values between 2 and 11 by the addition of 0 1 m hcl or naoh solutions then these solutions were mixed with the biochars after a contact time of 48 h under shaking the final ph values were determined and plotted against the initial ph 2 4 adsorption studies methylene blue mb dye was selected for biochar adsorption studies the important operational parameters for investigation of mb adsorption were adsorbent dosage 0 3 1 8 g l contact time 15 180 min ph 2 10 adjusted by 0 1 mol l hcl or naoh and initial mb concentration 25 450 mg l all batch experiments carried out using 50 ml portions of dye solution containing a known amount of biochars after achieving equilibrium the samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm and analyzed with a hach dr 5000 spectrophotometer loveland colo usa at a wavelength of 665 nm the adsorption capacity qe mg g was calculated by 1 q e c 0 c e m v where co is the initial dye concentration mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration in the solution mg l v is the volume of solution ml and m is the biochar mass mg in the desorption studies the potential of biochar reusability was investigated through five cycles of dye adsorption desorption for this purpose 0 06 g of each biochar sample was utilized in 50 ml of mb with an initial concentration of 25 mg l the removal efficiency was determined to observe the sustainable operation of the biochar samples for removal of mb for several cycles 3 results 3 1 characterization of biochar 3 1 1 chemical composition analysis table 1 shows the yield and elemental analysis of macroalgae biochar samples the higher carbohydrate and ash content can lead to higher biochar yields 23 the yields of biochar production were 15 1 and 15 0 wt for g gracilis and c glomerata macroalgae respectively the derived biochar samples from both macroalgae species had more carbon hydrogen and ash content than their feedstock but their oxygen contents decreased after the htl process the high carbon content of biochar samples resulted from the condensation and carbonization reaction under htl condition the h c and o c ratios in biochar samples were decreased by demethylation and decarboxylation during htl reaction 24 the inorganics content of the biomass and the biochar is dependent on the feedstock as has been shown in table 1 the ash recovery which obtain from the ratio of the ash content of biochar to the ash content of macroalgae samples multiplied by yield of biochar was 25 2 for g gracilis and 25 75 for c glomerata the major ash forming elements within biochars are presented in table 2 biomasses with higher concentrations of silicon and metal elements specially iron appear to result in an increasingly high amount of ash within the biochar while those without high amount of silicon and iron have a decreasing content of ash within the biochars 25 on the other hand precipitates of some inorganic species could be formed under hydrothermal conditions which can result in the decrease of inorganics solubility dai et al concluded that when there are enough anions such as phosphate and carbonate ca precipitates could be formed under hydrothermal conditions 26 as can be seen from table 2 the significant amount of silica within the ashes is one of the main reason for the high ash content of biochars the role of silica is to form molecular bonds with carbon which are not easily broken even at gasification temperatures 27 3 1 2 tga analysis fig 1 a illustrates the decomposition of macroalgae and related biochar samples under thermogravimetric analysis the most thermal degradation of g gracilis and c glomerata occurred at 200 400 c the residue content of biochar samples after heating up to 800 c reached 44 8 and 59 96 from 26 1 and 36 in related raw materials i e g gracilis and c glomerata macroalgae respectively tga analysis showed that most macroalgae functional groups decomposition occurred at 350 c higher ash content will result in higher inorganic compounds and ph of a solution the ph of the reactors content were measured at the end of htl process the ph values of the reactors content which contain g gracilis and c glomerata were 11 2 and 11 respectively because of the decomposition of organic acids and carbonates through the htl process the alkali salts were released in ash and increases the ph of products 29 30 3 1 3 ftir analysis oxygen containing acidic surface functional groups hydroxyl phenolic aldehydic ketonic and carboxylic on the surface of biochar which are active binding sites for the adsorption process were derived from macromolecules in macroalgae 31 the ftir spectra of g gracilis and c glomerata fig 1 b showed the intense bonds at 3400 1 cm oh stretching vibration which can be allocated to hydroxyl functional groups 32 the absorbance bonds at 2900 1 cm 1600 1 cm and 1100 1 cm were assigned to vibration modes of c h aromatic cc and coc bonds respectively 33 34 furthermore the intense peak at 1069 1 cm siosi stretching vibration is due to high silica content of the biomasses and consequently the ash content of the biochars 35 the following indices obtained from the integration of absorbance peak regions were utilized to evaluate the chemical properties of biochars aromaticity the degree of the aromatic ring aliphatic chain length oxygen function groups and c factor 36 the ratio of the co to cc stretching group c factor was used as a criterion for describing oxygen containing groups in samples 37 38 the selected regions of functional groups and the semi quantitative ratios of integrated areas are presented in fig 1 and table 3 respectively as shown in table 3 the aliphatic ch2 stretching 2900 2940 1 cm aliphatic ch3 stretching 2940 3000 1 cm ratio increased these ratios indicated a decrease in aliphatic chain length and degree of branching of aliphatic side groups after htl conversion the c factor for c glomerata macroalgae did not show a significant difference however this value for g gracilismacroalgae showed a clear increase and also showed that the htl process led to the formation of higher amounts of oxygen containing groups on the basis of two aromaticity indices the aromaticity of samples under htl conditions decreased significantly and the aliphatic content increased for biochar samples 3 1 4 biochar surface properties the biochar surface properties of macroalgae depend on the production procedure and raw material properties table 4 shows the surface area average pore size and total pore volume of each biochar sample obtained by brunauer emmett and teller method bet the bet surface area of c glomeratabiochar 6 45 m2 g was larger than that of the g gracilisbiochar 2 11 m2 g as reported in other research the biochars obtained from macroalgae typically have small surface area 39 after the htl process the surface area increases due to the escape of volatile materials produced from cellulose and hemicellulose contents of macroalgae the biochars produced from g gracilis and c glomerata had pore diameters of 15 08 and 9 43 nm respectively consequently they were classified as mesoporous material between 2 and 50 nm the boehm titration data results are shown in table 4 the total oxygenated groups in both biochar samples were as high as 3 08 and 3 59 meq g for g gracilis and c glomerata respectively the results of boehm titration were consistent with the ftir analysis data of biochars as can be seen from fig 1 b the surface functional groups of the biochars are mostly oxygen containing acidic groups more oxygen containing acidic functional groups on the surface of biochars provide more negative active sites due to the deprotonation of functional groups in aqueous environment the phpzc illustrates the surface charge of adsorbent in different solution ph the phpzc values of g gracilis and c glomerata biochars were obtained 2 6 and 2 8 respectively the surface of g gracilis and c glomerata become negatively charged when the ph of solutions is above 2 6 and 2 8 respectively therefore both biochars are favorable for efficient adsorption of cationic ions by electrostatic attraction in alkaline environment under the htl process raw material structure and composition can greatly change it is clear from the sem images fig 2 that both macroalgae samples had the smooth surface with a sheet like structure which was destroyed after the htl process instead small and porous particles with rough surfaces were obtained the dust on the biochar surface may be related to decomposition of the small size sheets in the macroalgae as feedstock in the htl reaction 3 2 adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph investigation of the ph is inevitable because of its significant influence on the ionization of the dye molecules as well as on the binding functional groups of the adsorbent hence the solubility of the dye and the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent are directly affected by the ph of the solution 40 fig 3 a shows the effect of solution ph on the adsorption capacity of g gracilis and c glomerata biochars for both biochars the removal efficiencies increased significantly by increasing the ph from 2 to 3 since the surface charge of biochars changed from positive to negative phsolution phpzc and the electrostatic attraction between mb ions and the surface of biochars was developed nevertheless in acidic medium the concentration of h is high which compete with mb for adsorption hence the removal efficiency in acidic medium was relatively lower than in the alkali environment 41 however the deprotonation of oxygen containing acidic groups at higher ph values increases the number of negatively charged sites and enhances the attraction between dye cations and the biochars surface 42 initial ph of mb solutions before adding biochars was 6 7 so this ph without further adjustment was chosen for the subsequent experiments 3 2 2 effect of initial mb concentration as shown in fig 3 b the removal efficiency decreased significantly with an increase in the initial mb concentration because the amount of the adsorbent s reactive sites is constant in addition an increase in the dye concentration provides a driving force for mb ions to be adsorbed on the available reactive sites 43 at lower initial dye concentrations the removal efficiency was relatively high due to the availability of sufficient unoccupied reactive sites to adsorb mb ions 44 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent dosage fig 3 c shows the effect of adsorbent dosage ranging from 0 3 to 1 8 g l on the removal efficiency of mb as can be seen the removal efficiency increased significantly by increasing the adsorbent dosage from 0 3 to 1 2 g l due to increasing active sites for adsorption of dye ions on the other hand the adsorbate mb ions concentration provides the necessary driving force to surmount the resistance to mass transfer of adsorbate ions between the solution bulk and the adsorbent surface which plays a key role in the adsorption efficiency 45 therefore at the higher dosage of the adsorbent with many vacant active sites if the concentration and the availability of dye ions are not sufficient for appropriate mass transfer the removal efficiency remains approximately constant in other words by increasing the concentration of adsorbate to a certain amount the adsorption capacity of adsorbent will increase similar results have been reported in previous studies 46 47 3 2 4 effects of contact time and temperature fig 3 d provides the effect of contact time on the removal efficiency of mb by biochars the high adsorption rate was observed within 60 min after the start of mixing which was due to the availability of abundant vacant active sites and a high concentration of dye ions after 60 min the adsorption rate increased slowly due to saturation of active sites and reduction of mb concentration and the adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 2 h the increase of contact time from 2 to 24 did not have any significant effect on the removal efficiency therefore the contact time of 2 h was selected for subsequent adsorption isotherm experiments 3 2 5 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms have been used to estimate the maximum adsorption capacity and to study the behavior of biochars in the adsorption process the langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin models were used to fit the experimental data for each model linear regression was used to compare and find the best model the correlation coefficient r2 the residual root mean square error rmse and the chi square test χ2 were applied to investigate the fitting of the adsorption isotherms to the equilibrium data eqs 2 and 3 2 r m e s 1 n p i 1 n q e e x p q e c a l i 2 3 χ 2 i 1 n q e e x p q e c a l 2 q e c a l i where qe exp is the experimental adsorption capacity qe cal is the calculated adsorption capacity n is the number of experimental data p is the number of parameters within model equation the linear forms of studied models and the obtained results are presented in table 5 the comparison of r2 values indicated the langmuir model with the r2 value of 0 995 was the best fitting model for the g gracilis biochar s equilibrium data furthermore the langmuir model exhibited lower χ2 and rmse values than the other isotherm models however in the case of c glomeratabiochar the freundlich model with the r2 value of 0 999 was found to fit the data well as can be seen from table 5 the x 2 and rmse values of the freundlich model were lower than those of other models accordingly the langmuir and freundlich models were considered as the best fitting models to describe the adsorption behavior of mb onto g gracilis and c glomerata biochars respectively furthermore the predicted maximum adsorption capacities were very close to the experimentally obtained data the calculated maximum adsorption capacity of c glomerata and g gracilis biochars using langmuir model were 226 28 and 104 07 mg g respectively fig 4 a and b show the experimental and corresponding calculated data through the mentioned adsorption isotherm models which confirms the results of error analysis as can be seen at low concentrations more than one isotherm model has good agreement with the experimental data however by increasing the concentration of adsorbate the actual behavior of the adsorbents can be determined hence the range of dye concentration was chosen wide enough to provide a significant difference between isotherm models as can be seen from table 5 under the same conditions the adsorption capacity of c glomerata biochar was greater than g gracilis biochar as the specific surface area of the biochars was low the difference between their adsorption capacity cannot be due to the difference between specific surface area however the higher adsorption capacity of c glomerata can be attributed to their different adsorptive behavior freundlich against langmuir model and the higher amount of oxygen containing acidic surface functional groups table 4 3 2 6 adsorption kinetics to investigate the characteristic adsorption mechanism the applicability of the pseudo first order pseudo second order intraparticle diffusion and elovich kinetic models were tested for the mb adsorption onto c glomerata and g gracilis biochars the linear forms of investigated models calculated kinetic parameters and their corresponding error analysis parameters including r2 χ2 and rmse are summarized in table 6 with regard to the r2 χ2 and rmse values it can be concluded that the pseudo first order intraparticle diffusion and elovich models have exhibited poor fit to the experimental data of both biochars however the r2 χ2 and rmse values of the pseudo second order model confirmed that this model exhibited a very good fitting with the experimental data of both biochars furthermore the estimated adsorption capacity by this model had a good agreement with the obtained experimental data as a result the pseudo second order model was considered to be the best fitting model for both biochars fig 4 c and d show the experimental and predicted data using investigated kinetic models at a dye concentration of 450 mg l as can be seen all data were well predicted by the pseudo second order model indeed the pseudo second model represents the external liquid film diffusion surface adsorption and intra particle diffusion processes 48 and confirms that in the adsorption process the rate limiting step is chemisorption 49 to recognize the adsorption mechanism in different phases over the time the intraparticle kinetic model was investigated separately as can be seen in fig 4 f the adsorption process can be divided into two phases the initial phase up to 60 min had a steep slope which is related to the fast diffusion of adsorbate across the external boundary layer to the surface of biochars however the second phase from 60 to 180 min with a gentle slope is related to diffusion into the pores of biochars 50 the linear plots did not pass through the origin indicating that the adsorption rate using biochars did not control only through intraparticle diffusion 50 3 3 desorption and regeneration of biochars investigation of biochar reusability was conducted by using the acidic solution as the desorption agent in this study desorption of mb ions from exhausted adsorbents was performed using a 0 1 mol l hcl solution and the results showed that c glomerata and g gracilis biochars were regenerable as can be seen from fig 5 after five repeated adsorption and desorption cycles the adsorption efficiency of c glomerata and g gracilis iochars reduced to 90 and 80 respectively as a consequence the concentration of h was high enough to provide a large driving force toward the active sites of the adsorbent therefore the mb ions were desorbed from the surface of the adsorbent these results indicated that the electrostatic interaction was one of the main driving force for the adsorption of mb 3 4 possible mechanisms of mb adsorption onto c glomerata and g graciis biochar there are several possible mechanisms for adsorption of mb onto biochars therefore the adsorption of mb by biochars is a complicated process according to the pseudo second order kinetic model the adsorption process of mb onto biochars includes physical acting and chemical bonding 51 in other words the involved processes in the adsorption by biochars are external liquid film diffusion surface adsorption and intra particle diffusion processes based on the effect of ph on the adsorption process and also desorption study it can be concluded that the adsorption mechanism of mb onto biochars includes electrostatic interaction the htl process for the production of macroalgae biochar can be affected by many parameters such as reaction temperature time salt content inorganic materials and biochemical composition of the macroalgae feedstock 52 inorganic materials may have a catalytic role in htl reaction biochemical composition of macroalgae is an important factor in biochar characteristics and properties 23 functional groups on the biochar surface directly relate to compounds present in macroalgae such as carbohydrate and protein all pathways of biochar formation are related to the production of soluble polymers in the reaction 53 a nucleation growth mechanism can explain the production of solid biochar from soluble polymers in the solution phase 54 when the concentration of pahs increases and then reaches a critical saturation point a burst nucleation process can be accomplished thus biochar is formed by several species in aqueous solution the type of these species has a significant effect on reactive oxygen functional groups hydroxyl carbonyl carboxylic etc these functional groups were detected on the biochar surface by ftir analysis and determined using the boehm titration method according to ftir analysis fig 1 b surface complexation including hydrogen bonding and electronic attraction and functional groups as active sites such as oh cooh co ch participate in the adsorption process of mb onto the biochars 51 furthermore the produced biochars have an aromatic structure therefore mb with an aromatic structure can be adsorbed through π π stacking interaction onto the biochars 55 fig 6 schematically illustrates the possible mechanisms of mb adsorption onto c glomerata and g gracilis biochars including surface complexation electrostatic interaction physical function and π π stacking interaction 3 5 comparison with other biochars for the removal of mb up to now many biochars as adsorbent have been reported for the adsorption of mb the maximum adsorption capacities of c glomerata and g gracilis and other biochars for removal of mb are summarized in table 6 as it can be observed the adsorption capacities of the investigated biochars were significantly higher than those of other biochars reported previously table 7 4 conclusions two biochar samples derived from c glomerata and g gracilis macroalgae as the main co products of htl process for biofuel production were effectively applied for mb removal from aqueous solutions the removal efficiency decreased by decreasing ph the adsorption equilibrium data of c glomerata and g gracilis biochars were in agreement with the freundlich and langmuir isotherms respectively in addition the maximum adsorption capacities for methylene blue were 226 and 104 mg g for c glomerata and g gracilis respectively the experimental results for both biochars were fitted to the pseudo second order model desorption and regeneration experiments illustrated that prepared biochars could be a reusable adsorbent for mb adsorption compared with other biochars c glomerata and g gracilis have superior adsorption capacities according to the obtained results electrostatic interaction surface complexation physical function and π π stacking interaction involved in the mechanism of mb adsorption onto biochars as a result the biochar or solid residue produced from htl processing of macroalgae had a potential to be an attractive adsorbent for the removal of contaminants from wastewater acknowledgment the authors wish to acknowledge the nanotechnology and waste to energy research centers of college of engineering

14281,the thermo responsive swelling shrinking behaviour of the poly n isopropylacrylamide pnipam hydrogels under the effect of temperature change have mechanistic function upon controlling the uptake and release of cr3 ions by the hydrogel networks in this study acrylic acid aa was co polymerized with pnipam onto the silica coated magnetic nanoparticles mnps to form thermo magneto responsive pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps composite hydrogels with increased density of cr3 binding groups its temperature manipulated adsorption desorption efficiency as well as their magnetic phase separability were investigated chromium loaded hydrogels shown apparent phase separation under influence of low gradient magnetic field desorption of cr3 gradually predominated as temperature increased from 298 k to 323 k under high initial cr3 concentration whereby physical adsorption is prevailing the re uptake of cr3 occurred when the solution being cooled down to 298 k furthermore the adsorption kinetic analysis revealed that the adsorption of cr3 by pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps hydrogels was governed by surface precipitation of cr3 keywords adsoprtion desorption thermoresponsive hydrogel magnetophoresis heavy metal removal 1 introduction chromium is a ubiquitous heavy metal which can be found in effluents exuded from a myriad of industrial activities running the gamut from electroplating mining to leather dyeing removal of cr3 can be acquired via various conventional approaches including ph dependent chemical precipitation ion exchange by resins adsorption via ligand chelation and membrane filtration nonetheless the efficiency of these methods has been vitiated by several drawbacks such as production of secondary precipitates and low metal recovery 1 8 in view of questing for efficient removal of cr3 ions there have been numbers of studies performed on assessing the feasibility of utilizing water soluble polymers as chromium iii ions chelators in aqueous solutions liu et al 9 synthesized a type of coordination polymer 4 2 4 pyridin 3 yl methoxy phenyl diazenyl benzoic acid which contained the designed ligand with the carbomethoxy laced group was employed as adsorbent for the selective removal of cr3 from aqueous solution choi et al 10 fabricated polyethylenimine silica pei silica via one step facile method which involved the participation of amine groups in the reduction and adsorption of cr6 and cr3 in aqueous solution respectively nonetheless low adsorption capacity and the separability of these adsorbents from bulk aqueous solution remain as setback for improving the adsorption efficiency in this work a type of composite hydrogels with magnetite nanoparticles mnps as cores namely poly n isopropylacrylamide co acrylic acid pnipam co aa hydrogels with encapsulated magnetic cores were employed as adsorbent for adsorption of chromium trivalent ions cr3 in aqueous solution poly n isopropylacylamide pnipam is a type of thermo responsive hydrogel in which its cross linked polymer network exhibits reversible swelling shrinking behaviour in response to the variation of temperature at temperature above its lower critical solution temperature lcst the hydrogel matrix starts to shrink as water is released until it reaches fully dehydrated state with increasing temperature and vice versa hence the thermo responsive swelling shrinking behaviour is conceived to endow the hydrogel with the ability of controlled uptake release of the cr3 ions under temperature variation 11 13 in addition the carboxylates coo of aa co monomer moiety in pnipam co aa are prominent electron donating groups that could act as effective ligands to chelate cr3 cations in aqueous phase cr3 are chelated by multidentates via different interactions including electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding as well as covalent bonds moreover the magnetic cores of the composite hydrogels consisting of fe3o4 magnetite nanoparticles mnps are useful for magnetic separation of the adsorbate adsorbent from the bulk reaction solution by using an external magnetic field 14 11 15 16 hence by coupling magnetic behaviour of the mnps with the temperature manipulated adsorption properties of the pnipam networks the synergistic effect of both thermo responsiveness and magneto responsiveness of the composite hydrogels upon their interactions with cr3 and its removal efficiency in aqueous solution was evaluated in this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the chemicals used for the synthesis of mnps magnetic cores of the composite hydrogels were ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o ferrous chloride tetrahydrate fecl2 4h2o and sodium hydroxide naoh then poly vinylpyrrolidone pvp 10 kg mol 1 and tetraethyl orthosilicate teos were used for surface functionalization and silica coating of mnps respectively subsequently monomer n isopropylacrylamide nipam c6h11no cross linker n n methylene bis acrylamide mba c7h10n2o2 99 and co monomer acrylic acid aa were applied for polymerization of pnipam co aa layer and chromium iii nitrate nonahydrate crn3o9 9h2o was used as chromium iii ion source in aqueous solution the aforementioned chemicals were all purchased from sigma aldrich in addition ammonium persulfate aps which was the initiator for nipam polymerization ethanol c2h5oh and ammonia solution 25 wt used as solvents for stöber process were obtained from merck all chemicals are of analytical grade and were used as supplied 2 2 preparation of fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles mnps the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles were synthesized via co precipitation method fecl3 6h2o and fecl2 4h2o were dissolved in 150 ml of distilled water in a molar ratio 0 5 the mixture solution was stirred continuously at 600 rpm in a 250 ml three necked bottom and it was degassed with n2 for 30 min then the obtained transparent solution was heated to 80 c under rapid mechanical stirring 600 rpm subsequently 20 ml of naoh 10 m was injected into the solution the resultant black dispersion was stirred for another 1 h at 90 c after being cooled to room temperature the produced suspension was subjected to magnetic separation to harvest the magnetic nanoparticles 14 15 17 2 3 synthesis of pnipam co aa encapsulated mnps composite hydrogels the produced mnps dispersion was functionalized with pvp as mediating layer for acquiring effective coating of silica layer then the silica was incorporated onto pvp functionalized mnps via stöber method which was carried out by dispersing the pvp mnps into 40 ml ethanol 2 mmol teos and 3 ml of ammonium hydroxide 25 wt were mixed into the solution the mixture solution was stirred for 12 h at 40 c the produced silica pvp mnps solution was centrifuged for two cycles at 7000 rpm by dispersing into di water the dispersion was collected by a cylindrical neodymium boron ferrite ndfeb magnet with remanence magnetization of 1 45 t 14 18 20 subsequently pnipam cross linked network layers was prepared through free radical polymerization monomer nipam 0 28 g co monomer acrylic acid aa and cross linker mba 0 025 g were dissolved in a three necked flask containing 170 ml deionized water the mixture solution was then heated up to 70 c in water bath meanwhile nitrogen gas was also purged into the solution for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen after that aps 0 11 g was introduced into the solution to initiate the reaction the solution was stirred at 350 rpm for 4 h at 70 c as a result the pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps composite hydrogels with magnetic cores were formed as whitish brown suspension in aqueous phase the obtained hydrogel suspension was centrifuged to discard the impurities and it was re dispersed in deionized water then it was separated by a ndfeb magnet 1 45 t the final product harvested was dispersed again in 40 ml di water for storage 11 21 25 2 4 characterization of pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps composite hydrogels 2 4 1 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir analysis for infrared detection the hydrogel suspension was air dried into powder form the functional groups of hydrogels were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscope nicolet is10 ft ir spectrometer in the range of 4000 500 cm 1 with atr technique 2 4 2 thermal gravimetric analysis tga thermal gravimetric analysis tga perkin elmer usa was performed to estimate the pnipam co aa cross linked polymeric network loading on the silica coated mnps the sample mass of 5 mg was used and being placed on alumina crucible all measurements were conducted under nitrogen purging and ambient pressure at the rate of 10 c min 1 ramp heating from ambient temperature to 800 c 2 4 3 dynamic light scattering dls the thermo responsive variations in hydrodynamic diameter dh of the composite hydrogel particle were monitored by a dynamic light scattering apparatus malvern zetasizer 1000 equipped with a helium neon laser λ 633 nm and a detector located at 90 in principle the intensity fluctuation on the incident laser light scattered by the hydrogel particles was detected at an angle of 173 non invasive back scatter nibs which was then autofitted into an exponential decay correlation function subsequently this correlation function is mathematically treated through cumulants method defined in iso 13321 and iso 22412 to attain a translational diffusion coefficient dt the dt was fitted into the stokes einstein equation for obtaining the corresponding dh in which the equation is expressed as follows 1 d h k t 3 π η d t where k refers to boltzmann s constant m2 kg k 1 s 2 η is the solvent viscosity pa s dt represents translational diffusion coefficient m2 s 1 and t denotes absolute temperature k hence all of the monodispersed particles or cluster of particles in the samples are assumed to be spherical shape 26 27 moreover in order to avoid multiple scattering effect and particle interactions all dls measurements were carried out at diluted sample concentration of 5 10 mg l 1 the range of inspection was fixed at the temperature range of 25 50 c to establish the profile of dh change against temperature 2 4 4 transmission electronic microscopy tem morphological observation of hydrogel was carried out using jeol transmission electron microscope tem jeol jem 200cx at 100 kv a few droplets of hydrogel suspension samples were spread onto the surface of a 300 mesh copper grid and allowed to dry for 30 min the dried specimen was clamped onto a tem specimen rod and inserted into the sample chamber for observation 2 4 5 magnetophoresis kinetics measurement 4 ml of a sample hydrogel suspension with initial concentration fixed at 500 mg l 1 was filled into a standard uv vis cuvette which was placed on a cylindrical neodymium boron ferrite ndfeb magnet remanence magnetization of 1 45 t for solute phase separation then the concentration variation of the suspension bulk phase against time was monitored by a uv vis spectrophotometer agilent cary 60 equipped with monochromatic light having wavelength of 500 nm the beam of light was passed through the sample suspension and the variations in light absorbance were recorded the concentration change of each sample suspension was monitored at every interval of 12 min for the duration of 7 h 2 4 6 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the xps spectra were acquired by using axis ultra dld kratos equipped with a al kα x ray source 1486 6 ev at 10 ma 15 kv to analyze a 300 μmm 700 μm area under 3 4 10 9 torr ultra vacuum environment inside a sample analyzing chamber the analysis was performed in the hybrid lens mode with the slot aperture and the analyzer was operated in fixed analyzer transmission fat mode with pass energy of the hemispherical analyzer was set at 160 ev for the survey scan the samples were dried under vacuum before xps analysis the calibration of the binding energy of the spectra was performed with the c 1s peak at 284 6 ev the spectra were analyzed by employing vision software which was coupled with vision manager and vision processing 2 5 chromium iii adsorption desorption study 2 5 1 measurement of cr3 concentration a series of vials filled with 50 ml reaction solutions containing 4 mg of the composite hydrogels as adsorbent and stock solutions of cr3 with initial concentrations c0 ranging from 20 to 100 mg l 1 prepared by using crn3o9 9h2o the solution ph of each sample in the vials was adjusted to ph 5 by using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh for attaining optimum equilibrium adsorption then the reaction sample filled vials were rotated at 40 rpm on a rotator mixer for 24 h subsequently the chromium loaded hydrogel particles in every solution was separated by a cylindrical ndfeb magnet the cr3 concentration in the supernatant of each reaction solution was determined by employing an agilent cary 60 uv vis spectrophotometer integrated with monochromatic light at wavelength of 585 nm prior to measurements a profile of absorbance change against cr3 concentration was first plotted as a calibration curve by measuring the light absorbances of a control set of cr3 solutions with known concentrations then the cr3 concentration in supernatant of each separated reaction sample was derived by comparing the light absorbance measured to the calibration curve the adsorption percentage of cr3 was expressed as 2 c r 3 a d s o r p t i o n c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 mg l 1 and ce mg l 1 denote the initial and equilibrium cr3 concentration respectively the composite hydrogel capacity of cr3 uptake at equilibrium can be represented by equilibrium adsorption capacity qe which is expressed as follows 3 q e c 0 c e m v where v l is the total volume of the solution m g refers to the dry mass of pristine composite hydrogels another experiment was performed to examine temperature dependent adsorption desorption of cr3 by immersing a series of hydrogel chromium solutions kept in vials with c0 of 20 40 50 60 80 and 100 mg l 1 into a water bath the solutions were first heated in water bath from 298 to 323 k and the solutions were cooled back to 298 k measurement of cr3 concentration in bulk phase was carried out every temperature set prior to every measurement made the solutions were rotated for overnight to attain adsorption equilibrium then the hydrogels were separated by magnets and supernatant of each solution was harvested for cr3 concentration measurement after measurement the supernatants were poured back into the hydrogel solutions and the separated hydrogel particles were re dispersed into the bulk phase for next temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 ftir characterization in fig 1 the presence of aa in the co polymeric pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps composite hydrogels was confirmed by the asymmetric carbonyl co stretching of carboxylic cooh groups possessed by aa moieties as manifested by the peak at around 1716 cm 1 after cr3 adsorption this characteristic peak had disappeared due to the complexation between cr3 with the carbonyl co of carboxylic groups in aa moieties 21 24 in addition the peak reduction at 1539 cm 1 also signified the participation of nh of amide in chelation with cr3 it is in parallel with the frequency shift for the characteristic peak of amide i from 1640 to 1645 cm 1 and the substantial reduction in peak intensity also infers the lone pairs possessed by both co and nh had been involved in cr3 coordination similarly the small peaks at 2972 1459 and 1368 cm 1 present in the spectrum of pristine pnipam co aa mnps had also vanished after the hydrogels were loaded with cr3 where these missing peaks were assigned to asymmetric ch stretching asymmetric and symmetric ch bending of methyl respectively again this observation connotes the electron donating tendency of these alky groups that had contributed to the multidentate coordination of cr3 to form ligand chelated complex 21 25 28 31 3 2 tga analysis thermal gravimetric analysis was performed to examine the extent of pnipam co aa network polymerized onto the silica coated magnetic mnps fig 2 depicts the weight decay against the step wise increase in temperature the first stage of weight loss observed at around 210 c was ascribed to the decomposition of certain amount of volatile substances trapped within the pnipam co aa networks and the polymer itself the second stage of weight loss as portrayed by another meagre decline in weight percentage observed at around 416 c corresponding to the decomposition of residual aa fragments 15 22 25 the absolute weight loss for silica coated mnps was 12 47 wt whereas total weight decay of 16 79 wt was acquired by pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps hence merely 4 32 wt of the composite hydrogels was constituted by the pnipam co aa network layer 3 3 thermo responsiveness of the composite hydrogels before and after cr3 adsorption the thermo responsive behaviour of the magnetic composite hydrogels was evaluated before and after cr3 adsorption by employing dls technique the variation of hydrodynamic diameter dh of the samples was probed within the temperature range of 298 323 k in our previous study the synthesized homo polymeric pnipam silica pvp mnps magnetic composite hydrogels had the same lower critical solution temperature lcst as that of pure pnipam hydrogels which was around 305 k 32 c 1 2 it is the threshold temperature for the hydrogel network structures to undergo volume phase transition vpt in aqueous dispersion as characterized by its shrinkage in conformation at temperature above lcst 14 23 however in this work the plots of hydrodynamic diameter dh change against temperature in fig 3 a demonstrates reduction in dh initiated immediately from 943 nm to 830 nm as the temperature was raised gradually from 298 to 305 k the abrupt drop in particle size was attributed to the expulsion of water molecules from the co polymeric pnipam co aa matrices then the heating induced shrinkage became insignificant in which dh decreased slightly to 818 nm as temperature increased further to 315 k as temperature elevated part of the hydrophilic groups had been invaginated into the network interior and engaged in forming stable inner hydrogen bonds among amides of nipam moiety and carboxylates of aa that led to relatively more rigid network structures these intra particle bonds impaired the resilience of the matrix structures upon temperature driven swelling shrinking mechanism 22 24 32 full dehydration could have occurred at 317 k where the hydrogel particles shrunk to their core size at around 790 nm nonetheless as heating carried on until 323 k more hydrophilic functionalities including carboxylates were sequestered into the hydrogel matrix interior this had led to like charge repulsion among dehydrated carboxylates which was also restraint by the formation of more inner hydrogen bonds among carboxylates and amides resulting in only meagre re expansion of the particle to 817 nm nearly linear dh change against decreasing temperature during cooling cycle and the apparent hysteresis observed were attributed to reduced interstitial space within hydrogel networks caused by some irreversible inter and intra chain hydrogen bonds forms among both aa and nipam moieties that could have impeded the diffusion of water molecules into hydrogel matrices 22 23 after adsorption of cr3 the profile of dh change against temperature was shown in fig 3 b the composite hydrogels had been enlarged to 1 18 μm after being loaded with cr3 at 298 k with mild increment in dh of 18 55 in relation to the pristine hydrogels before adsorption at ph 5 cr3 aqua cation exists in aqueous environment as monohydroxo species when one of the water molecules anchored around the centre cr3 ion of original cr3 h2o 6 3 hexaaqua ions pka 4 3 was hydrolysed into hydroxide oh this resulted in the formation of cr3 h2o 5 oh 2 monohydroxo species which bears a hydroxide ion with enhanced reactivity toward the hydrogel ligands especially carbonyls of aa carboxylates 30 33 35 in addition as being explained by petrou et al 31 the hydroxides in the complex enhanced the labilization destabilization of the coordinated h2o molecule which is located trans to the oh in the octahedral cr3 complex the labile unstable trans water molecule could easily be substituted by the h bonded ligand coh of the carboxylate then the coh is deprotonated by the oh via hydrolysis to form stronger and more stable crco bond after all this results in 102 103 fold higher in reaction rate for hydroxo aqua over hexaaqua complex ion moreover the hydroxide also inclined to bridge other cr3 monohydroxo complex ions in the bulk phase to polymerize into polynuclear species that precipitated on the surfaces of hydrogel besides these surface adsorbed cr3 hydroxo precipitates tend to act as bridging linkage to facilitate agglomeration of the hydrogels 28 29 35 37 along the heating cycle the hydrogels loaded with cr3 exhibited reverse thermo responsiveness the size of hydrogels expanded from 1 02 μm to 1 30 μm as temperature increased from 298 to 323 k the size increment was 28 contributed by like charge repulsion among cr3 laden aa carboylates the dh of the hydrogel continually grew into more than double of its size at 323 k 1 3 μm until 2 92 μm as temperature reduced to 298 k more water ligands of the cr3 aqua ions were hydrolyzed into hydroxides following the change in pka of the bulk solvent and enthalpy during heating hence when cooling process began the hydrolytically polymerized hydroxo species of cr3 that had been precipitated on the hydrogel surfaces acted as interfacial bridging agents for the agglomeration of hydrogel particles the dh of hydrogels increased substantially along the cooling cycle as more hydrogels were agglomerated as enthalpy driven mobility abated as temperature decreased 31 35 36 the ζ profile versus temperature in fig 4 a depicts that the hydrogels had highly negative surface charge with ζ of 41 3 mv measured at 298 k before heating the negativity of the hydrogel surfaces was invoked by the deprotonated carboxylates of aa moieties when temperature rose to 307 k the negative value of ζ reduced to 33 2 mv and remained nearly constant within a narrow range of 33 2 and 34 9 mv as temperature further elevated to 323 k at the beginning of heating the initial reduction of ζ was caused by the dehydration process where the dehydrated hydrophilic groups were invaginated into the network interiors and the hydrophobic isopropyls were re oriented towards bulk phase consequently inner hydrogen bonds within hydrogel matrices were formed among hydrophilic carboxylates and amides which could have reduced the density of surface carboxylates after that the hydrogel suspension was quenched from 323 to 310 k its ζ increased again to 36 4 mv and remained nearly constant until the end of cooling process at 298 k as most of the hydrophilic groups were still engaged in inner hydrogen bonds there was a formation of hydrophobic hydration layer engulfing the exposed hydrophobic isopropyl moieties the increase in negative ζ values was ascribed to the migration of oh ions from bulk aqueous phase onto the hydrophobic hydration shell around hydrogel surface as described by utashiro et al 38 they also reported that the assembly of oh on the hydrogel surfaces was progressively stabilized along with the stabilization of the hydrophobic hydration shell zangi and engberts 39 performed molecular dynamics md simulation upon the assembly of oh ions from aqueous bulk phase on a hydrophobic surface through physisorption their simulation results indicated that the interaction energy between oh ions and the waters near the hydrophobic surface helps stabilize the hydration layer to compensate for the entropy loss this occurs when entropy abated after re alignment of waters in the hydration layer into an ordered structure around the hydrophobic groups hence they also concluded that the driving force for the migration of oh ions from bulk aqueous phase is the preferential re orientation of the water molecules in the hydrophobic hydration shell around the hydrophobic surface they explained that the ordered alignment of physisorbed water molecules in the hydration layer creates an electrical potential gradient that inclined to interact with the dipole moment of the oh ions 43 on the contrary the chromium loaded composite hydrogels exhibited ζ profile in the positive region as shown in fig 4 b the complexation between cr3 and hydrogel ligands established positively charged surface potential the initial ζ was measured to be 15 9 mv and the value dropped to 8 27 mv at 310 k some water molecules were dissociated from the cr3 ions and the vacant coordination sites were replaced by oh with better affinity toward the complex centre cr3 then ζ ascended again to 11 8 mv at 323 k as further heating catalyzed dissociation of more physisorbed water molecules from the outer hydrated shell around the adsorbed cr3 layer the alignment of water molecules in the hydration shell was disrupted which in turn deteriorated the electrical potential gradient that draws oh from bulk solvent as a result more adsorbed cr3 was unshielded by both water molecules and oh which enhanced again the surface positive charge potential in a slight increment 3 4 magnetophoresis kinetic measurements of magnetic composite hydrogels colloidal stability of hydrogel particles in aqueous environment relied on several manipulating variables including particle size distribution surface area and surface charge particularly the particle size and surface charge density counteract the gravity effect on sedimentation rate of solutes in suspension in line with this the rate of decline in solute concentration in the bulk phase over time manifests colloidal stability of the hydrogel suspension 19 40 41 20 27 fig 5 a displays the comparison of normalized concentration profiles against time for suspensions of the composite hydrogels before and after cr3 adsorption in the absence of magnetic field gradient before adsorption the pristine composite hydrogels exhibited much slower decline rate in concentration over the monitoring period due to their high density of negative surface charges as reflected in fig 4 a this created inter particle electrostatic repulsion to counteract the gravity effect which drove the settlement of the hydrogels 20 27 after equilibrium adsorption of cr3 distinct deterioration of colloidal stability was observed the surface adsorbed cr3 rendered a net positive charge density over the particle surfaces and the interfacial electrostatic repulsion helped sustain the stability of the hydrogel for only 120 min then the concentration started to decline and the surface precipitated hydroxo cr3 also acted as bridging factor that formed interfacial linkages among hydrogels which causing susceptible to agglomeration as a result the gravity pull over agglomerated hydrogel particles gradually overcame interfacial repulsion and settlement occurred in a moderate rate 40 20 fig 5 b shows the separation kinetic profiles for the same set of hydrogels under influence of low gradient magnetic field pristine hydrogels demonstrated slower rate of concentration degeneration due to high density of negative charge coverage on the surfaces creating interfacial repulsion between hydrogels that enhanced their stability against external magnetic field after equilibrium adsorption of cr3 the rate of decline in concentration of the hydrogel suspension increased considerably the adsorbed cr3 onto the aa co polymerized hydrogels was mainly aggregated on surfaces as seen in the tem images the bridging effect of adsorbed cr3 hydroxo species induced agglomeration of the hydrogels which in turn enhanced their magneto responsiveness as portrayed by the high rate of concentration decline 40 41 20 3 5 particle structure fig 6 refers to tem images of the composite hydrogels before and after cr3 adsorption fig 6 a and b show that the pristine hydrogels have irregular shape with particle size observed to be in the range of 550 667 nm before adsorption on the other hand fig 6 c and d reveals that the hydrogels enlarged to the size range of 708 840 nm after being loaded with cr3 species the precipitates of less soluble cr3 hydroxo complexes were seen accumulated on the hydrogel surfaces indicating surface adsorption could have prevailed in the adsorption the cr3 hydroxo species acted as interfacial bridging agents that caused the agglomeration of hydrogels after adsorption as shown in fig 6 c and supported by the profile of dh change in fig 3 b 31 35 3 6 xps analyisis xps study was conducted to examine the changes in the elemental composition of pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps hydrogel surfaces fig 7 shows the spectra of the hydrogels before and after adsorption of cr3 in which the characteristic peaks of c 1s n 1s and o 1s were identified small peak of cr 2p3 2 at 577 ev was detected after cr3 adsorption as illustrated in the insert of fig 7 which is assigned to cr3 trivalent species 1 42 2 43 the relative atomic concentrations ac in percentage of carbon c nitrogen n oxygen o and chromium cr are listed in table 1 after adsorption there were reductions in ac for carbon and nitrogen on the hydrogel surface from 38 98 to 24 57 and from 4 22 to 1 02 respectively according to literature the decreases in ac for these surface elemental compositions signify that the presence of cr3 hydroxo species on surface could have involved the functional chelation of the elements on the other hand the distinct peak of oxygen at 532 ev is assigned to oxygen containing functional groups that includes both hydroxyls of cr3 hydroxo complexes and carbonyls of amides 1 44 2 the increase in ac for o 1s from 37 43 to 48 63 indicating the attachment of cr3 hydroxo species in meagre amount on the surfaces of hydrogels this is further confirmed by the increase in the o c ratio from 0 960 to 1 979 suggesting the presence of cr3 hydroxo complexes on the hydrogel surfaces 44 46 furthermore the presence of cr3 species on the hydrogel surfaces was also proven by the ac of cr 2p3 2 measured at 1 35 after adsorption as presented in table 1 as well 3 7 cr3 adsorption efficiency the efficiency of cr3 adsorption in terms of adsorption percentage and the adsorption capacity qe of the hydrogels were plotted against initial cr3 concentrations c0 as presented in fig 8 the adsorption percentage of cr3 declined from 28 34 to 9 33 with increasing c0 from 20 to 100 mg l 1 the inverse trend of cr3 uptake against c0 was due to the reduction in ratio of available cr3 binding sites on the composite hydrogels to the total cr3 ions present in the bulk solution as c0 increased on the contrary the profile of cr3 adsorption capacity qe against c0 was in directly proportional trend where qe ascended from 141 70 to 233 36 mg g 1 with elevating c0 increased concentration of cr3 in bulk solution created higher concentration gradient as the driving force which overrode the resistance on the mass transfer of cr3 between the aqueous bulk phase and adsorbent surfaces as a result this phenomenon enhanced the amount of cr3 to be driven toward the binding sites of hydrogels 3 5 8 9 60 3 8 adsorption isotherm of cr3 ions the equilibrium adsorption data was fitted langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherm models to deduce possible cr3 adsorption mechanisms acquired by the composite hydrogels the optimal degree of cr3 uptake by the hydrogels is characterized as the maximum adsorption capacity qm which could be derived from the adsorption isotherm plots with certain underlying assumptions langmuir isotherm depicts monolayer adsorption of the cr3 ions on the hydrogel surfaces which is represented as 4 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where ce mg l 1 represents the equilibrium concentration of cr3 ions qe denotes the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g 1 qm refers to the maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 kl l mg 1 is known as langmuir constant which is related to the adsorption energy the linear form of the equation can be expressed as 5 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m the qm can be obtained from the slope of the linear plot of ce qe versus ce whereas kl can be derived from the plot intercept 47 48 on the other hand freundlich isotherm is an empirical adsorption model for a heterogeneous surface it is not limited to description of monolayer adsorption but it can also be employed to elucidate multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous adsorbent surface with uneven coverage of adsorption energy it assumes that the stronger binding sites of adsorbent are bound to adsorbates first which leads to the exponential decline in adsorption energy until adsorption equilibrium is achieved the model is represented by the following equation 6 q e k f c e 1 n where qe is equilibrium cr3 adsorption capacity mg g 1 ce is the equilibrium concentration of cr3 mg l 1 kf denotes a distribution coefficient which is also known as freundlich constant l g 1 and 1 n represents the heterogeneity factor for the ease of plotting the equation can be derived into the linear form as follow 7 log q e 1 n log c e log k f the slope is the value of heterogeneity factor 1 n and the freundlich constant kf is obtained from the intercept the heterogeneity factor 1 n depicts the adsorption intensity of adsorbates onto the adsorbent surface heterogeneity when value of 1 n is between 0 and 1 it is indicative of favourable adsorption isotherm the nature of adsorption is chemisorption for 1 n 1 and cooperative adsorption occurs for 1 n 1 in the case where 1 n approaches 0 the surface of adsorbent becomes increasingly heterogeneous and the isotherm is non linear as 1 n goes above unity depicts unfavourable adsorption isotherm 48 49 fig 9 shows plot of experimental qe on the cr3 adsorption by pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps was compared to the plots of qe obtained by fitting data to the isotherm models against different equilibrium cr3 concentrations ce freundlich isotherm exhibits better fit than that of langmuir isotherm as presented in table 2 both r2 values for langmuir and freundlich are close to 1 with values of 0 9248 and 0 9537 respectively hence this suggests that both monolayer and multilayer adsorption of cr3 on the surface of composite hydrogel could have occurred prevalently the heterogeneity factor of freundlich isotherm n is 1 which also indicated that the adsorption intensity is favourable over the range of experimental data perused in addition the maximum adsorption capacity qm of the hydrogel calculated from langmuir isotherm can achieve 243 90 mg g 1 3 9 comparison with other polymeric adsorbents a comparison of the hydrogel adsorbent systems with other polymeric adsorbents for the adsorption of cr3 ions is presented in table 3 as seen from the data summarized in table 2 the pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps composite hydrogel system have relatively higher adsorption capacities in comparison to other methods reported in table 2 the relatively high adsorption capacity of the hydrogel is via surface precipitation as well as collective magnetophoresis of the hydrogel together with the precipitated chromium 3 10 thermo responsive adsorption desorption of cr3 fig 10 illustrates the changing profiles of qe normalized by its respective equilibrium cr3 concentration ce at different temperatures for the composite hydrogels at temperature of 298 k the qe ce ratio revealed a decreasing trend from 5 99 to 1 99 with ascending c0 from 20 to 100 mg l 1 due to the decline in ratio of occupied binding sites of hydrogels to the total concentration of cr3 in the solution the adsorption of cr3 was governed by the precipitation of cr3 hydroxo species on the hydrogel surfaces bound by the carboxylates coo of the aa moiety and amides to form metal ligand surface complexes this agrees with the disappearance of characteristic peaks at frequencies 1716 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 in the ft ir spectra after adsorption of cr3 as shown in fig 1 when temperature rose to 323 k normalized qe reduced from 8 84 to 0 20 with increasing c0 continual uptake of cr3 happened for only lower c0 from 20 to 50 mg l 1 as heating driven hydrolysis of cr3 aqua ions converted coordinated water molecules anchored around cr3 centre into oh hydroxyl groups the hydrolysed cr3 bearing hydroxyls had higher affinity towards the binding groups of hydrogels by bridging more stable hydrogen bonds and precipitated onto hydrogel surfaces nevertheless at higher temperature desorption of cr3 happened for the higher regime of c 0 from 60 to 100 mg l 1 signified the release of physisorbed cr3 back to the bulk solution heat was consumed endothermically for hydrolyzing water ligands coordinated with cr3 centre at higher temperature compensating the hydroxides converting effect moreover higher concentration of cr3 aqua ions in the bulk phase also created higher concentration gradient favouring multilayer physisorption of cr3 which was enthalpically dissociated at higher temperature this explained the net release of cr3 from hydrogels enhanced with increasing c0 from 60 to 100 mg l 1 then as the solution was being quenched back to 298 k the qe ce was improved for c0 in the higher range of 50 100 mg l 1 the hydrogels gradually agglomerated along the cooling process as reflected in dh profile in fig 3 b the particle size of hydrogels grew to as large as 2 9 μm during cooling cycle the enthalpy driven mobility of the hydrogels abated and more cr3 hydroxo aqua ions had been functioning as interfacial bridging agents for the agglomeration of hydrogel particles the aggregation of these chromium laden hydrogels allowed the surface adsorbed cr3 hydroxo complex ions to bridge more cr3 hydroxo complex ions from the bulk phase via hydrolytic dimerization and polymerization at ph above the pka of cr3 hexaaqua ions pka 4 3 the hydrolysed complexes started to dimerize or to polymerize forming polynuclear complexes and precipitate on the adsorbent surfaces at low temperature as a result the re uptake of cr3 was possibly driven by migration of hydrated cr3 from bulk phase and reversibly physisorbed onto the hydrogel surfaces this explained the net re adsorption occurred under cooling stage especially for higher concentration of cr3 where higher concentration gradient helped catalyze the cr3 polymerization in other words most surface aa moiety had been irreversibly occupied by bound cr3 during heating process and the re uptake of cr3 along cooling process might be largely contributed by surface polymerization of cr3 hydroxo species which is especially significant for higher concentration of cr3 instead thermo responsiveness did not seem to play a role in the adsorption desorption of cr3 in this case schematic diagram in fig 11 illustrates the adsorption of cr3 and formation of inner hydrogen bonds within pnipam co aa cross linked networks that restraint re swelling of the hydrogel during cooling process cr3 had been irreversibly precipitated on hydrogel surface binding groups during cooling process more cr3 were bridged by the surface cr3 hydroxo complexes which also induced agglomeration of hydrogels however the composite systems show net desorption during heating which was largely ascribed to the enthalpy driven dissociation of hydrated cr3 from the hydrogel surfaces 3 11 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics relies on the adsorbate adsorbent interaction as well as the adsorption condition where its evaluation is influenced by two vital variables that are the mechanism and the reaction rate of the adsorption the uptake rate of adsorbates from the bulk phase by the adsorbents delineates the residence time required to achieve adsorption equilibrium that can be deduced from the adsorption kinetic studies in our study three models of kinetics were adopted for adsorption data fitting namely pseudo first order pseudo second order and the intra particle diffusion models the pseudo first order kinetics was formulated by lagergren to describe the adsorption kinetics of solute adsorption onto solid adsorbent surface for a liquid solid adsorption system the pseudo first order model is represented as the following expression 8 d q t d t k 1 q e q t where qe and qt denotes the adsorption capacity of hydrogel mg g 1 at equilibrium and at time t respectively k1 refers to the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 the differential equation is integrated into a linear relationship by applying the initial conditions qt 0 at t 0 which is shown as below 9 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t pseudo second order kinetics model is applicable when the rate limiting step is the direct adsorption process on adsorbent surfaces that involves chemisorption and the uptake of solutes from bulk phase by adsorbent is governed by physicochemical interactions between the two phases the most common form of the pseudo second order kinetics was derived by ho and mckay which is expressed in linear relationship as below 10 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 refers to the pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 both pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models are not applicable for implicating the adsorption of cr3 ions into hydrogel networks via diffusion mechanism the diffusion mechanism of solute adsorption from liquid bulk phase onto adsorbent surface is characterized on a diffusion resistance which influences the adsorption kinetics in the adsorption of solutes into cross linked polymeric hydrogel structures the main diffusion resistance could be manifested by the cross linking degree of the corresponding hydrogels 54 57 furthermore the intraparticle diffusion resistances on adsorption kinetics was assessed by using the weber morris equation which was derived from fick s law for describing diffusion of adsorbates into spherical adsorbents the entire adsorption process could take place either by a single step or multiple steps which is usually observed in film diffusion pore diffusion and surface diffusion hence the intra particle diffusion model was employed to evaluate the diffusion process of cr3 into the hydrogel structures the initial rate of intra particle diffusion is calculated from the linearized form of the function qt f t1 2 as below which represents the relationship between the adsorption capacity at time t qt and the square root of adsorption time t1 2 11 q t k i d t 1 2 c i d where kid represents the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 1 2 the intercept of the linear equation cid mg g 1 refers to a constant related to the thickness of the boundary layer for intra particle diffusion to take place the plot of qt versus t1 2 should be linear and it is the rate limiting step if the line passes through the origin in the case when there is multi linearity along the plot of qt versus t1 2 this implies that two or three steps are involved in the intra particle diffusion process in the first step instantaneous adsorption occurs at the external surface adsorption it is followed by the second step which is known as the gradual adsorption step where intra particle diffusion of solutes into adsorbent structure is rate controlling then in the third step final equilibrium is achieved where solutes diffuse slowly from larger pores to micropores resulting in a slow adsorption rate 58 59 the calculated and experimental equilibrium adsorption capacity qe adsorption rate constants k1 k2 and kid determined from the three models are presented in table 4 along with the regression coefficient r2 the r2 values in table 4 revealed that the data only fitted well to the pseudo second order model with r2 closer to unity which has the value of 0 995 this implies that the adsorption of cr3 on the surface of the hydrogels was contributed equally by two important parameters namely the feed concentration as well as the presence of functional group aa on the hydrogel matrix this is in accordance to what has been proposed in fig 11 however the data has poor fitting to both pseudo first order model with low r2 values of 0 693 the discrepancy between calculated qe cal and experimental qe exp implicated that the adsorption kinetic did not follow pseudo first order model the pseudo second order model indicated that the excess concentration of cr3 was not the only rate determining reactant which altered the reaction rate instead the surface with aa carboxylate which provides the metal ligand complexes sites is equally important which explained the poor fitting of the pnipam co aa composite system into pseudo first order model subsequently the experimental data was also fitted into the intra particle diffusion model represented by the kinetic plots of qt versus t1 2 of the hydrogel that passed through the origin as illustrated in fig 12 c the r2 value was observed to be only 0 657 signifying that the intra particle diffusion was not the major mechanism throughout the adsorption process 4 conclusion thermo magneto responsive pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps composite hydrogels was employed as chelating agent to remove cr3 ions the hydrogels show serious hysteresis in their thermo responsiveness due to the agglomeration of hydrogel particles bridged by surface adsorbed cr3 the composite hydrogels exhibited that magnetic susceptibility of the hydrogels increased appreciably after adsorption of cr3 leading to faster phase separation nonetheless desorption prevailed at increasing temperature for the surface physical adsorption and the adsorption resumed during cooling process for system with high initial cr3 concentration the cr3 adsorption kinetics of the hydrogels was fitted well to pseudo second order delineating that both the feed concentration and surface functional group of hydrogels predominated in the irreversible uptake of cr3 declaration of competing interest none

14281,the thermo responsive swelling shrinking behaviour of the poly n isopropylacrylamide pnipam hydrogels under the effect of temperature change have mechanistic function upon controlling the uptake and release of cr3 ions by the hydrogel networks in this study acrylic acid aa was co polymerized with pnipam onto the silica coated magnetic nanoparticles mnps to form thermo magneto responsive pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps composite hydrogels with increased density of cr3 binding groups its temperature manipulated adsorption desorption efficiency as well as their magnetic phase separability were investigated chromium loaded hydrogels shown apparent phase separation under influence of low gradient magnetic field desorption of cr3 gradually predominated as temperature increased from 298 k to 323 k under high initial cr3 concentration whereby physical adsorption is prevailing the re uptake of cr3 occurred when the solution being cooled down to 298 k furthermore the adsorption kinetic analysis revealed that the adsorption of cr3 by pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps hydrogels was governed by surface precipitation of cr3 keywords adsoprtion desorption thermoresponsive hydrogel magnetophoresis heavy metal removal 1 introduction chromium is a ubiquitous heavy metal which can be found in effluents exuded from a myriad of industrial activities running the gamut from electroplating mining to leather dyeing removal of cr3 can be acquired via various conventional approaches including ph dependent chemical precipitation ion exchange by resins adsorption via ligand chelation and membrane filtration nonetheless the efficiency of these methods has been vitiated by several drawbacks such as production of secondary precipitates and low metal recovery 1 8 in view of questing for efficient removal of cr3 ions there have been numbers of studies performed on assessing the feasibility of utilizing water soluble polymers as chromium iii ions chelators in aqueous solutions liu et al 9 synthesized a type of coordination polymer 4 2 4 pyridin 3 yl methoxy phenyl diazenyl benzoic acid which contained the designed ligand with the carbomethoxy laced group was employed as adsorbent for the selective removal of cr3 from aqueous solution choi et al 10 fabricated polyethylenimine silica pei silica via one step facile method which involved the participation of amine groups in the reduction and adsorption of cr6 and cr3 in aqueous solution respectively nonetheless low adsorption capacity and the separability of these adsorbents from bulk aqueous solution remain as setback for improving the adsorption efficiency in this work a type of composite hydrogels with magnetite nanoparticles mnps as cores namely poly n isopropylacrylamide co acrylic acid pnipam co aa hydrogels with encapsulated magnetic cores were employed as adsorbent for adsorption of chromium trivalent ions cr3 in aqueous solution poly n isopropylacylamide pnipam is a type of thermo responsive hydrogel in which its cross linked polymer network exhibits reversible swelling shrinking behaviour in response to the variation of temperature at temperature above its lower critical solution temperature lcst the hydrogel matrix starts to shrink as water is released until it reaches fully dehydrated state with increasing temperature and vice versa hence the thermo responsive swelling shrinking behaviour is conceived to endow the hydrogel with the ability of controlled uptake release of the cr3 ions under temperature variation 11 13 in addition the carboxylates coo of aa co monomer moiety in pnipam co aa are prominent electron donating groups that could act as effective ligands to chelate cr3 cations in aqueous phase cr3 are chelated by multidentates via different interactions including electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding as well as covalent bonds moreover the magnetic cores of the composite hydrogels consisting of fe3o4 magnetite nanoparticles mnps are useful for magnetic separation of the adsorbate adsorbent from the bulk reaction solution by using an external magnetic field 14 11 15 16 hence by coupling magnetic behaviour of the mnps with the temperature manipulated adsorption properties of the pnipam networks the synergistic effect of both thermo responsiveness and magneto responsiveness of the composite hydrogels upon their interactions with cr3 and its removal efficiency in aqueous solution was evaluated in this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the chemicals used for the synthesis of mnps magnetic cores of the composite hydrogels were ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o ferrous chloride tetrahydrate fecl2 4h2o and sodium hydroxide naoh then poly vinylpyrrolidone pvp 10 kg mol 1 and tetraethyl orthosilicate teos were used for surface functionalization and silica coating of mnps respectively subsequently monomer n isopropylacrylamide nipam c6h11no cross linker n n methylene bis acrylamide mba c7h10n2o2 99 and co monomer acrylic acid aa were applied for polymerization of pnipam co aa layer and chromium iii nitrate nonahydrate crn3o9 9h2o was used as chromium iii ion source in aqueous solution the aforementioned chemicals were all purchased from sigma aldrich in addition ammonium persulfate aps which was the initiator for nipam polymerization ethanol c2h5oh and ammonia solution 25 wt used as solvents for stöber process were obtained from merck all chemicals are of analytical grade and were used as supplied 2 2 preparation of fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles mnps the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles were synthesized via co precipitation method fecl3 6h2o and fecl2 4h2o were dissolved in 150 ml of distilled water in a molar ratio 0 5 the mixture solution was stirred continuously at 600 rpm in a 250 ml three necked bottom and it was degassed with n2 for 30 min then the obtained transparent solution was heated to 80 c under rapid mechanical stirring 600 rpm subsequently 20 ml of naoh 10 m was injected into the solution the resultant black dispersion was stirred for another 1 h at 90 c after being cooled to room temperature the produced suspension was subjected to magnetic separation to harvest the magnetic nanoparticles 14 15 17 2 3 synthesis of pnipam co aa encapsulated mnps composite hydrogels the produced mnps dispersion was functionalized with pvp as mediating layer for acquiring effective coating of silica layer then the silica was incorporated onto pvp functionalized mnps via stöber method which was carried out by dispersing the pvp mnps into 40 ml ethanol 2 mmol teos and 3 ml of ammonium hydroxide 25 wt were mixed into the solution the mixture solution was stirred for 12 h at 40 c the produced silica pvp mnps solution was centrifuged for two cycles at 7000 rpm by dispersing into di water the dispersion was collected by a cylindrical neodymium boron ferrite ndfeb magnet with remanence magnetization of 1 45 t 14 18 20 subsequently pnipam cross linked network layers was prepared through free radical polymerization monomer nipam 0 28 g co monomer acrylic acid aa and cross linker mba 0 025 g were dissolved in a three necked flask containing 170 ml deionized water the mixture solution was then heated up to 70 c in water bath meanwhile nitrogen gas was also purged into the solution for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen after that aps 0 11 g was introduced into the solution to initiate the reaction the solution was stirred at 350 rpm for 4 h at 70 c as a result the pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps composite hydrogels with magnetic cores were formed as whitish brown suspension in aqueous phase the obtained hydrogel suspension was centrifuged to discard the impurities and it was re dispersed in deionized water then it was separated by a ndfeb magnet 1 45 t the final product harvested was dispersed again in 40 ml di water for storage 11 21 25 2 4 characterization of pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps composite hydrogels 2 4 1 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir analysis for infrared detection the hydrogel suspension was air dried into powder form the functional groups of hydrogels were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscope nicolet is10 ft ir spectrometer in the range of 4000 500 cm 1 with atr technique 2 4 2 thermal gravimetric analysis tga thermal gravimetric analysis tga perkin elmer usa was performed to estimate the pnipam co aa cross linked polymeric network loading on the silica coated mnps the sample mass of 5 mg was used and being placed on alumina crucible all measurements were conducted under nitrogen purging and ambient pressure at the rate of 10 c min 1 ramp heating from ambient temperature to 800 c 2 4 3 dynamic light scattering dls the thermo responsive variations in hydrodynamic diameter dh of the composite hydrogel particle were monitored by a dynamic light scattering apparatus malvern zetasizer 1000 equipped with a helium neon laser λ 633 nm and a detector located at 90 in principle the intensity fluctuation on the incident laser light scattered by the hydrogel particles was detected at an angle of 173 non invasive back scatter nibs which was then autofitted into an exponential decay correlation function subsequently this correlation function is mathematically treated through cumulants method defined in iso 13321 and iso 22412 to attain a translational diffusion coefficient dt the dt was fitted into the stokes einstein equation for obtaining the corresponding dh in which the equation is expressed as follows 1 d h k t 3 π η d t where k refers to boltzmann s constant m2 kg k 1 s 2 η is the solvent viscosity pa s dt represents translational diffusion coefficient m2 s 1 and t denotes absolute temperature k hence all of the monodispersed particles or cluster of particles in the samples are assumed to be spherical shape 26 27 moreover in order to avoid multiple scattering effect and particle interactions all dls measurements were carried out at diluted sample concentration of 5 10 mg l 1 the range of inspection was fixed at the temperature range of 25 50 c to establish the profile of dh change against temperature 2 4 4 transmission electronic microscopy tem morphological observation of hydrogel was carried out using jeol transmission electron microscope tem jeol jem 200cx at 100 kv a few droplets of hydrogel suspension samples were spread onto the surface of a 300 mesh copper grid and allowed to dry for 30 min the dried specimen was clamped onto a tem specimen rod and inserted into the sample chamber for observation 2 4 5 magnetophoresis kinetics measurement 4 ml of a sample hydrogel suspension with initial concentration fixed at 500 mg l 1 was filled into a standard uv vis cuvette which was placed on a cylindrical neodymium boron ferrite ndfeb magnet remanence magnetization of 1 45 t for solute phase separation then the concentration variation of the suspension bulk phase against time was monitored by a uv vis spectrophotometer agilent cary 60 equipped with monochromatic light having wavelength of 500 nm the beam of light was passed through the sample suspension and the variations in light absorbance were recorded the concentration change of each sample suspension was monitored at every interval of 12 min for the duration of 7 h 2 4 6 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the xps spectra were acquired by using axis ultra dld kratos equipped with a al kα x ray source 1486 6 ev at 10 ma 15 kv to analyze a 300 μmm 700 μm area under 3 4 10 9 torr ultra vacuum environment inside a sample analyzing chamber the analysis was performed in the hybrid lens mode with the slot aperture and the analyzer was operated in fixed analyzer transmission fat mode with pass energy of the hemispherical analyzer was set at 160 ev for the survey scan the samples were dried under vacuum before xps analysis the calibration of the binding energy of the spectra was performed with the c 1s peak at 284 6 ev the spectra were analyzed by employing vision software which was coupled with vision manager and vision processing 2 5 chromium iii adsorption desorption study 2 5 1 measurement of cr3 concentration a series of vials filled with 50 ml reaction solutions containing 4 mg of the composite hydrogels as adsorbent and stock solutions of cr3 with initial concentrations c0 ranging from 20 to 100 mg l 1 prepared by using crn3o9 9h2o the solution ph of each sample in the vials was adjusted to ph 5 by using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh for attaining optimum equilibrium adsorption then the reaction sample filled vials were rotated at 40 rpm on a rotator mixer for 24 h subsequently the chromium loaded hydrogel particles in every solution was separated by a cylindrical ndfeb magnet the cr3 concentration in the supernatant of each reaction solution was determined by employing an agilent cary 60 uv vis spectrophotometer integrated with monochromatic light at wavelength of 585 nm prior to measurements a profile of absorbance change against cr3 concentration was first plotted as a calibration curve by measuring the light absorbances of a control set of cr3 solutions with known concentrations then the cr3 concentration in supernatant of each separated reaction sample was derived by comparing the light absorbance measured to the calibration curve the adsorption percentage of cr3 was expressed as 2 c r 3 a d s o r p t i o n c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 mg l 1 and ce mg l 1 denote the initial and equilibrium cr3 concentration respectively the composite hydrogel capacity of cr3 uptake at equilibrium can be represented by equilibrium adsorption capacity qe which is expressed as follows 3 q e c 0 c e m v where v l is the total volume of the solution m g refers to the dry mass of pristine composite hydrogels another experiment was performed to examine temperature dependent adsorption desorption of cr3 by immersing a series of hydrogel chromium solutions kept in vials with c0 of 20 40 50 60 80 and 100 mg l 1 into a water bath the solutions were first heated in water bath from 298 to 323 k and the solutions were cooled back to 298 k measurement of cr3 concentration in bulk phase was carried out every temperature set prior to every measurement made the solutions were rotated for overnight to attain adsorption equilibrium then the hydrogels were separated by magnets and supernatant of each solution was harvested for cr3 concentration measurement after measurement the supernatants were poured back into the hydrogel solutions and the separated hydrogel particles were re dispersed into the bulk phase for next temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 ftir characterization in fig 1 the presence of aa in the co polymeric pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps composite hydrogels was confirmed by the asymmetric carbonyl co stretching of carboxylic cooh groups possessed by aa moieties as manifested by the peak at around 1716 cm 1 after cr3 adsorption this characteristic peak had disappeared due to the complexation between cr3 with the carbonyl co of carboxylic groups in aa moieties 21 24 in addition the peak reduction at 1539 cm 1 also signified the participation of nh of amide in chelation with cr3 it is in parallel with the frequency shift for the characteristic peak of amide i from 1640 to 1645 cm 1 and the substantial reduction in peak intensity also infers the lone pairs possessed by both co and nh had been involved in cr3 coordination similarly the small peaks at 2972 1459 and 1368 cm 1 present in the spectrum of pristine pnipam co aa mnps had also vanished after the hydrogels were loaded with cr3 where these missing peaks were assigned to asymmetric ch stretching asymmetric and symmetric ch bending of methyl respectively again this observation connotes the electron donating tendency of these alky groups that had contributed to the multidentate coordination of cr3 to form ligand chelated complex 21 25 28 31 3 2 tga analysis thermal gravimetric analysis was performed to examine the extent of pnipam co aa network polymerized onto the silica coated magnetic mnps fig 2 depicts the weight decay against the step wise increase in temperature the first stage of weight loss observed at around 210 c was ascribed to the decomposition of certain amount of volatile substances trapped within the pnipam co aa networks and the polymer itself the second stage of weight loss as portrayed by another meagre decline in weight percentage observed at around 416 c corresponding to the decomposition of residual aa fragments 15 22 25 the absolute weight loss for silica coated mnps was 12 47 wt whereas total weight decay of 16 79 wt was acquired by pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps hence merely 4 32 wt of the composite hydrogels was constituted by the pnipam co aa network layer 3 3 thermo responsiveness of the composite hydrogels before and after cr3 adsorption the thermo responsive behaviour of the magnetic composite hydrogels was evaluated before and after cr3 adsorption by employing dls technique the variation of hydrodynamic diameter dh of the samples was probed within the temperature range of 298 323 k in our previous study the synthesized homo polymeric pnipam silica pvp mnps magnetic composite hydrogels had the same lower critical solution temperature lcst as that of pure pnipam hydrogels which was around 305 k 32 c 1 2 it is the threshold temperature for the hydrogel network structures to undergo volume phase transition vpt in aqueous dispersion as characterized by its shrinkage in conformation at temperature above lcst 14 23 however in this work the plots of hydrodynamic diameter dh change against temperature in fig 3 a demonstrates reduction in dh initiated immediately from 943 nm to 830 nm as the temperature was raised gradually from 298 to 305 k the abrupt drop in particle size was attributed to the expulsion of water molecules from the co polymeric pnipam co aa matrices then the heating induced shrinkage became insignificant in which dh decreased slightly to 818 nm as temperature increased further to 315 k as temperature elevated part of the hydrophilic groups had been invaginated into the network interior and engaged in forming stable inner hydrogen bonds among amides of nipam moiety and carboxylates of aa that led to relatively more rigid network structures these intra particle bonds impaired the resilience of the matrix structures upon temperature driven swelling shrinking mechanism 22 24 32 full dehydration could have occurred at 317 k where the hydrogel particles shrunk to their core size at around 790 nm nonetheless as heating carried on until 323 k more hydrophilic functionalities including carboxylates were sequestered into the hydrogel matrix interior this had led to like charge repulsion among dehydrated carboxylates which was also restraint by the formation of more inner hydrogen bonds among carboxylates and amides resulting in only meagre re expansion of the particle to 817 nm nearly linear dh change against decreasing temperature during cooling cycle and the apparent hysteresis observed were attributed to reduced interstitial space within hydrogel networks caused by some irreversible inter and intra chain hydrogen bonds forms among both aa and nipam moieties that could have impeded the diffusion of water molecules into hydrogel matrices 22 23 after adsorption of cr3 the profile of dh change against temperature was shown in fig 3 b the composite hydrogels had been enlarged to 1 18 μm after being loaded with cr3 at 298 k with mild increment in dh of 18 55 in relation to the pristine hydrogels before adsorption at ph 5 cr3 aqua cation exists in aqueous environment as monohydroxo species when one of the water molecules anchored around the centre cr3 ion of original cr3 h2o 6 3 hexaaqua ions pka 4 3 was hydrolysed into hydroxide oh this resulted in the formation of cr3 h2o 5 oh 2 monohydroxo species which bears a hydroxide ion with enhanced reactivity toward the hydrogel ligands especially carbonyls of aa carboxylates 30 33 35 in addition as being explained by petrou et al 31 the hydroxides in the complex enhanced the labilization destabilization of the coordinated h2o molecule which is located trans to the oh in the octahedral cr3 complex the labile unstable trans water molecule could easily be substituted by the h bonded ligand coh of the carboxylate then the coh is deprotonated by the oh via hydrolysis to form stronger and more stable crco bond after all this results in 102 103 fold higher in reaction rate for hydroxo aqua over hexaaqua complex ion moreover the hydroxide also inclined to bridge other cr3 monohydroxo complex ions in the bulk phase to polymerize into polynuclear species that precipitated on the surfaces of hydrogel besides these surface adsorbed cr3 hydroxo precipitates tend to act as bridging linkage to facilitate agglomeration of the hydrogels 28 29 35 37 along the heating cycle the hydrogels loaded with cr3 exhibited reverse thermo responsiveness the size of hydrogels expanded from 1 02 μm to 1 30 μm as temperature increased from 298 to 323 k the size increment was 28 contributed by like charge repulsion among cr3 laden aa carboylates the dh of the hydrogel continually grew into more than double of its size at 323 k 1 3 μm until 2 92 μm as temperature reduced to 298 k more water ligands of the cr3 aqua ions were hydrolyzed into hydroxides following the change in pka of the bulk solvent and enthalpy during heating hence when cooling process began the hydrolytically polymerized hydroxo species of cr3 that had been precipitated on the hydrogel surfaces acted as interfacial bridging agents for the agglomeration of hydrogel particles the dh of hydrogels increased substantially along the cooling cycle as more hydrogels were agglomerated as enthalpy driven mobility abated as temperature decreased 31 35 36 the ζ profile versus temperature in fig 4 a depicts that the hydrogels had highly negative surface charge with ζ of 41 3 mv measured at 298 k before heating the negativity of the hydrogel surfaces was invoked by the deprotonated carboxylates of aa moieties when temperature rose to 307 k the negative value of ζ reduced to 33 2 mv and remained nearly constant within a narrow range of 33 2 and 34 9 mv as temperature further elevated to 323 k at the beginning of heating the initial reduction of ζ was caused by the dehydration process where the dehydrated hydrophilic groups were invaginated into the network interiors and the hydrophobic isopropyls were re oriented towards bulk phase consequently inner hydrogen bonds within hydrogel matrices were formed among hydrophilic carboxylates and amides which could have reduced the density of surface carboxylates after that the hydrogel suspension was quenched from 323 to 310 k its ζ increased again to 36 4 mv and remained nearly constant until the end of cooling process at 298 k as most of the hydrophilic groups were still engaged in inner hydrogen bonds there was a formation of hydrophobic hydration layer engulfing the exposed hydrophobic isopropyl moieties the increase in negative ζ values was ascribed to the migration of oh ions from bulk aqueous phase onto the hydrophobic hydration shell around hydrogel surface as described by utashiro et al 38 they also reported that the assembly of oh on the hydrogel surfaces was progressively stabilized along with the stabilization of the hydrophobic hydration shell zangi and engberts 39 performed molecular dynamics md simulation upon the assembly of oh ions from aqueous bulk phase on a hydrophobic surface through physisorption their simulation results indicated that the interaction energy between oh ions and the waters near the hydrophobic surface helps stabilize the hydration layer to compensate for the entropy loss this occurs when entropy abated after re alignment of waters in the hydration layer into an ordered structure around the hydrophobic groups hence they also concluded that the driving force for the migration of oh ions from bulk aqueous phase is the preferential re orientation of the water molecules in the hydrophobic hydration shell around the hydrophobic surface they explained that the ordered alignment of physisorbed water molecules in the hydration layer creates an electrical potential gradient that inclined to interact with the dipole moment of the oh ions 43 on the contrary the chromium loaded composite hydrogels exhibited ζ profile in the positive region as shown in fig 4 b the complexation between cr3 and hydrogel ligands established positively charged surface potential the initial ζ was measured to be 15 9 mv and the value dropped to 8 27 mv at 310 k some water molecules were dissociated from the cr3 ions and the vacant coordination sites were replaced by oh with better affinity toward the complex centre cr3 then ζ ascended again to 11 8 mv at 323 k as further heating catalyzed dissociation of more physisorbed water molecules from the outer hydrated shell around the adsorbed cr3 layer the alignment of water molecules in the hydration shell was disrupted which in turn deteriorated the electrical potential gradient that draws oh from bulk solvent as a result more adsorbed cr3 was unshielded by both water molecules and oh which enhanced again the surface positive charge potential in a slight increment 3 4 magnetophoresis kinetic measurements of magnetic composite hydrogels colloidal stability of hydrogel particles in aqueous environment relied on several manipulating variables including particle size distribution surface area and surface charge particularly the particle size and surface charge density counteract the gravity effect on sedimentation rate of solutes in suspension in line with this the rate of decline in solute concentration in the bulk phase over time manifests colloidal stability of the hydrogel suspension 19 40 41 20 27 fig 5 a displays the comparison of normalized concentration profiles against time for suspensions of the composite hydrogels before and after cr3 adsorption in the absence of magnetic field gradient before adsorption the pristine composite hydrogels exhibited much slower decline rate in concentration over the monitoring period due to their high density of negative surface charges as reflected in fig 4 a this created inter particle electrostatic repulsion to counteract the gravity effect which drove the settlement of the hydrogels 20 27 after equilibrium adsorption of cr3 distinct deterioration of colloidal stability was observed the surface adsorbed cr3 rendered a net positive charge density over the particle surfaces and the interfacial electrostatic repulsion helped sustain the stability of the hydrogel for only 120 min then the concentration started to decline and the surface precipitated hydroxo cr3 also acted as bridging factor that formed interfacial linkages among hydrogels which causing susceptible to agglomeration as a result the gravity pull over agglomerated hydrogel particles gradually overcame interfacial repulsion and settlement occurred in a moderate rate 40 20 fig 5 b shows the separation kinetic profiles for the same set of hydrogels under influence of low gradient magnetic field pristine hydrogels demonstrated slower rate of concentration degeneration due to high density of negative charge coverage on the surfaces creating interfacial repulsion between hydrogels that enhanced their stability against external magnetic field after equilibrium adsorption of cr3 the rate of decline in concentration of the hydrogel suspension increased considerably the adsorbed cr3 onto the aa co polymerized hydrogels was mainly aggregated on surfaces as seen in the tem images the bridging effect of adsorbed cr3 hydroxo species induced agglomeration of the hydrogels which in turn enhanced their magneto responsiveness as portrayed by the high rate of concentration decline 40 41 20 3 5 particle structure fig 6 refers to tem images of the composite hydrogels before and after cr3 adsorption fig 6 a and b show that the pristine hydrogels have irregular shape with particle size observed to be in the range of 550 667 nm before adsorption on the other hand fig 6 c and d reveals that the hydrogels enlarged to the size range of 708 840 nm after being loaded with cr3 species the precipitates of less soluble cr3 hydroxo complexes were seen accumulated on the hydrogel surfaces indicating surface adsorption could have prevailed in the adsorption the cr3 hydroxo species acted as interfacial bridging agents that caused the agglomeration of hydrogels after adsorption as shown in fig 6 c and supported by the profile of dh change in fig 3 b 31 35 3 6 xps analyisis xps study was conducted to examine the changes in the elemental composition of pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps hydrogel surfaces fig 7 shows the spectra of the hydrogels before and after adsorption of cr3 in which the characteristic peaks of c 1s n 1s and o 1s were identified small peak of cr 2p3 2 at 577 ev was detected after cr3 adsorption as illustrated in the insert of fig 7 which is assigned to cr3 trivalent species 1 42 2 43 the relative atomic concentrations ac in percentage of carbon c nitrogen n oxygen o and chromium cr are listed in table 1 after adsorption there were reductions in ac for carbon and nitrogen on the hydrogel surface from 38 98 to 24 57 and from 4 22 to 1 02 respectively according to literature the decreases in ac for these surface elemental compositions signify that the presence of cr3 hydroxo species on surface could have involved the functional chelation of the elements on the other hand the distinct peak of oxygen at 532 ev is assigned to oxygen containing functional groups that includes both hydroxyls of cr3 hydroxo complexes and carbonyls of amides 1 44 2 the increase in ac for o 1s from 37 43 to 48 63 indicating the attachment of cr3 hydroxo species in meagre amount on the surfaces of hydrogels this is further confirmed by the increase in the o c ratio from 0 960 to 1 979 suggesting the presence of cr3 hydroxo complexes on the hydrogel surfaces 44 46 furthermore the presence of cr3 species on the hydrogel surfaces was also proven by the ac of cr 2p3 2 measured at 1 35 after adsorption as presented in table 1 as well 3 7 cr3 adsorption efficiency the efficiency of cr3 adsorption in terms of adsorption percentage and the adsorption capacity qe of the hydrogels were plotted against initial cr3 concentrations c0 as presented in fig 8 the adsorption percentage of cr3 declined from 28 34 to 9 33 with increasing c0 from 20 to 100 mg l 1 the inverse trend of cr3 uptake against c0 was due to the reduction in ratio of available cr3 binding sites on the composite hydrogels to the total cr3 ions present in the bulk solution as c0 increased on the contrary the profile of cr3 adsorption capacity qe against c0 was in directly proportional trend where qe ascended from 141 70 to 233 36 mg g 1 with elevating c0 increased concentration of cr3 in bulk solution created higher concentration gradient as the driving force which overrode the resistance on the mass transfer of cr3 between the aqueous bulk phase and adsorbent surfaces as a result this phenomenon enhanced the amount of cr3 to be driven toward the binding sites of hydrogels 3 5 8 9 60 3 8 adsorption isotherm of cr3 ions the equilibrium adsorption data was fitted langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherm models to deduce possible cr3 adsorption mechanisms acquired by the composite hydrogels the optimal degree of cr3 uptake by the hydrogels is characterized as the maximum adsorption capacity qm which could be derived from the adsorption isotherm plots with certain underlying assumptions langmuir isotherm depicts monolayer adsorption of the cr3 ions on the hydrogel surfaces which is represented as 4 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where ce mg l 1 represents the equilibrium concentration of cr3 ions qe denotes the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g 1 qm refers to the maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 kl l mg 1 is known as langmuir constant which is related to the adsorption energy the linear form of the equation can be expressed as 5 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m the qm can be obtained from the slope of the linear plot of ce qe versus ce whereas kl can be derived from the plot intercept 47 48 on the other hand freundlich isotherm is an empirical adsorption model for a heterogeneous surface it is not limited to description of monolayer adsorption but it can also be employed to elucidate multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous adsorbent surface with uneven coverage of adsorption energy it assumes that the stronger binding sites of adsorbent are bound to adsorbates first which leads to the exponential decline in adsorption energy until adsorption equilibrium is achieved the model is represented by the following equation 6 q e k f c e 1 n where qe is equilibrium cr3 adsorption capacity mg g 1 ce is the equilibrium concentration of cr3 mg l 1 kf denotes a distribution coefficient which is also known as freundlich constant l g 1 and 1 n represents the heterogeneity factor for the ease of plotting the equation can be derived into the linear form as follow 7 log q e 1 n log c e log k f the slope is the value of heterogeneity factor 1 n and the freundlich constant kf is obtained from the intercept the heterogeneity factor 1 n depicts the adsorption intensity of adsorbates onto the adsorbent surface heterogeneity when value of 1 n is between 0 and 1 it is indicative of favourable adsorption isotherm the nature of adsorption is chemisorption for 1 n 1 and cooperative adsorption occurs for 1 n 1 in the case where 1 n approaches 0 the surface of adsorbent becomes increasingly heterogeneous and the isotherm is non linear as 1 n goes above unity depicts unfavourable adsorption isotherm 48 49 fig 9 shows plot of experimental qe on the cr3 adsorption by pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps was compared to the plots of qe obtained by fitting data to the isotherm models against different equilibrium cr3 concentrations ce freundlich isotherm exhibits better fit than that of langmuir isotherm as presented in table 2 both r2 values for langmuir and freundlich are close to 1 with values of 0 9248 and 0 9537 respectively hence this suggests that both monolayer and multilayer adsorption of cr3 on the surface of composite hydrogel could have occurred prevalently the heterogeneity factor of freundlich isotherm n is 1 which also indicated that the adsorption intensity is favourable over the range of experimental data perused in addition the maximum adsorption capacity qm of the hydrogel calculated from langmuir isotherm can achieve 243 90 mg g 1 3 9 comparison with other polymeric adsorbents a comparison of the hydrogel adsorbent systems with other polymeric adsorbents for the adsorption of cr3 ions is presented in table 3 as seen from the data summarized in table 2 the pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps composite hydrogel system have relatively higher adsorption capacities in comparison to other methods reported in table 2 the relatively high adsorption capacity of the hydrogel is via surface precipitation as well as collective magnetophoresis of the hydrogel together with the precipitated chromium 3 10 thermo responsive adsorption desorption of cr3 fig 10 illustrates the changing profiles of qe normalized by its respective equilibrium cr3 concentration ce at different temperatures for the composite hydrogels at temperature of 298 k the qe ce ratio revealed a decreasing trend from 5 99 to 1 99 with ascending c0 from 20 to 100 mg l 1 due to the decline in ratio of occupied binding sites of hydrogels to the total concentration of cr3 in the solution the adsorption of cr3 was governed by the precipitation of cr3 hydroxo species on the hydrogel surfaces bound by the carboxylates coo of the aa moiety and amides to form metal ligand surface complexes this agrees with the disappearance of characteristic peaks at frequencies 1716 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 in the ft ir spectra after adsorption of cr3 as shown in fig 1 when temperature rose to 323 k normalized qe reduced from 8 84 to 0 20 with increasing c0 continual uptake of cr3 happened for only lower c0 from 20 to 50 mg l 1 as heating driven hydrolysis of cr3 aqua ions converted coordinated water molecules anchored around cr3 centre into oh hydroxyl groups the hydrolysed cr3 bearing hydroxyls had higher affinity towards the binding groups of hydrogels by bridging more stable hydrogen bonds and precipitated onto hydrogel surfaces nevertheless at higher temperature desorption of cr3 happened for the higher regime of c 0 from 60 to 100 mg l 1 signified the release of physisorbed cr3 back to the bulk solution heat was consumed endothermically for hydrolyzing water ligands coordinated with cr3 centre at higher temperature compensating the hydroxides converting effect moreover higher concentration of cr3 aqua ions in the bulk phase also created higher concentration gradient favouring multilayer physisorption of cr3 which was enthalpically dissociated at higher temperature this explained the net release of cr3 from hydrogels enhanced with increasing c0 from 60 to 100 mg l 1 then as the solution was being quenched back to 298 k the qe ce was improved for c0 in the higher range of 50 100 mg l 1 the hydrogels gradually agglomerated along the cooling process as reflected in dh profile in fig 3 b the particle size of hydrogels grew to as large as 2 9 μm during cooling cycle the enthalpy driven mobility of the hydrogels abated and more cr3 hydroxo aqua ions had been functioning as interfacial bridging agents for the agglomeration of hydrogel particles the aggregation of these chromium laden hydrogels allowed the surface adsorbed cr3 hydroxo complex ions to bridge more cr3 hydroxo complex ions from the bulk phase via hydrolytic dimerization and polymerization at ph above the pka of cr3 hexaaqua ions pka 4 3 the hydrolysed complexes started to dimerize or to polymerize forming polynuclear complexes and precipitate on the adsorbent surfaces at low temperature as a result the re uptake of cr3 was possibly driven by migration of hydrated cr3 from bulk phase and reversibly physisorbed onto the hydrogel surfaces this explained the net re adsorption occurred under cooling stage especially for higher concentration of cr3 where higher concentration gradient helped catalyze the cr3 polymerization in other words most surface aa moiety had been irreversibly occupied by bound cr3 during heating process and the re uptake of cr3 along cooling process might be largely contributed by surface polymerization of cr3 hydroxo species which is especially significant for higher concentration of cr3 instead thermo responsiveness did not seem to play a role in the adsorption desorption of cr3 in this case schematic diagram in fig 11 illustrates the adsorption of cr3 and formation of inner hydrogen bonds within pnipam co aa cross linked networks that restraint re swelling of the hydrogel during cooling process cr3 had been irreversibly precipitated on hydrogel surface binding groups during cooling process more cr3 were bridged by the surface cr3 hydroxo complexes which also induced agglomeration of hydrogels however the composite systems show net desorption during heating which was largely ascribed to the enthalpy driven dissociation of hydrated cr3 from the hydrogel surfaces 3 11 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics relies on the adsorbate adsorbent interaction as well as the adsorption condition where its evaluation is influenced by two vital variables that are the mechanism and the reaction rate of the adsorption the uptake rate of adsorbates from the bulk phase by the adsorbents delineates the residence time required to achieve adsorption equilibrium that can be deduced from the adsorption kinetic studies in our study three models of kinetics were adopted for adsorption data fitting namely pseudo first order pseudo second order and the intra particle diffusion models the pseudo first order kinetics was formulated by lagergren to describe the adsorption kinetics of solute adsorption onto solid adsorbent surface for a liquid solid adsorption system the pseudo first order model is represented as the following expression 8 d q t d t k 1 q e q t where qe and qt denotes the adsorption capacity of hydrogel mg g 1 at equilibrium and at time t respectively k1 refers to the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 the differential equation is integrated into a linear relationship by applying the initial conditions qt 0 at t 0 which is shown as below 9 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t pseudo second order kinetics model is applicable when the rate limiting step is the direct adsorption process on adsorbent surfaces that involves chemisorption and the uptake of solutes from bulk phase by adsorbent is governed by physicochemical interactions between the two phases the most common form of the pseudo second order kinetics was derived by ho and mckay which is expressed in linear relationship as below 10 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 refers to the pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 both pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models are not applicable for implicating the adsorption of cr3 ions into hydrogel networks via diffusion mechanism the diffusion mechanism of solute adsorption from liquid bulk phase onto adsorbent surface is characterized on a diffusion resistance which influences the adsorption kinetics in the adsorption of solutes into cross linked polymeric hydrogel structures the main diffusion resistance could be manifested by the cross linking degree of the corresponding hydrogels 54 57 furthermore the intraparticle diffusion resistances on adsorption kinetics was assessed by using the weber morris equation which was derived from fick s law for describing diffusion of adsorbates into spherical adsorbents the entire adsorption process could take place either by a single step or multiple steps which is usually observed in film diffusion pore diffusion and surface diffusion hence the intra particle diffusion model was employed to evaluate the diffusion process of cr3 into the hydrogel structures the initial rate of intra particle diffusion is calculated from the linearized form of the function qt f t1 2 as below which represents the relationship between the adsorption capacity at time t qt and the square root of adsorption time t1 2 11 q t k i d t 1 2 c i d where kid represents the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 1 2 the intercept of the linear equation cid mg g 1 refers to a constant related to the thickness of the boundary layer for intra particle diffusion to take place the plot of qt versus t1 2 should be linear and it is the rate limiting step if the line passes through the origin in the case when there is multi linearity along the plot of qt versus t1 2 this implies that two or three steps are involved in the intra particle diffusion process in the first step instantaneous adsorption occurs at the external surface adsorption it is followed by the second step which is known as the gradual adsorption step where intra particle diffusion of solutes into adsorbent structure is rate controlling then in the third step final equilibrium is achieved where solutes diffuse slowly from larger pores to micropores resulting in a slow adsorption rate 58 59 the calculated and experimental equilibrium adsorption capacity qe adsorption rate constants k1 k2 and kid determined from the three models are presented in table 4 along with the regression coefficient r2 the r2 values in table 4 revealed that the data only fitted well to the pseudo second order model with r2 closer to unity which has the value of 0 995 this implies that the adsorption of cr3 on the surface of the hydrogels was contributed equally by two important parameters namely the feed concentration as well as the presence of functional group aa on the hydrogel matrix this is in accordance to what has been proposed in fig 11 however the data has poor fitting to both pseudo first order model with low r2 values of 0 693 the discrepancy between calculated qe cal and experimental qe exp implicated that the adsorption kinetic did not follow pseudo first order model the pseudo second order model indicated that the excess concentration of cr3 was not the only rate determining reactant which altered the reaction rate instead the surface with aa carboxylate which provides the metal ligand complexes sites is equally important which explained the poor fitting of the pnipam co aa composite system into pseudo first order model subsequently the experimental data was also fitted into the intra particle diffusion model represented by the kinetic plots of qt versus t1 2 of the hydrogel that passed through the origin as illustrated in fig 12 c the r2 value was observed to be only 0 657 signifying that the intra particle diffusion was not the major mechanism throughout the adsorption process 4 conclusion thermo magneto responsive pnipam co aa silica pvp mnps composite hydrogels was employed as chelating agent to remove cr3 ions the hydrogels show serious hysteresis in their thermo responsiveness due to the agglomeration of hydrogel particles bridged by surface adsorbed cr3 the composite hydrogels exhibited

14282,heterojunction photocatalysts has gained much attention in last decade due to their high photo catalytic activity therefore we have synthesized ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 a visible light photo catalyst via single step micro emulsification followed by controlled hydrothermal and calcination treatment simultaneous crystallization of tio2 and conversion of bulk g c3n4 into nano sheets took place by hydrothermal and calcination respectively the degradation efficiency of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 for mb and rhb was quite high with rate constant k 0 120 0 156 min 1 than tio2 g c3n4 k 0 035 0 053 min 1 and ag agbr tio2 k 0 015 0 016 min 1 respectively this phenomenon was explained in terms of multiplex synergy such as localized surface plasmon resonance lspr of agnps and absorption of visible light by agbr further the interfacial electron transferring within ag agbr tio2 and g c3n4 has equal contribution apart the suitable adjustment of band edge potential ensures the enhance separation of electron hole pairs providing an excellent photocatalytic activity moreover ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 exhibited good photo stability and reusability due to plasmonic properties of agnps keywords photocatalytic system visible light charge carrier s transportation degradation 1 introduction photo active materials have a number of applications in our daily life and one of the biggest application is self degradation of material with time and to reduce the waste management issues 1 3 this is reason scientists have the interest in this field and trying their level best to tailor the properties according to the application the tio2 is considered one of the most prominent heterogeneous photocatalyst as it has diverse applications in photo catalysis electrochemistry and in the environment protection 4 7 however tio2 based photo catalyst have some shortcomings as it absorbs light only in uv region having wide band gap and fast recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs 8 9 numbers of scientists have successfully synthesized photo active materials which adequately exploit the visible region of solar light for desirable photo catalysis recently metal free g c3n4 2 7 ev poly heptazine based materials have been explored for visible light photo catalytic hydrogen generation from water and degradation of toxic pollutants it has been recorded that to enhance the catalytic activity of the material band potential of semiconductors should be adjusted this mechanism improves the dissociation of excitons collection and separation of photo generated charge careers at the interfaces of two semiconductors 10 12 in comparison with tio2 g c3n4 has a suitable band gap 2 7 ev for visible light absorption similarly the metal free and the highly condense framework results into excellent physicochemical properties 10 12 further the separation and recombination behavior of the photo generated charges can be monitored through required band edge positions this is the reason photo degradation potential of g c3n4 tio2 nano materials have been explored and reported 13 15 recent studies concluded that adsorption of dyes onto catalyst surface is also a prerequisite for efficient visible light photodegradation by taking into account their porous nature 16 17 most recently we have reported that foamed titania carbon nitride nano composite performed quite well for visible light photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes 18 on the other hand the localized surface plasmonic resonance lspr materials such as agx have been effectively used in visible light induced photocatalysis due to their excellent visible light absorption and plasmonic induced photo stability further the ag nano particles can control agx decomposition due its dipolar plasmonic characteristics and protect the nanocomposite from photo corrosion 19 27 however the synthesis complexity of multi component semiconductor system limits its production applications hence highly optimized conditions are required to control the crystalline structure and surface morphology 27 28 based on the above analysis and taking into account the salient features of ag agbr tio2 and g c3n4 in photo catalytic reactions it prompted to investigate the synergism and potential dissension of the four components in a single nano composite ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 with sharp edged morphology and characterize it with reference to its photo stability and visible light photo catalytic degradation potential for organic pollutants 2 experiment 2 1 chemicals aqueous ammonia nh3 25 wt and absolute ethanol c2h5oh a r were purchased from xilong chemical company china n octane c8h18 a r cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab a r were obtained from tianjin fuchen chemical reagents industry china tetra butyl orthotitanate tbot a r acetyl acetone c5h8o2 a r silver nitrate agno3 a r and dicyandiamide c2n3na a r from beijing chemicals reagent co ltd 2 2 fabrication of ag agbr tio2 and ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite the dicyandiamide was converted into the bulk g c3n4 by thermal treatment in a typical synthesis the calculated amount of dicyandiamide calcined at 550 c for 4h 3 cmin 1 in muffle furnace to obtain yellow solid product that was grinded very well up to light yellow powder of bulk g c3n4 18 the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite was prepared by in situ micro emulsification followed by hydrothermal and calcination treatment as shown in scheme 1 the bulk g c3n4 was converted into nano sheets during calcination in typical synthesis first the foaming reagent was prepared by mixing 1 35 g of ctab in a blend of 65 ml deionized water and 20 ml octane then added 15 ml of aqueous ammonia 2 mol l 1 with constant stirring of 30 min after that 0 2 g of the bulk g c3n4 powder was dispersed into the above micro emulsion and stirred for 45 min to completely homogenize it followed by adding 2 3 g of tetra butyl orthotitanate into the foaming reagent with energetic stirring for 45 min then 10 ml 0 3 m silver ammonia solution was added and stirred for 2 h during the reaction ag from agno3 and br from ctab react to form agbr and deposited on the surface of titania carbon nitride afterward the resulting mixture was hydrothermally treated at 100 c for 12 h 24 h and 48 h respectively then the product was centrifuged washed and dried finally calcined at 500 c for 2h 3 cmin 1 and the resulting compound was designated as ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite correspondingly ag agbr tio2 was also being prepared using similar method for comparative studies without adding g c3n4 2 3 fabrication of powder tio2 g c3n4 the powder tio2 g c3n4 was synthesized by following the methodology stated above but without foaming reagent in usual synthesis 0 25 g of the bulk g c3n4 was dispersed in to 10 ml of n octane till completely homogenize the system then added 3 g of tbot into the resulting dispersion with energetic stirring for 1 h consequently the mixture was hydrothermally treated at 100 c for 24 h the product was collected and washed several times with deionized water for the removal of any residual chemical salts and then dried under air atmosphere at 500 c for 2h 3 cmin 1 during the calcination a chemical bond is formed between the surface hydroxyl groups of tio2 and triazine amino group of g c3n4 subsequent to the formation of tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction 2 4 characterization the crystalline structure of the nanocomposite was characterized by xrd technique the measurement was carried out in the 2θ range of 5 70 on a rigaku d max 2500 vbz pc diffraction meter cu kα 0 1541 nm surface morphology and micro structure was analyzed by sem hitachi s 4700 and hrtem jem 3010 with an accelerating voltage of 20 kv and 200 kv respectively sem was coupled with eds spectral graph inca x act oxford instruments for elemental composition the optical properties were measured by using diffuse reflectance uv vis spectroscopy on uv vis nir spectrophotometer uv 3600 shimadzu the x rays photoelectron spectra were recorded for surface chemical composition and binding energy by using escalab 250 x ray photoelectron spectrometer having al kα x ray source reactive oxygen species ross were detected by epr technique on analytical instrument bruker model e 500 spectrometer chemical composition was measured by inductive coupled plasma by icp ms and elemental analyzer system gmbh vario el cube superuser for inorganic and organic materials 2 5 electrochemical measurements electrochemical measurement such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photo current density was recorded on chi760e ch instrument co usa in 1 m koh to measure the electrical conductivity and rate of charge separation recombination eis were carried out on gc electrode under low and high impedance frequency range from 100 khz to 0 1 hz with amplitude voltage is 0 005 v 2 6 measurement of photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic activity of the as synthesized catalysts was measured by the degradation of methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rhb under visible light these dyes were preferred as model organic pollutants because of noxious components of industrial effluents typically 100 mg of the samples was added into 50 ml of 20 mg l 1 aqueous solution of mb and rhb then added in pyrex reactor and ultra sonicated for 30 min to ensure adsorption desorption equilibrium in dark prior to light irradiations later on the system was irradiated by hg lamp 50 w with a cutoff filter as the visible light source λ 420 nm after definite intervals the particular amount of the suspension taken out removed the powder and measured the photo degradation of mb and rhb by colorimetric method a blank test in the absence of photocatalyst and irradiations was also conducted to ensure the superiority of the nanocomposite the change in concentration before and after degradation was calculated from the absorption peak by comparing with standard curve based on lambert beer law similarly to test the stability and durability the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 suspension was centrifuged washed with water and ethanol to regenerate the photocatalyst this regenerated photocatalyst was used for five consecutive cycles to ensure its stability 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of materials 3 1 1 crystallographic properties the xrd spectra of g c3n4 nanosheets tio2 g c3n4 ag agbr tio2 and ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite were carried out as shown in fig 1 a the xrd of individual component at particular 2θ value gives an authentic elucidation about the structure of the novel nano composite the distinct peak at 27 4 corresponds to 002 aromatic inter layer stacking of g c3n4 nanosheets jcpds no 75 1621 29 similarly the series of other diffraction peaks at 25 2 48 0 53 9 55 0 and 62 4 belong to the anatase phase of tio2 jcpds no 21 1272 30 while the peaks at 37 5 and 63 2 assign to silver nanoparticles ag jcpds no 04 0783 and at 30 4 and 43 5 assign to agbr jcpds no 06 0438 no alteration in position and widths of the diffraction peaks of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite was seen there is weak peak intensity of g c3n4 at 27 4 due to its low content or peak overlapping with tio2 at 25 2 conversely the incorporation of g c3n4 enhance the peak intensity of tio2 ag and agbr that indicated a strong interaction between the reacting species 31 furthermore no impurity was observed in the crystalline structure of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 hydrothermally treated at 24 h while the fig 1 b c depicted the xrd spectra of the sample treated for 12 h and 48 h have not seemed to be perfect crystals it is manifested that during the hydrothermal reaction the exchange of ions between the hydro peroxide of the titanate and hydroxyl groups of dicyandiamides took place the edging at high temperature and high pressure inside the autoclave massively effect the crystal structure surface morphology as well as size of the particles the sample treated for 12 h has some impurities at 25 30 and weak peaks could be seen in many places belong to low crystallinity while the sample treated for 48 h have somewhat wide peaks due to the leaching of other minerals in hot water and here phase conversion took place from anatase to rutile phase the changes in titanate structure alter the intensities and widths of the peaks unlike to pure anatase tio2 jcpds no 21 1272 because the hydrothermal treatment for long time causes the breakage of ti o ti bonds lead to the formation of six coordinated monomer ti oh 6 2 in contrast the hydrothermally treated sample for 24 h showed perfect crystalline structure 3 1 2 surface morphologies the surface morphology is very important factor for visible light absorption and charge transportation so highly optimized and concise condition are required the surface morphology of tio2 g c3n4 and ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite was evaluated by sem displayed in fig 2 here also the hydrothermal treatment put massive effect on surface morphology the sem images of g c3n4 nanosheets are shown in fig 2 a b respectively the tio2 g c3n4 comprise regularly distributed smooth nano spheres of size 70 150 nm while loading of ag agbr nanoparticles on the tio2 g c3n4 obviously altered the surface morphology of the resulting ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite it could be observed from the fig 2 c that ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nano composite consist of large nanospheres with sharp edges that uniformly covered with ag and agbr nanoparticles the big nanospheres 150 250 nm with zig zag surfaces due to the simultaneous combination of asymmetrical small cubic nano spheres 10 50 nm the ruptured surfaces were due to the incorporation of ag agbr inside the bulk of tio2 g c3n4 such type of morphology is highly obliged for effecient charge carrires transportation the treatement for 12 h and 48 h effect the dimensions of the edges to get agglomerated morphology because of the high pressure inside the reactor increase the surface tension lead to bending of the surface layers with random distribution fig s1 according to the formation mechanism the hydrothermal growing of crystal at 24 h is anisotropic and lead to the formation of regular nanospheres with sharp edges 32 33 3 1 3 microstructure and chemical composition the hrtem measurements were carried out to investigate the micro structure and interfacial connection among ag agbr and tio2 g c3n4 as shown in fig 3 it could be observed that the pure tio2 g c3n4 consist of uniform nanospheres with more or less regularly connected cubes of tio2 wrapped with g c3n4 nanosheets as shown in fig 3 a while in case of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 the surfaces of tio2 g c3n4 uniformly covered with ag agbr nanoparticles of average particle size of 2 7 nm this indicates a strong interaction between tio2 g c3n4 and ag agbr consistent with xps measurements are displayed in fig 3 b 34 similarly the hrtem results of the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 exhibited the four distinct lattice spaces with ca 0 33 nm 002 0 34 nm 101 0 28 nm 200 and 0 23 nm 111 assign to crystal plane of g c3n4 g c3n4 tio2 agbr and ag respectively these findings verified the interfacial connection between tio2 g c3n4 and ag agbr in hetero junction this hetero junction offer more photocatalytic active sites that facilitate the photocatalytic reaction and also stabilized the system 35 in addition the eds spectrum with elemental mapping revealed the existence of ti o c n br and ag elements in the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite accordance with the xrd and xps as shown in fig 4 similarly the chemical analysis yields almost same elements composition as initial precursors with minute fades as provided in table s1 3 1 4 optical properties as we have mentioned above that the main theme of this study is to improve the optical properties of tio2 g c3n4 by doping with ag and agbr the coordination and interconnection of ag agbr and tio2 g c3n4 were studied by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy the uv vis drs were taken to explore the enhance visible light absorption capability of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite fig 5 a revealed that tio2 g c3n4 exhibited somewhat stronger visible light absorption than g c3n4 nanosheets and ag agbr tio2 36 its absorption capability is weaker than ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite that have a significant improvement in light absorption with broad and strong peak in the whole visible light region this enhancement of light absorption could be ascribed to the visible light absorption of agbr and spr effect of metallic ag nps also the g c3n4 enhance the optical properties with suitable electronic band structures in this case ag agbr tio2 and g c3n4 have well fitted band edge potentials undergoes several electronic transitions such as n n n л and л л most importantly the morphology modification at optimal hydrothermal temperature makes the environment more suitable for the penetration of light into the bulk structure usually the mesoporous structure with sharp edges could increase the light harvesting capability due to multiple scattering effects while at 12 h and 48 h the boundary defects and surface agglomeration take place which effect the optical properties furthermore the band gap energy was calculated by plotting αhν 1 2 vs hν to understand the shifting of absorption adge towards visible light region by doping with ag and agbr 37 39 consequently the eg of g c3n4 tio2 g c3n4 ag agbr tio2 and ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposites is calculated as 2 7 2 5 3 1 and 2 0 ev respectively as shown in fig 5 b the uv vis outcomes of sample synthesized at 12 h and 48 h exhibited low absorption with large band gap energy than ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 respectively from the fig 5 c d it is noted that the small band gap energy of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nano composites synthesized at 24 h represents the significant absorption of light even in the whole visible light region the uv vis consequence indicated that ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 could absorb more photons and produces extra photo generated charges upon excitation under visible light irradiations this enhancement could be reflected to the synergistic coupling and unique morphology 3 1 5 xps analysis the chemical composition and bonding of elements in heterojunction was investigates by xps spectroscopy as shown in fig 6 a b the formation of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 could be justified with the help of high resolution xps spectrum of the corresponding elements the broad intensity c1 s spectrum was fitted into three deconvolatory characteristics peaks at 284 75 ev 285 05 ev and 288 45 ev corresponded to sp2 carbon atom ncn sp3 carbon c n 3 and cn with polymeric graphitic structure respectively as shown in fig 6 c 40 similarly the high resolution spectra of n1s consist of three deconvoluted peaks at binding energy of 396 55 ev assigned to cnc at 397 03 ev assign to n c 3 and at 397 41 ev assign to cn bond as shown in fig 6 d 36 the binding energy of ti 2p spectrum at 462 5 ev and 468 2 ev could be assigned to ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 as shown in fig 7 a 31 41 the o1s spectrum is fitted into small deconvolatory peaks at 533 25 ev assign to tio and at 534 15 ev ascribe to the surface ho bonds or the carboxyl co bonds as shown in fig 7 b 42 similarly ag 3d bands ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 further fitted into four distinct peaks that identified as ag ions ag 3d5 2 at 371 31 ev and ag 3d3 2 377 21 ev and ag nps ag 3d5 2 at 371 74 ev and ag 3d3 2 at 377 75 ev as shown in fig 7 c in the similar way the xps spectrum of br 3d also fitted into br 3d5 2 and br 3d3 2 with the corresponding binding energies at 71 67 ev and 72 61 ev as shown in fig 7 d 43 44 the binding energies of ag in ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 is higher than individual ag agbr indicating its strong attraction with tio2 g c3n4 45 consequently the mutual results of xrd and xps verify the existence of ag and agbr nano particles on tio2 g c3n4 that built strong correlation for enhanced photocatalytic activity 31 46 47 3 2 photocatalytic activity the pseudo first order reaction kinetics model was applied to investigate the photo degradation kinetics of mb and rhb ln c co kt where k is pseudo first order rate constant min 1 co is initial c is the equilibrium concentration of the dyes mg l 1 and t is the reaction time min fig 8 a c reaveled that the mb and rhb concentration decreased under visible light by all tio2 based nanocomposites correspondingly the mb and rhb degradation efficiency under visible light irradiations is 99 2 69 2 59 2 for ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 tio2 g c3n4 and ag agbr tio2 respectively on the bases of the value of rate constant k the degradation rate of mb enlisted in the order of significance ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 k 0 156 min 1 tio2 g c3n4 k 0 053 min 1 ag agbr tio2 k 0 016 min 1 and of rhb the degradation rate enlisted in the order of significance ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 k 0 120 min 1 tio2 g c3n4 k 0 035 min 1 ag agbr tio2 k 0 015 min 1 as shown in fig 8 b d a noticeable enhancement in catalytic activity could be seen in the four components system as compared to three components and two components system this phenominon was attributed to the role of each component in the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 towards enhance photocatalytic performance this is the localized surface plasmonic resonance lspr effect of ag nps 48 enhanced visible light absorption of agbr 49 feasible transportation of charges between ag agbr and tio2 50 and long range interfacial transfer of electrons to the g c3n4 surface due to л л graphitic carbon network 51 therefore it was concluded that ag agbr tio2 and g c3n4 played a vital role in the photocatalytic activity of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 under visible light irradiations moreover the photocatalytic activity under visible light of related catalyst has also been provided for comparison see table s2 3 3 mechanism of photocatalytic activity the proposed visible light induced photocatalytic mechanism of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 displayed in scheme 2 the possible steps took place in the photocatalytic reaction enlisted in eqs 1 10 under the visible light irradiations the electrons and holes produced from the photo excited agbr eq 1 and plasmonic excited ag nps eq 2 3 the electrons from the ag nps migrate to the conduction band cb of tio2 instead of agbr eq 3 this might be due to the less negative cb edge of tio2 0 101 v vs nhe than agbr 1 04 v vs nhe consequently the ag nps captured the electrons from cb of agbr eq 4 this phenomenon could protect the ag nps from corrosions by the negligible release of ag ions during photocatalytic reaction and result a quite stable ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 photocatalytic system 31 in the same way the photo generated holes in the valance band vb of agbr oxidized the br to bro eq 5 in the instant the electrons from the cb of tio2 migrated to the surface of g c3n4 eq 6 this is energetically encouraging as the e a of tio2 ca 4 2 ev is less than work function of g c3n4 4 4 ev 52 the 2 d planar conjugated g c3n4 with enhanced conductivity assisted long range interfacial transfer of charges along the л л graphitic carbon network 51 besides this the electrons produced from ag nps could also be transferred to g c3n4 eq 7 31 actually both the plasmonic excited ag nps and tio2 could act as electron transferring media in the vectorial electron transfers of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 result in to the proficient separation of photo generated charges therefore the electrons in the cb of tio2 and on the surface of g c3n4 trapped by o2 to form o2 eq 8 leading to the production of oh and 1o2 eq 9 3 as per thermodynamic parameters the position of oh and o2 radicals should be appropriate with respect to their reduction and oxidation potentials with reference to redox scale i e eo h2o oh 1 99 v vs nhe and eo o2 o2 0 33 v vs nhe 53 these reactive oxygen species including o2 1o2 oh and h are responsible for the photo degradation of mb and rhb eq 10 1 agbr hʋ agbr e h 2 ag hʋ ag 3 ag tio2 tio2 e ag 4 ag agbr e h ag agbr h 5 agbr h br agbr bro 6 tio2 e g c3n4 g c3n4 e tio2 7 ag g c3n4 g c3n4 e ag 8 e o2 o2 9 o2 o2 1o2 oh 10 o2 1o2 oh h dyes mineralization products 3 4 determination of reactive oxygen species ross based on the above facts the photocatalytic degradation occurs due to number of reactive oxygen species therefore to identify the function and nature of ros the scavenger trapping experiments were carried out fig 9 the isopropyl alcohol benzoquinone and na2edta are used as trapping scavengers for hydroxyl superoxide radicals and holes respectively it was observed all of these scavengers suppress the degradation rate to some extent while oh was considered the most active radicals that played most important role in photo degradation process beside this the ros were also identified by the epr spectroscopic technique the dmpo was applied in aqueous and methanolic dispersions as trapping reagent these findings demonstrated that oh and o2 were the foremost oxidants in the photo degradation of dyes similarly the epr results also exhibits the signals of single electron trapped oxygen vacancy with lorentzian line centering at g 2 005 ascribed to the paramagnetic ti3 center 54 the reason behind this is that g c3n4 would partially decompose during calcination at 600 c and release nh3 gas in to the air which could reduce a part of ti4 to ti3 the up and coming ti3 act as the center of photo induced charge carriers and increase their separation efficiency hence increase the photocatalytic performance this lorentzian line also representing the production of unpaired electrons on л conjugated g c3n4 aromatic rings within heterostructure by band offsets thus the formation of the heterostructure can help to optimize the electronic band structure for charge transportation 3 5 kinetics and the feasibility of catalytic reactions 3 5 1 electrochemical impedance spectroscopic eis measurements eis can provides information about the interfacial properties and the electron transfers rate of a photocatalytic reaction the term impedance belongs to the frequency dependent resistance to current flow based on ohmic conductivity of the semiconductor the corresponding results are shown in fig 10 a the semicircles in the nyquist diagrams correlated with charge transfer resistance rct the large rct indicates the system is kinetically slow while small rct value indicates the system is kinetically facile a very short semi circle in nyquist plot can be observed for ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite indicating very small charge resistant corresponding to effecient charge transportation during the photocatalytic reaction 55 57 the surface morphology is a key factor to enhance the conductivity more importantly the nano spheres helps to decrease the charge density on the electrode electrolyte interfaces and exhibited better charge transportation 3 5 2 photo current responses more explanation about the transportation of charges the transient photocurrent responses was carried out under the chopped light as shown in fig 10 b the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 has pulsation effect on illuminations the current density reached to its higher value when light turn on and come down when light turn off the enhancement in photocurrent is induced by changes in the metal valence state by adding g c3n4 it is consistent to xps measurements the results demonstrated that an enhancement of photocurrent density in ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 was observed than tio2 g c3n4 this is attributed to the doping of ag and agbr which shift the absorption band toward visible region hence upon illumination increases the number of photon generated charge carriers that are responsible to produce oh and o2 and holes the elevated photocurrent and high conductivity were attributed to synergistic coupling that increases the interfacial charge transportation 58 60 3 6 stability test the stability test was carried out to explore the durability and long term practical existence of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 after complete degradation of dyes under visible light irradiations fig 11 a displayed high degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst after five consecutive degradation cycles the photolysis of agbr and the leaching of ag ions from ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 during photocatalytic degradation were negligible under visible light irradiations hence it was concluded that ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 exhibited high quality durability and photo stability a series of physicochemical tests of recycled ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 after five consecutive degradation cycles was conducted for the crystalline structure surface morphology microstructure and elemental composition the corresponding results shown in fig 11 b and fig s2 s3 these results depicted that the photocatalyst maintained its crystalline structure with almost same peaks position same elemental composition leading to the fortification of excellent structural stability and photocatalytic activity 4 conclusions in summary the novel ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite has been synthesized by facile micro emulsification process followed by hydrothermal and calcination treatment the crystalline structure and surface morphology effectively controlled by precisely adjusting the hydrothermal treatment the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 treated for 24 h was found very affective for the photo catalytic degradation of mb and rhb with high rate constant than tio2 g c3n4 and ag agbr tio2 it was further concluded that the enhanced performance was associated to the extensive light absorption in visible region and efficient charge separation it was the result of lspr effect of ag nps visible light response of agbr vectorial electron transfer in the agbr ag tio2 nano junction and g c3n4 nanosheets while the well aligned band energy electronic structure of the nanocomposite ensured the efficient separation of electron hole pairs furthermore ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 possesses good photo stability and durability we are to be certain that this approach is a common course to prepared coupled heterostructure photocatalysts for environmental applications acknowledgements this work was financially

14282,heterojunction photocatalysts has gained much attention in last decade due to their high photo catalytic activity therefore we have synthesized ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 a visible light photo catalyst via single step micro emulsification followed by controlled hydrothermal and calcination treatment simultaneous crystallization of tio2 and conversion of bulk g c3n4 into nano sheets took place by hydrothermal and calcination respectively the degradation efficiency of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 for mb and rhb was quite high with rate constant k 0 120 0 156 min 1 than tio2 g c3n4 k 0 035 0 053 min 1 and ag agbr tio2 k 0 015 0 016 min 1 respectively this phenomenon was explained in terms of multiplex synergy such as localized surface plasmon resonance lspr of agnps and absorption of visible light by agbr further the interfacial electron transferring within ag agbr tio2 and g c3n4 has equal contribution apart the suitable adjustment of band edge potential ensures the enhance separation of electron hole pairs providing an excellent photocatalytic activity moreover ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 exhibited good photo stability and reusability due to plasmonic properties of agnps keywords photocatalytic system visible light charge carrier s transportation degradation 1 introduction photo active materials have a number of applications in our daily life and one of the biggest application is self degradation of material with time and to reduce the waste management issues 1 3 this is reason scientists have the interest in this field and trying their level best to tailor the properties according to the application the tio2 is considered one of the most prominent heterogeneous photocatalyst as it has diverse applications in photo catalysis electrochemistry and in the environment protection 4 7 however tio2 based photo catalyst have some shortcomings as it absorbs light only in uv region having wide band gap and fast recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs 8 9 numbers of scientists have successfully synthesized photo active materials which adequately exploit the visible region of solar light for desirable photo catalysis recently metal free g c3n4 2 7 ev poly heptazine based materials have been explored for visible light photo catalytic hydrogen generation from water and degradation of toxic pollutants it has been recorded that to enhance the catalytic activity of the material band potential of semiconductors should be adjusted this mechanism improves the dissociation of excitons collection and separation of photo generated charge careers

results into excellent physicochemical properties 10 12 further the separation and recombination behavior of the photo generated charges can be monitored through required band edge positions this is the reason photo degradation potential of g c3n4 tio2 nano materials have been explored and reported 13 15 recent studies concluded that adsorption of dyes onto catalyst surface is also a prerequisite for efficient visible light photodegradation by taking into account their porous nature 16 17 most recently we have reported that foamed titania carbon nitride nano composite performed quite well for visible light photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes 18 on the other hand the localized surface plasmonic resonance lspr materials such as agx have been effectively used in visible light induced photocatalysis due to their excellent visible light absorption and plasmonic induced photo stability further the ag nano particles can control agx decomposition due its dipolar plasmonic characteristics and protect the nanocomposite from photo corrosion 19 27 however the synthesis complexity of multi component semiconductor system limits its production applications hence highly optimized conditions are required to control the crystalline structure and surface morphology 27 28 based on the above analysis and taking into account the salient features of ag agbr tio2 and g c3n4 in photo catalytic reactions it prompted to investigate the synergism and potential dissension of the four components in a single nano composite ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 with sharp edged morphology and characterize it with reference to its photo stability and visible light photo catalytic degradation potential for organic pollutants 2 experiment 2 1 chemicals aqueous ammonia nh3 25 wt and absolute

c3n4 nanocomposite the dicyandiamide was converted into the bulk g c3n4 by thermal treatment in a typical synthesis the calculated amount of dicyandiamide calcined at 550 c for 4h 3 cmin 1 in muffle furnace to obtain yellow solid product that was grinded very well up to light yellow powder of bulk g c3n4 18 the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite was prepared by in situ micro emulsification followed by hydrothermal and calcination treatment as shown in scheme 1 the bulk g c3n4 was converted into nano sheets during calcination in typical synthesis first the foaming reagent was prepared by mixing 1 35 g of ctab in a blend of 65 ml deionized water and 20 ml octane then added 15 ml of aqueous ammonia 2 mol l 1 with constant stirring of 30 min after that 0 2 g of the bulk g c3n4 powder was dispersed into the above micro emulsion and stirred for 45 min to completely homogenize it followed by adding 2 3 g of tetra butyl orthotitanate into the foaming reagent with energetic stirring for 45 min then 10 ml 0 3 m silver ammonia solution was added and stirred for 2 h during the reaction ag from agno3 and br from ctab react to form agbr and deposited on the surface of titania carbon nitride afterward the resulting mixture was hydrothermally treated at 100 c for 12 h 24 h and 48 h respectively then the product was centrifuged washed and dried finally calcined at 500 c for 2h 3 cmin 1 and the resulting compound was designated as ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite correspondingly ag agbr tio2 was also being prepared using similar method for comparative studies without adding g c3n4 2 3 fabrication of powder tio2 g c3n4 the powder tio2 g c3n4 was synthesized by following the methodology stated above but without foaming reagent in usual synthesis 0 25 g of the bulk g c3n4 was dispersed in to 10 ml of n octane till completely homogenize the system then added 3 g of tbot into the resulting dispersion with energetic stirring for 1 h consequently the mixture was hydrothermally treated at 100 c for 24 h the product was collected and washed several times with deionized water for the removal of any residual chemical salts and then dried under air atmosphere at 500 c for 2h 3 cmin 1 during the calcination a chemical bond is formed between the surface hydroxyl groups of tio2 and triazine amino group of g c3n4 subsequent to the formation of tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction 2 4 characterization the crystalline structure of the nanocomposite was characterized by xrd technique the measurement was carried out in the 2θ range of 5 70 on a rigaku d max 2500 vbz pc diffraction

eds spectral graph inca x act oxford instruments for elemental composition the optical properties were measured by using diffuse reflectance uv vis spectroscopy on uv vis nir spectrophotometer uv 3600 shimadzu the x rays photoelectron spectra were recorded for surface chemical composition and binding energy by using escalab 250 x ray photoelectron spectrometer having al kα x ray source reactive oxygen species ross were detected by epr technique on analytical instrument bruker model e 500 spectrometer chemical composition was measured by inductive coupled plasma by icp ms and elemental analyzer system gmbh vario el cube superuser for inorganic and organic materials 2 5 electrochemical measurements electrochemical measurement such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photo current density was recorded on chi760e ch instrument co usa in 1 m koh to measure the electrical conductivity and rate of charge separation recombination eis were carried out on gc electrode under low and high impedance frequency range from 100 khz to 0 1 hz with amplitude voltage is 0 005 v 2 6 measurement of photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic activity of the as synthesized catalysts was measured by the degradation of methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rhb under visible light these dyes were preferred as model organic pollutants because of noxious components of industrial effluents typically 100 mg of the samples was added into 50 ml of 20 mg l 1 aqueous solution of mb and rhb then added in pyrex reactor and ultra sonicated for 30 min to ensure adsorption desorption equilibrium in dark prior to light irradiations later on the system was irradiated by hg lamp 50 w with a cutoff filter as the visible light source λ 420 nm after definite intervals the particular amount of the suspension taken out removed the powder and measured the photo degradation of mb and rhb by colorimetric method a blank test in the absence of photocatalyst and irradiations was also conducted to ensure the superiority of the nanocomposite the change in concentration before and after degradation was calculated from the absorption peak by comparing with standard curve based on lambert beer law similarly to test the stability and durability the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 suspension was centrifuged washed with water and ethanol to regenerate the photocatalyst this regenerated photocatalyst was used for five consecutive cycles to ensure its stability 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of materials 3 1 1 crystallographic properties the xrd spectra of g c3n4 nanosheets tio2 g c3n4 ag agbr tio2 and ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite were carried out as shown in fig 1 a the xrd of individual component at particular 2θ value gives an authentic elucidation about the structure of the novel nano composite the distinct peak at 27 4 corresponds to 002 aromatic inter layer stacking of g c3n4 nanosheets jcpds no 75 1621 29 similarly the series of other diffraction peaks at 25 2 48 0 53 9 55 0 and 62 4 belong to the anatase phase of tio2 jcpds no 21 1272 30 while the peaks at 37 5 and 63 2 assign to silver nanoparticles ag jcpds no 04 0783 and at 30 4 and 43 5 assign to agbr jcpds no 06 0438 no alteration in position and widths of the diffraction peaks of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite was seen there is weak peak intensity of g c3n4 at 27 4 due to its low content or peak overlapping with tio2 at 25 2 conversely the incorporation of g c3n4 enhance the peak intensity of tio2 ag and agbr that indicated a strong interaction between the reacting species 31 furthermore no impurity was observed in the crystalline structure of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 hydrothermally treated at 24 h while the fig 1 b c depicted the xrd spectra of the sample treated for 12 h and 48 h have not seemed to be perfect crystals it is manifested that during the hydrothermal reaction the exchange of ions between the hydro peroxide of the titanate and hydroxyl groups of dicyandiamides took place the edging at high temperature and high pressure inside the autoclave massively effect the crystal structure surface morphology as well as size of the particles the sample treated for 12 h has some impurities at 25 30 and weak peaks could be seen in many places belong to low crystallinity while the sample treated for 48 h have somewhat wide peaks due to the leaching of other minerals in hot water and here phase conversion took place from anatase to rutile phase the changes in titanate structure alter the intensities and widths of the peaks unlike to pure anatase tio2 jcpds no 21 1272 because the hydrothermal treatment for long time causes the breakage of ti o ti bonds lead to the formation of six coordinated monomer ti oh 6 2 in contrast the hydrothermally treated sample for 24 h showed perfect crystalline structure 3 1 2 surface morphologies the surface morphology is very important factor for visible light absorption and charge transportation so highly optimized and concise condition are required the surface morphology of tio2 g c3n4 and ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite was evaluated by sem displayed in fig 2 here also the hydrothermal treatment put massive effect on surface morphology the sem images of g c3n4 nanosheets are shown in fig 2 a b respectively the tio2 g c3n4 comprise regularly distributed smooth nano spheres of size 70 150 nm while loading of ag agbr nanoparticles on the tio2 g c3n4 obviously altered the surface morphology of the resulting ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite it could be observed from the fig 2 c that ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nano composite consist of large nanospheres with sharp edges that uniformly covered with ag and agbr nanoparticles the big nanospheres 150 250 nm with zig zag surfaces due to the simultaneous combination of asymmetrical small cubic nano spheres 10 50 nm the ruptured surfaces were due to the incorporation of ag agbr inside the bulk of tio2 g c3n4 such type of morphology is highly obliged for effecient charge carrires transportation the treatement for 12 h and 48 h effect the dimensions of the edges to get agglomerated morphology because of the high pressure inside the reactor increase the surface tension lead to bending of the surface layers with random distribution fig s1 according to the formation mechanism the hydrothermal growing of crystal at 24 h is anisotropic and lead to the formation of regular nanospheres with sharp edges 32 33 3 1 3 microstructure and chemical composition the hrtem measurements were carried out to investigate the micro structure and interfacial connection among ag agbr and tio2 g c3n4 as shown in fig 3 it could be observed that the pure tio2 g c3n4 consist of uniform nanospheres with more or less regularly connected cubes of tio2 wrapped with g c3n4 nanosheets as shown in fig 3 a while in case of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 the surfaces of tio2 g c3n4 uniformly covered with ag agbr nanoparticles of average particle size of 2 7 nm this indicates a strong interaction between tio2 g c3n4 and ag agbr consistent with xps measurements are displayed in fig 3 b 34 similarly the hrtem results of the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 exhibited the four distinct lattice spaces with ca 0 33 nm 002 0 34 nm 101 0 28 nm 200 and 0 23 nm 111 assign to crystal plane of g c3n4 g c3n4 tio2 agbr and ag respectively these findings verified the interfacial connection between tio2 g c3n4 and ag agbr in hetero junction this hetero junction offer more photocatalytic active sites that facilitate the photocatalytic reaction and also stabilized the system 35 in addition the eds spectrum with elemental mapping revealed the existence of ti o c n br and ag elements in the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite accordance with the xrd and xps as shown in fig 4 similarly the chemical analysis yields almost same elements composition as initial precursors with minute fades as provided in table s1 3 1 4 optical properties as we have mentioned above that the main theme of this study is to improve the optical properties of tio2 g c3n4 by doping with ag and agbr the coordination and interconnection of ag agbr and tio2 g c3n4 were studied by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy the uv vis drs were taken to explore the enhance visible light absorption capability of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite fig 5 a revealed that tio2 g c3n4 exhibited somewhat stronger visible light absorption than g c3n4 nanosheets and ag agbr tio2 36 its absorption capability is weaker than ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite that have a significant improvement in light absorption with broad and strong peak in the whole visible light region this enhancement of light absorption could be ascribed to the visible light absorption of agbr and spr effect of metallic ag nps also the g c3n4 enhance the optical properties with suitable electronic band structures in this case ag agbr tio2 and g c3n4 have well fitted band edge potentials undergoes several electronic transitions such as n n n л and л л most importantly the morphology modification at optimal hydrothermal temperature makes the environment more suitable for the penetration of light into the bulk structure usually the mesoporous structure with sharp edges could increase the light harvesting capability due to multiple scattering effects while at 12 h and 48 h the boundary defects and surface agglomeration take place which effect the optical properties furthermore the band gap energy was calculated by plotting αhν 1 2 vs hν to understand the shifting of absorption adge towards visible light region by doping with ag and agbr 37 39 consequently the eg of g c3n4 tio2 g c3n4 ag agbr tio2 and ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposites is calculated as 2 7 2 5 3 1 and 2 0 ev respectively as shown in fig 5 b the uv vis outcomes of sample synthesized at 12 h and 48 h exhibited low absorption with large band gap energy than ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 respectively from the fig 5 c d it is noted that the small band gap energy of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nano composites synthesized at 24 h represents the significant absorption of light even in the whole visible light region the uv vis consequence indicated that ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 could absorb more photons and produces extra photo generated charges upon excitation under visible light irradiations this enhancement could be reflected to the synergistic coupling and unique morphology 3 1 5 xps analysis the chemical composition and bonding of elements in heterojunction was investigates by xps spectroscopy as shown in fig 6 a b the formation of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 could be justified with the help of high resolution xps spectrum of the corresponding elements the broad intensity c1 s spectrum was fitted into three deconvolatory characteristics peaks at 284 75 ev 285 05 ev and 288 45 ev corresponded to sp2 carbon atom ncn sp3 carbon c n 3 and cn with polymeric graphitic structure respectively as shown in fig 6 c 40 similarly the high resolution spectra of n1s consist of three deconvoluted peaks at binding energy of 396 55 ev assigned to cnc at 397 03 ev assign to n c 3 and at 397 41 ev assign to cn bond as shown in fig 6 d 36 the binding energy of ti 2p spectrum at 462 5 ev and 468 2 ev could be assigned to ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 as shown in fig 7 a 31 41 the o1s spectrum is fitted into small deconvolatory peaks at 533 25 ev assign to tio and at 534 15 ev ascribe to the surface ho bonds or the carboxyl co bonds as shown in fig 7 b 42 similarly ag 3d bands ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 further fitted into four distinct peaks that identified as ag ions ag 3d5 2 at 371 31 ev and ag 3d3 2 377 21 ev and ag nps ag 3d5 2 at 371 74 ev and ag 3d3 2 at 377 75 ev as shown in fig 7 c in the similar way the xps spectrum of br 3d also fitted into br 3d5 2 and br 3d3 2 with the corresponding binding energies at 71 67 ev and 72 61 ev as shown in fig 7 d 43 44 the binding energies of ag in ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 is higher than individual ag agbr indicating its strong attraction with tio2 g c3n4 45 consequently the mutual results of xrd and xps verify the existence of ag and agbr nano particles on tio2 g c3n4 that built strong correlation for enhanced photocatalytic activity 31 46 47 3 2 photocatalytic activity the pseudo first order reaction kinetics model was applied to investigate the photo degradation kinetics of mb and rhb ln c co kt where k is pseudo first order rate constant min 1 co is initial c is the equilibrium concentration of the dyes mg l 1 and t is the reaction time min fig 8 a c reaveled that the mb and rhb concentration decreased under visible light by all tio2 based nanocomposites correspondingly the mb and rhb degradation efficiency under visible light irradiations is 99 2 69 2 59 2 for ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 tio2 g c3n4 and ag agbr tio2 respectively on the bases of the value of rate constant k the degradation rate of mb enlisted in the order of significance ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 k 0 156 min 1 tio2 g c3n4 k 0 053 min 1 ag agbr tio2 k 0 016 min 1 and of rhb the degradation rate enlisted in the order of significance ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 k 0 120 min 1 tio2 g c3n4 k 0 035 min 1 ag agbr tio2 k 0 015 min 1 as shown in fig 8 b d a noticeable enhancement in catalytic activity could be seen in the four components system as compared to three components and two components system this phenominon was attributed to the role of each component in the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 towards enhance photocatalytic performance this is the localized surface plasmonic resonance lspr effect of ag nps 48 enhanced visible light absorption of agbr 49 feasible transportation of charges between ag agbr and tio2 50 and long range interfacial transfer of electrons to the g c3n4 surface due to л л graphitic carbon network 51 therefore it was concluded that ag agbr tio2 and g c3n4 played a vital role in the photocatalytic activity of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 under visible light irradiations moreover the photocatalytic activity under visible light of related catalyst has also been provided for comparison see table s2 3 3 mechanism of photocatalytic activity the proposed visible light induced photocatalytic mechanism of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 displayed in scheme 2 the possible steps took place in the photocatalytic reaction enlisted in eqs 1 10 under the visible light irradiations the electrons and holes produced from the photo excited agbr eq 1 and plasmonic excited ag nps eq 2 3 the electrons from the ag nps migrate to the conduction band cb of tio2 instead of agbr eq 3 this might be due to the less negative cb edge of tio2 0 101 v vs nhe than agbr 1 04 v vs nhe consequently the ag nps captured the electrons from cb of agbr eq 4 this phenomenon could protect the ag nps from corrosions by the negligible release of ag ions during photocatalytic reaction and result a quite stable ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 photocatalytic system 31 in the same way the photo generated holes in the valance band vb of agbr oxidized the br to bro eq 5 in the instant the electrons from the cb of tio2 migrated to the surface of g c3n4 eq 6 this is energetically encouraging as the e a of tio2 ca 4 2 ev is less than work function of g c3n4 4 4 ev 52 the 2 d planar conjugated g c3n4 with enhanced conductivity assisted long range interfacial transfer of charges along the л л graphitic carbon network 51 besides this the electrons produced from ag nps could also be transferred to g c3n4 eq 7 31 actually both the plasmonic excited ag nps and tio2 could act as electron transferring media in the vectorial electron transfers of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 result in to the proficient separation of photo generated charges therefore the electrons in the cb of tio2 and on the surface of g c3n4 trapped by o2 to form o2 eq 8 leading to the production of oh and 1o2 eq 9 3 as per thermodynamic parameters the position of oh and o2 radicals should be appropriate with respect to their reduction and oxidation potentials with reference to redox scale i e eo h2o oh 1 99 v vs nhe and eo o2 o2 0 33 v vs nhe 53 these reactive oxygen species including o2 1o2 oh and h are responsible for the photo degradation of mb and rhb eq 10 1 agbr hʋ agbr e h 2 ag hʋ ag 3 ag tio2 tio2 e ag 4 ag agbr e h ag agbr h 5 agbr h br agbr bro 6 tio2 e g c3n4 g c3n4 e tio2 7 ag g c3n4 g c3n4 e ag 8 e o2 o2 9 o2 o2 1o2 oh 10 o2 1o2 oh h dyes mineralization products 3 4 determination of reactive oxygen species ross based on the above facts the photocatalytic degradation occurs due to number of reactive oxygen species therefore to identify the function and nature of ros the scavenger trapping experiments were carried out fig 9 the isopropyl alcohol benzoquinone and na2edta are used as trapping scavengers for hydroxyl superoxide radicals and holes respectively it was observed all of these scavengers suppress the degradation rate to some extent while oh was considered the most active radicals that played most important role in photo degradation process beside this the ros were also identified by the epr spectroscopic technique the dmpo was applied in aqueous and methanolic dispersions as trapping reagent these findings demonstrated that oh and o2 were the foremost oxidants in the photo degradation of dyes similarly the epr results also exhibits the signals of single electron trapped oxygen vacancy with lorentzian line centering at g 2 005 ascribed to the paramagnetic ti3 center 54 the reason behind this is that g c3n4 would partially decompose during calcination at 600 c and release nh3 gas in to the air which could reduce a part of ti4 to ti3 the up and coming ti3 act as the center of photo induced charge carriers and increase their separation efficiency hence increase the photocatalytic performance this lorentzian line also representing the production of unpaired electrons on л conjugated g c3n4 aromatic rings within heterostructure by band offsets thus the formation of the heterostructure can help to optimize the electronic band structure for charge transportation 3 5 kinetics and the feasibility of catalytic reactions 3 5 1 electrochemical impedance spectroscopic eis measurements eis can provides information about the interfacial properties and the electron transfers rate of a photocatalytic reaction the term impedance belongs to the frequency dependent resistance to current flow based on ohmic conductivity of the semiconductor the corresponding results are shown in fig 10 a the semicircles in the nyquist diagrams correlated with charge transfer resistance rct the large rct indicates the system is kinetically slow while small rct value indicates the system is kinetically facile a very short semi circle in nyquist plot can be observed for ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite indicating very small charge resistant corresponding to effecient charge transportation during the photocatalytic reaction 55 57 the surface morphology is a key factor to enhance the conductivity more importantly the nano spheres helps to decrease the charge density on the electrode electrolyte interfaces and exhibited better charge transportation 3 5 2 photo current responses more explanation about the transportation of charges the transient photocurrent responses was carried out under the chopped light as shown in fig 10 b the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 has pulsation effect on illuminations the current density reached to its higher value when light turn on and come down when light turn off the enhancement in photocurrent is induced by changes in the metal valence state by adding g c3n4 it is consistent to xps measurements the results demonstrated that an enhancement of photocurrent density in ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 was observed than tio2 g c3n4 this is attributed to the doping of ag and agbr which shift the absorption band toward visible region hence upon illumination increases the number of photon generated charge carriers that are responsible to produce oh and o2 and holes the elevated photocurrent and high conductivity were attributed to synergistic coupling that increases the interfacial charge transportation 58 60 3 6 stability test the stability test was carried out to explore the durability and long term practical existence of ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 after complete degradation of dyes under visible light irradiations fig 11 a displayed high degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst after five consecutive degradation cycles the photolysis of agbr and the leaching of ag ions from ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 during photocatalytic degradation were negligible under visible light irradiations hence it was concluded that ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 exhibited high quality durability and photo stability a series of physicochemical tests of recycled ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 after five consecutive degradation cycles was conducted for the crystalline structure surface morphology microstructure and elemental composition the corresponding results shown in fig 11 b and fig s2 s3 these results depicted that the photocatalyst maintained its crystalline structure with almost same peaks position same elemental composition leading to the fortification of excellent structural stability and photocatalytic activity 4 conclusions in summary the novel ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite has been synthesized by facile micro emulsification process followed by hydrothermal and calcination treatment the crystalline structure and surface morphology effectively controlled by precisely adjusting the hydrothermal treatment the ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 treated for 24 h was found very affective for the photo catalytic degradation of mb and rhb with high rate constant than tio2 g c3n4 and ag agbr tio2 it was further concluded that the enhanced performance was associated to the extensive light absorption in visible region and efficient charge separation it was the result of lspr effect of ag nps visible light response of agbr vectorial electron transfer in the agbr ag tio2 nano junction and g c3n4 nanosheets while the well aligned band energy electronic structure of the nanocomposite ensured the efficient separation of electron hole pairs furthermore ag agbr tio2 g c3n4 possesses good photo stability and durability we are to be certain that this approach is a common course to prepared coupled heterostructure photocatalysts for environmental applications acknowledgements this work was financially

14283,oily wastewater treatment has been proved to be one of the most crucial environmental concerns in the present study in the first step hydrophobicity properties of fe3o4 nanoparticles were modified by oleic acid oa to form fe3o4 oa afterwards graphene oxide go nanosheets were functionalized with fe3o4 oa nanocomposite to synthesize novel superhydrophobic nanosheets of fe3o4 oa go synthesized fe3o4 oa go nanocomposite was employed as a fast recyclable high performance cost effective and environmentally friendly nanodemulsifier to eliminate oil from oily wastewater demulsification performance of synthesized go based nanodemulsifiers was measured using bottle test as a function of dosage of nanodemulsifier temperature ph and settle time mechanism of demulsification was investigated through optical microscopy finally adsorption isotherms of asphaltene molecules and synthesized nanodemulsifiers were studied so as to achieve detailed and precise understanding regarding interaction between nanodemulsifiers and molecules of asphaltene demulsification tests revealed that fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier with excellent demulsification performance 99 99 had the ability to separate oil water emulsion quickly with demulsification capability for 6 recycle times keywords nanodemulsifiers oily wastewater demulsification superhydrophobic property fe3o4 oa go 1 introduction the formation of stable emulsions during the production of crude oil is an expensive process faced by the oil industry recovery 1 3 in the early 2000s researchers focused on destabilized water in oil emulsions for primary exploitation in oilfields in which the water content was low 4 6 with the aging of the oil field today the decrement of the output pressure of the reservoirs leading to spill of crude oil and reduction in crude oil yields has become a matter of concern 4 7 8 nowadays the alkaline surfactant polymer asp flooding technology has extensively been utilized to extract crude oil to enhance oil production 9 10 this well known technology inevitably produces oil in water o w emulsion due to the presence of natural surface active compounds asphaltenes resins etc in the crude oil as well as added chemical surfactants and alkaline salts 11 14 in addition a large amount of oil sewage is produced from the exploitation of oil in tankers oil ships tankers crash and the outburst of oil wells in the middle of the seas 15 16 this oil sewage directly threatens the environment and should be eliminated before discharge oil pollution caused by the discharge of oily wastewater in recent years has also become one of the most serious environmental issues 17 18 oil induced pollution could have harmful and irreversible effects on marine environments including death of aquatic organisms inappropriate marine nutrition for human and harbors and coasts contamination 19 hence the destabilization of the o w emulsion is an important issue in the petroleum and petrochemical industries several different methods such as air flotation 20 21 electro coalescence 22 23 reverse osmosis 24 filtration membrane separation 25 27 biotechnology 28 30 coagulation sedimentation 31 etc have been proposed to eliminate persistent emulsions although these methods have some merits such as easy operation good demulsification efficiency and feasible installation and so on 26 28 they are considered as costly energy demanding and time consuming methods which require sophisticated equipment and massive place to operate therefore employing an alternative method to address the problems of conventional methods seems vital as a matter of fact by changing the physicochemical properties of the film around a stable emulsion in crude oil the complete separation of oil from wastewater is feasible in general demulsifiers need to be able to penetrate the interface of water and oil and interact with natural surfactants asphaltenes to cause instability of emulsions 32 33 asphaltenes have an essential function in forming an elastic film in the oil water interface 34 37 huanjiang and his research group used carbon black nanoparticles as demulsifiers to separate oil from oily wastewater and investigated the interaction behavior of carbon black and asphaltenes by quantum chemical calculations 38 39 also yun pen and co workers introduced janus membranes with charged carbon nanotubes cnt as a kind of efficient demulsifiers capable of destabilize the o w emulsions due to an unique surface nature and they concluded that such mentioned membranes can demonstrate the recovery performance of 89 per 40 min of oil from 1 2 dichloroethane water emulsions 38 in recent years graphene oxide go has attracted a great deal of attention among the scientists in many potential applications due to its unique properties 4 40 43 the presence of functional groups including hydroxyl carboxylic and epoxy on the edges and planes of go makes it a supreme amphiphilic surfactant featuring both hydrophilic and hydrophobic edges 44 49 thus go is the suitable choice for the demulsification of o w emulsions 50 52 sili and colleagues reported that go is an environmentally friendly and high efficiency nanodemulsifier which has the capability to separate oil from water in oil emulsion within a few minutes 4 furthermore shenwen and co workers systematically discussed the interfacial rheology properties as well as the interfacial tension of the go nanosheets at the crude oil water interface to investigate demulsification mechanism of go for separation of oil from o w emulsions 43 the results showed that go was able to diffuse the interface of oil and water phase and comfortably decreased interfacial tension of the emulsion huanjiang wang and his research group in another investigation synthesized reduced graphene oxides rgo by a controlled hydrothermal dehydration route furtherly they pointed out the excellent demulsification performance in the presence of rgo samples the results of the controlled amphiphilicity of rgo samples and its effect on the demulsification performance demonstrated that with increasing the reduction degree of go demulsification efficiency has been enhanced 53 recently magnetic nanoparticles have drawn the attention of many researchers due to facile management of the separation and recycling the adsorbents from wastewater through an external magnetic field 54 juan and his research team used magnetic graphene oxide mgo to destabilize the crude o w emulsion and also presented a thorough understanding on the intrinsic interaction between demulsifiers and asphaltenes 55 actually prepared magnetic demulsifier is considered as environmentally friendly recyclable and efficient strategy for treating oily wastewater likewise jiling et al studied magnetic nanoparticles coated on oleic acid oa for destabilization of the cyclohexane in water emulsion 56 in another study haiyan and co workers used expanded perlite ep to fabricate ep aptes fe3o4 in order to separate oil from oily wastewater 57 in this paper our main purpose was to investigate the ability of breaking o w emulsion by go nanosheets as nanodemulsifiers using the bottle test go nanosheets due to high surface area simple synthesis cost effective low density of energy similar structure to asphaltenes and environmentally friendly is preferred over other materials such as cnts polymers carbon black etc in order to enhance the hydrophobicity properties of go nanosheets magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 and magnetic nanoparticles coated with oleic acid fe3o4 oa were coated on go nanosheets further functionalized go with magnetic nanoparticles made it possible to recycle the magnetic nanodemulsifiers using an external magnetic field so that magnetic nanosheets would be consumed repeatedly making it more economically affordable it was observed that go functionalized with magnetic nanoparticles could be utilized as an all at once and suitable demulsifier to separate oil from oily wastewater with great efficiency demulsification performance was evaluated with effects of settling time demulsifiers dosage and temperature also the effect of ph on demulsification process of emulsified oil wastewater was considered in detail the results of bottle test demonstrated the best performance of demulsification shortened settle time and optimum dosage of go nanosheets related to novel fe3o4 oa go nanocomposite synthesized for first time in this work 2 materials and methods

station of taleghan 2 2 preparation of go nanosheets the route to synthesis of go was based on the conventional modified hummer method 58 in brief 5 g of graphite and 2 5 g sodium nitrate were added to a concentrated sulfuric acid 150 ml 98 following addition of 25 g potassium permanganate under stirring in an ice bath to keep the temperature below 50 c for 5 h while removing the ice bath the mixture slowly was diluted with deionized water causing an increase in temperature up to 80 c the diluted mixture was kept at this temperature for 30 min subsequently the suspension was treated with 37 hydrogen peroxide to reduce the residual permanganate and manganese dioxide and provide colorless soluble manganese sulfate then the mixture was centrifuged and rinsed with 2 5 liters of 10 hydrochloric acid solution followed by 2 5 liters of distilled water the brown solid was transferred to a petri dish and allowed to dry in the room temperature for one night finally the obtained powder was used for our experimental work 2 3 preparation of fe3o4 go nanosheets briefly 10 mg feso4 7h2o and 20 mg fecl3 6h2o were mixed with a magnetic stirrer in a three necked flask containing 200 ml deionized water until they were completely dissolved 59 then the mixed liquid was added into a 50 ml of 1000 ppm of graphene oxide solution ultrapure inert ar gas was utilized to remove oxygen and create an oxygen free environment during the synthesis process afterward the solution was refluxed after refluxing the solution was heated to 80 c with a digital heating stirrer and paraffin bath also ammonium hydroxide 25 v v was dropwise added to the solution until the ph reached 11 and the black precipitate was formed after heating the solution to 80 c within 10 min the mixture was stirred for 3 h and then was allowed to cool to the room temperature the black precipitate was collected by magnetic decantation and repeatedly washed with distilled water and ethanol 2 4 preparation of fe3o4 oa go nanosheets fe3o4 oa nanoparticles were prepared by modified chemical co precipitation 60 in short as mentioned above 10 mg feso4 7h2o and 20 mg fecl3 6h2o were dissolved in 200 ml deionized water under ar flow thereafter the solution was heated to 80 c and stirred and subsequently 20 ml ammonium hydroxide was added rapidly until the ph value reached about 11 then 0 5 ml oleic acid was added and the mixture was preserved at 80 c for 50 min the mixture was allowed to chill at room temperature then the product was gathered with an external magnetic field and extracted upon addition of ethanol and deionized water to remove excess oa finally the fe3o4 oa nanoparticles were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 12 h the fe3o4 oa go nanosheets were prepared by using the liquid self assembly method 61 in a typical synthesis firstly 50 mg of go was dispersed in 50 ml distilled water via sonication for 2 h at room temperature secondly 40 mg of the dissolved fe3o4 oa in 25 ml distilled water was added dropwise into the dispersed go the obtained mixture was sonicated for 3 h at room temperature the resultant nanocomposite was rolled up with the external magnetic field and thoroughly washed with ethanol and distilled water finally the mixture was dried during one day at 60 c the bonds of synthesized nanodemulsifier showed in scheme 1 the bonding between magnetite nanoparticles and oleic acid is chemical bonding and kind of chemical bond is covalent when fe3o4 nanoparticles were coated by oleic acid the two oxygen atoms of coo in oleic acid provided two coordination positions to form the chemical interaction with fe atom 4 in fact oleic acid could bonded from oh or c o with fe3o4 in addition bonding within fe3o4 oa and go is physical bonding and fe3o4 oa able to interact with cooh or oh groups on surface of go nanosheets 2 5 characterization of crude oil the physicochemical properties of crude oil were measured and tabulated in table 2 the

crude oil in the presence of an indicator phenolphthalein all analysis were performed 3 times for determining an average and the standard deviation was 0 03 mg koh viscosity of crude oil was measured with cambridge electromagnetic viscometer spsl 440 model at 25 c 2 6 crude oil in water elsion oily wastewater preparation the temperature of heavy crude oil was maintained at 60 c for 1 h to increase power flowing of crude oil and then 3 ml of heavy oil and 97 ml distilled water were mixed together and sonicated for 2 h to obtain an oily wastewater 3 v v 2 7 demulsification test the bottle test has proven to be a frequent method for evaluation of the demulsification performance for demulsification 1 ml of each three nanodemulsifiers go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go were added to the oily wastewater 5 ml contained in a graded test tube the distilled water was used as demulsifier in the blank test then the graded test tube was shaken 200 times in order to ensure that go based nanodemulsifiers and emulsion were mixed properly thereupon the mixture was placed under the ambient condition to fulfill the separation of oily wastewater bottle test was repeated 3 times for each type of nanodemulsifier and an average of data was reported the oil in the separated water sample was extracted and diluted with kerosene the residual oil content in the separated water was measured using a spectrophotometer uv vis pg t80plus by monitoring the absorbance at 325 nm the initial oil concentration was calculated through the following equation 1 c0 m0 vw 103 where the c0 mg l is the oil concentration m0 mg is the corresponding mass of oil in the standard curve and vw ml is attributed to the water volume 4 also the demulsification efficiency was computed from the difference of the initial and final oil content in the mixture using the following equation 2 e c0 ci c0 100 in which e is the demulsification efficiency c0 is the initial oil content mg l of emulsion and ci is the residuary oil content in the separated water 56 2 8 characterization to characterize the structure and approve the formation of functional groups the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir thermo nicolet 100 absorption technique was applied the thermogravimetric analysis tga of the samples were measured by using perkin elmer pyris1 from room temperature to 700 c with heating rate 10 c min 1 under a n2 atmosphere x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd philips xpert mpd was also employed for crystalline size and chemical phases of the as prepared nanosheets i e go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go in addition the surface morphology was observed through a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem hitachi s 4160 model and high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem zeiss electron microscopy cm30 300 k the contact angle ca was measured by a contact angle measuring device surface wettability measurements of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers were performed on a drop analyzer to investigate hydrophobic hydrophilic properties of nanodemulsifiers the dehydrated crude oil was diluted by kerosene to 0 25 wt and was used as the oil phase at 25 c 250 ppm of each nanodemulsifiers in distilled water was employed as water phase the water phase was filled in a glass cell and it was attached to the instrument then using a syringe a drop of oil phase was injected into the glassy cell after immersing the drop of oil in go based solution using digimizer software the contact angle was calculated the magnetic property of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers were measured on a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm kavir magnetic company at room temperature elemental mapping analysis was investigated by energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx of go based nanodemulsifiers bruker x flash6l 10 zeta potential measurements of the go based nanosheets go fe3o4 go fe3o4 oa go and crude oil were accomplished through a zeta potential analyzer malvern zetasizer in this regard the go fe3o4 go fe3o4 oa go and crude oil were well dispersed using an ultrasonic in up to 90 min and the as prepared suspensions and diluted hcl was added gently to adjust it desired ph the measurement was repeated 3 times at room temperature 25 1 c and ultimately the mean value and standard deviation were reported micrographs of oily wastewater prior and after adding nanodemulsifiers were captured by an optical microscope leitz germany 2 9 relative solubility number rsn measurement rsn evaluates affinity of hydrophilic and lipophilic parts of demulsifiers to water or oil phase respectively which can be considered a practical alternative method to hlb parameter in brief 1 g of each go based nanodemulsifiers was added to 30 ml of 2 6 v v solution of toluene ethylene glycol dimethyl ether and then was titrated with deionized water until the resulted solution became turbid under stirring at 25 c persistently the volume of titrated water was considered as rsn index the low number of rsn index 13 indicates hydrophobic properties of nanodemulsifiers whereas the high number of rsn index 17 could be a sign of hydrophilic properties of nanodemulsifiers 63 64 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of the go based nanosheets 3 1 1 ft ir spectra of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers fig 1 a demonstrates the ft ir spectra of the go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go samples several characteristic bands have appeared in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 in three ft ir spectra for go nanosheets a characteristic broad band centered at 3425 cm 1 could be assigned to the hydroxyl group oh stretching vibrational bands and the ones at 2923 cm 1 and 2854 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of c h ch2 4 also the carbonyl c o peak is assigned to the carboxyl group cooh appeared at 1723 cm 1 59 the stretching vibration bands at 1165 cm 1 and 1072 cm 1 are attributed to the alkoxy group o c o for go nanosheets 65 the band at 1618 cm 1 is related to cc stretching vibration of go aromatic plane as could be observed from the ft ir pattern of fe3o4 go the peak at 580 cm 1 is ascribed to the fe o bending vibration in the crystalline lattice of fe3o4 indicating the existence of fe3o4 in the fe3o4 go nanocomposite fig 1 a ii 59 moreover characteristic bands of go nanosheets is obvious in fe3o4 go spectra pointing out that fe3o4 go was successfully synthesized in comparison with fe3o4 go a new peak at 1389 cm 1 is related to ch3 of oleic acid which is appeared in spectrum of fe3o4 oa go 56 3 1 2 thermogravimetric analysis tga thermogravimetric analysis for synthesized go based nanodemulsifiers was performed in nitrogen environment as depicted in fig 1 b for all samples a weight loss was observed below 100 c which was attributed to the removal of adsorbed water two stages of weight loss took place around 200 400 c representing the decomposition of oxygen containing functional groups at various positions on go nanosheets increasing weight loss at this range of temperature for fe3o4 oa go nanosheets may be assigned to overlap of losing the oa coating with functional groups of go nanosheets for go nanosheets after 400 c no weight loss was observed while the weight loss at above 600 c was related to the breakdown of the coo group coordinated with fe3o4 nanoparticles in the fe3o4 go nanosheets and reduction of fe3o4 with gases caused by oa degradation in fe3o4 oa go nanosheets 3 1 3 morphological analysis of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nano demulsifiers the morphology of the go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets were revealed using tem and sem as displayed in fig 2 the tem image of bare go and the prepared go nanosheets represents the transparency and a silk fabric arranges of them fig 2 a also according to sem image fig 2 b crinkles and defects observed on the surface of the go nanosheets has provided a layer structure on the other hand the images of go demonstrate that it is a thin crumpled sheets closely associated and interconnected with each other so that an amorphous solid is formed images of tem and sem fig 2 c and d respectively for fe3o4 go nanosheets indicate that fe3o4 nanoparticles in small size and high density are distributed on the planes of go nanosheets due to the strong interaction of hydrogen bonds between go and fe3o4 which could approximately prevent the aggregation of fe3o4 nanoparticles 66 however due to the magnetic properties of fe3o4 nanoparticles the partial aggregation of them were observed on surface of go in order to fabricate fe3o4 oa go nanosheets spherical core shell of fe3o4 oa was formed so that the fe3o4 nanoparticles were covered with oa and finally were anchored on the surface of go fig 2 e and f in comparison with fe3o4 go oleic acid capping on fe3o4 surface could inhibit the aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles and as a result fe3o4 oa was more uniformly distributed on the surface of go in fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier furthermore composition of go based nanodemulsifiers was investigated by edx spectroscopy experiments fig 2 g that confirm the presence of c o and fe elements in go based nanodemulsifiers in addition as observed in fig 2 g wt elemental mapping of c increased in fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers which revels fe3o4 oa go was synthesized 3 1 4 magnetic behaviors for fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers the magnetic behavior and saturation magnetizations m versus applied magnetic field h of magnetic demulsifiers were investigated by vsm fig 3 a displays the comparison of saturation magnetization of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanoparticles with bare fe3o4 the observed curve of fe3o4 go nanosheets is representative of reversible magnetic hysteresis loops the obtained zero coercivity of magnetite nanoparticles suggests the superparamagnetic behavior of the synthesized magnetite nanoparticles 67 the saturation magnetization ms values for fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets are 36 and 9 11 emug 1 respectively the ms value of these nanosheets is less than that of bare magnetite 74 emug 1 the reduction in ms value might be due to the small sized magnetite nanoparticles and the existence non magnetization nanosheets of go oa go coating on the surface of magnetite nanoparticles 68 that leads to a decrease in the density of fe3o4 in the synthesized nanocomposites the magnetic particle diameter was given by 69 3 d m 18 k b t x i n π ρ σ 0 2 1 3 where k is the boltzmann constant erg k t is related to the absolute temperature k ρ is density of nanoparticles g cm3 ms and χi are the saturation magnetization emu g and initial magnetic susceptibility emu g oe respectively 69 70 the calculated magnetic particle size for fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go at 27 c were 21 1 nm and 14 nm respectively these values are in agreement with the xrd results 3 1 5 xrd patterns of synthesized nanosheets fig 3 b shows the xrd patterns of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets as shown an intense diffraction peak is found at 2θ 10 5 for go corresponding to the typical diffraction peak of 001 plane of go 71 the position of this peak confirms the successfully synthesis of go the xrd of fe3o4 go also indicates the diffraction peaks in the pattern of cubic phase at 2θ 21 41 35 31 41 81 50 65 63 61 67 54 and 73 79 which are indexed as the planes of 111 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 respectively with a cubic spinel crystal structure jcpds no 19 0629 71 this pattern is quite analogous to that of bare fe3o4 however the intensity of characteristic peak is decreased compared to the bare fe3o4 fig 3 b ii it can indicate a decrement in the crystalline structure of fe3o4 go nevertheless the characteristic peak of go nanosheets is not found in the xrd pattern of fe3o4 go nanocomposite this phenomenon ascribes to the fact that under the co precipitation condition crystal growth of fe3o4 between the interlayer of go spoiled the regular layer stacking resulting in the exfoliation of go and the disappearance of the 001 diffraction peak 72 73 the comparison between xrd peak situation of the bare fe3o4 and fe3o4 oa go samples pointed out that the oa coating did not explicitly affect the crystal structure of the magnetite nanoparticles 74 75 according to debye scherrer s equation 76 the average crystallite size of go and fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go sheets was calculated 4 d k λ β c o s ɵ in which d is the crystallite size λ 0 1789 nm is the wavelength β is full width at half maximum fwhm value of xrd diffraction in radians θ is the bragg angle and k 0 9 is the constant using this equation crystallite size was obtained 20 6 and 13 83 for fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets respectively these values are in consent with the results of the vsm for magnetic nanoparticles 3 1 6 surface wettability of go and fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers the surface wettability of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets is shown in fig 4 as seen in fig 4 the surface thin section of stone makes the oil droplet attain a spherical shape when it is placed on the solution containing go with a oil contact angle ca of 65 7 in contrast when the oil droplet is dropped on the surface of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers it is immediately absorbed and oil could easily migrate the surface that the oil contact angle was measured to be 134 9 and 161 8 respectively the results of ca indicate that the fe3o4 oa go nanosheets are superhydrophobic nanodemulsifiers 3 1 7 relative solubility measurements for go based nanodemulsifiers the relative solubility rsn values was determined and listed in table 3 as shown in table 3 the rsn number for go nanosheets was obtained 18 5 which confirm hydrophilic property of this nanodemulsifier however with functionalization of go nanosheets hydrophobic properties of go based nanodemulsifiers were increased as a result fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier has emerged as a superhydrophobic composite and can comfortably be adsorbed in oil water interface rsn value in range of 13 17 for fe3o4 go nanodemulsifier indicate that this composite possess a desired dispersity in water at low concentration 63 77 3 2 demulsification of emulsified oil wastewater to evaluate the demulsification performance of go based nanodemulsifiers bottle test was used as a conventional method at 25 c dosages of nanodemulsifiers in the various range were determined by trial and error method finally the ranges of 600 1000 ppm were selected due to their proximity to the optimum concentration of nanodemulsifiers in order to compare the effect of the nanodemulsifiers the fresh crude o w emulsion without adding demulsifiers was used as a control blank which was stable for about one day without any phase separation fig 5 after adding a dosage of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers the color of oily wastewater was changed rapidly suggesting the instability of the emulsion and the occurrence of phase separation after a few seconds oil droplets joined together immediately to form larger droplets and coagulated on top of the water to separate the oil phase from water until the oily wastewater was completely treated as shown in fig 5 b and c when fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets were employed as nanodemulsifiers the colorless water phase and particles suspended in water had diminished more compared to the bare go nanosheets in a comparison between demulsification efficiency and settling time of go based nanodemulsifiers it was found that the fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier can reduce the oily wastewater separation time down to 3 s where the demulsification efficiency reached up to 99 99 while the demulsification efficiency of go and fe3o4 go nanosheets was 99 70 and 99 87 settling time of 25 and 10 min respectively hence one possible conclusion would be that higher hydrophobicity properties of nanodemulsifier are associated with enhanced demulsification performance fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier could certainly migrate from water phase to oil water interface to make contact and contribute to hydrophobic interaction of oil droplets with molecules of asphaltenes due to its hydrophobic features all mentioned results imply that the fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier with high oil wettability oil contact angle 18 2 is a fast and efficient nanodemulsifier for oily wastewater destabilization also the most transparent water phase was observed for fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier in order to better understand the mechanism of demulsification process the morphological changes of emulsion before and after driving by go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers were observed using the optical microscope fig 6 as observed in fig 6 a for as prepared emulsified oil wastewater 3 v v the oil droplets with the size smaller than 15 μm have been uniformly dispersed in water phase which was in agreement with those of previously reports 4 78 after treating by go based nanodemulsifiers the oil droplets were aggregated together and the oil floccules with bigger size than initial oily wastewater were acquired these conclude that nanodemulsifiers have been able to interact with oil droplets in oily wastewater and the droplets join each other and the oil floccules caused the decreasing of oil content in the water phase fig 6 b d and f finally after shaking the go based nanodemulsifiers caused instability of oil wastewater and the rapidly oil droplets coalescenced together to form a separated oil phase top on the water phase as seen in fig 6 c e and g a small amount of oil droplet with 5 10 μm has been remained to the separated phase water actually the extraction of oil floccules from oily wastewater using go based nanodemulsifiers has led to an obvious decrease of oil content in the separated water in addition as shown in fig 6 g fe3o4 oa go suspension has demonstrated the best performance also the significant decrement of oil content in water about 2 ppm pointed out the superiority of fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier sample for separation of oily wastewater as a result fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers represent much higher performance due to the presence of superhydrophobic groups on their surface which they enable easily migration to the oil phase and destroying the elasticity film and therefore they reduce surface tension as well 3 3 effect of go based nanodemulsifiers dosage on demulsification performance demulsification performance of go based nanodemulsifiers was evaluated based on residual oil in separated water using a uv spectrophotometer the results indicated that a minimum oil content corresponding to a maximum demulsification efficiency was attained at an optimal demulsifiers dosage 4 according to fig 7 when the dosage of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets was raised nanodemulsifiers efficiency increased sharply and oil content diminished considerably in the separated water phase with elevation of the dosage of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers to 1000 ppm 850 ppm 650 ppm respectively the residual oil content fell to lower than 15 4 ppm 7 3 ppm and 2 1 ppm for the corresponding demulsifiers efficiency of as high as to 99 94 99 97 and 99 99 these values were considered as an optimum concentration for go based nanodemulsifiers for fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers in the three dosages demulsification efficiency was the best and the lower dosage was chosen as optimum dosage on the other hand it can be stated that with the rise of go based nanodemulsifiers dosage the possibility of nanodemulsifiers to diffuse in the interface of oily wastewater increases and nanosheets would be able to interact more with oily wastewater 79 the results also revealed that fe3o4 oa go suspension possessed a far better performance than go and fe3o4 go suspension it can be argued that because of hydrophobicity features of fe3o4 oa go and fe3o4 go nanodemulsifiers they had a stronger interaction with the oil floccules in oily wastewater long hydrocarbon chains ch2 of oa and basal plane of aromatic carbons in fe3o4 oa go represent the high hydrophobicity of fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier in addition fe3o4 oa go is adsorbed on the disperse droplets which is attributed to the fact that the coating of oa with fe3o4 leads to enhanced interfacial activity of fe3o4 oa go nanosheets 56 these properties have proven the ability of fe3o4 oa go to drive the oil droplet to the oil phase and an excellent demulsification performance beyond the optimum dosage provided that the dosage of nanodemulsifiers was increased the demulsification efficiency would be reduced this abnormal phenomenon is feasibly ascribed to the distribution of go based nanosheets in the interface of oil and water leading to the formation of go based film in the interface of emulsion this also causes greater stability of oily wastewater due to the flexible structure of go and fe3o4 go nanodemulsifiers all the mentioned results suggest that go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go suspensions can be applied as high performance demulsifiers for destabilization of the emulsified heavy oily wastewater in fact with functionalizing of go nanosheets and increasing hydrophobic property of go the demulsification efficiency was increased and demulsification time was decreased which is useful in petroleum industery 3 4 effect of temperature on demulsification performance the temperatures used for demulsification performance evaluation of the o w emulsion included 25 c 40 c and 70 c the alteration oil contents in separated water for optimum dosages of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers in the three desired temperatures are illustrated in fig 8 the oil content in separated water decrease with increasing temperature from 25 c to 70 c while increasing the temperature from 25 c to 70 c the settle time for go fe3o4 go nanodemulsifiers was reduced to 16 min and 5 min respectively these phenomena could be justified in such that an increase in temperature promotes oil droplet motion and consequently increase the kinetic energy of them which aid the oil droplets to collide together more frequently 74 in addition an increase in temperature causes the viscosity of oil phase to decrease considerably so that demulsifier diffuses to the oil water interface and interact quickly with asphaltene molecules 80 for fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier its performance did not change significantly and settle time was not measurable in temperature above 25 c because the demulsification performance was very quick about 3 s when the temperature was increased an increase in the temperature causes the reduction of the oil viscosity so the oil droplets joined together easily and the instability of oily wastewater has been rapidly achieved fe3o4 oa go represented the very fast performance to destabilize oily wastewater due to increasing the interfacial adsorption of fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier in the oily wastewater with an increase of the temperature thus this nanodemulsifier was able to migrate in the oil water interface in a facile way which contributes to the separation of oil from the water phase conclusively the temperature has a strong impact on the instability of o w emulsion 3 5 effect of ph on demulsification performance because of hydrophilic edges and hydrophobic plane of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets these nanodemulsifiers can be affected by ph of solution easily so the effect of ph value of emulsion on demulsification performance of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go were investigated it was observed that nanodemulsifiers mentioned in this research exhibited excellent demulsification efficiency in the acidic condition fig 9 in fig 9 the demulsification efficiency as a function of ph value at optimum dosage of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets were measured and illustrated the results show that the demulsification efficiency of oily wastewater was above 99 96 for go nanosheet in the ph range of 2 4 that this amount was higher for fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets about 99 9 and 100 in order to evaluate the results the residual oil content in the separated water at different ph value as a function of go based nanosheets dosage were measured and display in fig 10 a b and c it was found that by increasing the acidity of water phase the residual oil content for go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets would be reduced for instance oil content for go nanodemulsifier was lower 5 ppm and 1 ppm in ph 4 and ph 2 respectively that these values were lower than those reported in the literature 4 these phenomena imply that there was very little of the oil floccules remaining in the separated water these observations insinuated that the go based nanoparticles were entered into the oil phase in large scale after demulsification this could probably due to the ionization of the functional groups of oh and cooh on the go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets in the acidic condition which makes these nanodemulsifiers less hydrophilic and they propend in oil phase 4 to determine the effect of ph quantitatively the zeta potential of go based nanosheets was measured in various ph fig 10 d the results indicated that zeta potential of go based nanosheets became more positive with decreasing of ph value accordingly electrostatic repulsion between oil droplet and go based nanodemulsifiers was remarkably reduced due to the protonation and ionization of polar groups on active surfaces of nanodemulsifiers in ph 2 and ph 4 respectively it was noted that with a decrease of ph the separated water has become almost colorless during the bottle test as seen in fig 10 a for go nanodemulsifier the separated water after demulsification at ph 2 was more colorless than the separated water at neutral condition plausibly the yellow color of the latter could be attributed to the presence go based nanosheets dispersed in separated water phase 4 in acidic condition hydroxyl oh and carboxylic cooh groups would undergo ionization and hence the go nanosheets could be able to migrate in the oil phase easily and the separated water became transparent these results indicate that go based nanodemulsifiers are efficient for demulsification acidic oily wastewater during the well washing process 3 6 adsorption isotherms for consideration of adsorption isotherms asphaltene was extracted from crude oil sample according to ip 143 standard 81 in a short view a given amount of the crude oil sample and n heptane at a proportional ratio of 1 40 g l were admixed then the mixture was refluxed in an extractor for three times and subsequently it was kept in a dark place overnight and the asphaltene was collected by centrifuging the black precipitate was washed with n heptane several times and finally dried at 70 c over one day the measurements dealing with adsorption isotherms for the selected nanodemulsifiers were conducted at 25 c through varying the concentration of asphaltene from 10 to 1000 ppm and the results were depicted in fig 11 the data of isotherms were fitted with langmuir 82 and freundlich 83 models expressed in the following equation respectively 5 q e q 0 k l c e 1 k l c e 6 q e k f c e 1 n and linear form of langmuir model 7 c e q e c e q 0 1 k l q 0 and linear form of freundlich model 8 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where qe is the amount of asphaltenes adsorbed onto the nanosheets at equilibrium mg g q0 is maximum adsorption to form a monolayer of adsorbent mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of asphaltenes in solution phase mg l and kl is langmuir equilibrium adsorption constant related to the affinity of binding sites l mg and kf and 1 n are freundlich constants kf is the adsorption capacity mg m2 l mg 1 n and 1 n is the adsorption intensity factor unitless 81 in recent years several studies presented langmuir type adsorption model for the adsorption of asphaltenes on metal oxide nanoparticles which proposes monolayer adsorption on asphaltene molecules 84 85 while m castro reported multiple layer adsorption due to asphaltene self association to form micelles of asphaltenes 86 it is worth mentioning that the langmuir model assumption is based on a homogeneous adsorption surface with a monolayer coating whereas the freundlich model hypothetically assumes that the adsorbent occurs on a heterogeneous surface with adsorption sites possessing different adsorption energies 85 consequently table 4 lists parameters of fitting for langmuir and freundlich models table 4 represents that the langmuir model is more accurate than the freundlich model for describing the adsorption process of the asphaltene on go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers as a deduction from the results langmuir model looks to be the best mathematical fitting model to justify experimental data for adsorption of asphaltenes on go based nanodemulsifiers which suggests monolayer adsorption asphaltenes on nanodemulsifiers surface as mentioned in previous studies 85 87 88 comparing between q0 values reveals that fe3o4 oa go nanosheets display the highest adsorption capacity the present aromatic rings on surface of go based nanosheets cause π π interaction that is important for adsorption asphaltenes on surface of go based nanodemulsifiers 89 after determining the best fitting to isotherm thermodynamic variables for langmuir isotherm were measured using the arrhenius and van t hoff vantage equations as following 9 δ g a d s r t l n k 10 ln k δ h a d s r t δ s a d s r in which r is universal gas content t is temperature k and k is the adsorption equilibrium constant conventionally k express klcs where kl is the equilibrium langmuir constant l mmol and cs is the molecular mass of asphaltene asphaltene molecular mass reported range of 750 5000 g mol 90 the value of δg for go based nanodemulsifiers regarding the molecular mass of asphaltene 750 g mol at 25 c 40 c 70 c are calculated and reported in table 5 the amount of langmuir isotherms for three temperatures e g 25 c 40 c 70 c were measured with the correlation coefficients r2 0 99 and likewise adsorption constants kl were obtained at the three desired temperatures according to eq 6 fig 11 d the results of thermodynamic variables are listed in table 5 the negative value of gibbs free energy implies the spontaneity of thermodynamic processes which further indicates that the adsorption process of asphaltenes on go based nanodemulsifiers is thermodynamically favorable the variations in gibbs free energy are inversely related to temperature and as a result δgads becomes more negative with increasing temperature in the system the negative value of δhads suggests that the interaction between asphaltenes and go based nanoparticles is exothermic in nature the positive value of δsads corresponds to an increase in the randomness at the solid liquid interface in adsorption of the asphaltene molecules on go based nanodemulsifiers the amounts of absorption heat also showed that the adsorption occurs on the go based nanodemulsifiers physically lower of 40 kj mol 1 91 3 7 recycling test unlike traditional demulsifiers the magnetic form of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets have the capability to be recycled and be reused several times which this attracted much attention in the literature according to the assumed mechanism of demulsification as long as the hydrophobicity property of nanodemulsifiers increases interactions of nanodemulsifiers and asphaltenes at the oily wastewater interface become stronger and thereupon it was hypothesized that a considerable amounts asphaltenes would have been adsorbed on the surface of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go after the demulsification hence the fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go were isolated by using external magnetic field and then they were recycled and washed with toluene to remove the adsorbed asphaltenes the desirable ph value for accomplishing the recycle tests was at about 6 and it repeated for six times as well fig 12 depicts the oil concentration in the separated water and demulsification performance for fe3o4 go and recycled fe3o4 oa go respectively as shown in 3th recycling test the oil concentration was lower than 15 mg l however after 4th cycle the demulsification efficiency was decrease and oil content in separated water for fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go was about increased to 57 6 and 23 3 ppm respectively the decrease in demulsification efficiency might be resulted from enhancement of the strong interaction of asphaltene and resins on fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier that could not be removed easily by toluene washing especially after multiple recycling and a small percentage of contamination of crude oil remained on the fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go surfaces these results express that the fe3o4 oa go presents both excellent demulsification performance and high recyclability in a way that recycling the fe3o4 oa go suspension after demulsification might be efficiently taken place from the complex systems through an external magnetic field in other words it could be a supreme alternative for diminishing the side effects of nanodemulsifiers and oil refineries on environment for confirm stability of fe3o4 oa go nanosheets the ft ir and contact angle analysis of fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier were used after 6 cycle as seen in fig 13 a the ft ir of fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier did not change after and before demulsification and several characteristic peak was located in 500 4000 cm 1 a characteristic broad band centered at 3425 cm 1 could be assigned to the hydroxyl group oh stretching vibrational bands and the ones at 2923 cm 1 and 2854 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of c h ch2 also the carbonyl co peak is assigned to the carboxyl group cooh appeared at 1723 cm 1 the stretching vibration bands at 1165 cm 1 and 1072 cm 1 are attributed to the alkoxy group o c o for go nanosheets the peak at 580 cm 1 is ascribed to the fe o bending vibration in the crystalline lattice of fe3o4 the peak at 1389 cm 1 is related to ch3 of oleic acid in addition the results of contact angle showed that the hydrophobic property θ 163 2 of fe3o4 oa go nanosheets after demulsification is almost the same with this phenomena θ 161 8 before demulsification fig 13b as the result can be said fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier is stable 3 8 the possible mechanism of demulsification the mechanism of demulsification has not been thoroughly understood in general according to the characterization results of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go suspensions these nanodemulsifiers had a large surface area with a chemical structure of conjugated aromatic rings with huge delocalized π systems 92 93 and strong interactions of go based nanodemulsifiers with asphaltenes in oil water interfaces this destabilizes oily wastewaters as predicted in previous studies 4 43 55 on the other hand asphaltene and resin had also cc bonds which are characterized by complex aromatic rings containing heteroatoms such as oxygen sulfur and nitrogen 94 due to interaction of π conjugated system of asphaltenes or resins with the polarized π orbitals of go based suspensions such nanodemulsifiers might adsorb asphaltenes from oily wastewater to form π π electron donor acceptor also the anti bonding orbital of asphaltenes interacts with electron rich functional groups on the go based surfaces to form n π interactions 4 finally fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets had greater affinity to adsorb oil droplets because of their higher hydrophobicity property than go these nanodemulsifiers could be able to penetrate to o w emulsion interface more easily as compared with go nanosheets therefore π conjugated system of asphaltenes or resins with the polarized π orbitals of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go suspensions are strong enough to form vigorous π π interactions fig 14 4 conclusion in the current study go based nanosheets was synthesized and utilized as environmentally friendly cost effective high efficiency and recyclable nanodemulsifiers for treating oily wastewater the morphology and physicochemical properties of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets were investigated using ft ir xrd tem sem vsm and ca the findings in this research work suggested that hydrophobic fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier represented an excellent performance with demulsification efficiency of 99 99 within a few second in addition fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers could be reused to 6 cycle without significant decreasing in demulsification performance under acidic condition fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier was less negative and could interact with oil drops easier than other nanodemulsifiers besides the effect of various temperatures on demulsification efficiency of go based nanodemulsifiers were investigated the results implied temperature had a strong effect on the instability of oily wastewater in such a way that increases in temperature specifically caused emulsified oil wastewater to become unstable 
14283,oily wastewater treatment has been proved to be one of the most crucial environmental concerns in the present study in the first step hydrophobicity properties of fe3o4 nanoparticles were modified by oleic acid oa to form fe3o4 oa afterwards graphene oxide go nanosheets were functionalized with fe3o4 oa nanocomposite to synthesize novel superhydrophobic nanosheets of fe3o4 oa go synthesized fe3o4 oa go nanocomposite was employed as a fast recyclable high performance cost effective and environmentally friendly nanodemulsifier to eliminate oil from oily wastewater demulsification performance of synthesized go based nanodemulsifiers was measured using bottle test as a function of dosage of nanodemulsifier temperature ph and settle time mechanism of demulsification was investigated through optical microscopy finally adsorption isotherms of asphaltene molecules and synthesized nanodemulsifiers were studied so as to achieve detailed and precise understanding regarding interaction between nanodemulsifiers and molecules of asphaltene demulsification tests revealed that fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier with excellent demulsification performance 99 99 had the ability to separate oil water emulsion quickly with demulsification capability for 6 recycle times keywords nanodemulsifiers oily wastewater demulsification superhydrophobic property fe3o4 oa go 1 introduction the formation of stable emulsions during the production of crude oil is an expensive process faced by the oil industry recovery 1 3 in the early 2000s researchers focused on destabilized water in oil emulsions for primary exploitation in oilfields in which the water content was low 4 6 with the aging of the oil field today the decrement of the output pressure of the reservoirs leading to spill of crude oil and reduction in crude oil yields has become a matter of concern 4 7 8 nowadays the alkaline surfactant polymer asp flooding technology has extensively been utilized to extract crude oil to enhance oil production 9 10 this well known technology inevitably produces oil in water o w emulsion due to the presence of natural surface active compounds asphaltenes resins etc in the crude oil as well as added chemical surfactants and alkaline salts 11 14 in addition a large amount of oil sewage is produced from the exploitation of oil in tankers oil ships tankers crash and the outburst of oil wells in the middle of the seas 15 16 this oil sewage directly threatens the environment and should be eliminated before discharge oil pollution caused by the discharge of oily wastewater in recent years has also become one of the most serious environmental issues 17 18 oil induced pollution could have harmful and irreversible effects on marine environments including death of aquatic organisms inappropriate marine nutrition for human and harbors and coasts contamination 19 hence the destabilization of the o w emulsion is an important issue in the petroleum and petrochemical industries several different methods such as air flotation 20 21 electro coalescence 22 23 reverse osmosis 24 filtration membrane separation 25 27 biotechnology 28 30 coagulation sedimentation 31 etc have been proposed to eliminate persistent emulsions although these methods have some merits such as easy operation good demulsification efficiency and feasible installation and so on 26 28 they are considered as costly energy demanding and time consuming methods which require sophisticated equipment and massive place to operate therefore employing an alternative method to address the problems of conventional methods seems vital as a matter of fact by changing the physicochemical properties of the film around a stable emulsion in crude oil the complete separation of oil from wastewater is feasible in general demulsifiers need to be able to penetrate the interface of water and oil and interact with natural surfactants asphaltenes to cause instability of emulsions 32 33 asphaltenes have an essential function in forming an elastic film in the oil water interface 34 37 huanjiang and his research group used carbon black nanoparticles as demulsifiers to separate oil from oily wastewater and investigated the interaction behavior of carbon black and asphaltenes by quantum chemical calculations 38 39 also yun pen and co workers introduced janus membranes with charged carbon nanotubes cnt as a kind of efficient demulsifiers capable of destabilize the o w emulsions due to an unique surface nature and they concluded that such mentioned membranes can demonstrate the recovery performance of 89 per 40 min of oil from 1 2 dichloroethane water emulsions 38 in recent years graphene oxide go has attracted a great deal of attention among the scientists in many potential applications due to its unique properties 4 40 43 the presence of functional groups including hydroxyl carboxylic and epoxy on the edges and planes of go makes it a supreme amphiphilic surfactant featuring both hydrophilic and hydrophobic edges 44 49 thus go is the suitable choice for the demulsification of o w emulsions 50 52 sili and colleagues reported that go is an environmentally friendly and high efficiency nanodemulsifier which has the capability to separate oil from water in oil emulsion within a few minutes 4 furthermore shenwen and co workers systematically discussed the interfacial rheology properties as well as the interfacial tension of the go nanosheets at the crude oil water interface to investigate demulsification mechanism of go for separation of oil from o w emulsions 43 the results showed that go was able to diffuse the interface of oil and water phase and comfortably decreased interfacial tension of the emulsion huanjiang wang and his research group in another investigation synthesized reduced graphene oxides rgo by a controlled hydrothermal dehydration route furtherly they pointed out the excellent demulsification performance in the presence of rgo samples the results of the controlled amphiphilicity of rgo samples and its effect on the demulsification performance demonstrated that with increasing the reduction degree of go demulsification efficiency has been enhanced 53 recently magnetic nanoparticles have drawn the attention of many researchers due to facile management of the separation and recycling the adsorbents from wastewater through an external magnetic field 54 juan and his research team used magnetic graphene oxide mgo to destabilize the crude o w emulsion and also presented a thorough understanding on the intrinsic interaction between demulsifiers and asphaltenes 55 actually prepared magnetic demulsifier is considered as environmentally friendly recyclable and efficient strategy for treating oily wastewater likewise jiling et al studied magnetic nanoparticles coated on oleic acid oa for destabilization of the cyclohexane in water emulsion 56 in another study haiyan and co workers used expanded perlite ep to fabricate ep aptes fe3o4 in order to separate oil from oily wastewater 57 in this paper our main purpose was to investigate the ability of breaking o w emulsion by go nanosheets as nanodemulsifiers using the bottle test go nanosheets due to high surface area simple synthesis cost effective low density of energy similar structure to asphaltenes and environmentally friendly is preferred over other materials such as cnts polymers carbon black etc in order to enhance the hydrophobicity properties of go nanosheets magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 and magnetic nanoparticles coated with oleic acid fe3o4 oa were coated on go nanosheets further functionalized go with magnetic nanoparticles made it possible to recycle the magnetic nanodemulsifiers using an external magnetic field so that magnetic nanosheets would be consumed repeatedly making it more economically affordable it was observed that go functionalized with magnetic nanoparticles could be utilized as an all at once and suitable demulsifier to separate oil from oily wastewater with great efficiency demulsification performance was evaluated with effects of settling time demulsifiers dosage and temperature also the effect of ph on demulsification process of emulsified oil wastewater was considered in detail the results of bottle test demonstrated the best performance of demulsification shortened settle time and optimum dosage of go nanosheets related to novel fe3o4 oa go nanocomposite synthesized for first time in this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the materials of this study and their analytical purity listed in table 1 the dead crude oil was obtained from one of the oil fields in iran the source of kerosene was from a local gas station of taleghan 2 2 preparation of go nanosheets the route to synthesis of go was based on the conventional modified hummer method 58 in brief 5 g of graphite and 2 5 g sodium nitrate were added to a concentrated sulfuric acid 150 ml 98 following addition of 25 g potassium permanganate under stirring in an ice bath to keep the temperature below 50 c for 5 h while removing the ice bath the mixture slowly was diluted with deionized water causing an increase in temperature up to 80 c the diluted mixture was kept at this temperature for 30 min subsequently the suspension was treated with

hydrochloric acid solution followed by 2 5 liters of distilled water the brown solid was transferred to a petri dish and allowed to dry in the room temperature for one night finally the obtained powder was used for our experimental work 2 3 preparation of fe3o4 go nanosheets briefly 10 mg feso4 7h2o and 20 mg fecl3 6h2o were mixed with a magnetic stirrer in a three necked flask containing 200 ml deionized water until they were completely dissolved 59 then the mixed liquid was added into a 50 ml of 1000 ppm of graphene oxide solution ultrapure inert ar gas was utilized to remove oxygen and create an oxygen free environment during the synthesis process afterward the solution was refluxed after refluxing the solution was heated to 80 c with a digital heating stirrer and paraffin bath also ammonium hydroxide 25 v v was dropwise added to the solution until the ph reached 11 and the black precipitate was formed after heating the solution to 80 c within 10 min the mixture was stirred for 3 h and then was allowed to cool to the room temperature the black precipitate was collected by magnetic decantation and repeatedly washed with distilled water and ethanol 2 4 preparation of fe3o4 oa go nanosheets fe3o4 oa nanoparticles were prepared by modified chemical co precipitation 60 in short as mentioned above 10 mg feso4 7h2o and 20 mg fecl3 6h2o were dissolved in 200 ml deionized water under ar flow thereafter the solution was heated to 80 c and stirred and subsequently 20 ml ammonium hydroxide was added rapidly until the ph value reached about 11 then 0 5 ml oleic acid was added and the mixture was preserved at 80 c for 50 min the mixture was allowed to chill at room temperature then the product was gathered with an external magnetic field and extracted upon addition of ethanol and deionized water to remove excess oa finally the fe3o4 oa nanoparticles were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 12 h the fe3o4 oa go nanosheets were prepared by using the liquid self assembly method 61 in a typical synthesis firstly 50 mg of go was dispersed in 50 ml distilled water via sonication for 2 h at room temperature secondly 40 mg of the dissolved fe3o4 oa in 25 ml distilled water was added dropwise into the dispersed go the obtained mixture was sonicated for 3 h at room temperature the resultant nanocomposite was rolled up with the external magnetic field and thoroughly washed with ethanol and distilled water finally the mixture was dried during one day at 60 c the bonds of synthesized nanodemulsifier showed in scheme 1 the bonding between magnetite nanoparticles and oleic acid is chemical bonding and kind of chemical bond is covalent when fe3o4 nanoparticles were coated by oleic acid the two oxygen atoms of coo in oleic acid provided two coordination positions to form the chemical interaction with fe atom 4 in fact oleic acid could bonded from oh or c o with fe3o4 in addition bonding within fe3o4 oa and go is physical bonding and fe3o4 oa able to interact with cooh or oh groups on surface of go nanosheets 2 5 characterization of crude oil the physicochemical properties of crude oil were measured and tabulated in table 2 the measurement of total acid number tan of this crude oil were according to astm d664 by titration method 62 briefly potassium hydroxide 0 005 mol l was employed as a neutralizer for all acidic components titration was performed in a mixture of toluene isopropanol and water volumetric ratio of 500 495 5 the amount of acidic constituents is given in mg of potassium hydroxide koh per 1 g of crude oil in the presence of an indicator phenolphthalein all analysis were performed 3 times for determining an average and the standard deviation was 0 03 mg koh viscosity of crude oil was measured with cambridge electromagnetic viscometer spsl 440 model at 25 c 2 6 crude oil in water elsion oily wastewater preparation the temperature of heavy crude oil was maintained at 60 c for 1 h to increase power flowing of crude oil and then 3 ml of heavy oil and 97 ml distilled water were mixed together and sonicated for 2 h to obtain an oily wastewater 3 v v 2 7 demulsification test the bottle test has proven to be a frequent method for evaluation of the demulsification performance for demulsification 1 ml of each three nanodemulsifiers go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go were added to the oily wastewater 5 ml contained in a graded test tube the distilled water was used as demulsifier in the blank test then the graded test tube was shaken 200 times in order to ensure that go based nanodemulsifiers and emulsion were mixed properly thereupon the mixture was placed under the ambient condition to fulfill the separation of oily wastewater bottle test was repeated 3 times for each type of nanodemulsifier and an average of data was reported the oil in the separated water sample was extracted and diluted with kerosene the residual oil content in the separated water was measured using a spectrophotometer uv vis pg t80plus by monitoring the absorbance at 325 nm the initial oil concentration was calculated through the following equation 1 c0 m0 vw 103 where the c0 mg l is the oil concentration m0 mg is the corresponding mass of oil in the standard curve and vw ml is attributed to the water volume 4 also the demulsification efficiency was computed from the difference of the initial and final oil content in the mixture using the following equation 2 e c0 ci c0 100 in which e is the demulsification efficiency c0 is the initial oil content mg l of emulsion and ci is the residuary oil content in the separated water 56 2 8 characterization to characterize the structure and approve the formation of functional groups the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir thermo nicolet 100 absorption technique was applied the thermogravimetric analysis tga of the samples were measured by using perkin elmer pyris1 from room temperature to 700 c with heating rate 10 c min 1 under a n2 atmosphere x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd philips xpert mpd was also employed for crystalline size and chemical phases of the as prepared nanosheets i e go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go in addition the surface morphology was observed through a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem hitachi s 4160 model and high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem zeiss electron microscopy cm30 300 k the contact angle ca was measured by a contact angle measuring device surface wettability measurements of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers were performed on a drop analyzer to investigate hydrophobic hydrophilic properties of nanodemulsifiers the dehydrated crude oil was diluted by kerosene to 0 25 wt and was used as the oil phase at 25 c 250 ppm of each nanodemulsifiers in distilled water was employed as water phase the water phase was filled in a glass cell and it was attached to the instrument then using a syringe a drop of oil phase was injected into the glassy cell after immersing the drop of oil in go based solution using digimizer software the contact angle was calculated the magnetic property of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers were measured on a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm kavir magnetic company at room temperature elemental mapping analysis was investigated by energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx of go based nanodemulsifiers bruker x flash6l 10 zeta potential measurements of the go based nanosheets go fe3o4 go fe3o4 oa go and crude oil were accomplished through a zeta potential analyzer malvern zetasizer in this regard the go fe3o4 go fe3o4 oa go and crude oil were well dispersed using an ultrasonic in up to 90 min and the as prepared suspensions and diluted hcl was added gently to adjust it desired ph the measurement was repeated 3 times at room temperature 25 1 c and ultimately the mean value and standard deviation were reported micrographs of oily wastewater prior and after adding nanodemulsifiers were captured by an optical microscope leitz germany 2 9 relative solubility number rsn measurement rsn evaluates affinity of hydrophilic and lipophilic parts of demulsifiers to water or oil phase respectively which can be considered a practical alternative method to hlb parameter in brief 1 g of each go based nanodemulsifiers was added to 30 ml of 2 6 v v solution of toluene ethylene glycol dimethyl ether and then was titrated with deionized water until the resulted solution became turbid under stirring at 25 c persistently the volume of titrated water was considered as rsn index the low number of rsn index 13 indicates hydrophobic properties of nanodemulsifiers whereas the high number of rsn index 17 could be a sign of hydrophilic properties of nanodemulsifiers 63 64 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of the go based nanosheets 3 1 1 ft ir spectra of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers fig 1 a demonstrates the ft ir spectra of the go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go samples several characteristic bands have appeared in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 in three ft ir spectra for go nanosheets a characteristic broad band centered at 3425 cm 1 could be assigned to the hydroxyl group oh stretching vibrational bands and the ones at 2923 cm 1 and 2854 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of c h ch2 4 also the carbonyl c o peak is assigned to the carboxyl group cooh appeared at 1723 cm 1 59 the stretching vibration bands at 1165 cm 1 and 1072 cm 1 are attributed to the alkoxy group o c o for go nanosheets 65 the band at 1618 cm 1 is related to cc stretching vibration of go aromatic plane as could be observed from the ft ir pattern of fe3o4 go the peak at 580 cm 1 is ascribed to the fe o bending vibration in the crystalline lattice of fe3o4 indicating the existence of fe3o4 in the fe3o4 go nanocomposite fig 1 a ii 59 moreover characteristic bands of go nanosheets is obvious in fe3o4 go spectra pointing out that fe3o4 go was successfully synthesized in comparison with fe3o4 go a new peak at 1389 cm 1 is related to ch3 of oleic acid which is appeared in spectrum of fe3o4 oa go 56 3 1 2 thermogravimetric analysis tga thermogravimetric analysis for synthesized go based nanodemulsifiers was performed in nitrogen environment as depicted in fig 1 b for all samples a weight loss was observed below 100 c which was attributed to the removal of adsorbed water two stages of weight loss took place around 200 400 c representing the decomposition of oxygen containing functional groups at various positions on go nanosheets increasing weight loss at this range of temperature for fe3o4 oa go nanosheets may be assigned to overlap of losing the oa coating with functional groups of go nanosheets for go nanosheets after 400 c no weight loss was observed while the weight loss at above 600 c was related to the breakdown of the coo group coordinated with fe3o4 nanoparticles in the fe3o4 go nanosheets and reduction of fe3o4 with gases caused by oa degradation in fe3o4 oa go nanosheets 3 1 3 morphological analysis of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nano demulsifiers the morphology of the go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets were revealed using tem and sem as displayed in fig 2 the tem image of bare go and the prepared go nanosheets represents the transparency and a silk fabric arranges of them fig 2 a also according to sem image fig 2 b crinkles and defects observed on the surface of the go nanosheets has provided a layer structure on the other hand the images of go demonstrate that it is a thin crumpled sheets closely associated and interconnected with each other so that an amorphous solid is formed images of tem and sem fig 2 c and d respectively for fe3o4 go nanosheets indicate that fe3o4 nanoparticles in small size and high density are distributed on the planes of go nanosheets due to the strong interaction of hydrogen bonds between go and fe3o4 which could approximately prevent the aggregation of fe3o4 nanoparticles 66 however due to the magnetic properties of fe3o4 nanoparticles the partial aggregation of them were observed on surface of go in order to fabricate fe3o4 oa go nanosheets spherical core shell of fe3o4 oa was formed so that the fe3o4 nanoparticles were covered with oa and finally were anchored on the surface of go fig 2 e and f in comparison with fe3o4 go oleic acid capping on fe3o4 surface could inhibit the aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles and as a result fe3o4 oa was more uniformly distributed on the surface of go in fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier furthermore composition of go based nanodemulsifiers was investigated by edx spectroscopy experiments fig 2 g that confirm the presence of c o and fe elements in go based nanodemulsifiers in addition as observed in fig 2 g wt elemental mapping of c increased in fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers which revels fe3o4 oa go was synthesized 3 1 4 magnetic behaviors for fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers the magnetic behavior and saturation magnetizations m versus applied magnetic field h of magnetic demulsifiers were investigated by vsm fig 3 a displays the comparison of saturation magnetization of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanoparticles with bare fe3o4 the observed curve of fe3o4 go nanosheets is representative of reversible magnetic hysteresis loops the obtained zero coercivity of magnetite nanoparticles suggests the superparamagnetic behavior of the synthesized magnetite nanoparticles 67 the saturation magnetization ms values for fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets are 36 and 9 11 emug 1 respectively the ms value of these nanosheets is less than that of bare magnetite 74 emug 1 the reduction in ms value might be due to the small sized magnetite nanoparticles and the existence non magnetization nanosheets of go oa go coating on the surface of magnetite nanoparticles 68 that leads to a decrease in the density of fe3o4 in the synthesized nanocomposites the magnetic particle diameter was given by 69 3 d m 18 k b t x i n π ρ σ 0 2 1 3 where k is the boltzmann constant erg k t is related to the absolute temperature k ρ is density of nanoparticles g cm3 ms and χi are the saturation magnetization emu g and initial magnetic susceptibility emu g oe respectively 69 70 the calculated magnetic particle size for fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go at 27 c were 21 1 nm and 14 nm respectively these values are in agreement with the xrd results 3 1 5 xrd patterns of synthesized nanosheets fig 3 b shows the xrd patterns of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets as shown an intense diffraction peak is found at 2θ 10 5 for go corresponding to the typical diffraction peak of 001 plane of go 71 the position of this peak confirms the successfully synthesis of go the xrd of fe3o4 go also indicates the diffraction peaks in the pattern of cubic phase at 2θ 21 41 35 31 41 81 50 65 63 61 67 54 and 73 79 which are indexed as the planes of 111 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 respectively with a cubic spinel crystal structure jcpds no 19 0629 71 this pattern is quite analogous to that of bare fe3o4 however the intensity of characteristic peak is decreased compared to the bare fe3o4 fig 3 b ii it can indicate a decrement in the crystalline structure of fe3o4 go nevertheless the characteristic peak of go nanosheets is not found in the xrd pattern of fe3o4 go nanocomposite this phenomenon ascribes to the fact that under the co precipitation condition crystal growth of fe3o4 between the interlayer of go spoiled the regular layer stacking resulting in the exfoliation of go and the disappearance of the 001 diffraction peak 72 73 the comparison between xrd peak situation of the bare fe3o4 and fe3o4 oa go samples pointed out that the oa coating did not explicitly affect the crystal structure of the magnetite nanoparticles 74 75 according to debye scherrer s equation 76 the average crystallite size of go and fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go sheets was calculated 4 d k λ β c o s ɵ in which d is the crystallite size λ 0 1789 nm is the wavelength β is full width at half maximum fwhm value of xrd diffraction in radians θ is the bragg angle and k 0 9 is the constant using this equation crystallite size was obtained 20 6 and 13 83 for fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets respectively these values are in consent with the results of the vsm for magnetic nanoparticles 3 1 6 surface wettability of go and fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers the surface wettability of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets is shown in fig 4 as seen in fig 4 the surface thin section of stone makes the oil droplet attain a spherical shape when it is placed on the solution containing go with a oil contact angle ca of 65 7 in contrast when the oil droplet is dropped on the surface of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers it is immediately absorbed and oil could easily migrate the surface that the oil contact angle was measured to be 134 9 and 161 8 respectively the results of ca indicate that the fe3o4 oa go nanosheets are superhydrophobic nanodemulsifiers 3 1 7 relative solubility measurements for go based nanodemulsifiers the relative solubility rsn values was determined and listed in table 3 as shown in table 3 the rsn number for go nanosheets was obtained 18 5 which confirm hydrophilic property of this nanodemulsifier however with functionalization of go nanosheets hydrophobic properties of go based nanodemulsifiers were increased as a result fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier has emerged as a superhydrophobic composite and can comfortably be adsorbed in oil water interface rsn value in range of 13 17 for fe3o4 go nanodemulsifier indicate that this composite possess a desired dispersity in water at low concentration 63 77 3 2 demulsification of emulsified oil wastewater to evaluate the demulsification performance of go based nanodemulsifiers bottle test was used as a conventional method at 25 c dosages of nanodemulsifiers in the various range were determined by trial and error method finally the ranges of 600 1000 ppm were selected due to their proximity to the optimum concentration of nanodemulsifiers in order to compare the effect of the nanodemulsifiers the fresh crude o w emulsion without adding demulsifiers was used as a control blank which was stable for about one day without any phase separation fig 5 after adding a dosage of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers the color of oily wastewater was changed rapidly suggesting the instability of the emulsion and the occurrence of phase separation after a few seconds oil droplets joined together immediately to form larger droplets and coagulated on top of the water to separate the oil phase from water until the oily wastewater was completely treated as shown in fig 5 b and c when fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets were employed as nanodemulsifiers the colorless water phase and particles suspended in water had diminished more compared to the bare go nanosheets in a comparison between demulsification efficiency and settling time of go based nanodemulsifiers it was found that the fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier can reduce the oily wastewater separation time down to 3 s where the demulsification efficiency reached up to 99 99 while the demulsification efficiency of go and fe3o4 go nanosheets was 99 70 and 99 87 settling time of 25 and 10 min respectively hence one possible conclusion would be that higher hydrophobicity properties of nanodemulsifier are associated with enhanced demulsification performance fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier could certainly migrate from water phase to oil water interface to make contact and contribute to hydrophobic interaction of oil droplets with molecules of asphaltenes due to its hydrophobic features all mentioned results imply that the fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier with high oil wettability oil contact angle 18 2 is a fast and efficient nanodemulsifier for oily wastewater destabilization also the most transparent water phase was observed for fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier in order to better understand the mechanism of demulsification process the morphological changes of emulsion before and after driving by go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers were observed using the optical microscope fig 6 as observed in fig 6 a for as prepared emulsified oil wastewater 3 v v the oil droplets with the size smaller than 15 μm have been uniformly dispersed in water phase which was in agreement with those of previously reports 4 78 after treating by go based nanodemulsifiers the oil droplets were aggregated together and the oil floccules with bigger size than initial oily wastewater were acquired these conclude that nanodemulsifiers have been able to interact with oil droplets in oily wastewater and the droplets join each other and the oil floccules caused the decreasing of oil content in the water phase fig 6 b d and f finally after shaking the go based nanodemulsifiers caused instability of oil wastewater and the rapidly oil droplets coalescenced together to form a separated oil phase top on the water phase as seen in fig 6 c e and g a small amount of oil droplet with 5 10 μm has been remained to the separated phase water actually the extraction of oil floccules from oily wastewater using go based nanodemulsifiers has led to an obvious decrease of oil content in the separated water in addition as shown in fig 6 g fe3o4 oa go suspension has demonstrated the best performance also the significant decrement of oil content in water about 2 ppm pointed out the superiority of fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier sample for separation of oily wastewater as a result fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers represent much higher performance due to the presence of superhydrophobic groups on their surface which they enable easily migration to the oil phase and destroying the elasticity film and therefore they reduce surface tension as well 3 3 effect of go based nanodemulsifiers dosage on demulsification performance demulsification performance of go based nanodemulsifiers was evaluated based on residual oil in separated water using a uv spectrophotometer the results indicated that a minimum oil content corresponding to a maximum demulsification efficiency was attained at an optimal demulsifiers dosage 4 according to fig 7 when the dosage of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets was raised nanodemulsifiers efficiency increased sharply and oil content diminished considerably in the separated water phase with elevation of the dosage of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers to 1000 ppm 850 ppm 650 ppm respectively the residual oil content fell to lower than 15 4 ppm 7 3 ppm and 2 1 ppm for the corresponding demulsifiers efficiency of as high as to 99 94 99 97 and 99 99 these values were considered as an optimum concentration for go based nanodemulsifiers for fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers in the three dosages demulsification efficiency was the best and the lower dosage was chosen as optimum dosage on the other hand it can be stated that with the rise of go based nanodemulsifiers dosage the possibility of nanodemulsifiers to diffuse in the interface of oily wastewater increases and nanosheets would be able to interact more with oily wastewater 79 the results also revealed that fe3o4 oa go suspension possessed a far better performance than go and fe3o4 go suspension it can be argued that because of hydrophobicity features of fe3o4 oa go and fe3o4 go nanodemulsifiers they had a stronger interaction with the oil floccules in oily wastewater long hydrocarbon chains ch2 of oa and basal plane of aromatic carbons in fe3o4 oa go represent the high hydrophobicity of fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier in addition fe3o4 oa go is adsorbed on the disperse droplets which is attributed to the fact that the coating of oa with fe3o4 leads to enhanced interfacial activity of fe3o4 oa go nanosheets 56 these properties have proven the ability of fe3o4 oa go to drive the oil droplet to the oil phase and an excellent demulsification performance beyond the optimum dosage provided that the dosage of nanodemulsifiers was increased the demulsification efficiency would be reduced this abnormal phenomenon is feasibly ascribed to the distribution of go based nanosheets in the interface of oil and water leading to the formation of go based film in the interface of emulsion this also causes greater stability of oily wastewater due to the flexible structure of go and fe3o4 go nanodemulsifiers all the mentioned results suggest that go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go suspensions can be applied as high performance demulsifiers for destabilization of the emulsified heavy oily wastewater in fact with functionalizing of go nanosheets and increasing hydrophobic property of go the demulsification efficiency was increased and demulsification time was decreased which is useful in petroleum industery 3 4 effect of temperature on demulsification performance the temperatures used for demulsification performance evaluation of the o w emulsion included 25 c 40 c and 70 c the alteration oil contents in separated water for optimum dosages of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers in the three desired temperatures are illustrated in fig 8 the oil content in separated water decrease with increasing temperature from 25 c to 70 c while increasing the temperature from 25 c to 70 c the settle time for go fe3o4 go nanodemulsifiers was reduced to 16 min and 5 min respectively these phenomena could be justified in such that an increase in temperature promotes oil droplet motion and consequently increase the kinetic energy of them which aid the oil droplets to collide together more frequently 74 in addition an increase in temperature causes the viscosity of oil phase to decrease considerably so that demulsifier diffuses to the oil water interface and interact quickly with asphaltene molecules 80 for fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier its performance did not change significantly and settle time was not measurable in temperature above 25 c because the demulsification performance was very quick about 3 s when the temperature was increased an increase in the temperature causes the reduction of the oil viscosity so the oil droplets joined together easily and the instability of oily wastewater has been rapidly achieved fe3o4 oa go represented the very fast performance to destabilize oily wastewater due to increasing the interfacial adsorption of fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier in the oily wastewater with an increase of the temperature thus this nanodemulsifier was able to migrate in the oil water interface in a facile way which contributes to the separation of oil from the water phase conclusively the temperature has a strong impact on the instability of o w emulsion 3 5 effect of ph on demulsification performance because of hydrophilic edges and hydrophobic plane of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets these nanodemulsifiers can be affected by ph of solution easily so the effect of ph value of emulsion on demulsification performance of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go were investigated it was observed that nanodemulsifiers mentioned in this research exhibited excellent demulsification efficiency in the acidic condition fig 9 in fig 9 the demulsification efficiency as a function of ph value at optimum dosage of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets were measured and illustrated the results show that the demulsification efficiency of oily wastewater was above 99 96 for go nanosheet in the ph range of 2 4 that this amount was higher for fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets about 99 9 and 100 in order to evaluate the results the residual oil content in the separated water at different ph value as a function of go based nanosheets dosage were measured and display in fig 10 a b and c it was found that by increasing the acidity of water phase the residual oil content for go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets would be reduced for instance oil content for go nanodemulsifier was lower 5 ppm and 1 ppm in ph 4 and ph 2 respectively that these values were lower than those reported in the literature 4 these phenomena imply that there was very little of the oil floccules remaining in the separated water these observations insinuated that the go based nanoparticles were entered into the oil phase in large scale after demulsification this could probably due to the ionization of the functional groups of oh and cooh on the go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets in the acidic condition which makes these nanodemulsifiers less hydrophilic and they propend in oil phase 4 to determine the effect of ph quantitatively the zeta potential of go based nanosheets was measured in various ph fig 10 d the results indicated that zeta potential of go based nanosheets became more positive with decreasing of ph value accordingly electrostatic repulsion between oil droplet and go based nanodemulsifiers was remarkably reduced due to the protonation and ionization of polar groups on active surfaces of nanodemulsifiers in ph 2 and ph 4 respectively it was noted that with a decrease of ph the separated water has become almost colorless during the bottle test as seen in fig 10 a for go nanodemulsifier the separated water after demulsification at ph 2 was more colorless than the separated water at neutral condition plausibly the yellow color of the latter could be attributed to the presence go based nanosheets dispersed in separated water phase 4 in acidic condition hydroxyl oh and carboxylic cooh groups would undergo ionization and hence the go nanosheets could be able to migrate in the oil phase easily and the separated water became transparent these results indicate that go based nanodemulsifiers are efficient for demulsification acidic oily wastewater during the well washing process 3 6 adsorption isotherms for consideration of adsorption isotherms asphaltene was extracted from crude oil sample according to ip 143 standard 81 in a short view a given amount of the crude oil sample and n heptane at a proportional ratio of 1 40 g l were admixed then the mixture was refluxed in an extractor for three times and subsequently it was kept in a dark place overnight and the asphaltene was collected by centrifuging the black precipitate was washed with n heptane several times and finally dried at 70 c over one day the measurements dealing with adsorption isotherms for the selected nanodemulsifiers were conducted at 25 c through varying the concentration of asphaltene from 10 to 1000 ppm and the results were depicted in fig 11 the data of isotherms were fitted with langmuir 82 and freundlich 83 models expressed in the following equation respectively 5 q e q 0 k l c e 1 k l c e 6 q e k f c e 1 n and linear form of langmuir model 7 c e q e c e q 0 1 k l q 0 and linear form of freundlich model 8 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where qe is the amount of asphaltenes adsorbed onto the nanosheets at equilibrium mg g q0 is maximum adsorption to form a monolayer of adsorbent mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of asphaltenes in solution phase mg l and kl is langmuir equilibrium adsorption constant related to the affinity of binding sites l mg and kf and 1 n are freundlich constants kf is the adsorption capacity mg m2 l mg 1 n and 1 n is the adsorption intensity factor unitless 81 in recent years several studies presented langmuir type adsorption model for the adsorption of asphaltenes on metal oxide nanoparticles which proposes monolayer adsorption on asphaltene molecules 84 85 while m castro reported multiple layer adsorption due to asphaltene self association to form micelles of asphaltenes 86 it is worth mentioning that the langmuir model assumption is based on a homogeneous adsorption surface with a monolayer coating whereas the freundlich model hypothetically assumes that the adsorbent occurs on a heterogeneous surface with adsorption sites possessing different adsorption energies 85 consequently table 4 lists parameters of fitting for langmuir and freundlich models table 4 represents that the langmuir model is more accurate than the freundlich model for describing the adsorption process of the asphaltene on go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers as a deduction from the results langmuir model looks to be the best mathematical fitting model to justify experimental data for adsorption of asphaltenes on go based nanodemulsifiers which suggests monolayer adsorption asphaltenes on nanodemulsifiers surface as mentioned in previous studies 85 87 88 comparing between q0 values reveals that fe3o4 oa go nanosheets display the highest adsorption capacity the present aromatic rings on surface of go based nanosheets cause π π interaction that is important for adsorption asphaltenes on surface of go based nanodemulsifiers 89 after determining the best fitting to isotherm thermodynamic variables for langmuir isotherm were measured using the arrhenius and van t hoff vantage equations as following 9 δ g a d s r t l n k 10 ln k δ h a d s r t δ s a d s r in which r is universal gas content t is temperature k and k is the adsorption equilibrium constant conventionally k express klcs where kl is the equilibrium langmuir constant l mmol and cs is the molecular mass of asphaltene asphaltene molecular mass reported range of 750 5000 g mol 90 the value of δg for go based nanodemulsifiers regarding the molecular mass of asphaltene 750 g mol at 25 c 40 c 70 c are calculated and reported in table 5 the amount of langmuir isotherms for three temperatures e g 25 c 40 c 70 c were measured with the correlation coefficients r2 0 99 and likewise adsorption constants kl were obtained at the three desired temperatures according to eq 6 fig 11 d the results of thermodynamic variables are listed in table 5 the negative value of gibbs free energy implies the spontaneity of thermodynamic processes which further indicates that the adsorption process of asphaltenes on go based nanodemulsifiers is thermodynamically favorable the variations in gibbs free energy are inversely related to temperature and as a result δgads becomes more negative with increasing temperature in the system the negative value of δhads suggests that the interaction between asphaltenes and go based nanoparticles is exothermic in nature the positive value of δsads corresponds to an increase in the randomness at the solid liquid interface in adsorption of the asphaltene molecules on go based nanodemulsifiers the amounts of absorption heat also showed that the adsorption occurs on the go based nanodemulsifiers physically lower of 40 kj mol 1 91 3 7 recycling test unlike traditional demulsifiers the magnetic form of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets have the capability to be recycled and be reused several times which this attracted much attention in the literature according to the assumed mechanism of demulsification as long as the hydrophobicity property of nanodemulsifiers increases interactions of nanodemulsifiers and asphaltenes at the oily wastewater interface become stronger and thereupon it was hypothesized that a considerable amounts asphaltenes would have been adsorbed on the surface of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go after the demulsification hence the fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go were isolated by using external magnetic field and then they were recycled and washed with toluene to remove the adsorbed asphaltenes the desirable ph value for accomplishing the recycle tests was at about 6 and it repeated for six times as well fig 12 depicts the oil concentration in the separated water and demulsification performance for fe3o4 go and recycled fe3o4 oa go respectively as shown in 3th recycling test the oil concentration was lower than 15 mg l however after 4th cycle the demulsification efficiency was decrease and oil content in separated water for fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go was about increased to 57 6 and 23 3 ppm respectively the decrease in demulsification efficiency might be resulted from enhancement of the strong interaction of asphaltene and resins on fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier that could not be removed easily by toluene washing especially after multiple recycling and a small percentage of contamination of crude oil remained on the fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go surfaces these results express that the fe3o4 oa go presents both excellent demulsification performance and high recyclability in a way that recycling the fe3o4 oa go suspension after demulsification might be efficiently taken place from the complex systems through an external magnetic field in other words it could be a supreme alternative for diminishing the side effects of nanodemulsifiers and oil refineries on environment for confirm stability of fe3o4 oa go nanosheets the ft ir and contact angle analysis of fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier were used after 6 cycle as seen in fig 13 a the ft ir of fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier did not change after and before demulsification and several characteristic peak was located in 500 4000 cm 1 a characteristic broad band centered at 3425 cm 1 could be assigned to the hydroxyl group oh stretching vibrational bands and the ones at 2923 cm 1 and 2854 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of c h ch2 also the carbonyl co peak is assigned to the carboxyl group cooh appeared at 1723 cm 1 the stretching vibration bands at 1165 cm 1 and 1072 cm 1 are attributed to the alkoxy group o c o for go nanosheets the peak at 580 cm 1 is ascribed to the fe o bending vibration in the crystalline lattice of fe3o4 the peak at 1389 cm 1 is related to ch3 of oleic acid in addition the results of contact angle showed that the hydrophobic property θ 163 2 of fe3o4 oa go nanosheets after demulsification is almost the same with this phenomena θ 161 8 before demulsification fig 13b as the result can be said fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier is stable 3 8 the possible mechanism of demulsification the mechanism of demulsification has not been thoroughly understood in general according to the characterization results of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go suspensions these nanodemulsifiers had a large surface area with a chemical structure of conjugated aromatic rings with huge delocalized π systems 92 93 and strong interactions of go based nanodemulsifiers with asphaltenes in oil water interfaces this destabilizes oily wastewaters as predicted in previous studies 4 43 55 on the other hand asphaltene and resin had also cc bonds which are characterized by complex aromatic rings containing heteroatoms such as oxygen sulfur and nitrogen 94 due to interaction of π conjugated system of asphaltenes or resins with the polarized π orbitals of go based suspensions such nanodemulsifiers might adsorb asphaltenes from oily wastewater to form π π electron donor acceptor also the anti bonding orbital of asphaltenes interacts with electron rich functional groups on the go based surfaces to form n π interactions 4 finally fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets had greater affinity to adsorb oil droplets because of their higher hydrophobicity property than go these nanodemulsifiers could be able to penetrate to o w emulsion interface more easily as compared with go nanosheets therefore π conjugated system of asphaltenes or resins with the polarized π orbitals of fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go suspensions are strong enough to form vigorous π π interactions fig 14 4 conclusion in the current study go based nanosheets was synthesized and utilized as environmentally friendly cost effective high efficiency and recyclable nanodemulsifiers for treating oily wastewater the morphology and physicochemical properties of go fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanosheets were investigated using ft ir xrd tem sem vsm and ca the findings in this research work suggested that hydrophobic fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier represented an excellent performance with demulsification efficiency of 99 99 within a few second in addition fe3o4 go and fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifiers could be reused to 6 cycle without significant decreasing in demulsification performance under acidic condition fe3o4 oa go nanodemulsifier was less negative and could interact with oil drops easier than other nanodemulsifiers besides the effect of various temperatures on demulsification efficiency of go based nanodemulsifiers were investigated the results implied temperature had a strong effect on the instability of oily wastewater in such a way that increases in temperature specifically caused emulsified oil wastewater to become unstable 
14284,hydroxyapatite ha is a well known and widely used efficient adsorbent for toxic metal ion and radionuclide removal from wastewater however the relationship between the structural parameters of ha and its adsorption characteristics capacity selectivity kinetic parameters requires in depth study in this study ha with different crystalline and porous structures was obtained using crystallisation inhibitors of different natures and their adsorption properties in a multicomponent solution cd2 co2 cu2 fe3 ni2 pb2 and zn2 was investigated using low doses of inhibitors mg2 ions and hydroxyethylenediphosphonic acid had a positive effect on ha adsorption characteristics due to their low degree of crystallinity amorphous calcium phosphate and a well developed porous structure abet up to 200 240 m2 g 1 the adsorption capacity of the ha samples in relation to the cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 zn2 ions and their simultaneous presence in the solution varied from 0 13 to 1 28 mmol g 1 the achieved residual concentration of pb2 zn2 and cu2 ions was below the maximum concentration limit and the ions of fe3 were almost equal to zero the highest adsorption of co2 and ni2 ions was observed for ha obtained in the presence of mg2 ha prepared with hepd has been shown to have the highest efficiency towards cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 zn2 ions the adsorption kinetic data fitted well with the pseudo second order model it was shown that depending on the composition and structural characteristics of the prepared ha ion exchange and dissolution precipitation were the two main mechanisms in their interaction with metal ions keywords hydroxyapatite adsorption mechanism metal ions crystallisation inhibitors water treatment 1 introduction the high requirements for the quality of wastewater containing toxic metal ions produced in various fields of industry demand the intensive study of all available methods of their purification 1 4 inorganic sorbents currently play an important role in environmental problem solving as efficient and cost effective materials in recent years this has been evidenced by numerous studies and in depth review articles devoted to the comparative analysis of different sorbents 5 6 including titanosilicates 7 natural and synthetic zeolites 8 and low cost natural biosorbents activated charcoal 9 13 and nanostructured carbon derives 5 6 14 special attention has been paid to the low cost sorbents obtained from industrial and agricultural waste 9 11 12 15 each sorbent has its advantages disadvantages and limitations 2 2 3 4 6 11 the development of adsorption technologies is aimed at increasing the selectivity of sorbents and increasing their adsorption capacity in a wide ph range the initial concentrations of cations the presence of background cations and anions as well as organic impurities calcium and calcium magnesium phosphates have extremely high potential as sorbents of heavy metals being non toxic and environmentally friendly materials 16 19 most works are devoted to the study of synthetic 19 24 and natural apatites both of mineral origin 24 26 and biogenic bio coal bone meal 13 24 obtained from renewable raw materials literature presents the results of studies on the treatment of real wastewater 13 and soil 19 which showed high efficiency in heavy metal removal by bone meal and hydroxyapatite ha the peculiarity of calcium phosphates in particular ha is the possibility of varying the physical and chemical characteristics including the porous structure and chemical composition by changing the method and conditions of synthesis as was shown in 22 23 the adsorption characteristics depend on various parameters it was therefore shown that a decrease in the degree of ha crystallinity and in the size of crystallites leading to an increase in the specific surface area increased the adsorption of toxic metal ions pb2 zn2 cd2 the molar ratio ca p which for stoichiometric ha is 1 67 changes and in the presence of replacement of ca2 by h ions can therefore decrease to 1 38 23 27 in this case ha or so called calcium deficiency ha is characterised by greater solubility which leads to an increase in the adsorption capacity of sorbents even in the presence of a salt background 27 tertiary calcium phosphate with a stoichiometric ratio of ca p 1 5 and amorphous structure shows the highest efficiency towards heavy metal ions 28 29 the control of adsorption characteristics could be performed by varying such parameters of ha synthesis as temperature concentration of the initial reagents and deposition rate as well as using crystallization inhibitors 22 23 previously various organic ligands 30 31 polymers 32 and metal ions 33 38 were studied as crystallisation inhibitors for medical purposes comparative studies of a number of organic inhibitors have shown that polyacrylic acid slows down the formation of ha crystals to the greatest extent and citric acid to the least extent 30 phosphonic acids characterised by the content of one or more groups of capo oh 2 30 39 also showed a strong inhibitory effect the use of phosphonic and diphosphonic acids in the synthesis of bioceramics in an amount of up to 30 wt of the total phosphorus content for the functionalisation of ha contributes to the formation of a fine crystalline phase with a developed porous structure 40 42 this modification also increases the absorption efficiency of pb2 ions 43 modification of the surface of calcium phosphates can also be carried out by adsorption of phosphonates per ha from the solution as a result of which the material can be used for drug delivery 44 or as a selective sorbent for the extraction of heavy metal ions 45 this is due to the fact that phosphonates form strong complexes with transition metal ions as well as ca2 and mg2 ions 46 the effect of hepd used as a crystallisation inhibitor on the sorption of heavy metal ions has not been considered in literature the effect of metal cations such as mg2 sr2 zn2 cu2 is mainly to reduce the crystallinity of the ha as shown by previous studies most show the strong influence of the ions zn2 and cu2 35 36 while the presence of mn2 ions leads to the formation of the amorphous phase 36 the influence of mg2 ions which are among the main substituents of ca2 ions in bone tissue and play an important role in biological processes 33 34 36 38 has been studied in particular detail detailed studies of the adsorption selectivity and the mechanism of different composition ha interaction with a large number of heavy and non ferrous metal ions were carried out but usually such studies are performed from single or bi component solutions cd2 and zn2 47 cu2 and zn2 48 co2 and sr2 49 the available data on the interaction of ha simultaneously with various cations indicate their high efficiency 13 21 24 26 50 51 such studies are of great practical interest since the composition of natural water sources and real wastewater is usually represented by a set of multivalent ions at various ratios 13 52 the aim of this work was to study the efficiency of toxic metal ion adsorption from a multicomponent solution by sorbents based on ha of varying degrees of crystallinity and porous structure which was controlled by the use of crystallisation inhibitors of organic hepd and inorganic mg2 ions natures in addition to the above features of these substances they are practically harmless for the environment and do not lead to contamination of the cleaned solutions with harmful by products 53 the choice of these substances is also justified by the fact that mg2 and hedp ions are not the strongest inhibitors among similar compounds 36 39 since the aim of the work is not to prevent the formation of ha but the formation of a weakly crystallised structure in addition hedp as the well known member of diphosphonates was used as the reference standard for studies of the other diphosphonates with its own potency value set to one 53 the study of adsorption processes was carried out using a model multi metal solution containing cd2 co2 cu2 fe3 ni2 pb2 and zn2 ions which are most widely used in various technological processes and are therefore often found in real wastewater the sorbent concentration in the purified solution sorbent dose and the duration of purification were chosen as varied parameters the novelty of this work is to establish the relationship between the structural parameters of ha and its adsorption characteristics capacity selectivity kinetic parameters in relation to the ions of toxic metals 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of adsorbents hydroxyapatite adsorbents were prepared by chemical precipitation from ca no3 2 4h2o and h3po4 solutions and nh4oh to maintain ph 10 at room temperature the concentration of ca2 cations in the reaction solution after mixing was 0 083 m and anions po4 3 of 0 05 m these conditions of ha synthesis were different to the

diffractometer bruker germany using cukα radiation the content of ca2 in the synthesised samples was determined by the reverse titration method with trilon b and znso4solutions and the phosphorus content analysis was carried out by the method of photometry of the coloured phosphate vanadomolybdenum complex the porous structure characteristics of samples were evaluated by isotherms of low

concentration were carried out using an optical emission spectrometer with inductively coupled plasma icp oes model icap 6300 thermo electron corporation usa the ph of solutions before and after adsorption was controlled by a ph meter 340i 0 02 2 3 2 batch method the adsorption experiment was carried out by batch method at room temperature the sorbent sample was filled with 20 ml of the model solution and left for a certain time with constant shaking by a st 15 shaker cat m zipperer gmbh staufen germany then the solution was filtered using a polypropylene filter 0 45 μm to determine the optimal sorbent concentration the weight of the sorbent sample varied from 0 0100 to 0 2000 g with a constant volume of the purified solution equal to 20 ml accordingly the sorbent concentration in the solution varied in the range of 0 5 to 10 g l 1 the contact time of the sorbent with the solution was 24 h studies on the effect of contact time on the adsorption of metal ions was performed by varying the duration of interaction from 0 5 to 48 h a portion of the sorbent 0 1000 0 0001 g was placed in a plastic test tube filled with 10 ml of the model solution and shaken at 250 rpm the

pseudo first and the pseudo second order rate constants 3 results 3 1 sorbent characterization as shown by the study of the composition and properties of the synthesised ha samples the use of crystallisation inhibitors of different natures even with a small number of them leads to a change in the chemical composition crystal and structural characteristics fig 1 table 2 thus with the introduction of 1 mg2 ions the specific surface area of the obtained crystalline ha increased from 72 75 to 123 127 m2 g 1 the growth of the specific surface area was accompanied by a corresponding increase in pore volume from 0 233 0 242 to 0 375 0 367 cm3 g 1 with the average pore size practically unchanged the increase in the specific surface area apparently due to the decrease in the size of crystallites was due to the inhibitory effect of mg2 ions according to modern concepts the process of ha crystallisation is an extremely complex process consisting of five stages 1 the formation of ion clusters and amorphous calcium phosphate acp 2 the stabilisation of acp 3 the transition of acp to ha through dissolution and crystallisation 4 crystal growth 5 ha aging under conditions close to equilibrium 33 the mechanism of action of mg2 ions on ha crystallisation is that adsorbed on the surface of the formed primary particles of acp they prevent the further growth of these particles and the formation of the crystal structure thereby reducing the size of the crystallites and the degree of their crystallinity 33 in the synthesis in the presence of the additive hedp a weakly crystallised phase was formed characterised by a smaller specific surface area but a large volume of pores and their average size features of the formation of such a phase are explained by the presence of hedp molecules which capturing several ca2 ions prevent the crystallisation of ha and form elaborate complexes resulting in the growth of primary particles 30 a similar effect was observed for the hedp modifying of the ha surface 45 the action of crystallisation inhibitors was accompanied by corresponding changes in the chemical composition of the formed products according to the chemical analysis ha samples synthesised without inhibitors are close to the stoichiometric composition with a molar ratio of ca p 1 667 table 2 the use of mg2 ions as a crystallisation inhibitor leads to a slight decrease in the molar ratio of ca p to 1 63 hedp had a more significant impact on the chemical composition of ha the molar ratio of ca p of the phase formed in the presence of hedp was 1 56 which practically corresponds to tricalcium phosphate and thus confirms the xrd data 3 2 adsorption studies 3 2 1 dose of sorbents according to the data presented in fig 2 a c the removal efficiency of cations increased with an increase in the concentration of the sorbent at a dose of 5 0 g l 1 the removal efficiency of cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 and zn2 ions was 87 100 and at a maximum dose of 10 0 g l 1 sorbents regardless of their composition for almost all cations reached 100 this phenomenon could be explained by an increased number of active sites for adsorption as shown in 54 exceptions were fe3 ni2 and co2 ions despite the rather high concentration of fe3 ions the removal efficiency of these ions reached 100 at a minimum dose of sorbents 0 5 g l 1 for sorbent p 1 and 1 0 g l 1 for sorbents i 0 and m 1 the adsorption of ni2 and co2 ions on the other hand was minimal at all doses by all sorbents the maximum degree of purification from these ions was obtained using the m 1 sorbent at 76 and 60 respectively a comparison of sorbents among themselves shows that the fe3 pb2 zn2 and cu2 ions adsorptions differed from each other a marked difference can be traced to the adsorption of ions cd2 ni2 and co2 thus the minimum residual concentration of cd2 ions was obtained by adsorption with samples synthesised using crystallisation inhibitors especially p 1 and ni2 and co2 ions with the m 1 sample 3 2 2 the study of metal ion adsorption in time curves of changes in the removal efficiency of toxic metal ions during interaction with sorbents are shown in fig 3 all sorbents were characterised by a rapid increase in the removal efficiency of cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 and zn2 ions at the initial section of the curves corresponding to 5 15 min during adsorption of fe3 ions 60 min pb2 ions and 3 6 h for other ions then the curves went plateaued out which indicates the achievement of equilibrium first the equilibrium of fe3 and pb2 ions was established in the case of sorbent p 1 the equilibrium value for these ions was achieved in 5 min and 3 h respectively and sorbents i 0 and m 1 in 15 min and 6 h for cd2 cu2 and zn2 ions for all sorbents equilibrium was reached within 24 h when comparing the magnitude of the sorbents the adsorption capacity of these five ions in the first 60 min clearly shows the advantage of the sorbent p 1 fig 4 according to the efficiency of ion removal sorbents can be arranged in a series of p 1 m 1 i 0 for ni2 and co2 ion adsorption a different relationship was observed as can be seen from fig 3 ni2 and co2 ion equilibrium was achieved within 48 h of contact while in 24 h the ni2 ion recovery rate relative to the equilibrium value was 90 5 for the sorbent i 0 94 5 for p 1 and 96 7 for m 1 as the most active in relation to these ions for co2 ions the equilibrium was somewhat better so the value of removal efficiency at 24 h by the same sorbents reaches 92 8 97 7 and 98 0 of the equilibrium values respectively according to the efficiency of ni2 and co2 ions adsorption sorbents could be arranged in series of m 1 i 0 p 1 fig 4 3 2 3 kinetics models the obtained data on the adsorption capacity depending on the contact time were calculated using the pseudo first and pseudo second order equations fig 5 tables 3 and 4 data on the adsorption of fe3 ions could not be short circuited due to the rapid achievement of the equilibrium state at their available concentration in the initial solutions according to the calculation results table 3 when using the pseudo first order model for the processes of adsorption of pb2 co2 and ni2 ions low r 2 values and a large difference between q exp and q 1 values were obtained this indicates that these processes cannot be described by the pseudo first order equation the results on the adsorption of another group of ions cu2 cd2 and zn2 were characterised by higher values of r2 and a slight discrepancy between the values of qexp and q1 which suggests a different mechanism of interaction between ha samples and metal ions as calculations have shown the equation of pseudo second order table 4 describes the experimental data fairly accurately this model can be most reliably applied to the adsorption of pb2 cu2 cd2 and zn2 ions for which the coefficients r2 with all sorbents are almost 1 0 at the same time according to the results it was possible to trace the adsorption selectivity of various ions and analyse the advantages of sorbents comparison of the obtained values of the initial velocity h for different ions shows that all three sorbents had the highest adsorption rate of pb2 ions and the lowest for co2 as the initial velocity decreased the metal ions could be arranged in the following sequence 7 h pb h cu h cd h ni h zn h co according to the rate constant of different cations the sorbents had some differences thus in the interaction of ions with the sorbent obtained without inhibitors the constants could be arranged in the following sequence 8 k2 zn k2 pb k2 co k2 cu k2 cd k2 ni for sorbents m 1 and p 1 rate constants were formed in other sequences 9 and 10 respectively 9 k2 pb k2 zn k2 co k2 cu k2 cd k2 ni 10 k2 pb k2 zn k2 co k2 cu k2 ni k2 cd according to these series the sorbents obtained with inhibitors had the highest rate constant for pb2 ions adsorption and the lowest for m 1 while interacting with ni2 ions as in sorbent i 0 and with cd2 ions for p 1 comparison of sorbents between themselves shows that sample p 1 was allocated the highest values of the parameters k2 and h and the highest adsorption capacity of pb2 ions it was not possible to compare sorbents according to the equilibrium adsorption capacity since at a given concentration of metal ions during equilibrium the removal efficiency of metal ions reached 100 only in relation to ni2 ions was it the most prominent advantage of the sorbent m 1 sorbents i 0 and m 1 differed from each other in these parameters although some advantage in respect of pb2 cu2 cd2 and zn2 ions was manifested in sorbent m 1 and in respect of ni2 and co2 ions for i 0 all the revealed differences can be caused by the peculiarities of the chemical composition of sorbents their morphology and accordingly physical and chemical properties 3 3 mechanism of adsorption to study the features of sorbent interaction depending on the composition and physical chemical properties the ph measurement of filtrates was carried out and the content of cа2 and po4 3 ion leaching into the solution was determined fig 6 the change in ph according to the sorbent dose fig 6a and during adsorption fig 6d reflected the difference between the sorbents thus the sorbent obtained without the use of crystallisation inhibitors in the process of interaction with toxic metal ions in the solution had more alkaline properties resulting in an increase in the dose of the sorbent ph from 3 to 4 0 4 6 the sorbent obtained with the addition of hedp on the other hand had more acidic properties so there was a minimum increase in ph to 3 9 the behaviour of sorbent m 1 at low doses in solution 0 5 2 5 g l 1 was similar to the sorbent p 1 and at high doses 5 0 10 0 g l 1 sorbent i 0 the similarity of the behaviour of the sorbents i 0 and m 1 in the solution was confirmed by the graphs of the variation of ph during adsorption fig 6d by the time equilibrium was reached for the adsorption of most ions during the first 6 h fig 3 the ph of the filtrates had increased to 4 5 and 4 6 for i 0 and m 1 respectively at equilibrium ph was 4 8 in the case of the p 1 sample the equilibrium ph approached 4 0 the changes in the acid base composition of the solutions were in good agreement with the data on the number of cа2 and po4 3 ions transferred to the solution according to the results of the analysis the transition to a solution of ca2 ions accompanying the adsorption of toxic metal ions decreased as the sorbent dose increased and the molar ratio l cа q m increased and at a dose of 5 g l 1 reached a constant value close to one table 5 fig 6b at the same time a more intense leaching of ca2 ions into the solution and the highest l cа q m value of 1 0 was observed for the p 1 sorbent characterised by a large adsorption of metal ions the lowest values of ca2 ion concentration and the l cа q m molar ratio of 0 91 were obtained for the system containing the m 1 sorbent according to the content of phosphate ions in the filtrate between samples i 0 and m 1 there was no large spread for either of the sorbent concentrations at the maximum dose of sorbents the concentration of phosphate ions did not exceed 0 047 mmol l 1 and the molar ratio l p q m was 0 009 fig 6c for the p 1 sample the phosphorus concentration increased with the sorbent dose and at the maximum sorbent dose reached 0 56 mmol l 1 l p q m 0 107 this increase in the concentration of phosphorus in the filtrate may be due to the higher solubility of this sample which contributes to the higher adsorption capacity of this sample as well as the transition to a solution of the crystallisation inhibitor hedp this explains the lower ph of the solution after adsorption as shown by the data on the change in the concentration of ca2 and po4 3 ions in the adsorption process with an increase in the contact time of sorbents with the solution the number of absorbed ions simultaneously increased this correlated well with the increase of ca2 ion concentration in the solution and the molar ratio ca m fig 6e in general all sorbents showed similar changes in the content of ca2 ions in the solution at a higher concentration of ca2 ions in the system with the sorbent p 1 and the smallest with the sorbent m 1 the change in the concentration of po4 3 ions sorbent p 1 was significantly different from sorbents i 0 and m 1 according to the data shown in fig 6f in the first case there was an abrupt increase in the concentration of phosphorus for 6 h reaching a maximum concentration c e of 0 66 mmol l 1 and then gradually decreasing to 0 55 mmol l 1 for sorbents i 0 and m 1 at the initial stage during the first 5 min as a result of the dissolution processes a rapid transition of po4 3 ions into the solution occurred then at 15 min of contact a minimum concentration was observed which then increased and plateaued during the whole period the concentration of phosphate ions in the adsorption sample i 0 ranged from 0 008 0 055 mmol l 1and adsorption at m 1 in a slightly smaller range of 0 008 0 042 mmol l 1 the molar ratio l p q m changes were indicated for a much smaller amount of po4 3 ions in the solution at a high ph of the solution and a relatively low concentration of toxic metal ions data on the effect of sorbent concentrations showed that the adsorption of fe3 pb2 zn2 and cu2 ions for all sorbents exhibited approximately the same efficiency while in respect of ions co2 and ni2 the more effective sorbent was m 1 for which the maximum removal efficiency was 76 and 60 respectively the lowest removal efficiency was obtained using the sorbent p 1 67 and 49 respectively although this sorbent showed high efficiency with respect to cd2 ions however the study of the adsorption kinetics of metal ions from the multicationic solution showed the significant advantage of the p 1 sample obtained with the use of hedp as a crystallisation inhibitor and the selectivity of different metal ions adsorption was more reliable and arranged in the sequence 7 the data on the release of ca2 ions and po4 3 ions into solution was accompanied with the adsorption of toxic metal ions it is indicated that the relationship of the sorbent structure with its adsorption properties and interaction mechanism allows us to conclude that the advantage of the p 1 sample is due to the higher solubility of the amorphous sample thus the greatest mobility of ca2 ions and po4 3 ions and a more developed porous structure had a positive effect on kinetic characteristics the features of changes in the ph of solutions and the content of ca2 ions for the m 1 sample in a series of experiments with different sorbent concentrations may be due to the presence in the ha structure of hydrophosphate groups hpo4 2 characteristic of ca deficient ha with a molar ratio of ca p 1 67 as a result there was a decrease in ph solution as in the case of the p 1 sample and lower values of the l cа q m molar ratio so ca2 ions and h participated in the exchange reaction the values of the molar ratio l ca q m were close to 1 0 which indicated that all samples regardless of their characteristics under conditions of low concentration of divalent metal ions reacted according to the following exchange reaction 11 11 ca10 po4 6 oh 2 xm2 ca10 x m x po4 6 oh 2 xca2 the analysis of the data for adsorption of toxic metal ions from multicomponent solution by ha samples synthesised with the use of crystallisation inhibitors showed that the achieved residual concentration of ions pb2 zn2 and cu2 was below the maximum concentration limit mcl and for fe3 ions was almost equal to zero table 6 the concentration of sorbents was much lower than that of widely used natural sorbents 2 8 11 4 conclusions it was shown that the adsorption characteristics of the ha synthesised in the presence of low doses of crystallisation inhibitors in the processes of cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 zn2 ions adsorption was significantly improved due to their lower degree of crystallinity and well developed porous structure it was established that almost complete adsorption of cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 zn2 ions occurred within 6 h at the dose of sorbent 5 0 10 0 gl 1 the adsorption capacity of the samples of ha in relation to the ions cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 zn2 with their simultaneous presence in the solution with the content of individual components varied from 0 13 to 1 28 mmol g 1 or a total of about 6 mmol g 1 the adsorption of metal ions from a multicomponent solution was described by a pseudo second order equation which indicated a heterogeneous chemical reaction between the sorbent and ions in the solution the highest adsorption for co2 and ni2 ions was observed for ha obtained in the presence of mg2 that was characterised by a bet of 123 127 m2 g 1 and a pore diameter of 12 nm ha prepared with hepd had a pore volume of 0 516 0 735 cm3 g 1 an average pore diameter of 28 29 nm and showed the highest efficiency towards cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 zn2 ions declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this work was financially supported by state research programme grant 1 05 
14284,hydroxyapatite ha is a well known and widely used efficient adsorbent for toxic metal ion and radionuclide removal from wastewater however the relationship between the structural parameters of ha and its adsorption characteristics capacity selectivity kinetic parameters requires in depth study in this study ha with different crystalline and porous structures was obtained using crystallisation inhibitors of different natures and their adsorption properties in a multicomponent solution cd2 co2 cu2 fe3 ni2 pb2 and zn2 was investigated using low doses of inhibitors mg2 ions and hydroxyethylenediphosphonic acid had a positive effect on ha adsorption characteristics due to their low degree of crystallinity amorphous calcium phosphate and a well developed porous structure abet up to 200 240 m2 g 1 the adsorption capacity of the ha samples in relation to the cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 zn2 ions and their simultaneous presence in the solution varied from 0 13 to 1 28 mmol g 1 the achieved residual concentration of pb2 zn2 and cu2 ions was below the maximum concentration limit and the ions of fe3 were almost equal to zero the highest adsorption of co2 and ni2 ions was observed for ha obtained in the presence of mg2 ha prepared with hepd has been shown to have the highest efficiency towards cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 zn2 ions the adsorption kinetic data fitted well with the pseudo second order model it was shown that depending on the composition and structural characteristics of the prepared ha ion exchange and dissolution precipitation were the two main mechanisms in their interaction with metal ions keywords hydroxyapatite adsorption mechanism metal ions crystallisation inhibitors water treatment 1 introduction the high requirements for the quality of wastewater containing toxic metal ions produced in various fields of industry demand the intensive study of all available methods of their purification 1 4 inorganic sorbents currently play an important role in environmental problem solving as efficient and cost effective materials in recent years this has been evidenced by numerous studies and in depth review articles devoted to the comparative analysis of different sorbents 5 6 including titanosilicates 7 natural and synthetic zeolites 8 and low cost natural biosorbents activated charcoal 9 13 and nanostructured carbon derives 5 6 14 special attention has been paid to the low cost sorbents obtained from industrial and agricultural waste 9 11 12 15 each sorbent has its advantages disadvantages and limitations 2 2 3 4 6 11 the development of adsorption technologies is aimed at increasing the selectivity of sorbents and increasing their adsorption capacity in a wide ph range the initial concentrations of cations the presence of background cations and anions as well as organic impurities calcium and calcium magnesium phosphates have extremely high potential as sorbents of heavy metals being non toxic and environmentally friendly materials 16 19 most works are devoted to the study of synthetic 19 24 and natural apatites both of mineral origin 24 26 and biogenic bio coal bone meal 13 24 obtained from renewable raw materials literature presents the results of studies on the treatment of real wastewater 13 and soil 19 which showed high efficiency in heavy metal removal by bone meal and hydroxyapatite ha the peculiarity of calcium phosphates in particular ha is the possibility of varying the physical and chemical characteristics including the porous structure and chemical composition by changing the method and conditions of synthesis as was shown in 22 23 the adsorption characteristics depend on various parameters it was therefore shown that a decrease in the degree of ha crystallinity and in the size of crystallites leading to an increase in the specific surface area increased the adsorption of toxic metal ions pb2 zn2 cd2 the molar ratio ca p which for stoichiometric ha is 1 67 changes and in the presence of replacement of ca2 by h ions can therefore decrease to 1 38 23 27 in this case ha or so called calcium deficiency ha is characterised by greater solubility which leads to an increase in the adsorption capacity of sorbents even in the presence of a salt background 27 tertiary calcium phosphate with a stoichiometric ratio of ca p 1 5 and amorphous structure shows the highest efficiency towards heavy metal ions 28 29 the control of adsorption characteristics could be performed by varying such parameters of ha synthesis as temperature concentration of the initial reagents and deposition rate as well as using crystallization inhibitors 22 23 previously various organic ligands 30 31 polymers 32 and metal ions 33 38 were studied as crystallisation inhibitors for medical purposes comparative studies of a number of organic inhibitors have shown that polyacrylic acid slows down the formation of ha crystals to the greatest extent and citric acid to the least extent 30 phosphonic acids characterised by the content of one or more groups of capo oh 2 30 39 also showed a strong inhibitory effect the use of phosphonic and diphosphonic acids in the synthesis of bioceramics in an amount of up to 30 wt of the total phosphorus content for the functionalisation of ha contributes to the formation of a fine crystalline phase with a developed porous structure 40 42 this modification also increases the absorption efficiency of pb2 ions 43 modification of the surface of calcium phosphates can also be carried out by adsorption of phosphonates per ha from the solution as a result of which the material can be used for drug delivery 44 or as a selective sorbent for the extraction of heavy metal ions 45 this is due to the fact that phosphonates form strong complexes with transition metal ions as well as ca2 and mg2 ions 46 the effect of hepd used as a crystallisation inhibitor on the sorption of heavy metal ions has not been considered in literature the effect of metal cations such as mg2 sr2 zn2 cu2 is mainly to reduce the crystallinity of the ha as shown by previous studies most show the strong influence of the ions zn2 and cu2 35 36 while the presence of mn2 ions leads to the formation of the amorphous phase 36 the influence of mg2 ions which are among the main substituents of ca2 ions in bone tissue and play an important role in biological processes 33 34 36 38 has been studied in particular detail detailed studies of the adsorption selectivity and the mechanism of different composition ha interaction with a large number of heavy and non ferrous metal ions were carried out but usually such studies are performed from single or bi component solutions cd2 and zn2 47 cu2 and zn2 48 co2 and sr2 49 the available data on the interaction of ha simultaneously with various cations indicate their high efficiency 13 21 24 26 50 51 such studies are of great practical interest since the composition of natural water sources and real wastewater is usually represented by a set of multivalent ions at various ratios 13 52 the aim of this work was to study the efficiency of toxic metal ion adsorption from a multicomponent solution by sorbents based on ha of varying degrees of crystallinity and porous structure which was controlled by the use of crystallisation inhibitors of organic hepd and inorganic mg2 ions natures in addition to the above features of these substances they are practically harmless for the environment and do not lead to contamination of the cleaned solutions with harmful by products 53 the choice of these substances is also justified by the fact that mg2 and hedp ions are not the strongest inhibitors among similar compounds 36 39 since the aim of the work is not to prevent the formation of ha but the formation of a weakly crystallised structure in addition hedp as the well known member of diphosphonates was used as the reference standard for studies of the other diphosphonates with its own potency value set to one 53 the study of adsorption processes was carried out using a model multi metal solution containing cd2 co2 cu2 fe3 ni2 pb2 and zn2 ions which are most widely used in various technological processes and are therefore often found in real wastewater the sorbent concentration in the purified solution sorbent dose and the duration of purification were chosen as varied parameters the novelty of this work is to establish the relationship between the structural parameters of ha and its adsorption characteristics capacity selectivity kinetic parameters in relation to the ions of toxic metals 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of adsorbents hydroxyapatite adsorbents were prepared by chemical precipitation from ca no3 2 4h2o and h3po4 solutions and nh4oh to maintain ph 10 at room temperature the concentration of ca2 cations in the reaction solution after mixing was 0 083 m and anions po4 3 of 0 05 m these conditions of ha synthesis were different to the conditions under which the processes of medical ha crystallisation were studied temperature of 37 c ph 7 4 reagent concentration of 1 mmol l 1 30 all reagents were purchased by sigma aldrich and used

was kept under the mother liquor for 24 h without stirring for maturation the precipitate separated on the buchner funnel was washed with hot water and ethanol sample i 0 the synthesis of samples in the presence of crystallisation inhibitors was carried out in a similar way mg no3 2 additive was introduced into ca containing solution at a rate of 1 0 mol relative to ca2 ions sample m 1 the addition of hepd was introduced into the h3po4 solution at a rate of 1 0 mol relative to po4 3 ions sample p 1 the wet sludge was first dried in air at room temperature then at 100 c for 24 h to study the physical chemical properties the dried samples were ground and the fraction of 125 250 μm was sieved 2 2 characterisation techniques x ray phase analysis xrd was performed on the d8 advanced x ray diffractometer bruker germany using cukα radiation the content of ca2 in the synthesised samples was determined by the reverse titration method with trilon b and znso4solutions and the phosphorus

adsorption was controlled by a ph meter 340i 0 02 2 3 2 batch method the adsorption experiment was carried out by batch method at room temperature the sorbent sample was filled with 20 ml of the model solution and left for a certain time with constant shaking by a st 15 shaker cat m zipperer gmbh staufen germany then the solution was filtered using a polypropylene filter 0 45 μm to determine the optimal sorbent concentration the weight of the sorbent sample varied from 0 0100 to 0 2000 g with a constant volume of the purified solution equal to 20 ml accordingly the sorbent concentration in the solution varied in the range of 0 5 to 10 g l 1 the contact time of the sorbent with the solution was 24 h studies on the effect of contact time on the adsorption of metal ions was performed by varying the duration of interaction from 0 5 to 48 h a portion of the sorbent 0 1000 0 0001 g was placed in a plastic test tube filled with 10 ml of the model solution and shaken at 250 rpm the

pseudo first and the pseudo second order rate constants 3 results 3 1 sorbent characterization as shown by the study of the composition and properties of the synthesised ha samples the use of crystallisation inhibitors of different natures even with a small number of them leads to a change in the chemical composition crystal and structural characteristics fig 1 table 2 thus with the introduction of 1 mg2 ions the specific surface area of the obtained crystalline ha increased from 72 75 to 123 127 m2 g 1 the growth of the specific surface area was accompanied by a corresponding increase in pore volume from 0 233 0 242 to 0 375 0 367 cm3 g 1 with the average pore size practically unchanged the increase in the specific surface area apparently due to the decrease in the size of crystallites was due to the inhibitory effect of mg2 ions according to modern concepts the process of ha crystallisation is an extremely complex process consisting of five stages 1 the formation of ion clusters and amorphous calcium phosphate acp 2 the stabilisation of acp 3 the transition of acp to ha through dissolution and crystallisation 4 crystal growth 5 ha aging under conditions close to equilibrium 33 the mechanism of action of mg2 ions on ha crystallisation is that adsorbed on the surface of the formed primary particles of acp they prevent the further growth of these particles and the formation of the crystal structure thereby reducing the size of the crystallites and the degree of their crystallinity 33 in the synthesis in the presence of the additive hedp a weakly crystallised phase was formed characterised by a smaller specific surface area but a large volume of pores and their average size features of the formation of such a phase are explained by the presence of hedp molecules which capturing several ca2 ions prevent the crystallisation of ha and form elaborate complexes resulting in the growth of primary particles 30 a similar effect was observed for the hedp modifying of the ha surface 45 the action of crystallisation inhibitors was accompanied by corresponding changes in the chemical composition of the formed products according to the chemical analysis ha samples synthesised without inhibitors are close to the stoichiometric composition with a molar ratio of ca p 1 667 table 2 the use of mg2 ions as a crystallisation inhibitor leads to a slight decrease in the molar ratio of ca p to 1 63 hedp had a more significant impact on the chemical composition of ha the molar ratio of ca p of the phase formed in the presence of hedp was 1 56 which practically corresponds to tricalcium phosphate and thus confirms the xrd data 3 2 adsorption studies 3 2 1 dose of sorbents according to the data presented in fig 2 a c the removal efficiency of cations increased with an increase in the concentration of the sorbent at a dose of 5 0 g l 1 the removal efficiency of cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 and zn2 ions was 87 100 and at a maximum dose of 10 0 g l 1 sorbents regardless of their composition for almost all cations reached 100 this phenomenon could be explained by an increased number of active sites for adsorption as shown in 54 exceptions were fe3 ni2 and co2 ions despite the rather high concentration of fe3 ions the removal efficiency of these ions reached 100 at a minimum dose of sorbents 0 5 g l 1 for sorbent p 1 and 1 0 g l 1 for sorbents i 0 and m 1 the adsorption of ni2 and co2 ions on the other hand was minimal at all doses by all sorbents the maximum degree of purification from these ions was obtained using the m 1 sorbent at 76 and 60 respectively a comparison of sorbents among themselves shows that the fe3 pb2 zn2 and cu2 ions adsorptions differed from each other a marked difference can be traced to the adsorption of ions cd2 ni2 and co2 thus the minimum residual concentration of cd2 ions was obtained by adsorption with samples synthesised using crystallisation inhibitors especially p 1 and ni2 and co2 ions with the m 1 sample 3 2 2 the study of metal ion adsorption in time curves of changes in the removal efficiency of toxic metal ions during interaction with sorbents are shown in fig 3 all sorbents were characterised by a rapid increase in the removal efficiency of cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 and zn2 ions at the initial section of the curves corresponding to 5 15 min during adsorption of fe3 ions 60 min pb2 ions and 3 6 h for other ions then the curves went plateaued out which indicates the achievement of equilibrium first the equilibrium of fe3 and pb2 ions was established in the case of sorbent p 1 the equilibrium value for these ions was achieved in 5 min and 3 h respectively and sorbents i 0 and m 1 in 15 min and 6 h for cd2 cu2 and zn2 ions for all sorbents equilibrium was reached within 24 h when comparing the magnitude of the sorbents the adsorption capacity of these five ions in the first 60 min clearly shows the advantage of the sorbent p 1 fig 4 according to the efficiency of ion removal sorbents can be arranged in a series of p 1 m 1 i 0 for ni2 and co2 ion adsorption a different relationship was observed as can be seen from fig 3 ni2 and co2 ion equilibrium was achieved within 48 h of contact while in 24 h the ni2 ion recovery rate relative to the equilibrium value was 90 5 for the sorbent i 0 94 5 for p 1 and 96 7 for m 1 as the most active in relation to these ions for co2 ions the equilibrium was somewhat better so the value of removal efficiency at 24 h by the same sorbents reaches 92 8 97 7 and 98 0 of the equilibrium values respectively according to the efficiency of ni2 and co2 ions adsorption sorbents could be arranged in series of m 1 i 0 p 1 fig 4 3 2 3 kinetics models the obtained data on the adsorption capacity depending on the contact time were calculated using the pseudo first and pseudo second order equations fig 5 tables 3 and 4 data on the adsorption of fe3 ions could not be short circuited due to the rapid achievement of the equilibrium state at their available concentration in the initial solutions according to the calculation results table 3 when using the pseudo first order model for the processes of adsorption of pb2 co2 and ni2 ions low r 2 values and a large difference between q exp and q 1 values were obtained this indicates that these processes cannot be described by the pseudo first order equation the results on the adsorption of another group of ions cu2 cd2 and zn2 were characterised by higher values of r2 and a slight discrepancy between the values of qexp and q1 which suggests a different mechanism of interaction between ha samples and metal ions as calculations have shown the equation of pseudo second order table 4 describes the experimental data fairly accurately this model can be most reliably applied to the adsorption of pb2 cu2 cd2 and zn2 ions for which the coefficients r2 with all sorbents are almost 1 0 at the same time according to the results it was possible to trace the adsorption selectivity of various ions and analyse the advantages of sorbents comparison of the obtained values of the initial velocity h for different ions shows that all three sorbents had the highest adsorption rate of pb2 ions and the lowest for co2 as the initial velocity decreased the metal ions could be arranged in the following sequence 7 h pb h cu h cd h ni h zn h co according to the rate constant of different cations the sorbents had some differences thus in the interaction of ions with the sorbent obtained without inhibitors the constants could be arranged in the following sequence 8 k2 zn k2 pb k2 co k2 cu k2 cd k2 ni for sorbents m 1 and p 1 rate constants were formed in other sequences 9 and 10 respectively 9 k2 pb k2 zn k2 co k2 cu k2 cd k2 ni 10 k2 pb k2 zn k2 co k2 cu k2 ni k2 cd according to these series the sorbents obtained with inhibitors had the highest rate constant for pb2 ions adsorption and the lowest for m 1 while interacting with ni2 ions as in sorbent i 0 and with cd2 ions for p 1 comparison of sorbents between themselves shows that sample p 1 was allocated the highest values of the parameters k2 and h and the highest adsorption capacity of pb2 ions it was not possible to compare sorbents according to the equilibrium adsorption capacity since at a given concentration of metal ions during equilibrium the removal efficiency of metal ions reached 100 only in relation to ni2 ions was it the most prominent advantage of the sorbent m 1 sorbents i 0 and m 1 differed from each other in these parameters although some advantage in respect of pb2 cu2 cd2 and zn2 ions was manifested in sorbent m 1 and in respect of ni2 and co2 ions for i 0 all the revealed differences can be caused by the peculiarities of the chemical composition of sorbents their morphology and accordingly physical and chemical properties 3 3 mechanism of adsorption to study the features of sorbent interaction depending on the composition and physical chemical properties the ph measurement of filtrates was carried out and the content of cа2 and po4 3 ion leaching into the solution was determined fig 6 the change in ph according to the sorbent dose fig 6a and during adsorption fig 6d reflected the difference between the sorbents thus the sorbent obtained without the use of crystallisation inhibitors in the process of interaction with toxic metal ions in the solution had more alkaline properties resulting in an increase in the dose of the sorbent ph from 3 to 4 0 4 6 the sorbent obtained with the addition of hedp on the other hand had more acidic properties so there was a minimum increase in ph to 3 9 the behaviour of sorbent m 1 at low doses in solution 0 5 2 5 g l 1 was similar to the sorbent p 1 and at high doses 5 0 10 0 g l 1 sorbent i 0 the similarity of the behaviour of the sorbents i 0 and m 1 in the solution was confirmed by the graphs of the variation of ph during adsorption fig 6d by the time equilibrium was reached for the adsorption of most ions during the first 6 h fig 3 the ph of the filtrates had increased to 4 5 and 4 6 for i 0 and m 1 respectively at equilibrium ph was 4 8 in the case of the p 1 sample the equilibrium ph approached 4 0 the changes in the acid base composition of the solutions were in good agreement with the data on the number of cа2 and po4 3 ions transferred to the solution according to the results of the analysis the transition to a solution of ca2 ions accompanying the adsorption of toxic metal ions decreased as the sorbent dose increased and the molar ratio l cа q m increased and at a dose of 5 g l 1 reached a constant value close to one table 5 fig 6b at the same time a more intense leaching of ca2 ions into the solution and the highest l cа q m value of 1 0 was observed for the p 1 sorbent characterised by a large adsorption of metal ions the lowest values of ca2 ion concentration and the l cа q m molar ratio of 0 91 were obtained for the system containing the m 1 sorbent according to the content of phosphate ions in the filtrate between samples i 0 and m 1 there was no large spread for either of the sorbent concentrations at the maximum dose of sorbents the concentration of phosphate ions did not exceed 0 047 mmol l 1 and the molar ratio l p q m was 0 009 fig 6c for the p 1 sample the phosphorus concentration increased with the sorbent dose and at the maximum sorbent dose reached 0 56 mmol l 1 l p q m 0 107 this increase in the concentration of phosphorus in the filtrate may be due to the higher solubility of this sample which contributes to the higher adsorption capacity of this sample as well as the transition to a solution of the crystallisation inhibitor hedp this explains the lower ph of the solution after adsorption as shown by the data on the change in the concentration of ca2 and po4 3 ions in the adsorption process with an increase in the contact time of sorbents with the solution the number of absorbed ions simultaneously increased this correlated well with the increase of ca2 ion concentration in the solution and the molar ratio ca m fig 6e in general all sorbents showed similar changes in the content of ca2 ions in the solution at a higher concentration of ca2 ions in the system with the sorbent p 1 and the smallest with the sorbent m 1 the change in the concentration of po4 3 ions sorbent p 1 was significantly different from sorbents i 0 and m 1 according to the data shown in fig 6f in the first case there was an abrupt increase in the concentration of phosphorus for 6 h reaching a maximum concentration c e of 0 66 mmol l 1 and then gradually decreasing to 0 55 mmol l 1 for sorbents i 0 and m 1 at the initial stage during the first 5 min as a result of the dissolution processes a rapid transition of po4 3 ions into the solution occurred then at 15 min of contact a minimum concentration was observed which then increased and plateaued during the whole period the concentration of phosphate ions in the adsorption sample i 0 ranged from 0 008 0 055 mmol l 1and adsorption at m 1 in a slightly smaller range of 0 008 0 042 mmol l 1 the molar ratio l p q m changes were indicated for a much smaller amount of po4 3 ions in the solution at a high ph of the solution and a relatively low concentration of toxic metal ions data on the effect of sorbent concentrations showed that the adsorption of fe3 pb2 zn2 and cu2 ions for all sorbents exhibited approximately the same efficiency while in respect of ions co2 and ni2 the more effective sorbent was m 1 for which the maximum removal efficiency was 76 and 60 respectively the lowest removal efficiency was obtained using the sorbent p 1 67 and 49 respectively although this sorbent showed high efficiency with respect to cd2 ions however the study of the adsorption kinetics of metal ions from the multicationic solution showed the significant advantage of the p 1 sample obtained with the use of hedp as a crystallisation inhibitor and the selectivity of different metal ions adsorption was more reliable and arranged in the sequence 7 the data on the release of ca2 ions and po4 3 ions into solution was accompanied with the adsorption of toxic metal ions it is indicated that the relationship of the sorbent structure with its adsorption properties and interaction mechanism allows us to conclude that the advantage of the p 1 sample is due to the higher solubility of the amorphous sample thus the greatest mobility of ca2 ions and po4 3 ions and a more developed porous structure had a positive effect on kinetic characteristics the features of changes in the ph of solutions and the content of ca2 ions for the m 1 sample in a series of experiments with different sorbent concentrations may be due to the presence in the ha structure of hydrophosphate groups hpo4 2 characteristic of ca deficient ha with a molar ratio of ca p 1 67 as a result there was a decrease in ph solution as in the case of the p 1 sample and lower values of the l cа q m molar ratio so ca2 ions and h participated in the exchange reaction the values of the molar ratio l ca q m were close to 1 0 which indicated that all samples regardless of their characteristics under conditions of low concentration of divalent metal ions reacted according to the following exchange reaction 11 11 ca10 po4 6 oh 2 xm2 ca10 x m x po4 6 oh 2 xca2 the analysis of the data for adsorption of toxic metal ions from multicomponent solution by ha samples synthesised with the use of crystallisation inhibitors showed that the achieved residual concentration of ions pb2 zn2 and cu2 was below the maximum concentration limit mcl and for fe3 ions was almost equal to zero table 6 the concentration of sorbents was much lower than that of widely used natural sorbents 2 8 11 4 conclusions it was shown that the adsorption characteristics of the ha synthesised in the presence of low doses of crystallisation inhibitors in the processes of cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 zn2 ions adsorption was significantly improved due to their lower degree of crystallinity and well developed porous structure it was established that almost complete adsorption of cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 zn2 ions occurred within 6 h at the dose of sorbent 5 0 10 0 gl 1 the adsorption capacity of the samples of ha in relation to the ions cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 zn2 with their simultaneous presence in the solution with the content of individual components varied from 0 13 to 1 28 mmol g 1 or a total of about 6 mmol g 1 the adsorption of metal ions from a multicomponent solution was described by a pseudo second order equation which indicated a heterogeneous chemical reaction between the sorbent and ions in the solution the highest adsorption for co2 and ni2 ions was observed for ha obtained in the presence of mg2 that was characterised by a bet of 123 127 m2 g 1 and a pore diameter of 12 nm ha prepared with hepd had a pore volume of 0 516 0 735 cm3 g 1 an average pore diameter of 28 29 nm and showed the highest efficiency towards cd2 cu2 fe3 pb2 zn2 ions declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this work was financially supported by state research programme grant 1 05
