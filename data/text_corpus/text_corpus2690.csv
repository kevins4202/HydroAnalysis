to the traditional separation processes in the recovery of different nutritional and therapeutic proteins from wastewater streams of pharmaceutical biochemical and food industries 1 pressure driven membrane systems pdms in specific have gained considerable attention in this regard 2 however the projected growth of pdms in protein recovery was majorly hindered because of the two well known non idealities namely concentration polarization cp and membrane fouling 3 cp refers to the reversible accumulation of solutes on the membrane surface whereas solute adsorption and subsequent pore blocking are known as fouling fouling leads to irreversible loss of permeability an elevated level of cp has been reported to increase the membrane fouling 4 those two non idealities are primarily responsible for the transient flux decline observed from the very beginning of filtration 5 consequently the flux levels off to a quasi steady value towards the terminal stages of filtration flux can only be recovered through cleaning operation of which chemical cleaning is most commonly practiced 6 therefore all membrane based water treatment units sequentially operate in filtration and cleaning modes frequent cleaning on the other hand alters the permeation property and often results in a drastic reduction of the service life 7 several remedial techniques were proposed over the years which are generally classified into four major categories i boundary layer manipulation this is commonly accomplished either upon insertion of the static turbulent promoter s or by feed flow rate independent shear enhancement at the membrane surface e g the dse modules 8 ii upstream techniques like pretreatment of feed 9 iii modification of the membrane surface properties 10 and iv external perturbations e g backpulsing backflushing backwashing pulsatile flow gas sparging use of electric field or ultrasound etc 11 12 the idea of shear enhancement at the membrane surface and disruption of the polarized layer was first implemented in much earlier cross flow cf systems 13 in cf modules the membrane shear stress can be largely increased upon increasing the feed flow rate nevertheless the transmembrane pressure tmp eventually decreases along the direction of feed flow which results in a non optimal use of the membrane surface 14 increased feed flow rate also increases the pumping cost the idea of dynamic shear enhancement was introduced to decouple the membrane shear stress from the feed flow rate according to this strategy shear was made independent of the feed rate by introducing a rotating or a reciprocating accessory for example a primitive dead end module may be converted to a dse filtration system upon placing a high speed stirrer close to the membrane 15 flux was reported to increase in this upgraded design known as single stirred cell compared to its unstirred counterpart 16 the increasing need of processing heavy fouling feedstocks e g concentrated protein or polymer solutions oil water emulsions industrial effluents etc has promoted the innovation scale up and commercialization of different dse modules since the 1970s some of the standard designs include rotating disk rd rotating disk membrane rdm multi shaft disk msd and vibratory shear enhanced processing vsep units 17 a large number of performance characterization and hydrodynamic studies of several dse modules with a wide range of feed and process conditions have been reported over the last two decades 18 a comprehensive review of their performances in the treatment of various industrial and synthetic feedstocks comparative analysis shear production capacities and energy usage profiles has been presented by jaffrin 19 a different group of dse modules with an online cleaning facility was propped nearly a decade ago 20 21 of which the sbm unit was the baseline design the module was tested in ultrafiltration uf of polyethylene glycol polyvinyl alcohol and bovine serum albumin for all feedstocks the maximum flux decline was restricted within 10 even after three to five hours of continuous filtration 22 very recently the upgraded design referred as the intermeshed spinning basket membrane isbm module has also been reported 23 literature review on dse modules indicates a plethora of performance characterization studies some of the investigations were also based on hydrodynamic simulation nevertheless majorly based on the standard cfd packages very few attempts were made to formulate a mathematical model primarily owing to the complex hydrodynamic environment that generally prevails in any dse module the models mainly deal with the baseline designs such as rd or rdm recently a first of its kind but exceedingly simplified formulation is reported for the sbm filtration device 24 a brief review of those models is presented as follows one of the early models of rd unit was proposed by holechovsky and cooney 25 one dimensional convection diffusion equation with variable diffusivity term was solved to obtain the system specific mass transfer correlation the dynamic feature of shear enhancement was established in terms of axial velocity independent mass transfer coefficient as the specific velocity component according to its definition was directly proportional to the feed flow rate the formulation was grossly empirical indeed because it incorporates the experimental mass transfer correlation since then several models of rd and rdm were proposed bhattacharjee and dutta partially resolved the problem of empiricism associated with the mass transfer coefficient they have introduced the concept of back transport flux to account for the effects of shear enhancement the back transport flux was semi empirically considered to be proportional to the rotational speed of the stirrer 26 a more realistic one parameter model based on the similar idea was later proposed by sarkar et al 27 the model was further extended to simulate the rdm filtration systems 28 alternative to the analytical studies different numerical models are also available for rd and rdm pilots very recently an elegant numerical model of a rotodynamic i e equivalent to rd module ro filtration system has been proposed by uppu et al 29 different specific purpose subroutines were incorporated in a commercial cfd package to simulate the complex hydrodynamic picture correctly the simulated velocity field confirmed the presence of helical pathlines which was rightly envisaged earlier by sarkar et al 27 it is imperative to note that modeling studies of dse units are majorly limited to simple and baseline designs i e rd and rdm modules only only an elementary two parameter steady state model of the sbm system has been recently proposed 24 the formulation was based on lubrication theory osmotic pressure model and thermodynamic black box model of membrane transport due to spiegler and kedem the approach circumvented the solution of the fundamental convection diffusion equation additionally the physical picture of the cleaning run remained completely unexplored spinning basket filtration systems i e sbm and isbm units are pretty effective in the treatment of heavy fouling feed solutions 20 23 the modules are also capable of intermittent flux regeneration using their inbuilt physical cleaning facility furthermore both sbm and isbm filtration units have been established to be techno economically suitable specifically for protein recovery compared to other dse systems 22 23 accordingly a thorough understanding of their mass transfer picture is necessary beyond the mere performance characterization and elementary cfd simulation for appropriate scale up a modeling attempt from the perspective of the fundamental convection diffusion archetype is therefore necessary to be explored additionally the basic physics of the physical cleaning mechanism must be understood from a quantitative point of view for further improvement and upgradation in this article we have presented a two parameter unsteady state analytical model of the sbm pilot which can simulate the device operating in repeated filtration and cleaning modes in sequence the transient two dimensional convection diffusion equation was solved to obtain the protein concentration profile under the time varying boundary condition at the membrane surface a functional form f j c m c p t 0 j flux c m c p membrane surface and permeate concentrations of protein t time derived thereof was incorporated with two other constitutive equations arising from osmotic pressure and spiegler kedem black box models the governing system equations were simultaneously solved to simulate the device in filtration mode on the other hand a lumped parameter cleaning model was formulated in terms of c m a force balance between the dislodging mechanical draft on the deposited solute layer due to reversed directional basket spinning the flow induced lift force and the solute solute dlvo interactions was considered to formulate the cleaning rate the model has been validated with the experimental profiles of j and c p obtained in ultrafiltration of protein bearing synthetic wastewater i e an aqueous solution of bsa conducted in a standard sbm pilot 2 experimental 2 1 materials and analytical techniques reagent grade 99 pure igg endotoxin and fatty acid free bsa of average molecular weight 66 kda was procured from srl india the synthetic wastewater feedstock was prepared upon dissolving bsa powder in the tris buffer the buffer was prepared upon mixing 151 14 g of tris base per 1000 ml of deionized water 30 the ph was adjusted around the neural range i e 7 0 7 3 additionally 0 012 w sodium azide was also added to prevent bacterial growth asymmetric semi permeable moist polyether sulphone pes membranes with 50 kda molecular weight cut off mwco were procured from the koch membrane system usa the rectangular flat sheet 1 0 1 0 m2 membranes have the following operating ranges ph 2 5 10 5 pressure kpa 100 830 and temperature c 5 54 coomassie brilliant blue dye based bradford assay was used to measure the protein concentration in feed retentate and permeate streams 31 for this purpose a dual beam hitachi uv vis spectrophotometer model u 2800 was employed 2 2 filtration pilot the bench scale sbm module consists of a hollow spinning basket with four flat radial arms which is placed within a cylindrical casing with a narrow clearance 6 mm the basket is mounted on a hollow shaft four flat sheet membranes effective are 0 05 0 01 m2 are fitted on the alternate side of all radial arms naturally the permeate flows out of the basket through the shaft s central aperture schematics of the sbm pilot and the whole filtration bench are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively a photograph of the spinning basket is also included as an insert of fig 1 a during the filtration run the basket was rotated with the membrane bearing sides being the leading faces thus for the present design the direction of spinning during the filtration run is counterclockwise fig 1 a basket spinning was accomplished by a three phase induction motor which transmitted the power through a belt pulley drive a triplex piston pump delivered the synthetic wastewater to the unit tmp was adjusted upon operating two needle valves fitted in retentate and bypass lines respectively once the three successive flux readings were close to each other the operation was switched to cleaning mode present cleaning protocol is purely based on hydrodynamic principles however it is characteristically different from conventional hydrodynamic techniques such as backpulsing backflushing or backwashing 11 tmp was primarily released at the beginning of all cleaning runs upon simultaneously adjusting the two needle valves the feed flow was kept unchanged this was followed by a reversed rotation of the basket i e in the clockwise direction for the present pilot a local vacuum was expected to set in over the membrane surface because the membranes were on the trailing faces of the rotating arms during such cleaning runs the permeate side pressure remained atmospheric therefore a hydrodynamic draft with per unit area magnitude in the order of local dynamic pressure was generated the draft acted in the direction of permeate to feed which was expected to partially dislodge the accumulated protein layer formed during the previous filtration run 2 3 design of experiment performance of the module was characterized by systematically varying the three process parameters namely i transmembrane pressure tmp ii feed concentration c 0 and iii rotational speed ω any one of the parameters was varied over the stipulated range while keeping the others constant corresponding ranges were tmp kgf cm 2 1 5 c 0 w o f b s a 1 4 and ω r a d s e c 1 10 47 41 9 in our previous report it has been shown that the filtration characteristics of the sbm pilot are nearly independent of the feed flow rate 23 thus a constant retentate flow rate 6 lpm was maintained in all filtration runs all cleaning runs were performed with the same rotational speed i e ω c ω as used in the corresponding filtration run however in opposite i e clockwise direction each cleaning operation was continued for 300 s after which the next filtration run was initiated all characterization experiments were continued for three successive filtration runs intervened by two cleaning operations 2 4 experimental procedure initially four flat sheer virgin membranes total area 0 06 0 11 m2 were fitted on the alternate faces of the four radial arms this was followed by membrane compaction at 6 0 kgf cm 2 compaction pressure was higher than the highest tmp used in the filtration runs 5 0 kgf cm 2 the module was then operated in filtration mode under fixed conditions of tmp c 0 and ω at the beginning of filtration the needle valves in the retentate and recycle lines were kept completely open once the feed starts flowing steadily through the module both the valves were adjusted to fix the tmp and flow rate at their desired values 10 cm3 of permeate was periodically collected to measure the flux permeate concentration was also determined from the same sample the retentate was continuously recirculated back to the feed tank therefore the concentration of the feed solution was continuously monitored and calculated amount of make up solution was periodically added feed tank ph was also measured continuously to adjust it around neutral ph 7 0 7 5 which was far from the isoelectric point of bsa ph 4 71 once the flux had reached its quasi steady state the module was switched to cleaning mode as discussed in section 3 2 no permeate was generated during cleaning as tmp was released for model testing and validation the filtration cleaning experiments were conducted under a varied set of parametric conditions i e tmp c 0 and ω permeate flux was noted to achieve the quasi steady state i e nearly identical flux readings for three successive measurements with an interval of 30 min each about 120 min of filtration as discussed later thus all filtration runs were simulated for 120 min on the other hand the cleaning run simulations were carried out for 300 s as all cleaning operations were conducted over the same duration the parametric conditions as used in the present simulation are described in table 1 3 model formulation primarily it is necessary to outline the objectives of the present model in the filtration mode variations of the flux j and the permeate concentration c p with time are to be principally simulated for a fixed set of parametric conditions i e tmp ω and c 0 as the two quantities could be experimentally measured the membrane surface concentration profile i e c m v s t was also predicted to initialize the next cleaning run nevertheless it is impossible to measure c m in the present setup for the first filtration run the initial condition was at t 0 c m c 0 c p 0 and j t m p σ π c o π 0 μ r m where σ is the osmotic reflection coefficient μ is the solvent viscosity r m is the hydrodynamic resistance of the membrane and π π c is the osmotic pressure expressed as a function of protein concentration we have used the well known osmotic pressure model to evaluate the flux 32 for the second and the third filtration runs the initial membrane surface and permeate concentrations were to be evaluated regarding permeate concentration all filtration runs were initialized as c p 0 however for c m it was necessary to simulate the previous cleaning run accordingly the objectives of the model formulation may be summarized as 1 to simulate the transient profiles of j c m and c p in the three successive filtration runs for an experiment conducted with a fixed set of parametric conditions i e tmp ω and c o 2 to simulate the transient profiles of c m during the two intermittent cleaning runs for the same experiment based on those objectives we have developed a complete process model for the filtration cleaning cycle of the sbm module the formulations are discussed in the following sections 3 1 filtration model the filtration model principally consists of the analytical solution of a simplified convection diffusion equation the concentration profile expression was further used to generate a time explicit functional relation between the three process variables i e f j c m c p t 0 the corresponding equation was simultaneously solved along with the equations arising from the osmotic pressure and the spiegler kedem black box models respectively 24 however formulation of the convection diffusion equation requires a thorough knowledge of the velocity field the hydrodynamic picture of the sbm pilot is expected to be complex because of the spinning basket placed inside the cylindrical casing with narrow clearance hydrodynamic complexity signatures were also demonstrated in the previous cfd simulation 22 presently we have again simulated the pilot using identical conditions as those of our earlier work the velocity field is presented in fig 2 a despite of the complex hydrodynamic environment the flow pattern near the basket may be greatly simplified considering a single loopy pathline as elaborated in the baseline model 24 the pathline was thought to be like a distorted envelope of the basket it is nearly parallel to the membrane surfaces as depicted in fig 2 b the simulated velocity profile and the simplified pathline collectively indicate a flat plate type boundary layer flow over the membrane surface a concentration boundary layer is also expected to grow from the leading edge of the membrane because of the continuous solute rejection and the polarization effect an appropriate coordinate system was introduced with its origin being fixed at the midpoint of the membrane s leading edge fig 2 c profiles of the hydrodynamic and concentration boundary layers are schematically depicted in fig 2 d the concentration boundary layer was assumed to be well within the laminar sublayer assumption 1 this is justified in terms of the large schmidt number sc owing to the extremely low diffusivity of bsa in water 10 10 m 2 s 1 33 the boundary layer thicknesses i e δ a n d δ c are functionally related to each other through the schmidt number as δ δ c s c 1 3 the expression of hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness δ in turbulent flow is quite well known as δ 0 0382 ν u 1 5 x 4 5 34 where u is the free stream velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity high reynolds number of the present system d b n b 2 ρ μ 6 10 6 w h e r e d b i s t h e m o d u l e d i a m e t e r a n d n b i s t h e r o t a t i o n a l s p e e d confirms the prevalence of turbulent regime therefore δ c a x 4 5 where a 0 0382 ν u 1 5 s c 1 3 considering assumption 1 the x component velocity within the concentration boundary layer may be expressed as u k y x 1 5 where k 0 0297 u 9 5 ν 4 5 34 here we have assumed the feed to be a newtonian fluid assumption 2 velocity component along y direction i e v close to the membrane surface may be expressed as v j expressions of u and v are incorporated in the general convection diffusion equation i e c t v c d 2 c 1 c t k y x 1 5 c x j c y d 2 c x 2 2 c y 2 associated initial and boundary conditions may be formulated as i ic at t 0 c c 0 for all x and y ii bc 1 at x 0 c c 0 for t 0 and for all y iii bc 2 at x l c x 0 for all y t 0 iv bc 3 at y 0 c c m for t 0 and for all x v bc 4 at y δ c c c 0 for t 0 and for all x no end effects c z 0 were considered to reduce the dimensionality of the convection diffusion equation assumption 3 the transience of c m has been temporarily neglected in bc 3 assuming pseudo steady state assumption 4 the flux was also considered to be pseudo steady similar to c m assumption 5 still it is impossible to obtain the analytical solution of eq 1 because of variable x component velocity we have further replaced the x component velocity i e u k y x 1 5 by its spatial average i e u over y 0 δ c and x 0 l respectively assumption 6 the respective expression becomes 2 u 1 δ c l 0 l 0 δ c k y x 1 5 d x d y 5 8 k δ c l 4 5 substitution of u by u in eq 1 results in a constant coefficient second order partial differential equation yet there exists the unknown free stream velocity u present in the expression of u free stream velocity can be approximately solved from the side wise volume flow rate between the basket arm tip and the cylindrical casing due to basket spinning q l from the expression of q l u maybe solved as 3 u 0 034 α ω r r b a s k e t c where r and l are the radius and height of the basket arm respectively the inner radius of the cylindrical casing is r b a s k e t fig 2 c the step wise calculation for u has been elaborated in supplementary section s 1 the empirical parameter α was introduced to effectively resolve the mean velocity through the side wise gap u into the free stream velocity u additionally it must incorporate the typical exit effects 35 α has been considered to be dependent on tmp ω and c 0 as the velocity field was found to be grossly dependent on the same set of parameters 22 the simplified form of the convection diffusion equation becomes 4 c t u c x j c y d 2 c x 2 2 c y 2 where u 0 0186 α u 9 5 ν 4 5 δ c l 4 5 δ c is the averaged concentration boundary layer thickness over x 0 l thus 5 δ c 1 l 0 l a x 4 5 d x 5 9 a l 4 5 eq 4 was first reshaped to a dimensionless form and subsequently solved to obtain the concentration field 6 c x y t c o c m c o u l 8 d e u l 2 d 1 e u x 2 d j y 2 d e y u 2 j 2 2 d 1 erf y 4 d t u 2 j 2 t 4 d e y u 2 j 2 2 d 1 e r f y 4 d t u 2 j 2 t 4 d the solution is detailed out in the supplementary section s 2 finally to develop the desired functional relation of the form f 1 j c m c p t 0 assumption 4 was invoked once again the assumption necessitates a perfect balance between the incoming and the outgoing solute fluxes at the membrane surface so 7 j c m c p d c y y 0 combining eqs 6 and 7 followed by further averaging of c y y 0 over x 0 l the functional relation becomes 8 j c m c p d c m c 0 4 j 2 d u 2 j 2 2 d erf u 2 j 2 t 4 d j 2 d u 2 j 2 2 d erf u 2 j 2 t 4 d 4 d π t e u 2 j 2 t 4 d j d 0 eq 8 represents an implicit functional relation between the dependent j c m c p and the independent t variables of the system during filtration however to solve for the individual profiles of j c m c p it is necessary to formulate two additional equations of the form f i j c m c p 0 i 2 3 this is discussed in the following subsection 3 1 1 incorporation of osmotic pressure and spiegler kedem black box models the osmotic pressure model describes a linear rate law of solvent transport through a membrane the flux expression according to the model is 9 j t m p σ π c m π c p μ r m the osmotic reflection coefficient σ describes the tendency of a solute to induce osmotic flow 36 the osmotic pressure was evaluated according to the following correlation for bsa 28 10 π r t m c 9 22 10 3 c 2 3 01 10 5 c 3 where r is the universal gas constant t is the absolute temperature and m is the molecular weight of bsa 66 5 103 da combining eqs 9 and 10 the second model equation i e f 2 j c m c p 0 becomes 11 j t m p σ r t m c m c p 1 9 22 10 3 c m c p 3 01 10 5 c m 2 c m c p c p 2 μ r m the third and final equation was directly obtained from the spiegler kedem black box model 37 the final model equation outlines a relationship between the real rejection i e r r 1 c p c m and the permeate flux j as 12 1 c p c m σ 1 f 1 σ f where f e x p 1 σ j p m and p m is the solute permeability coefficient eqs 8 11 and 12 constitute the complete set of model equations for the filtration run however to initialize the simulation of the second and the third filtration runs the membrane surface concentration at the beginning of each run must be evaluated for this purpose it is necessary to formulate a cleaning model a simple cleaning model based on the lumped parameter approach is described in the next section 3 2 cleaning model the desired outcome of the cleaning model is the membrane surface concentration at the end of the cleaning run otherwise the next filtration run cannot be initialized the unit produces no measurable output i e flux or permeate concentration during the cleaning experiment therefore the membrane surface concentration was considered as the single process variable of the cleaning model which cannot be directly measured the efficacy of the cleaning model can only be tested through the simulated flux profile of the next filtration run as the profile is functionally dependent on the initial condition i e fundamentally on the membrane surface and permeate concentrations permeate concentrations at the beginning of the filtration runs were fixed as c p 0 0 so the cleaning model should be entirely based on the dynamics of membrane surface concentration thus we have planned to adopt the simple lumped parameter approach to formulate the cleaning model the transience of c m c i e the membrane surface concentration during the cleaning run might be straightway formulated as 13 δ f d c m c d t j b t where δ f is the deposited protein layer thickness in the beginning of the cleaning run and j b t is the respective back transport flux of solutes during cleaning t is the local time variable for cleaning and t 0 t c where t c is the duration of the individual cleaning experiment we have assumed δ f to remain constant assumption 7 nevertheless the void fraction of the layer ε must be increasing as the proteins are continually scooped up from the layer the model picture is depicted in fig 3 the back transport flux was evaluated from the expression of the net force acting on the protein molecules in the deposited layer as j b t f n e t f 1 ε where f is the friction factor of the protein molecules the upward velocity of the molecules i e f n e t f was converted to the respective flux expression upon dividing the velocity by 1 ε which eventually changes the basis of the area from the total projected area of the protein molecules to the membrane surface area here we have assumed the volume and the surface porosities of the deposited layer to be identical assumption 8 the friction factor was determined from stokes law expression of f n e t was calculated as the resultant of i the reversed basket rotation induced hydrodynamic draft f p ii the mean shear induced lift f l and iii the appropriate component of the cohesive interaction f c o h e s i v e t between the adjacent protein molecules trapped in the deposited layer accordingly f n e t f p f l f c o h e s i v e t eventually to account for the possible non idealities a correction factor β was introduced the final form of the model equation becomes 14 δ f d c m c d t β ρ b s a 6 π μ a f l f p f c o h e s i v e t c m c c m c where a is the approximate radius of the bsa molecule δ f was evaluated considering a force equilibrium between the cohesive interaction and the lift force at the end of the previous filtration run eq 14 was initialized as t 0 c m c c m t f where c m t f represents the membrane surface concentration at the end of the previous filtration run the detailed formulation of the cleaning model is presented in the supplementary section s 3 4 simulation scheme transient profiles of j c m and c p during the filtration run were simulated by solving eqs 8 11 and 12 simultaneously the multivariate newton raphson scheme was employed for this purpose complete profiles were generated by repeatedly solving the set of equations over t 0 t f for all filtration experiments the permeate flux was observed to attain its quasi steady state around 120 min therefore we have chosen t f to be 120 min time increment δ t to execute repeated solution was fixed at 1 min the choice of δt did not introduce any significant variation in the individual profiles as eq 8 is explicit in time and the set of equations is devoid of any time derivative terms the first filtration run m a r k e d a s i 1 w h e r e i i s t h e r u n i n d e x was initialized as c m i 1 j 1 c 0 c p i 1 j 1 0 j i 1 j 1 t m p σ π m c 0 μ r m it is imperative to note that t 0 corresponds to j 1 where j is the discrete experimental data point index for the second and the third filtration runs c m was obtained from the simulation of the previous cleaning run i e c m i j 1 c m c i 1 t c where i 2 or 3 however c p i j 1 was always set to zero irrespective of i i e c p i j 1 0 initial permeate flux in the second or the third filtration run was evaluated from the osmotic pressure model using appropriate values of c m and c p once a specific filtration run was fully simulated corresponding quasi steady protein layer thickness δ f was solved according to the force equilibrium condition f c o h e s i v e t d f l δ f the method is elaborated in supplementary section s 3 for the cleaning runs profiles of c m c i over t 0 t c was simulated upon solving eq 14 by 4th order runge kutta method unlike filtration reliability of the cleaning run simulation heavily depends on the time increment δ t considering the short duration of cleaning operation t c 300 s we have chosen δ t to be 1 s cleaning was initialized as c m c i 0 c m i j 9 where j 9 corresponds to t t f the present simulation scheme requires the prior estimations of the parameters present in eqs 8 11 12 and 14 collectively the parameter set includes μ d r m σ ρ b s a n a ϕ a h corresponding measures are discussed in supplementary section s 4 additionally the model equations also include two adjustable parameters α and β according to their definitions the adjustable parameters are expected to be dependent on the respective process parameters filtration run parameter α was considered as α α t m p ω c 0 on the other hand the cleaning run parameter β was apprehended to depend on ω c and c 0 only as t m p 0 during the cleaning experiments table 1 both α and β were evaluated upon minimizing the following objective functions e and e c respectively which are equivalent to the sum of the square error sse of model predicted flux with respect to experimental flux e α is defined as 15 e α i 1 n j 1 m 1 j m o d e l i j j e x p i j 2 where j 1 to m is the discrete experimental data point index and i 1 to n is the filtration run index consequently j i j represents the permeate flux value at j t h data point of i t h filtration run of a specific experiment according to the present experimental design m 9 and n 3 e c β was also defined similar to e α nevertheless correct estimation of β is expected to simulate the membrane surface concentration at the end of cleaning run i e c m c t c which must lead to minimum sse between experimental and simulated flux values in the beginning i e j 1 of the next filtration run i 1 therefore 16 e c β i 1 2 1 j m o d e l i 1 j 1 c m c i t c j e x p i 1 j 1 2 both e α and e c β were minimized by the well known direct search method 38 a detailed flowchart of the present simulation scheme is depicted in fig 4 5 results and discussion the sbm filtration pilot was simulated under a different set of t m p ω and c 0 table 1 to obtain the transient profiles of j c m and c p over the three sequential filtration runs the adjustable parameters i e α and β were appropriately tuned to minimize e α and e c β the response surface methodology rsm was used to decipher the functional relations between the adjustable and the operating parameters furthermore the standard correlation between the time averaged permeate flux j and the mean membrane shear rate γ was also tested for the present module all dse modules introduced so far exhibit a non trivial power law type correlation between the flux and the membrane shear rate i e j γ n where n varies within the range of 0 42 to 0 55 19 accordingly for the stress enhancement characterization and also for the development of the appropriate scale up relation j vs γ correlation study has been performed in the following subsections the outcomes of those investigations are discussed 5 1 flux profiles for all filtration runs the quasi steady state was achieved at about 120 m i n the flux profiles tentatively indicate a first order type decline from the very beginning of the filtration experiment corresponding profiles under varied conditions of t m p ω and c o are depicted in fig 5 a i a iii respectively flux decline was noted to vary from 10 to 22 the overall decline for 360 m i n of filtration which consisted of three successive filtration and two intermediate cleaning runs was limited to 30 only low flux decline may be regarded as an outcome of the dynamic shear enhancement during the filtration run and the intermediate flux regeneration because of the cleaning runs reversed basket rotation induced cleaning runs each of only 5 min duration could regenerate the flux by 15 20 the observation indicates a marginally small i e 1 5 flux decline after each filtration cleaning cycle usual variations were recorded with the change of operating conditions for example quasi steady flux at the end of the first filtration run i e j t t f increased by 65 for a change of t m p from 1 k g f c m 2 to 5 k g f c m 2 with otherwise unchanged process condition c o 2 w and ω 20 95 r a d s 1 similarly for the full scale parametric change of ω i e 10 47 41 90 r a d s 1 j t t f was recorded to increase by 105 145 under different conditions of t m p and c o flux was noted to be highly sensitive towards any change of ω which clearly displayed the dynamic shear enhancement feature of the present module prevalently high membrane shear may be further justified in terms of nominal flux reduction i e 8 10 for a change of feed concentration from 1 4 w simulated flux profiles were reasonably close to the experimental dataset for all the filtration cleaning experiments the maximum absolute error was 12 whereas the average error was estimated to be 5 6 to understand the error trend we have included the transient profiles of 1 j m o d e l j e x p 2 in the same figure fig 5 b closer investigation indicates relatively large square errors in the beginning and towards the terminal stages of filtration notably the first filtration run was initialized as c m 0 c 0 and c p 0 0 subsequently the initial flux was solved using the osmotic pressure model eq 11 on the other hand j e x p 0 was measured upon collecting 5 c m 3 of permeate the corresponding time of collection was in the order of few seconds even over the small time interval concentration polarization may be apprehended to influence the system dynamics cp is instantaneous by nature while membrane fouling is a slow and long term phenomenon 4 rd filtration system has been confirmed to attain the steady state of cp around 200 s in reverse osmosis 39 therefore at the beginning of the filtration experiments the experimental flux values were expected to deviate from the simulated profile largely a similar explanation regarding the divergent experimental data points from the simulated flux profiles is also pertinent for the second and the third filtration runs moreover the initial membrane surface concentrations for the subsequent filtration runs were simulated using the cleaning model consequently the actual c m deviates from the simulated c m because of the nearly instantaneous polarization effect once the system was switched to the next filtration run upon adjusting the tmp and the rotational speed we have used a lumped correction factor β in the cleaning model which was supposed to account for all the model exclusive non idealities in a collective sense nevertheless force expressions needed individual corrections for example the non dlvo forces 40 which majorly contribute to the cohesive interaction of proteins were not considered in the present model this was completely unavoidable because no explicit non dlvo force expression between the bsa molecules was reported so far similarly in the case of f l the velocity term was directly substituted as u c without introducing any additional correction factor thus due to cp s instantaneous nature and the lumped adjustable parameter used in the cleaning model simulated profiles seemed to moderately deviate from the experimental data points over the initial phases of filtration conversely in the intermediate regime over t m i n 10 45 normalized square error profiles passed through their respective minimum accordingly the model may be inferred to simulate the system with the maximum level of accuracy when the cp had attained its steady state and the membrane fouling was still passing through its transience the extended transience of the fouling process is justified by the slow but progressive trend of flux decline beyond t 45 m i n the difference of the simulated flux from the corresponding experimental data was also noted to increase after t 45 m i n the increasing transient error was continued till the quasi steady state was reached fig 5 b this is also quite evident as the phenomenon of membrane fouling was not separately accounted in the filtration model cp was explicitly incorporated through the convection diffusion equation i e eq 8 however membrane fouling was not furthermore in the cleaning model the structure of the deposited protein layer was grossly simplified consequently the simulated flux is bound to deviate from the experimental data points when membrane fouling started governing the system dynamics yet for the three successive filtration runs the proposed analytical model simulated the sbm pilot with a maximum average absolute error of less than 6 this clearly justifies the validity of the proposed model besides it is a first of its kind attempt to simulate the dynamics of the sbm pilot the module is structurally and operationally much more complex than the other baseline dse filtration systems therefore a maximum absolute error of 12 and a maximum average absolute error of 6 in flux simulation are pretty acceptable in addition to the permeate flux the membrane surface and the permeate concentrations are also simulated dynamic profiles of c m and c p are discussed in the following section 5 2 membrane surface and permeate concentration profiles dynamic profiles of c m over the first three filtration run for all the operating conditions were similar fig 6 a all profiles were noted to grow rapidly from the beginning and the state of maximum concentration was achieved near the quasi steady state for example at t m p 2 k g f c m 2 c 0 2 w and ω 20 95 r a d s 1 simulation results indicate an increase of c m by 50 k g m 3 from the beginning t 0 c m c 0 20 k g m 3 to the quasi steady state of the first filtration run t 120 m i n t f c m 70 k g m 3 in all cases more than 90 of the simulated growth was observed over the first 30 min the specific trend once again confirms the instantaneous nature of cp rapidly increasing profiles from the initial stages of filtration signifies high solute accumulation at the membrane surface membrane fouling also operates in parallel though it is a much slower process than the cp so the dynamics of c m is likely to be governed by cp in the early stages of filtration i e f o r t 30 m i n whereas during the latter half slow but steady growth of c m demonstrates fouling to be dominant all c m profiles were purely simulated corresponding validity check was beyond the scope of the present investigation the reported methods of membrane surface concentration measurement are technically complex and it is practically impossible to measure c m even in the case of the simplest dse module e g stirred cell or rd filtration unit as it consists of either a high speed stirrer or a flat rotating disk close to the membrane surface the proposed filtration model does not explicitly account for the membrane fouling it is fundamentally based on concentration polarization nevertheless fouling was implicit in the model picture it has been viewed as a phenomenological extension of cp without considering the thermodynamic irreversibility directly irreversibility was incorporated through the spiegler kedem black box model thus we may conclude that instead of the sharp growth of solute concentration at the interface between the fouled and the polarized layer we have considered a smooth and progressively growing concentration profile this is apprehended to yield an underpredicted profile of c m unlike c m the simulated profiles of c p were compared with the experimental data fig 6 b the overall trend of permeate concentration was quite close to that of c m however with widely different maximum values for example in a filtration run with t m p 2 k g f c m 2 c 0 2 w and ω 20 95 r a d s 1 the experimental c p grew up from 0 25 k g m 3 at t 0 to 0 89 k g m 3 at t 120 m i n which corresponded to a real rejection r r 1 c p c m of 98 7 the observed rejection r 0 1 c p c 0 was found to be 95 5 for all other parametric conditions both r r and r 0 were found to be higher than 93 high percent rejection is a typical feature of dse modules for instance in reverse osmosis of simulated brackish water using a vsep unit mean r 0 for the common ions n a m g 2 c a 2 c l etc was reported to be greater than 95 whereas without vibration r 0 was even lower than 75 for some of the ions 41 similarly in the recovery of glucuronane polysaccharides from fermentation broth more than 90 rejection was achieved with rd module 42 the present results of high r r and r 0 alternatively justify the dynamic shear enhancement characteristics of the sbm module simulated profiles were noted to overpredict c p the trend of overprediction was quite prominent towards the quasi steady state maximum positive deviation was found to be about 8 in reverse simulated profiles underpredicted c p over the initial phases of filtration the maximum underprediction was consistently below 10 the trend of deviation is just opposite to the results of flux simulation fig 5 a the root cause of underprediction lies in the initialization scheme permeate concentration was assumed to be zero c p 0 in the beginning of all filtration runs furthermore c p was also measured from the same 5 c m 3 of the collected permeate sample as used for flux measurement consequently an inconsistency between the time scale of data recording and the time scale associated with the dynamics of c p was quite evident over the later stages of filtration the deviation was majorly due to the fouling process which was not explicitly accounted for in the present formulation yet the maximum errors were limited within 10 for c p and within 12 for the permeate flux the results validate the current model instead of its relatively sizeable absolute error because of the following reasons i this is a first of its kind mathematical model for a new class of dse filtration units with inbuilt hydrodynamic provision for membrane cleaning ii the hydrodynamic picture of the module is quite complicated iii very few analytical models of dse modules are available in the literature 5 3 variations of α and β with the process parameters the adjustable parameters i e α and β were noted to be heavily dependent on the operating parameters therefore appropriate functional forms i e α α t m p ω c 0 and β β ω c c 0 were considered to determine the exact correlations as discussed earlier for the correlation study the popular technique of response surface methodology rsm was used four different multivariable regression models namely i linear ii quadratic iii two factor interaction 2fi and iv cubic were individually tested for both the parameters the 2fi model was identified to be the most suitable in describing the parametric dependence of α the model selection was followed by the detailed analysis of variance anova the anova outcomes for α in brief are presented in table 2 the high f value implies the model to be significant besides high r 2 and its closeness with adjusted r 2 suggest the presence of non redundant terms only in the model equation the closeness of r 2 and adjusted r 2 is regarded as a marker of a regression model with significant terms only 43 t m p and ω were identified to be the most significant terms as indicated by the corresponding f values mixed quadratic term of t m p and ω t m p ω was also found to be influential three dimensional mesh plots of α are shown in fig 7 a i iii the corresponding response equation is 17 α 0 45033 0 18853 t m p 0 031697 ω 0 033378 c 0 0 034026 t m p ω 0 011833 t m p c 0 1 78104 10 3 ω c 0 fig 7 a represents the monotonically increasing trend of α with t m p and ω whereas it is nearly independent of c 0 for example at a fixed parametric condition ω and c 0 ω 41 9 r a d s 1 and c 0 4 w α was noted to change form 2 1 to 8 05 for change of t m p over 1 5 k g f c m 2 similar variations were also observed for ω as well high tmp and ω are expected to scale up the turbulence even close to the membrane surface it also intensified the eddy diffusion of momentum in the neighborhood of the basket arm tip besides the circulation velocity of vortices swirls and periodic secondary flows were also seemed to increase with t m p and ω this has also been established in our previous study 22 enhanced circulation velocity positively augmented the free stream velocity component of the flow through the gap between the arm tip and the cylindrical casing consequently the effective free stream velocity i e u became two to eightfold higher than its theoretical estimate i e α 2 8 conversely at the lower side values of the same operating parameters for instance at t m p 1 k g f c m 2 and ω 10 47 r a d s 1 α was found to be lower than unity i e α 0 6 this signifies a negative augmentation of the baseline free stream velocity over the entire parametric space α was identified to vary between 0 6 and 8 05 accordingly we have o α 1 as considered in the present model the simple hydrodynamic picture seems to be quite effective in describing the system as the respective adjustable parameter was found to be localized in the neighborhood of unity thus the model predicted velocity field is close to the actual one at least within the concentration boundary layer formed over the membrane surface similar to α rsm based multivariate regression analysis was also performed for β the cubic model was found to be most suitable in describing the functional form once again detailed anova was carried out for β as well some of the key results are presented in table 2 ω c and ω c 3 were identified to be the most significant terms as indicated by the respective f values which were followed by linear concentration term c 0 the model equation is 18 β 2 53426 0 27685 ω c 0 33332 c 0 7 16804 10 3 ω c c 0 0 013747 ω c 2 0 14998 c 0 2 9 13970 10 5 ω c 2 c 0 4 78101 10 4 ω c c 0 2 1 67795 10 4 ω c 3 0 016667 c 0 3 the corresponding three dimensional mesh plots are depicted in fig 7 b β was noted to increase with both ω c and c 0 nevertheless the parameter was found to be strongly dependent on ω c both f l and f p were found to share power law type functional relations with ω i e f l ω c 2 7 and f p ω c 2 as described in supplementary section s 3 whereas f c o h e s i v e t was only dependent on c 0 although indirectly any increase in c 0 is expected to increase c m fig 6 a the protein protein distance of separation d decreased with increasing c m according to eq s 23 in the supplementary section s 3 which resulted in higher f d l v o d fig s 3 b and finally to increased f c o h e s i v e t as per eq s 20 in supplementary section s 3 therefore c 0 is anticipated to weakly influence β relative to ω c so the trends of β with ω and c 0 as obtained from rsm analysis are qualitatively justified β was noted to achieve its maximum 3 6 at c 0 4 k g m 3 and ω c 41 9 r a d s 1 on the other hand the lowest β 0 8 was found at c 0 1 k g m 3 and ω c 10 47 r a d s 1 thus o β 1 which is similar to the order of magnitude of α the order of magnitude analysis for both the adjustable parameters justifies the viability of the present model in describing the filtration cleaning cycle of the sbm module 5 4 flux shear relationship the flux shear rate correlation is considered to be one of the central characteristics of any dse module generally the correlation follows a power law type functional relation 19 j k γ n where γ is the shear rate commonly expressed in s 1 and flux j is represented in l m 2 h 1 we have chosen the same units for standardization and comparative analysis 44 the exponent n quantifies the functional sensitivity whereas k is the shear rate independent limiting flux for dse modules n was reported to vary between 0 186 and 1 56 19 the parameter is independent of the rotational speed in cases of rd and msd pilots the frequency of vibration in vsep modules and the size of the device nevertheless it strongly depends on the type of feed concentration and membrane pore size the power law correlation is generally estimated from the experimental flux data set and theoretically evaluated shear rate for instance bouzerar et al have used the navier stokes equation to calculate the local shear rate close to the membrane surface of an rd module operating in the laminar regime whereas the blasius friction factor was used to determine γ when the same unit operates in the turbulent regime 45 currently γ was estimated from the expression of x directional velocity component u as described in section 3 1 within the concentration boundary layer y δ c the following expression of u was obtained 20 u 0 0297 u 9 5 ν 4 5 y x 1 5 differentiating eq 20 with respect to y and averaging the expression over x 0 l the mean shear rate γ becomes 21 γ 0 037 u 9 5 l 4 5 ν 4 5 so γ α ω 9 5 moreover α was solved to be dependent on t m p ω and c 0 eq 17 accordingly γ γ t m p ω c 0 a closer inspection of eq 17 revealed that α may be fairly approximated as α a 1 t m p a 2 ω where a 1 and a 2 are the appropriate regression coefficients because t m p and ω were identified to be the two most significant terms of the regression model table 2 consequently γ a 1 t m p a 2 ω 9 5 ω 9 5 and the term with the highest exponent value of ω in γ v s ω correlation becomes ω 3 6 in all other existing dse modules the exponent was reported to be lower than 2 for instance in rd pilot γ ω 1 5 whereas for the rotating disk membrane modules γ ω 1 8 19 similarly maximum shear rate γ m is proportional to ω 1 5 in case of vsep modules with ω being the angular frequency the analysis signifies a much higher production of shear in the sbm pilot relative to other dse modules therefore we have operated the module with a relatively lower operating speed i e 100 400 rpm whereas other dse filtration devices are generally operated in the range of 750 2000 rpm 46 even with such a low operating speed the sbm pilot can generate a maximum shear rate of 1 7 10 5 s 1 which is well within the range of γ produced by a high speed msd pilot i e between 10 5 to 4 10 5 s 1 19 the results explicitly demonstrate the novelty of the design in shear generation the average of the three quasi steady flux data was evaluated at the end of the corresponding filtration runs for a specific operating condition to determine the flux shear rate correlation thus a set of 64 data points n 64 in the form of j vs γ was generated the flux shear rate characterization experiments were conducted at four discrete points for each of the three operating parameters contrary to the set of filtration cleaning experiments which consists of only ten n 10 experimental runs table 1 hence the j vs γ dataset must consist of 4 3 64 number of data points the average flux was evaluated as j 1 3 j t 120 j t 245 j t 370 j vs γ data points were plotted in a double logarithmic phase plane subsequently regression analysis was carried out to check the validity of the power law fit the results are presented in fig 8 high correlation coefficient r 2 0 98 substantiates the following correlation 22 j 32 48 γ 0 19 the low value of n signifies a low sensitivity of j in relation to γ a similar small exponent has also been reported in microfiltration mf for instance in mf of yeast suspension using rd and vsep pilots the exponent was noted to vary from 0 18 to 0 19 44 in protein uf the exponent varies between 0 43 to 1 257 llow exponent value is seemingly disadvantageous however this is adequately compensated by high limiting flux coefficient k 32 48 l m 2 h 1 a large k value is a characteristic feature of dse systems in mf for instance mf of caco3 suspension using an msd pilot was noted to have a similar limiting flux 38 26 l m 2 h 1 47 on the other hand dse nanofiltration nf units generally operate with low k nf of uht skimmed milk in vibrating disk system was reported to have k 3 10 4 l m 2 h 1 44 high k and low n value is advantageous from the standpoint of specific energy demand the present module can produce reasonably high flux 100 l m 2 h 1 at the cost of low power budget our previous investigation has established the specific energy demand of the sbm pilot to be proportional to ω 22 fig 8 also indicates no significant alteration of j vs γ profile with the change of feed concentration additionally the present values of k and n do not corroborate with the reported empirical correlation i e k 10 2 5 n 44 however sbm is not the only exception the correlation is violated by msd filtration systems as well 6 conclusion nearly a decade ago we proposed the design of a dynamic shear enhanced filtration device with an inbuilt membrane cleaning facility the unit was named as spinning basket membrane sbm module the sbm pilot was characterized in ultrafiltration of different synthetic wastewater streams 20 22 an elementary mathematical model was also previously developed to simulate the flux profile under steady state 24 closer investigation revealed that the perpetual sequence of filtration and cleaning operations majorly limits the scope of the unsteady state model formulation in this work we have presented an unsteady state mathematical model of the sbm filtration unit capable of simulating the flux and the permeate concentration for any number of sequential filtration cleaning cycles the overall formulation consists of i a distributed parameter filtration model and ii a lumped parameter cleaning model the model consists of two adjustable parameters simulated flux and concentration profiles were in good agreement with the experimental data obtained from ultrafiltration of protein bearing synthetic wastewater the average absolute deviation for the permeate flux was well below 6 for permeate concentration the error was also found to be less than 8 mathematical models are essential for understanding scale up and upgradation any process device the present two parameter model can simulate a complex membrane filtration device in protein recovery from synthetic wastewater with reasonable accuracy the mathematical framework only requires the systematic solution of four simultaneous equations to obtain the transient flux and the permeate concentration profiles in repeated filtration cleaning cycles under varied parametric conditions from a broader perspective the current approach demonstrates a viable modelling strategy of a complex process device simply upon exploring the basic physics of the system declaration of competing interest the

13450,membrane based low cost recovery of nutritional and therapeutic proteins from wastewater is regarded as a leap towards sustainability however membranes are heavily fouled by proteins and thus frequent chemical or hydrodynamic cleaning is needed even in the advanced dynamic shear enhanced dse filtration devices this article presents the modeling simulation and characterization studies of a

wastewater it can perpetually regenerate the flux with its simple and moreover online cleaning facility a two parameter transient model purely based on an analytical approach has been developed to simulate the device moderately low deviation 12 of the simulated flux from the corresponding experimental data obtained from ultrafiltration of synthetic wastewater unambiguously validates the

to the traditional separation processes in the recovery of different nutritional and therapeutic proteins from wastewater streams of pharmaceutical biochemical and food industries 1 pressure driven membrane systems pdms in specific have gained considerable attention in this regard 2 however the projected growth of pdms in protein recovery was majorly hindered because of the two well known non idealities namely concentration polarization cp and membrane fouling 3 cp refers to the reversible accumulation of solutes on the membrane surface whereas solute adsorption and subsequent pore blocking are known as fouling fouling leads to irreversible loss of permeability an elevated level of cp has been reported to increase the membrane fouling 4 those two non idealities are primarily responsible for the transient flux decline observed from the very beginning of filtration 5 consequently the flux levels off to a quasi steady value towards the terminal stages of filtration flux can only be recovered through cleaning operation of which chemical cleaning is most commonly practiced 6 therefore all membrane based water treatment units sequentially operate in filtration and cleaning modes frequent cleaning on the other hand alters the permeation property and often results in a drastic reduction of the service life 7 several remedial techniques were proposed over the years which are generally classified into four major categories i boundary layer manipulation this is commonly accomplished either upon insertion of the static turbulent promoter s or by feed flow rate independent shear enhancement at the membrane surface e g the dse modules 8 ii upstream techniques like pretreatment of feed 9 iii modification of the membrane surface properties 10 and iv external perturbations e g backpulsing backflushing backwashing pulsatile flow gas sparging use of electric field or ultrasound etc 11 12 the idea of shear enhancement at the membrane surface and disruption of the polarized layer was first implemented in much earlier cross flow cf systems 13 in cf modules the membrane shear stress can be largely increased upon increasing the feed flow rate nevertheless the transmembrane pressure tmp eventually decreases along the direction of feed flow which results in a non optimal use of the membrane surface 14 increased feed flow rate also increases the pumping cost the idea of dynamic shear enhancement was introduced to decouple the membrane shear stress from the feed flow rate according to this strategy shear was made independent of the feed rate by introducing a rotating or a reciprocating accessory for example a primitive dead end module may be converted to a dse filtration system upon placing a high speed stirrer close to the membrane 15 flux was reported to increase in this upgraded design known as single stirred cell compared to its unstirred counterpart 16 the increasing need of processing heavy fouling feedstocks e g concentrated protein or polymer solutions oil water emulsions industrial effluents etc has promoted the innovation scale up and commercialization of different dse modules since the 1970s some of the standard designs include rotating disk rd rotating disk membrane rdm multi shaft disk msd and vibratory shear enhanced processing vsep units 17 a large number of performance characterization and hydrodynamic studies of several dse modules with a wide range of feed and process conditions have been reported over the last two decades 18 a comprehensive review of their performances in the treatment of various industrial and synthetic feedstocks comparative analysis shear production capacities and energy usage profiles has been presented by jaffrin 19 a different group of dse modules with an online cleaning facility was propped nearly a decade ago 20 21 of which the sbm unit was the baseline design the module was tested in ultrafiltration uf of polyethylene glycol polyvinyl alcohol and bovine serum albumin for all feedstocks the maximum flux decline was restricted within 10 even after three to five hours of continuous filtration 22 very recently the upgraded design referred as the intermeshed spinning basket membrane isbm module has also been reported 23 literature review on dse modules indicates a plethora of performance characterization studies some of the investigations were also based on hydrodynamic simulation nevertheless majorly based on the standard cfd packages very few attempts were made to formulate a mathematical model primarily owing to the complex hydrodynamic environment that generally prevails in any dse module the models mainly deal with the baseline designs such as rd or rdm recently a first of its kind but exceedingly simplified formulation is reported for the sbm filtration device 24 a brief review of those models is presented as follows one of the early models of rd unit was proposed by holechovsky and cooney 25 one dimensional convection diffusion equation with variable diffusivity term was solved to obtain the system specific mass transfer correlation the dynamic feature of shear enhancement was established in terms of axial velocity independent mass transfer coefficient as the specific velocity component according to its definition was directly proportional to the feed flow rate the formulation was grossly empirical indeed because it incorporates the experimental mass transfer correlation since then several models of rd and rdm were proposed bhattacharjee and dutta partially resolved the problem of empiricism associated with the mass transfer coefficient they have introduced the concept of back transport flux to account for the effects of shear enhancement the back transport flux was semi empirically considered to be proportional to the rotational speed of the stirrer 26 a more realistic one parameter model based on the similar idea was later proposed by sarkar et al 27 the model was further extended to simulate the rdm filtration systems 28 alternative to the analytical studies different numerical models are also available for rd and rdm pilots very recently an elegant numerical model of a rotodynamic i e equivalent to rd module ro filtration system has been proposed by uppu et al 29 different specific purpose subroutines were incorporated in a commercial cfd package to simulate the complex hydrodynamic picture correctly the simulated velocity field confirmed the presence of helical pathlines which was rightly envisaged earlier by sarkar et al 27 it is imperative to note that modeling studies of dse units are majorly limited to simple and baseline designs i e rd and rdm modules only only an elementary two parameter steady state model of the sbm system has been recently proposed 24 the formulation was based on lubrication theory osmotic pressure model and thermodynamic black box model of membrane transport due to spiegler and kedem the approach circumvented the solution of the fundamental convection diffusion equation additionally the physical picture of the cleaning run remained completely unexplored spinning basket filtration systems i e sbm and isbm units are pretty effective in the treatment of heavy fouling feed solutions 20 23 the modules are also capable of intermittent flux regeneration using their inbuilt physical cleaning facility furthermore both sbm and isbm filtration units have been established to be techno economically suitable specifically for protein recovery compared to other dse systems 22 23 accordingly a thorough understanding of their mass transfer picture is necessary beyond the mere performance characterization and elementary cfd simulation for appropriate scale up a modeling attempt from the perspective of the fundamental convection diffusion archetype is therefore necessary to be explored additionally the basic physics of the physical cleaning mechanism must be understood from a quantitative point of view for further improvement and upgradation in this article we have presented a two parameter unsteady state analytical model of the sbm pilot which can simulate the device operating in repeated filtration and cleaning modes in sequence the transient two dimensional convection diffusion equation was solved to obtain the protein concentration profile under the time varying boundary condition at the membrane surface a functional form f j c m c p t 0 j flux c m c p membrane surface and permeate concentrations of protein t time derived thereof was incorporated with two other constitutive equations arising from osmotic pressure and spiegler kedem black box models the governing system equations were simultaneously solved to simulate the device in filtration mode on the other hand a lumped parameter cleaning model was formulated in terms of c m a force balance between the dislodging mechanical draft on the deposited solute layer due to reversed directional basket spinning the flow induced lift force and the solute solute dlvo interactions was considered to formulate the cleaning rate the model has been validated with the experimental profiles of j and c p obtained in ultrafiltration of protein bearing synthetic wastewater i e an aqueous solution of bsa conducted in a standard sbm pilot 2 experimental 2 1 materials and analytical techniques reagent grade 99 pure igg endotoxin and fatty acid free bsa of average molecular weight 66 kda was procured from srl india the synthetic wastewater feedstock was prepared upon dissolving bsa powder in the tris buffer the buffer was prepared upon mixing 151 14 g of tris base per 1000 ml of deionized water 30 the ph was adjusted around the neural range i e 7 0 7 3 additionally 0 012 w sodium azide was also added to prevent bacterial growth asymmetric semi permeable moist polyether sulphone pes membranes with 50 kda molecular weight cut off mwco were procured from the koch membrane system usa the rectangular flat sheet 1 0 1 0 m2 membranes have the following operating ranges ph 2 5 10 5 pressure kpa 100 830 and temperature c 5 54 coomassie brilliant blue dye based bradford assay was used to measure the protein concentration in feed retentate and permeate streams 31 for this purpose a dual beam hitachi uv vis spectrophotometer model u 2800 was employed 2 2 filtration pilot the bench scale sbm module consists of a hollow spinning basket with four flat radial arms which is placed within a cylindrical casing with a narrow clearance 6 mm the basket is mounted on a hollow shaft four flat sheet membranes effective are 0 05 0 01 m2 are fitted on the alternate side of all radial arms naturally the permeate flows out of the basket through the shaft s central aperture schematics of the sbm pilot and the whole filtration bench are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively a photograph of the spinning basket is also included as an insert of fig 1 a during the filtration run the basket was rotated with the membrane bearing sides being the leading faces thus for the present design the direction of spinning during the filtration run is counterclockwise fig 1 a basket spinning was accomplished by a three phase induction motor which transmitted the power through a belt pulley drive a triplex piston pump delivered the synthetic wastewater to the unit tmp was adjusted upon operating two needle valves fitted in retentate and bypass lines respectively once the three successive flux readings were close to each other the operation was switched to cleaning mode present cleaning protocol is purely based on hydrodynamic principles however it is characteristically different from conventional hydrodynamic techniques such as backpulsing backflushing or backwashing 11 tmp was primarily released at the beginning of all cleaning runs upon simultaneously adjusting the two needle valves the feed flow was kept unchanged this was followed by a reversed rotation of the basket i e in the clockwise direction for the present pilot a local vacuum was expected to set in over the membrane surface because the membranes were on the trailing faces of the rotating arms during such cleaning runs the permeate side pressure remained atmospheric therefore a hydrodynamic draft with per unit area magnitude in the order of local dynamic pressure was generated the draft acted in the direction of permeate to feed which was expected to partially dislodge the accumulated protein layer formed during the previous filtration run 2 3 design of experiment performance of the module was characterized by systematically varying the three process parameters namely i transmembrane pressure tmp ii feed concentration c 0 and iii rotational speed ω any one of the parameters was varied over the stipulated range while keeping the others constant corresponding ranges were tmp kgf cm 2 1 5 c 0 w o f b s a 1 4 and ω r a d s e c 1 10 47 41 9 in our previous report it has been shown that the filtration characteristics of the sbm pilot are nearly independent of the feed flow rate 23 thus a constant retentate flow rate 6 lpm was maintained in all filtration runs all cleaning runs were performed with the same rotational speed i e ω c ω as used in the corresponding filtration run however in opposite i e clockwise direction each cleaning operation was continued for 300 s after which the next filtration run was initiated all characterization experiments were continued for three successive filtration runs intervened by two cleaning operations 2 4 experimental procedure initially four flat sheer virgin membranes total area 0 06 0 11 m2 were fitted on the alternate faces of the four radial arms this was followed by membrane compaction at 6 0 kgf cm 2 compaction pressure was higher than the highest tmp used in the filtration runs 5 0 kgf cm 2 the module was then operated in filtration mode under fixed conditions of tmp c 0 and ω at the beginning of filtration the needle valves in the retentate and recycle lines were kept completely open once the feed starts flowing steadily through the module both the valves were adjusted to fix the tmp and flow rate at their desired values 10 cm3 of permeate was periodically collected to measure the flux permeate concentration was also determined from the same sample the retentate was continuously recirculated back to the feed tank therefore the concentration of the feed solution was continuously monitored and calculated amount of make up solution was periodically added feed tank ph was also measured continuously to adjust it around neutral ph 7 0 7 5 which was far from the isoelectric point of bsa ph 4 71 once the flux had reached its quasi steady state the module was switched to cleaning mode as discussed in section 3 2 no permeate was generated during cleaning as tmp was released for model testing and validation the filtration cleaning experiments were conducted under a varied set of parametric conditions i e tmp c 0 and ω permeate flux was noted to achieve the quasi steady state i e nearly identical flux readings for three successive measurements with an interval of 30 min each about 120 min of filtration as discussed later thus all filtration runs were simulated for 120 min on the other hand the cleaning run simulations were carried out for 300 s as all cleaning operations were conducted over the same duration the parametric conditions as used in the present simulation are described in table 1 3 model formulation primarily it is necessary to outline the objectives of the present model in the filtration mode variations of the flux j and the permeate concentration c p with time are to be principally simulated for a fixed set of parametric conditions i e tmp ω and c 0 as the two quantities could be experimentally measured the membrane surface concentration profile i e c m v s t was also predicted to initialize the next cleaning run nevertheless it is impossible to measure c m in the present setup for the first filtration run the initial condition was at t 0 c m c 0 c p 0 and j t m p σ π c o π 0 μ r m where σ is the osmotic reflection coefficient μ is the solvent viscosity r m is the hydrodynamic resistance of the membrane and π π c is the osmotic pressure expressed as a function of protein concentration we have used the well known osmotic pressure model to evaluate the flux 32 for the second and the third filtration runs the initial membrane surface and permeate concentrations were to be evaluated regarding permeate concentration all filtration runs were initialized as c p 0 however for c m it was necessary to simulate the previous cleaning run accordingly the objectives of the model formulation may be summarized as 1 to simulate the transient profiles of j c m and c p in the three successive filtration runs for an experiment conducted with a fixed set of parametric conditions i e tmp ω and c o 2 to simulate the transient profiles of c m during the two intermittent cleaning runs for the same experiment based on those objectives we have developed a complete process model for the filtration cleaning cycle of the sbm module the formulations are discussed in the following sections 3 1 filtration model the filtration model principally consists of the analytical solution of a simplified convection diffusion equation the concentration profile expression was further used to generate a time explicit functional relation between the three process variables i e f j c m c p t 0 the corresponding equation was simultaneously solved along with the equations arising from the osmotic pressure and the spiegler kedem black box models respectively 24 however formulation of the convection diffusion equation requires a thorough knowledge of the velocity field the hydrodynamic picture of the sbm pilot is expected to be complex because of the spinning basket placed inside the cylindrical casing with narrow clearance hydrodynamic complexity signatures were also demonstrated in the previous cfd simulation 22 presently we have again simulated the pilot using identical conditions as those of our earlier work the velocity field is presented in fig 2 a despite of the complex hydrodynamic environment the flow pattern near the basket may be greatly simplified considering a single loopy pathline as elaborated in the baseline model 24 the pathline was thought to be like a distorted envelope of the basket it is nearly parallel to the membrane surfaces as depicted in fig 2 b the simulated velocity profile and the simplified pathline collectively indicate a flat plate type boundary layer flow over the membrane surface a concentration boundary layer is also expected to grow from the leading edge of the membrane because of the continuous solute rejection and the polarization effect an appropriate coordinate system was introduced with its origin being fixed at the midpoint of the membrane s leading edge fig 2 c profiles of the hydrodynamic and concentration boundary layers are schematically depicted in fig 2 d the concentration boundary layer was assumed to be well within the laminar sublayer assumption 1 this is justified in terms of the large schmidt number sc owing to the extremely low diffusivity of bsa in water 10 10 m 2 s 1 33 the boundary layer thicknesses i e δ a n d δ c are functionally related to each other through the schmidt number as δ δ c s c 1 3 the expression of hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness δ in turbulent flow is quite well known as δ 0 0382 ν u 1 5 x 4 5 34 where u is the free stream velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity high reynolds number of the present system d b n b 2 ρ μ 6 10 6 w h e r e d b i s t h e m o d u l e d i a m e t e r a n d n b i s t h e r o t a t i o n a l s p e e d confirms the prevalence of turbulent regime therefore δ c a x 4 5 where a 0 0382 ν u 1 5 s c 1 3 considering assumption 1 the x component velocity within the concentration boundary layer may be expressed as u k y x 1 5 where k 0 0297 u 9 5 ν 4 5 34 here we have assumed the feed to be a newtonian fluid assumption 2 velocity component along y direction i e v close to the membrane surface may be expressed as v j expressions of u and v are incorporated in the general convection diffusion equation i e c t v c d 2 c 1 c t k y x 1 5 c x j c y d 2 c x 2 2 c y 2 associated initial and boundary conditions may be formulated as i

end effects c z 0 were considered to reduce the dimensionality of the convection diffusion equation assumption 3 the transience of c m has been temporarily neglected in bc 3 assuming pseudo steady state assumption 4 the flux was also considered to be pseudo steady similar to c m assumption 5 still it is impossible to obtain the analytical solution of eq 1 because of variable x component velocity we have further replaced the x component velocity i e u k y x 1 5 by its spatial average i e u over y 0 δ c and x 0 l respectively assumption 6 the respective expression becomes 2 u 1 δ c l 0 l 0 δ c k y x 1 5 d x d y 5 8 k δ c l 4 5 substitution of u by u in eq 1 results in a constant coefficient second order partial differential equation yet there exists the unknown free stream velocity u present in the expression of u free stream velocity can be approximately solved from the side wise volume flow rate between the basket arm tip and the cylindrical casing due to basket spinning q l from the expression of q l u maybe solved as 3 u 0 034 α ω r r b a s k e t c where r and l are the radius and height of the basket arm respectively the inner radius of the cylindrical casing is r b a s k e t fig 2 c the step wise calculation for u has been elaborated in supplementary section s 1 the empirical parameter α was introduced to effectively resolve the mean velocity through the side wise gap u into the free stream velocity u additionally it must incorporate the typical exit effects 35 α has been considered to be dependent on tmp ω and c 0 as the velocity field was found to be grossly dependent on the same set of parameters 22 the simplified form of the convection diffusion equation becomes 4 c t u c x j c y d 2 c x 2 2 c y 2 where u 0 0186 α u 9 5 ν 4 5 δ c l 4 5 δ c is the averaged concentration boundary layer thickness over x 0 l thus 5 δ c 1 l 0 l a x 4 5 d x 5 9 a l 4 5 eq 4 was first reshaped to a dimensionless form and subsequently solved to obtain the concentration field 6 c x y t c o c m c o u l 8 d e u l 2 d 1 e u x 2 d j y 2 d e y u 2 j 2 2 d 1 erf y 4 d t u 2 j 2 t 4 d e y u 2 j 2 2 d 1 e r f y 4 d t u 2 j 2 t 4 d the solution is detailed out in the supplementary section s 2 finally to develop the desired functional relation of the form f 1 j c m c p t 0 assumption 4 was invoked once again the assumption necessitates a perfect balance between the incoming and the outgoing solute fluxes at the membrane surface so 7 j c m c p d c y y 0 combining eqs 6 and 7 followed by further averaging of c y y 0 over x 0 l the functional relation becomes 8 j c m c p d c m c 0 4 j 2 d u 2 j 2 2 d erf u 2 j 2 t 4 d j 2 d u 2 j 2 2 d erf u 2 j 2 t 4 d 4 d π t e u 2 j 2 t 4 d j d 0 eq 8 represents an implicit functional relation between the dependent j c m c p and the independent t variables of the system during filtration however to solve for the individual profiles of j c m c p it is necessary to formulate two additional equations of the form f i j c m c p 0 i 2 3 this is discussed in the following subsection 3 1 1 incorporation of osmotic pressure and spiegler kedem black box models the osmotic pressure model describes a linear rate law of solvent transport through a membrane the flux expression according to the model is 9 j t m p σ π c m π c p μ r m the osmotic reflection coefficient σ describes the tendency of a solute to induce osmotic flow 36 the osmotic pressure was evaluated according to the following correlation for bsa 28 10 π r t m c 9 22 10 3 c 2 3 01 10 5 c 3 where r is the universal gas constant t is the absolute temperature and m is the molecular weight of bsa 66 5 103 da combining eqs 9 and 10 the second model equation i e f 2 j c m c p 0 becomes 11 j t m p σ r t m c m c p 1 9 22 10 3 c m c p 3 01 10 5 c m 2 c m c p c p 2 μ r m the third and final equation was directly obtained from the spiegler kedem black box model 37 the final model equation outlines a relationship between the real rejection i e r r 1 c p c m and the permeate flux j as 12 1 c p c m σ 1 f 1 σ f where f e x p 1 σ j p m and p m is the solute permeability coefficient eqs 8 11 and 12 constitute the complete set of model equations for the filtration run however to initialize the simulation of the second and the third filtration runs the membrane surface concentration at the beginning of each run must be evaluated for this purpose it is necessary to formulate a cleaning model a simple cleaning model based on the lumped parameter approach is described in the next section 3 2 cleaning model the desired outcome of the cleaning model is the membrane surface concentration at the end of the cleaning run otherwise the next filtration run cannot be initialized the unit produces no measurable output i e flux or permeate concentration during the cleaning experiment therefore the membrane surface concentration was considered as the single process variable of the cleaning model which cannot be directly measured the efficacy of the cleaning model can only be tested through the simulated flux profile of the next filtration run as the profile is functionally dependent on the initial condition i e fundamentally on the membrane surface and permeate concentrations permeate concentrations at the beginning of the filtration runs were fixed as c p 0 0 so the cleaning model should be entirely based on the dynamics of membrane surface concentration thus we have planned to adopt the simple lumped parameter approach to formulate the cleaning model the transience of c m c i e the membrane surface concentration during the cleaning run might be straightway formulated as 13 δ f d c m c d t j b t where δ f is the deposited protein layer thickness in the beginning of the cleaning run and j b t is the respective back transport flux of solutes during cleaning t is the local time variable for cleaning and t 0 t c where t c is the duration of the individual cleaning experiment we have assumed δ f to remain constant assumption 7 nevertheless the void fraction of the layer ε must be increasing as the proteins are continually scooped up from the layer the model picture is depicted in fig 3 the back transport flux was evaluated from the expression of the net force acting on the protein molecules in the deposited layer as j b t f n e t f 1 ε where f is the friction factor of the protein molecules the upward velocity of the molecules i e f n e t f was converted to the respective flux expression upon dividing the velocity by 1 ε which eventually changes the basis of the area from the total projected area of the protein molecules to the membrane surface area here we have assumed the volume and the surface porosities of the deposited layer to be identical assumption 8 the friction factor was determined from stokes law expression of f n e t was calculated as the resultant of i the reversed basket rotation induced hydrodynamic draft f p ii the mean shear induced lift f l and iii the appropriate component of the cohesive interaction f c o h e s i v e t between the adjacent protein molecules trapped in the deposited layer accordingly f n e t f p f l f c o h e s i v e t eventually to account for the possible non idealities a correction factor β was introduced the final form of the model equation becomes 14 δ f d c m c d t β ρ b s a 6 π μ a f l f p f c o h e s i v e t c m c c m c where a is the approximate radius of the bsa molecule δ f was evaluated considering a force equilibrium between the cohesive interaction and the lift force at the end of the previous filtration run eq 14 was initialized as t 0 c m c c m t f where c m t f represents the membrane surface concentration at the end of the previous filtration run the detailed formulation of the cleaning model is presented in the supplementary section s 3 4 simulation scheme transient profiles of j c m and c p during the filtration run were simulated by solving eqs 8 11 and 12 simultaneously the multivariate newton raphson scheme was employed for this purpose complete profiles were generated by repeatedly solving the set of equations over t 0 t f for all filtration experiments the permeate flux was observed to attain its quasi steady state around 120 min therefore we have chosen t f to be 120 min time increment δ t to execute repeated solution was fixed at 1 min the choice of δt did not introduce any significant variation in the individual profiles as eq 8 is explicit in time and the set of equations is devoid of any time derivative terms the first filtration run m a r k e d a s i 1 w h e r e i i s t h e r u n i n d e x was initialized as c m i 1 j 1 c 0 c p i 1 j 1 0 j i 1 j 1 t m p σ π m c 0 μ r m it is imperative to note that t 0 corresponds to j 1 where j is the discrete experimental data point index for the second and the third filtration runs c m was obtained from the simulation of the previous cleaning run i e c m i j 1 c m c i 1 t c where i 2 or 3 however c p i j 1 was always set to zero irrespective of i i e c p i j 1 0 initial permeate flux in the second or the third filtration run was evaluated from the osmotic pressure model using appropriate values of c m and c p once a specific filtration run was fully simulated corresponding quasi steady protein layer thickness δ f was solved according to the force equilibrium condition f c o h e s i v e t d f l δ f the method is elaborated in supplementary section s 3 for the cleaning runs profiles of c m c i over t 0 t c was simulated upon solving eq 14 by 4th order runge kutta method unlike filtration reliability of the cleaning run simulation heavily depends on the time increment δ t considering the short duration of cleaning operation t c 300 s we have chosen δ t to be 1 s cleaning was initialized as c m c i 0 c m i j 9 where j 9 corresponds to t t f the present simulation scheme requires the prior estimations of the parameters present in eqs 8 11 12 and 14 collectively the parameter set includes μ d r m σ ρ b s a n a ϕ a h corresponding measures are discussed in supplementary section s 4 additionally the model equations also include two adjustable parameters α and β according to their definitions the adjustable parameters are expected to be dependent on the respective process parameters filtration run parameter α was considered as α α t m p ω c 0 on the other hand the cleaning run parameter β was apprehended to depend on ω c and c 0 only as t m p 0 during the cleaning experiments table 1 both α and β were evaluated upon minimizing the following objective functions e and e c respectively which are equivalent to the sum of the square error sse of model predicted flux with respect to experimental flux e α is defined as 15 e α i 1 n j 1 m 1 j m o d e l i j j e x p i j 2 where j 1 to m is the discrete experimental data point index and i 1 to n is the filtration run index consequently j i j represents the permeate flux value at j t h data point of i t h filtration run of a specific experiment according to the present experimental design m 9 and n 3 e c β was also defined similar to e α nevertheless correct estimation of β is expected to simulate the membrane surface concentration at the end of cleaning run i e c m c t c which must lead to minimum sse between experimental and simulated flux values in the beginning i e j 1 of the next filtration run i 1 therefore 16 e c β i 1 2 1 j m o d e l i 1 j 1 c m c i t c j e x p i 1 j 1 2 both e α and e c β were minimized by the well known direct search method 38 a detailed flowchart of the present simulation scheme is depicted in fig 4 5 results and discussion the sbm filtration pilot was simulated under a different set of t m p ω and c 0 table 1 to obtain the transient profiles of j c m and c p over the three sequential filtration runs the adjustable parameters i e α and β were appropriately tuned to minimize e α and e c β the response surface methodology rsm was used to decipher the functional relations between the adjustable and the operating parameters furthermore the standard correlation between the time averaged permeate flux j and the mean membrane shear rate γ was also tested for the present module all dse modules introduced so far exhibit a non trivial power law type correlation between the flux and the membrane shear rate i e j γ n where n varies within the range of 0 42 to 0 55 19 accordingly for the stress enhancement characterization and also for the development of the appropriate scale up relation j vs γ correlation study has been performed in the following subsections the outcomes of those investigations are discussed 5 1 flux profiles for all filtration runs the quasi steady state was achieved at about 120 m i n the flux profiles tentatively indicate a first order type decline from the very beginning of the filtration experiment corresponding profiles under varied conditions of t m p ω and c o are depicted in fig 5 a i a iii respectively flux decline was noted to vary from 10 to 22 the overall decline for 360 m i n of filtration which consisted of three successive filtration and two intermediate cleaning runs was limited to 30 only low flux decline may be regarded as an outcome of the dynamic shear enhancement during the filtration run and the intermediate flux regeneration because of the cleaning runs reversed basket rotation induced cleaning runs each of only 5 min duration could regenerate the flux by 15 20 the observation indicates a marginally small i e 1 5 flux decline after each filtration cleaning cycle usual variations were recorded with the change of operating conditions for example quasi steady flux at the end of the first filtration run i e j t t f increased by 65 for a change of t m p from 1 k g f c m 2 to 5 k g f c m 2 with otherwise unchanged process condition c o 2 w and ω 20 95 r a d s 1 similarly for the full scale parametric change of ω i e 10 47 41 90 r a d s 1 j t t f was recorded to increase by 105 145 under different conditions of t m p and c o flux was noted to be highly sensitive towards any change of ω which clearly displayed the dynamic shear enhancement feature of the present module prevalently high membrane shear may be further justified in terms of nominal flux reduction i e 8 10 for a change of feed concentration from 1 4 w simulated flux profiles were reasonably close to the experimental dataset for all the filtration cleaning experiments the maximum absolute error was 12 whereas the average error was estimated to be 5 6 to understand the error trend we have included the transient profiles of 1 j m o d e l j e x p 2 in the same figure fig 5 b closer investigation indicates relatively large square errors in the beginning and towards the terminal stages of filtration notably the first filtration run was initialized as c m 0 c 0 and c p 0 0 subsequently the initial flux was solved using the osmotic pressure model eq 11 on the other hand j e x p 0 was measured upon collecting 5 c m 3 of permeate the corresponding time of collection was in the order of few seconds even over the small time interval concentration polarization may be apprehended to influence the system dynamics cp is instantaneous by nature while membrane fouling is a slow and long term phenomenon 4 rd filtration system has been confirmed to attain the steady state of cp around 200 s in reverse osmosis 39 therefore at the beginning of the filtration experiments the experimental flux values were expected to deviate from the simulated profile largely a similar explanation regarding the divergent experimental data points from the simulated flux profiles is also pertinent for the second and the third filtration runs moreover the initial membrane surface concentrations for the subsequent filtration runs were simulated using the cleaning model consequently the actual c m deviates from the simulated c m because of the nearly instantaneous polarization effect once the system was switched to the next filtration run upon adjusting the tmp and the rotational speed we have used a lumped correction factor β in the cleaning model which was supposed to account for all the model exclusive non idealities in a collective sense nevertheless force expressions needed individual corrections for example the non dlvo forces 40 which majorly contribute to the cohesive interaction of proteins were not considered in the present model this was completely unavoidable because no explicit non dlvo force expression between the bsa molecules was reported so far similarly in the case of f l the velocity term was directly substituted as u c without introducing any additional correction factor thus due to cp s instantaneous nature and the lumped adjustable parameter used in the cleaning model simulated profiles seemed to moderately deviate from the experimental data points over the initial phases of filtration conversely in the intermediate regime over t m i n 10 45 normalized square error profiles passed through their respective minimum accordingly the model may be inferred to simulate the system with the maximum level of accuracy when the cp had attained its steady state and the membrane fouling was still passing through its transience the extended transience of the fouling process is justified by the slow but progressive trend of flux decline beyond t 45 m i n the difference of the simulated flux from the corresponding experimental data was also noted to increase after t 45 m i n the increasing transient error was continued till the quasi steady state was reached fig 5 b this is also quite evident as the phenomenon of membrane fouling was not separately accounted in the filtration model cp was explicitly incorporated through the convection diffusion equation i e eq 8 however membrane fouling was not furthermore in the cleaning model the structure of the deposited protein layer was grossly simplified consequently the simulated flux is bound to deviate from the experimental data points when membrane fouling started governing the system dynamics yet for the three successive filtration runs the proposed analytical model simulated the sbm pilot with a maximum average absolute error of less than 6 this clearly justifies the validity of the proposed model besides it is a first of its kind attempt to simulate the dynamics of the sbm pilot the module is structurally and operationally much more complex than the other baseline dse filtration systems therefore a maximum absolute error of 12 and a maximum average absolute error of 6 in flux simulation are pretty acceptable in addition to the permeate flux the membrane surface and the permeate concentrations are also simulated dynamic profiles of c m and c p are discussed in the following section 5 2 membrane surface and permeate concentration profiles dynamic profiles of c m over the first three filtration run for all the operating conditions were similar fig 6 a all profiles were noted to grow rapidly from the beginning and the state of maximum concentration was achieved near the quasi steady state for example at t m p 2 k g f c m 2 c 0 2 w and ω 20 95 r a d s 1 simulation results indicate an increase of c m by 50 k g m 3 from the beginning t 0 c m c 0 20 k g m 3 to the quasi steady state of the first filtration run t 120 m i n t f c m 70 k g m 3 in all cases more than 90 of the simulated growth was observed over the first 30 min the specific trend once again confirms the instantaneous nature of cp rapidly increasing profiles from the initial stages of filtration signifies high solute accumulation at the membrane surface membrane fouling also operates in parallel though it is a much slower process than the cp so the dynamics of c m is likely to be governed by cp in the early stages of filtration i e f o r t 30 m i n whereas during the latter half slow but steady growth of c m demonstrates fouling to be dominant all c m profiles were purely simulated corresponding validity check was beyond the scope of the present investigation the reported methods of membrane surface concentration measurement are technically complex and it is practically impossible to measure c m even in the case of the simplest dse module e g stirred cell or rd filtration unit as it consists of either a high speed stirrer or a flat rotating disk close to the membrane surface the proposed filtration model does not explicitly account for the membrane fouling it is fundamentally based on concentration polarization nevertheless fouling was implicit in the model picture it has been viewed as a phenomenological extension of cp without considering the thermodynamic irreversibility directly irreversibility was incorporated through the spiegler kedem black box model thus we may conclude that instead of the sharp growth of solute concentration at the interface between the fouled and the polarized layer we have considered a smooth and progressively growing concentration profile this is apprehended to yield an underpredicted profile of c m unlike c m the simulated profiles of c p were compared with the experimental data fig 6 b the overall trend of permeate concentration was quite close to that of c m however with widely different maximum values for example in a filtration run with t m p 2 k g f c m 2 c 0 2 w and ω 20 95 r a d s 1 the experimental c p grew up from 0 25 k g m 3 at t 0 to 0 89 k g m 3 at t 120 m i n which corresponded to a real rejection r r 1 c p c m of 98 7 the observed rejection r 0 1 c p c 0 was found to be 95 5 for all other parametric conditions both r r and r 0 were found to be higher than 93 high percent rejection is a typical feature of dse modules for instance in reverse osmosis of simulated brackish water using a vsep unit mean r 0 for the common ions n a m g 2 c a 2 c l etc was reported to be greater than 95 whereas without vibration r 0 was even lower than 75 for some of the ions 41 similarly in the recovery of glucuronane polysaccharides from fermentation broth more than 90 rejection was achieved with rd module 42 the present results of high r r and r 0 alternatively justify the dynamic shear enhancement characteristics of the sbm module simulated profiles were noted to overpredict c p the trend of overprediction was quite prominent towards the quasi steady state maximum positive deviation was found to be about 8 in reverse simulated profiles underpredicted c p over the initial phases of filtration the maximum underprediction was consistently below 10 the trend of deviation is just opposite to the results of flux simulation fig 5 a the root cause of underprediction lies in the initialization scheme permeate concentration was assumed to be zero c p 0 in the beginning of all filtration runs furthermore c p was also measured from the same 5 c m 3 of the collected permeate sample as used for flux measurement consequently an inconsistency between the time scale of data recording and the time scale associated with the dynamics of c p was quite evident over the later stages of filtration the deviation was majorly due to the fouling process which was not explicitly accounted for in the present formulation yet the maximum errors were limited within 10 for c p and within 12 for the permeate flux the results validate the current model instead of its relatively sizeable absolute error because of the following reasons i this is a first of its kind mathematical model for a new class of dse filtration units with inbuilt hydrodynamic provision for membrane cleaning ii the hydrodynamic picture of the module is quite complicated iii very few analytical models of dse modules are available in the literature 5 3 variations of α and β with the process parameters the adjustable parameters i e α and β were noted to be heavily dependent on the operating parameters therefore appropriate functional forms i e α α t m p ω c 0 and β β ω c c 0 were considered to determine the exact correlations as discussed earlier for the correlation study the popular technique of response surface methodology rsm was used four different multivariable regression models namely i linear ii quadratic iii two factor interaction 2fi and iv cubic were individually tested for both the parameters the 2fi model was identified to be the most suitable in describing the parametric dependence of α the model selection was followed by the detailed analysis of variance anova the anova outcomes for α in brief are presented in table 2 the high f value implies the model to be significant besides high r 2 and its closeness with adjusted r 2 suggest the presence of non redundant terms only in the model equation the closeness of r 2 and adjusted r 2 is regarded as a marker of a regression model with significant terms only 43 t m p and ω were identified to be the most significant terms as indicated by the corresponding f values mixed quadratic term of t m p and ω t m p ω was also found to be influential three dimensional mesh plots of α are shown in fig 7 a i iii the corresponding response equation is 17 α 0 45033 0 18853 t m p 0 031697 ω 0 033378 c 0 0 034026 t m p ω 0 011833 t m p c 0 1 78104 10 3 ω c 0 fig 7 a represents the monotonically increasing trend of α with t m p and ω whereas it is nearly independent of c 0 for example at a fixed parametric condition ω and c 0 ω 41 9 r a d s 1 and c 0 4 w α was noted to change form 2 1 to 8 05 for change of t m p over 1 5 k g f c m 2 similar variations were also observed for ω as well high tmp and ω are expected to scale up the turbulence even close to the membrane surface it also intensified the eddy diffusion of momentum in the neighborhood of the basket arm tip besides the circulation velocity of vortices swirls and periodic secondary flows were also seemed to increase with t m p and ω this has also been established in our previous study 22 enhanced circulation velocity positively augmented the free stream velocity component of the flow through the gap between the arm tip and the cylindrical casing consequently the effective free stream velocity i e u became two to eightfold higher than its theoretical estimate i e α 2 8 conversely at the lower side values of the same operating parameters for instance at t m p 1 k g f c m 2 and ω 10 47 r a d s 1 α was found to be lower than unity i e α 0 6 this signifies a negative augmentation of the baseline free stream velocity over the entire parametric space α was identified to vary between 0 6 and 8 05 accordingly we have o α 1 as considered in the present model the simple hydrodynamic picture seems to be quite effective in describing the system as the respective adjustable parameter was found to be localized in the neighborhood of unity thus the model predicted velocity field is close to the actual one at least within the concentration boundary layer formed over the membrane surface similar to α rsm based multivariate regression analysis was also performed for β the cubic model was found to be most suitable in describing the functional form once again detailed anova was carried out for β as well some of the key results are presented in table 2 ω c and ω c 3 were identified to be the most significant terms as indicated by the respective f values which were followed by linear concentration term c 0 the model equation is 18 β 2 53426 0 27685 ω c 0 33332 c 0 7 16804 10 3 ω c c 0 0 013747 ω c 2 0 14998 c 0 2 9 13970 10 5 ω c 2 c 0 4 78101 10 4 ω c c 0 2 1 67795 10 4 ω c 3 0 016667 c 0 3 the corresponding three dimensional mesh plots are depicted in fig 7 b β was noted to increase with both ω c and c 0 nevertheless the parameter was found to be strongly dependent on ω c both f l and f p were found to share power law type functional relations with ω i e f l ω c 2 7 and f p ω c 2 as described in supplementary section s 3 whereas f c o h e s i v e t was only dependent on c 0 although indirectly any increase in c 0 is expected to increase c m fig 6 a the protein protein distance of separation d decreased with increasing c m according to eq s 23 in the supplementary section s 3 which resulted in higher f d l v o d fig s 3 b and finally to increased f c o h e s i v e t as per eq s 20 in supplementary section s 3 therefore c 0 is anticipated to weakly influence β relative to ω c so the trends of β with ω and c 0 as obtained from rsm analysis are qualitatively justified β was noted to achieve its maximum 3 6 at c 0 4 k g m 3 and ω c 41 9 r a d s 1 on the other hand the lowest β 0 8 was found at c 0 1 k g m 3 and ω c 10 47 r a d s 1 thus o β 1 which is similar to the order of magnitude of α the order of magnitude analysis for both the adjustable parameters justifies the viability of the present model in describing the filtration cleaning cycle of the sbm module 5 4 flux shear relationship the flux shear rate correlation is considered to be one of the central characteristics of any dse module generally the correlation follows a power law type functional relation 19 j k γ n where γ is the shear rate commonly expressed in s 1 and flux j is represented in l m 2 h 1 we have chosen the same units for standardization and comparative analysis 44 the exponent n quantifies the functional sensitivity whereas k is the shear rate independent limiting flux for dse modules n was reported to vary between 0 186 and 1 56 19 the parameter is independent of the rotational speed in cases of rd and msd pilots the frequency of vibration in vsep modules and the size of the device nevertheless it strongly depends on the type of feed concentration and membrane pore size the power law correlation is generally estimated from the experimental flux data set and theoretically evaluated shear rate for instance bouzerar et al have used the navier stokes equation to calculate the local shear rate close to the membrane surface of an rd module operating in the laminar regime whereas the blasius friction factor was used to determine γ when the same unit operates in the turbulent regime 45 currently γ was estimated from the expression of x directional velocity component u as described in section 3 1 within the concentration boundary layer y δ c the following expression of u was obtained 20 u 0 0297 u 9 5 ν 4 5 y x 1 5 differentiating eq 20 with respect to y and averaging the expression over x 0 l the mean shear rate γ becomes 21 γ 0 037 u 9 5 l 4 5 ν 4 5 so γ α ω 9 5 moreover α was solved to be dependent on t m p ω and c 0 eq 17 accordingly γ γ t m p ω c 0 a closer inspection of eq 17 revealed that α may be fairly approximated as α a 1 t m p a 2 ω where a 1 and a 2 are the appropriate regression coefficients because t m p and ω were identified to be the two most significant terms of the regression model table 2 consequently γ a 1 t m p a 2 ω 9 5 ω 9 5 and the term with the highest exponent value of ω in γ v s ω correlation becomes ω 3 6 in all other existing dse modules the exponent was reported to be lower than 2 for instance in rd pilot γ ω 1 5 whereas for the rotating disk membrane modules γ ω 1 8 19 similarly maximum shear rate γ m is proportional to ω 1 5 in case of vsep modules with ω being the angular frequency the analysis signifies a much higher production of shear in the sbm pilot relative to other dse modules therefore we have operated the module with a relatively lower operating speed i e 100 400 rpm whereas other dse filtration devices are generally operated in the range of 750 2000 rpm 46 even with such a low operating speed the sbm pilot can generate a maximum shear rate of 1 7 10 5 s 1 which is well within the range of γ produced by a high speed msd pilot i e between 10 5 to 4 10 5 s 1 19 the results explicitly demonstrate the novelty of the design in shear generation the average of the three quasi steady flux data was evaluated at the end of the corresponding filtration runs for a specific operating condition to determine the flux shear rate correlation thus a set of 64 data points n 64 in the form of j vs γ was generated the flux shear rate characterization experiments were conducted at four discrete points for each of the three operating parameters contrary to the set of filtration cleaning experiments which consists of only ten n 10 experimental runs table 1 hence the j vs γ dataset must consist of 4 3 64 number of data points the average flux was evaluated as j 1 3 j t 120 j t 245 j t 370 j vs γ data points were plotted in a double logarithmic phase plane subsequently regression analysis was carried out to check the validity of the power law fit the results are presented in fig 8 high correlation coefficient r 2 0 98 substantiates the following correlation 22 j 32 48 γ 0 19 the low value of n signifies a low sensitivity of j in relation to γ a similar small exponent has also been reported in microfiltration mf for instance in mf of yeast suspension using rd and vsep pilots the exponent was noted to vary from 0 18 to 0 19 44 in protein uf the exponent varies between 0 43 to 1 257 llow exponent value is seemingly disadvantageous however this is adequately compensated by high limiting flux coefficient k 32 48 l m 2 h 1 a large k value is a characteristic feature of dse systems in mf for instance mf of caco3 suspension using an msd pilot was noted to have a similar limiting flux 38 26 l m 2 h 1 47 on the other hand dse nanofiltration nf units generally operate with low k nf of uht skimmed milk in vibrating disk system was reported to have k 3 10 4 l m 2 h 1 44 high k and low n value is advantageous from the standpoint of specific energy demand the present module can produce reasonably high flux 100 l m 2 h 1 at the cost of low power budget our previous investigation has established the specific energy demand of the sbm pilot to be proportional to ω 22 fig 8 also indicates no significant alteration of j vs γ profile with the change of feed concentration additionally the present values of k and n do not corroborate with the reported empirical correlation i e k 10 2 5 n 44 however sbm is not the only exception the correlation is violated by msd filtration systems as well 6 conclusion nearly a decade ago we proposed the design of a dynamic shear enhanced filtration device with an inbuilt membrane cleaning facility the unit was named as spinning basket membrane sbm module the sbm pilot was characterized in ultrafiltration of different synthetic wastewater streams 20 22 an elementary mathematical model was also previously developed to simulate the flux profile under steady state 24 closer investigation revealed that the perpetual sequence of filtration and cleaning operations majorly limits the scope of the unsteady state model formulation in this work we have presented an unsteady state mathematical model of the sbm filtration unit capable of simulating the flux and the permeate concentration for any number of sequential filtration cleaning cycles the overall formulation consists of i a distributed parameter filtration model and ii a lumped parameter cleaning model the model consists of two adjustable parameters simulated flux and concentration profiles were in good agreement with the experimental data obtained from ultrafiltration of protein bearing synthetic wastewater the average absolute deviation for the permeate flux was well below 6 for permeate concentration the error was also found to be less than 8 mathematical models are essential for understanding scale up and upgradation any process device the present two parameter model can simulate a complex membrane filtration device in protein recovery from synthetic wastewater with reasonable accuracy the mathematical framework only requires the systematic solution of four simultaneous equations to obtain the transient flux and the permeate concentration profiles in repeated filtration cleaning cycles under varied parametric conditions from a broader perspective the current approach demonstrates a viable modelling strategy of a complex process device simply upon exploring the basic physics of the system declaration of competing interest the

13451,iron impregnated biochar fe bc was developed through one step pyrolysis characterized and directly compared with fe impregnated activated carbon fe ac for the removal of methylene blue mb in a heterogeneous fenton reaction hfr fe bc exhibited significantly higher fe impregnation efficiency than fe ac at the same pyrolysis temperature of 600 c analyses via x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and raman spectroscopy revealed that both fe bc and fe ac contained fe species such as fe3o4 feooh and fe2o3 with fe bc having significantly more reduced fe ii than fe ac this result is clear evidence that fe bc had better catalytic activity for mb than fe ac the removal efficiencies of mb and total organic carbon by fe bc and fe ac prepared with optimum fe impregnation concentration 0 25 m fe were 98 3 and 46 3 respectively in particular fe bc removal of mb was predominantly by degradation due to the hfr while adsorption was dominant in the case of fe ac in particular fe bc 0 25 m fe impregnation showed higher mb treatment efficiency 65 7 and stable release of fe ions 2 mg l compared to fe ac during 5 consecutive hfr reactions low temperature fe ac prepared at 200 c showed poor fe impregnation and instability for reusability in view of the above results the developed fe bc can be used as an economic catalyst because it has superior stability and recyclability for treating recalcitrant pollutants compared to fe ac keywords fenton like reaction recalcitrant pollutants impregnation and pyrolysis agricultural residue heterogeneous fenton reaction 1 introduction the fenton reaction with fe ii and h2o2 is one of the faster and more economical advanced oxidation processes aops for treating recalcitrant wastewater including organic pollutants 1 3 fenton reagents such as h2o2 and fe ii fe iii have been used as powerful sources of hydroxy radicals in the fenton reaction 4 5 the reaction between fe ii and h2o2 generates hydroxyl radicals eq 1 while fe iii reacts with h2o2 to induce the regeneration of fe ii to prolong the fenton reaction eqs 2 and 3 1 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh 2 fe iii h2o2 fe ooh 2 h 3 fe ooh 2 fe ii oh2 treatment of recalcitrant pollutants using the conventional fenton reaction requires large amounts of fenton reagents such as h2o2 and fe ii as well as adjusting the ph to 2 5 3 0 the disadvantage of the homogeneous fenton reaction is that the dissolved fe cannot be recycled because of the difficulty in separating fe in salts and sludge after wastewater treatment especially iron rich sludge discharged from the conventional fenton oxidation process has been regarded as a secondary pollutant 6 7 owing to these issues hfr using fe impregnated solid support catalysts which enhance the recycling of fe promoters with little or no sludge formation have been developed 8 today catalysts composed of carbon such as graphene carbon nanotubes and activated carbon ac are attracting attention for their excellent properties such as acid base resistance and high thermal stability 6 9 10 most importantly the carbon materials mentioned has an extensive surface area therefore it will be enhancing the activity of fe catalysts such as fe oxide by enhancing their dispersibility and preventing agglomeration several researchers developed a carbon catalyst having magnetic property through fe incorporation in ac which can be easily separated and recovered by material that exhibit magnetism 5 11 these fe impregnated ac fe ac have exhibited excellent catalytic activity in the removal of various dyes nevertheless two thermal treatment steps are required to manufacturing fe ac one to prepare the ac and the other to impregnate fe into ac which increases the overall cost of catalyst preparation feedstock pyrolysis ac ac with fe source re pyrolysis fe ac for this reason the fe ac manufacturing process is known to be complex and could hinder its production and use 6 12 therefore in order to remove recalcitrant organic pollutants using hrf containing a carbon catalyst the development of a new carbon based catalyst with a simple and inexpensive manufacturing process is urgently required for the past decade biochar bc has been attracting attention from many researchers as an inexpensive carbon material and their application to wastewater treatment has been classified as a promising technology in the future 13 it has the capability to adsorb various organic pollutants because of its reasonably high surface area 14 15 however the adsorption of organic pollutants by bc often cannot completely remove and its adsorption efficiency is significantly reduced at high concentrations of pollutants especially recalcitrant pollutants such as dyes 16 furthermore recalcitrant pollutants such as dyes adsorbed onto bc are difficult to desorb thereby limiting their recycling potential in this paper we present the development of a bc based catalyst by a one step thermal process to impregnate fe into a carbon matrix with the aim of applying it in the hfr we hypothesize that this fe impregnated bc fe bc will offer the combined advantages of an inexpensive carbon material and magnetic properties considering the direct impregnation of fe into the porous bc structure we further hypothesize that the process will be more efficient in incorporating fe into the carbon matrix this along with the magnetic features will allow fe bc to maintain high catalytic activity stability and reusability in the hfr in previous studies the catalytic activity of fe bc was reported for the removal of non degradable pollutants like metronidazole trichloroethylene acid orange 7 and bisphenol a 17 20 however most studies have been conducted with a focus on the amounts of fe bc and oxidizing agents to treat specific pollutants to our knowledge there has been no direct comparison of catalytic efficiency between fe bc and fe ac in order to secure the economy and marketability of fe bc in the carbon based catalyst industry in the future it is necessary to compare and evaluate the catalytic activity of fe bc against non degradable pollutants with fe ac prepared under the same conditions therefore the objective of this study is to compare the physicochemical properties of fe bc and fe ac prepared under the same conditions and evaluate the mb degradation removal efficiency of methylene blue mb a model recalcitrant organic pollutant in a hfr 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of catalysts sugarcane harvest residue shr collected from the louisiana state university agcenter sugar research station at st gabriel louisiana usa was used to produce fe bc using a slow muffle furnace pyrolyzer in brief shr was first rinsed with deionized water oven dried at 60 c and ground to pass through a 0 5 mm sieve fe bc was prepared by impregnation pyrolysis specifically 30 g of shr was mixed with a series of 500 ml solutions containing 0 063 0 750 m feso4 in a glass beaker 1 l the mixtures were stirred for 24 h and oven dried at 60 c for 24 h the dried fe impregnated shr samples were placed in porcelain crucibles each with a cover and pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace fa 1730 thermolyne sybron corporation dubuque ia under limited oxygen conditions with purged nitrogen gas the controller of the furnace was programmed to increase the internal chamber temperature to 600 c at approximately 10 c min this was maintained for 4 h the resulting fe bc was cooled and stored in an airtight container before use in the case of fe ac ac was purchased from mallinckrodt st louis mo and the fe impregnation process was performed in the same manner and concentration as the fe bc process described above in this study xfe ac and xfe bc were named to clearly distinguish between catalyst and fe impregnation concentration where x represents the impregnation concentration of fe 2 2 characterization of catalysts the yield and ash content of fe bc and fe ac were calculated as follows 4 yield wfe bc and fe ac wfe impregnated shr and ac 100 5 ash content wash wfe bc and fe ac 100 where wfe bc and ac wash and wfe impregnated shr and ac are the dry weight g of fe bc and ac ash and its fe impregnated feedstock and ac respectively the fe contents in fe bc and fe ac were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes after digestion according to the epa 3050b method total c and n contents in fe bc and fe ac were analyzed using a flashea 1112 elemental analyzer thermo finnigan italy the specific surface area total pore volume tpv and micropore volume of fe bc and fe ac were determined by asap 2020 m analyzer micromeritics instrument corp usa x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps using a kratos axis ultra dld spectrometer with an al k x ray source was employed to analyze fe chemistry on the surface of fe bc and fe ac the specific structures and compositions of fe bc and fe ac were determined by sem jeol 6335 f and ft raman spectroscopy varian ft raman the samples were placed in a capillary tube and analyzed using a powerful laser x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy xanes of the fe bc and fe ac samples was performed at the lsu synchrotron using the ge 220 double crystal monochromator dcm beamline with a k edge energy range set from 6917 to 8090 ev hematite fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 fe oxide hydroxide feooh feo ferrous sulfate feso4 and ferric sulfate fe2 so4 3 were used as references for fe ii or and fe iii respectively the data were processed background subtraction deglitching and linear combination fitting using athena software 21 2 3 performance of catalysts experiments for the catalytic activity of fe bc and fe ac were evaluated using methylene blue a common recalcitrant toxic dye with high solubility which has a detrimental effect on humans and is known to be discharged from various industrial facilities 22 the catalyzed removal of mb was determined by weighing 0 5 g l of fe bc and fe ac derived at different fe impregnation concentrations in glass erlenmeyer flasks followed by adding 100 ml of solutions containing 0 1 g l mb the initial ph of each mixture was adjusted to 4 by the dropwise addition of 0 1 m hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide solution followed by the addition of 0 075 g l h2o2 the reaction was allowed to proceed for 8 h under stirring after all these reactions the samples were centrifuged 4000 rpm 10 min and the supernatants were analyzed for residual mb concentration using a thermo scientific evo 60 visible spectrophotometer usa at 668 nm the residual total organic carbon toc in the mixture solutions after the reaction was determined using a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu japan the concentration of fe released in the solution after the reaction was analyzed by icp aes 2 4 stability and recyclability the stability and recyclability of fe bc and fe ac were evaluated by investigating the catalytic activity in successive reactions and reuse after separation after the first run both mb and h2o2 were added to maintain the same pollutant and oxidant strength for successive run of the fe bc catalyst as in the first run in addition for better comparison both fe bc and fe ac produced with 0 25 m and 0 50 m fe impregnation solutions were used further because thermal treatment of ac for fe impregnation was frequently conducted at low temperatures such as 200 c 23 the evaluation of fe ac was also carried out with the sample produced at 200 c pyrolysis temperature which was named fe ac200 to distinguish it from fe ac prepared at 600 c in addition the stability of each catalyst was evaluated by measuring the concentration of fe released during the successive reactions containing each catalyst 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of physicochemical characteristics the physicochemical properties of fe bc and fe ac are listed in table 1 for convenience of comparison only the properties of fe bc and fe ac produced during fe impregnation using 0 25 m feso4 which yielded high catalytic activity with low fe release are given the yields of fe bc and fe ac were 34 9 and 72 3 respectively in the case of ac since the first pyrolysis had already carbonized most of the organic substances the yield of fe ac in the second thermal treatment was lower than that of ac the ash content of bc before and after fe impregnation was 20 1 and 32 2 respectively the ash content increased due to fe impregnation in bc a similar result was also observed with activated bc before and after fe impregnation on the other hand the ash content of raw bc was higher than that of ac because ac is mostly composed of carbon while bc contains various inorganic components such as k ca mg and na 24 25 in addition the ash content of bc is dominantly influenced by the characteristics of raw materials agricultural byproducts such as sugarcane residues used in this experiment are known to have a higher content of inorganic components than ac based on woody biomass 14 the c content in fe bc and fe ac was 44 6 and 68 9 respectively which were lower than those of bc and ac in particular the c content of fe bc decreased by 33 9 compared to that of bc this is because the impregnation of fe in the bc surface was more than that of fe ac which decreased by 10 9 compared to that of ac the fe content in fe bc 15 6 was approximately twice as high as that in fe ac 8 4 this result confirms our hypothesis that one step pyrolysis can increase fe impregnation efficiency the specific surface areas of bc and fe bc were similar to 224 6 m2 g and 210 2 m2 g respectively however the tpv of fe bc was higher than that of bc by 14 0 1755 vs 0 1521 cm3 g while its microspore volume was slightly lower table 1 it is believed that the melting and volatilization of ferric sulfate feso47 h2o used for fe impregnation of feedstock biomass during pyrolysis helps generate more tpv in the fe bc this suggests that fe impregnation tended to increase macropores in bc a result that was also observed previously 12 on the other hand the tpv of fe ac decreased slightly compared to that of ac corresponding to a decrease in the specific surface area table 1 such a decrease in tpv was likely due to the adhesion of fe and s to the ac surface because the pores were well developed during the manufacturing of ac 26 these results showed different influences of fe impregnation in preparing fe bc and fe ac the microscopic results of bc and ac before and after iron impregnation are shown in fig 1 after iron impregnation both bc and ac were found to have more finer particles than those before iron impregnation which is believed to have contributed to various iron oxides xanes was used to investigate the fe oxidation state and structure in the bulk samples of fe bc and fe ac and the results are shown in fig 2 the main adsorption peaks were observed at 7133 ev for both fe bc and fe ac which were clearly correlated with hematite fe2o3 and ferrihydrite feooh used as reference materials on the other hand the reference compound magnetite fe3o4 which consists of both fe ii and fe iii was assigned a peak at 7130 ev and feo was present at 7127 ev as the fe ions were converted to oxidized forms the main adsorption peaks were observed at higher energy levels shifting from the fe ii peak to fe iii peaks as indicated by the binding energies of 7127 7133 ev which are associated with ferrous sulfate and ferric sulfate respectively this result shows that most of the fe species in bulk fe bc and fe ac exist in the form of fe iii however when comparing pre edge features of fe adsorption at 7114 7115 ev fe bc and fe ac showed characteristics at the same energies as magnetite and ferrihydrite these results prove that the fe species in fe bc and fe ac produced by impregnation and pyrolysis were distributed fe2o3 and feooh as well as fe3o4 the post edge feature of fe adsorption around 7148 ev binding energy in fe ac also proved that most fe species in fe ac are fe iii forms 27 fdez gubieda et al 28 reported that higher energy in the edge point absorption curve indicates more oxidation the edge point adsorption curves of all reference materials except feo exist between ferrous sulfate and ferric sulfate characterized by fe ii and fe iii in particular our results show that the absorption curves of fe ac reach the edge point with higher energy as compared to fe bc which suggests that the fe form in the bulk sample of fe ac is more oxidized than that of fe bc xps was used to distinguish the surface chemical differences between fe bc and fe ac the carbon distribution in fe bc and fe ac through xps is shown in fig 3 a and b the peaks at binding energies of 284 8 286 0 288 8 and 292 7 ev are assigned to cc co co and coo respectively 29 the distribution of carbon in both fe bc and fe ac was similar and a difference was only observed in the coo peak in fe bc on the other hand the distribution of oxygen on the fe bc surface showed completely different characteristics when compared with fe ac fig 3c and d in general the o1s peaks at binding energies of 530 4 532 0 533 5 and 535 2 ev correspond to oxygen in co o i coc o ii coo o iii and h2o o iv groups respectively 30 in terms of fe oxides the peaks at 530 532 and 533 ev can be assigned to the lattice oxygen atoms binding with fe fe o lattice hydroxyl groups fe ohlattice in feooh and adsorbed hydroxyl groups fe ohad respectively 31 in our results the peaks related to coc o ii 68 6 assigned to 532 ev in fe bc was the main component followed by o iii 20 4 and o i 7 3 the relative distributions of o i o ii and o iii on fe ac were found to be 35 5 42 7 and 9 01 respectively among which o i and o ii are the dominant forms fig 2c vs fig 2d as a result of o1s by xps the surface of fe bc was predominantly distributed with feooh and fe ac was closely related to fe oxides such as hematite and magnetite the main peaks of high resolution xps for fe were observed at 710 9 711 4 ev fe 2p3 2 and 724 4 724 9 ev fe 2p1 2 in the fe2p spectra of fe bc and fe ac fig 3e vs f specifically the assigned peaks at binding energies of 709 4 and 710 8 ev in fe bc and fe ac are related to fe ii and fe iii in fe3o4 fe2p3 2 respectively considering the chemical structure of fe3o4 the ratio of fe iii fe ii is 2 1 in particular the ratio of fe iii fe ii was about 2 1 in the xps results of graphene impregnated fe3o4 nanocrystals 32 in our study the area ratio of fe iii fe ii assigned to 709 4 and 710 8 ev was 0 84 for fe bc and 1 42 for fe ac this indicates that fe bc has a relatively higher fe ii form than fe ac additionally the fe2p1 2 peak absorbed at a binding energy of 724 3 ev corresponds to fe2o3 and feooh 33 34 this suggests that the presence of fe at the surface of fe bc is a mixture of fe3o4 feooh and fe2o3 moreover fe satellite peaks assigned at 718 and 733 ev in fe ac have been frequently observed in more oxidized fe forms of oxides 35 this result further indicates the more oxidized fraction of fe in the fe ac surface compared to that of the fe bc surface consistent with evidence of bulk characteristics of these two samples observed by xanes the structures of the carbon and fe in fe bc and fe ac were analyzed by raman spectroscopy fig 4 a vs b the strong peaks assigned to 1350 and 1580 cm 1 represent sp3 carbon hybridization d band and crystalline graphitic sp2 carbon g band respectively 36 37 which were observed in fe bc and fe ac comparing the relative distributions of the g and d bands of fe bc the peak and area of the g band were significantly higher than those of the d band with a relatively high strength and a wide g band as compared to the d band the carbon in the fe bc is composed of a graphite sheet with a high degree of graphitization 38 in the case of fe ac the peak of the g band was relatively stronger than that of the d band but the total area was higher in the d band additionally the g d area ratios ag ad of fe bc and fe ac were 1 70 and 0 81 respectively suggesting that fe bc was more graphitized than fe ac the peaks at the 200 to 800 cm 1 wavenumber regions are generally attributed to fe oxides such as hematite magnetite and goethite 36 the intensity and area of these peaks for fe oxides in fe bc were significantly higher than those of fe ac which could be due to the difference in fe content table 1 in particular fe bc showed a strong fe oxide related peak at 382 cm 1 and weak peaks at 220 and 276 cm 1 which are closely related to hematite and ferrihydrite 39 40 this observation is in agreement with those of xanes and xps in the case of fe ac there was only a broad absorption with no well defined peaks in the fe oxide region the two peaks near 382 and 650 cm 1 in fe ac are also related to hematite and ferrihydrite 39 41 liu et al 39 reported that magnetite related peaks were detected at wavenumbers of 310 540 and 670 cm 1 our results also showed small shoulder peaks in these wavenumber regions various fe oxides are present in the fe bc and fe ac samples however these results showed that fe in fe bc was more abundant and reduced than that in fe ac which is in general agreement with the xanes and xps observations 3 2 comparison of catalytic activities the fe impregnation efficiency and catalytic activity of fe bc and fe ac were investigated in an fe impregnation solution range of 0 063 0 750 m as shown in fig 5 a the fe content tended to increase with an increase in fe impregnation concentration to 0 5 m in both fe bc from 0 08 21 81 and fe ac from 0 02 11 5 but remained relatively constant over 0 5 m 22 3 for fe bc and 12 1 for fe ac this indicates that even if a large amount of fe is added to the solution for impregnation of fe the amount of fe that can be absorbed by the feedstock and ac is limited comparing the fe content of fe bc and fe ac produced at different fe impregnation concentrations fe bcs in all fe impregnation concentrations had significantly higher fe contents than those of fe acs indicating that the feedstock was more capable of absorbing the solution with fe in the impregnation process than ac the effect of fe impregnation concentration on mb removal by fe bc and fe ac is shown in fig 5b the removal efficiency of mb by only h2o2 was very low at 2 6 data not shown the mb removal efficiency of fe bc improved with a 0 063 to 0 50 m increase in the fe impregnation concentration this was likely due to the increased generation of oh radicals by an enhancement in the rate of decomposition of h2o2 42 the removal efficiency of mb was almost 100 with fe bc derived from fe impregnation concentration between 0 25 and 0 75 m on the other hand the removal efficiency of mb by fe ac increased with increasing fe concentration compared to that of ac from 32 3 60 2 but it was remarkably lower than that of fe bc it is interesting to note that the removal efficiency of mb by fe ac was higher than that of fe bc at the fe impregnation concentration of 0 063 m or less this high removal efficiency of mb for fe ac compared to fe bc at low fe impregnation concentration was likely caused by the strong adsorption capacity of ac for organic contaminants due to its large surface area and high pore volume compared to bc table 1 this was especially evident when there was no fe impregnation in which ac showed approximately three times the mb removal compared to bc fig 5b since the removal at no or low fe impregnation was not yet dominant it is well known that ac can significantly adsorb organic compounds through special functional groups π π interactions 43 the removal efficiencies of toc by fe bc and fe ac showed a pattern similar to that of mb fig 5c in other words the removal efficiency of toc by fe bc increased remarkably to 46 8 and showed a significant response to the fe impregnation concentration whereas the toc removal efficiency by fe ac did not show a large difference and was maintained in the narrow range of 17 8 26 5 on the other hand the rate of increase in toc removal efficiency by fe bc tended to maximize beyond 0 5 m indicating that the amount of oh radicals generated by fe bc with the added h2o2 was limited in particular oh radicals can be scavenged or weakened by chain reactions eqs 1 3 and termination reactions eqs 6 8 in the following 44 46 6 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o 7 ho2 ho h2o o2 8 fe ii oh fe iii oh these results suggest that fe ac plays a more important role as an adsorbent rather than a function of a heterogeneous catalyst in contrast fe bc can be fully utilized as a catalyst for hfr and our study suggests that the ideal fe impregnation concentration for preparing fe bc is above 0 25 m 3 3 stability and recyclability as shown in fig 6 a the treatment efficiency of fe bc only slightly decreased from 99 9 82 9 for 0 50 m fe bc and from 99 6 65 7 for 0 25 m fe bc during five consecutive reactions respectively the loss of catalyst activity of fe bc may be due to the difficulty in completely removing residual byproducts and reactants from active catalyst sites after each reaction other studies also reported catalyst deactivation due to the loss of active catalytic sites caused by the replacement of fe from the catalyst surface as well as the catalyst in solution during consecutive reactions 12 47 on the other hand the catalytic activity of mb by both fe ac200 and fe ac was drastically decreased after the first reaction 20 6 for 0 25 m fe ac200 and 52 6 for 0 50 m fe ac200 although fe ac200 exhibited significantly higher catalytic activity than fe ac for fe ac200 it was only done twice as there was a significant loss of fe on the fe ac200 surface after first run which made it difficult to separate the fe ac particles from the solution for further run this result likely suggests that mb removal by fe ac was dominantly influenced by adsorption considering that there was very little fe released in the solution after reaction as compared to fe ac200 it was speculated that the treatment efficiency of fe ac gradually decreased as its adsorption site was saturated by mb which could easily be adsorbed in the carbon matrix through continuous reactions 48 49 the stability of fe during the hfr of fe bc and fe ac significantly affects the removal efficiency and effluent water quality during the actual treatment of wastewater as shown in fig 6b the fe released in the solution decreased after each reaction from 3 420 to 0 215 mg l for 0 50 m fe bc and from 0 341 to 0 020 mg l for 0 25 m fe bc in the catalyst during five consecutive reactions respectively these results indicate that even though the amounts of fe released from 0 50 m fe bc and 0 25 m fe bc in solution are 0 215 and 0 020 mg l after five consecutive reactions the removal efficiencies of mb are still high 65 7 demonstrating the strong stability and reusability of the hfr on the other hand fe ac was highly resistant to fe release regardless of the fe impregnation concentration used while the fe impregnation efficiency of fe ac was lower than that of fe bc the very low release of fe ions could also indicate the stable and less reactive nature of fe forms during the hfr because most of the fe impregnated on ac was converted to fe iii as suggested by xanes xps and raman spectroscopy observations considering the released fe concentration in the first run of the mb removal reaction 0 25 m fe bc yielded 0 34 mg l whereas 0 50 m fe bc released 3 42 mg l of fe ions which exceeded the effluent water quality standard of 2 mg l 50 some researchers reported that the degradation of organic pollutants during a hfr involving fe impregnated catalysts is predominantly influenced by the fe ions released from the catalyst 3 51 therefore in order to determine whether the decomposition of mb by fe bc was due to fe released from fe bc or by fe species impregnated bonded on the fe bc surface a homogeneous fenton reaction was carried out by applying the amount of fe ions that was equivalent to that released from 0 25 m fe bc and 0 50 m fe bc during the hfr the fe solutions were prepared from 0 34 to 3 42 mg l using feso4 and all experimental conditions including h2o2 and mb concentrations were applied in the same manner as in the hfr as a result it was found that the removal efficiency of mb in the homogeneous fenton reaction with fe ii of 0 34 and 3 42 mg l was 3 1 and 42 6 data not shown respectively which was significantly lower than that of fe bc 98 3 in the hfr this result suggests that the decomposition of mb by fe released from fe bc is limited and the decomposition of mb by surface fe species is the dominant mechanism especially for fe bc made at 0 25 m fe impregnation solution resulting in 15 6 fe in fe bc on the other hand the significant decrease in mb removal efficiency and corresponding loss of fe for fe ac200 produced at impregnation concentrations of 0 25 m and 0 50 m which yielded fe release of 4 15 and 9 21 mg l respectively in reaction solution was unexpected fig 6 the results indicate that the fe ion released from fe ac200 reacted similarly to a homogeneous fenton reaction in addition since fe ac200 has no magnetic activity unlike fe ac it was not easily separated from the solution after the reaction these results suggest that fe ac regardless of its preparation using low or high pyrolysis temperatures and low and high fe concentrations would not be as superior as fe bc preparation for use in hfr the 0 25 m fe bc could be a more economical and stable fe impregnated catalyst with higher removal efficiency and recyclability for use in treating recalcitrant organic pollutants in aops 4 conclusions this study demonstrated higher fe impregnation efficiency in preparation of fe bc via one step pyrolysis of fe solution pretreated plant biomass feedstock than traditional fe ac which was prepared by treating already formed ac with fe solution followed by either low or high temperature pyrolysis the optimum fe contents for fe bc and fe ac were 15 6 and 8 4 respectively analysis by xps xanes and raman spectroscopy showed a mixture of fe oxide species in fe bc and fe ac with fe in the fe bc being more reduced than that in the fe ac the fe bc exhibited significantly higher efficiency and reusability in the removal of mb from aqueous solution than fe ac prepared at 600 c pyrolysis temperature in contrast the fe ac200 prepared at low temperatures although showing good catalytic activity had significant fe leaching loss from the particle surface during the first cycle of treatment suggesting significant mb removal by the homogenous fenton reaction overall fe bc could be used as an economical and highly effective catalyst for the treatment of recalcitrant organic pollutants however since most of the removal of recalcitrant pollutants by hfr with fe bc is currently carried out with a focus on a single recalcitrant pollutant its information on complex recalcitrant pollutants is limited therefore the applicability to actual wastewater containing complex recalcitrant pollutants should be evaluated to secure the economy and marketability of hfr with fe bc in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13451,iron impregnated biochar fe bc was developed through one step pyrolysis characterized and directly compared with fe impregnated activated carbon fe ac for the removal of methylene blue mb in a heterogeneous fenton reaction hfr fe bc exhibited significantly higher fe impregnation efficiency than fe ac at the same pyrolysis temperature of 600 c analyses via x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and raman spectroscopy revealed that both fe bc and fe ac contained fe species such as fe3o4 feooh and fe2o3 with fe bc having significantly more reduced fe ii than fe ac this result is clear evidence that fe bc had better catalytic activity for mb than fe ac the removal efficiencies of mb and total organic carbon by fe bc and fe ac prepared with optimum fe impregnation concentration 0 25 m fe were 98 3 and 46 3 respectively in particular fe bc removal of mb was predominantly by degradation due to the hfr while adsorption was dominant in the case of fe ac in particular fe bc 0 25 m fe impregnation showed higher mb treatment efficiency 65 7 and stable release of fe ions 2 mg l compared to fe ac during 5 consecutive hfr reactions low temperature fe ac prepared at 200 c showed poor fe impregnation and instability for reusability in view of the above results the developed fe bc can be used as an economic catalyst because it has superior stability and recyclability for treating recalcitrant pollutants compared to fe ac keywords fenton like reaction recalcitrant pollutants impregnation and pyrolysis agricultural residue heterogeneous fenton reaction 1 introduction the fenton reaction with fe ii and h2o2 is one of the faster and more economical advanced oxidation processes aops for treating recalcitrant wastewater including organic pollutants 1 3 fenton reagents such as h2o2 and fe ii fe iii have been used as powerful sources of hydroxy radicals in the fenton reaction 4 5 the reaction between fe ii and h2o2 generates hydroxyl radicals eq 1 while fe iii reacts with h2o2 to induce the regeneration of fe ii to prolong the fenton reaction eqs 2 and 3 1 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh 2 fe iii h2o2 fe ooh 2 h 3 fe ooh 2 fe ii oh2 treatment of recalcitrant pollutants using the conventional fenton reaction requires large amounts of fenton reagents such as h2o2 and fe ii as well as adjusting the ph to 2 5 3 0 the disadvantage of the homogeneous fenton reaction is that the dissolved fe cannot be recycled because of the difficulty in separating fe in salts and sludge after wastewater treatment especially iron rich sludge discharged from the conventional fenton oxidation process has been regarded as a secondary pollutant 6 7 owing to these issues hfr using fe impregnated solid support catalysts which enhance the recycling of fe promoters with little or no sludge formation have been developed 8 today catalysts composed of carbon such as graphene carbon nanotubes and activated carbon ac are attracting attention for their excellent properties such as acid base resistance and high thermal stability 6 9 10 most importantly the carbon materials mentioned has an extensive surface area therefore it will be enhancing the activity of fe catalysts such as fe oxide by enhancing their dispersibility and preventing agglomeration several researchers developed a carbon catalyst having magnetic property through fe incorporation in ac which can be easily separated and recovered by material that exhibit magnetism 5 11 these fe impregnated ac fe ac have exhibited excellent catalytic activity in the removal of various dyes nevertheless two thermal treatment steps are required to manufacturing fe ac one to prepare the ac and the other to impregnate fe into ac which increases the overall cost of catalyst preparation feedstock pyrolysis ac ac with fe source re pyrolysis fe ac for this reason the fe ac manufacturing process is known to be complex and could hinder its production and use 6 12 therefore in order to remove recalcitrant organic pollutants using hrf containing a carbon catalyst the development of a new carbon based catalyst with a simple and inexpensive manufacturing process is urgently required for the past decade biochar bc has been attracting attention from many researchers as an inexpensive carbon material and their application to wastewater treatment has been classified as a promising technology in the future 13 it has the capability to adsorb various organic pollutants because of its reasonably high surface area 14 15 however the adsorption of organic pollutants by bc often cannot completely remove and its adsorption efficiency is significantly reduced at high concentrations of pollutants especially recalcitrant pollutants such as dyes 16 furthermore recalcitrant pollutants such as dyes adsorbed onto bc are difficult to desorb thereby limiting their recycling potential in this paper we present the development of a bc based catalyst by a one step thermal process to impregnate fe into a carbon matrix with the aim of applying it in the hfr we hypothesize that this fe impregnated bc fe bc will offer the combined advantages of an inexpensive carbon material and magnetic properties considering the direct impregnation of fe into the porous bc structure we further hypothesize that the process will be more efficient in incorporating fe into the carbon matrix this along with the magnetic features will allow fe bc to maintain high catalytic activity stability and reusability in the hfr in previous studies the catalytic activity of fe bc was reported for the removal of non degradable pollutants like metronidazole trichloroethylene acid orange 7 and bisphenol a 17 20 however most studies have been conducted with a focus on the amounts of fe bc and oxidizing agents to treat specific pollutants to our knowledge there has been no direct comparison of catalytic efficiency between fe bc and fe ac in order to secure the economy and marketability of fe bc in the carbon based catalyst industry in the future it is necessary to compare and evaluate the catalytic activity of fe bc against non degradable pollutants with fe ac prepared under the same conditions therefore the objective of this study is to compare the physicochemical properties of fe bc and fe ac prepared under the same conditions and evaluate the mb degradation removal efficiency of methylene blue mb a model recalcitrant organic pollutant in a hfr 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of catalysts sugarcane harvest residue shr collected from the louisiana state university agcenter sugar research station at st gabriel louisiana usa was used to produce fe bc using a slow muffle furnace pyrolyzer in brief shr was first rinsed with deionized water oven dried at 60 c and ground to pass through a 0 5 mm sieve fe bc was prepared by impregnation pyrolysis specifically 30 g of shr was mixed with a series of 500 ml solutions containing 0 063 0 750 m feso4 in a glass beaker 1 l the mixtures were stirred for 24 h and oven dried at 60 c for 24 h the dried fe impregnated shr samples were placed in porcelain crucibles each with a cover and pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace fa 1730 thermolyne sybron corporation dubuque ia under limited oxygen conditions with purged nitrogen gas the controller of the furnace was programmed to increase the internal chamber temperature to 600 c at approximately 10 c min this was maintained for 4 h the resulting fe bc was cooled and stored in an airtight container before use in the case of fe ac ac was purchased from mallinckrodt st louis mo and the fe impregnation process was performed in the same manner and concentration as the fe bc process described above in this study xfe ac and xfe bc were named to clearly distinguish between catalyst and fe impregnation concentration where x represents the impregnation concentration of fe 2 2 characterization of catalysts the yield and ash content of fe bc and fe ac were calculated as follows 4 yield wfe bc and fe ac wfe impregnated shr and ac 100 5 ash content wash wfe bc and fe ac 100 where wfe bc and ac wash and wfe impregnated shr and ac are the dry weight g of fe bc and ac ash and its fe impregnated feedstock and ac respectively the fe contents in fe bc and fe ac were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes after digestion according to the epa 3050b method total c and n contents in fe bc and fe ac were analyzed using a flashea 1112 elemental analyzer thermo finnigan italy the specific surface area total pore volume tpv and micropore volume of fe bc and fe ac were determined by asap 2020 m analyzer micromeritics instrument corp usa x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps using a kratos axis ultra dld spectrometer with an al k x ray source was employed to analyze fe chemistry on the surface of fe bc and fe ac the specific structures and compositions of fe bc and fe ac were determined by sem jeol 6335 f and ft raman spectroscopy varian ft raman the samples were placed in a capillary tube and analyzed using a powerful laser x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy xanes of the fe bc and fe ac samples was performed at the lsu synchrotron using the ge 220 double crystal monochromator dcm beamline with a k edge energy range set from 6917 to 8090 ev hematite fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 fe oxide hydroxide feooh feo ferrous sulfate feso4 and ferric sulfate fe2 so4 3 were used as references for fe ii or and fe iii respectively the data were processed background subtraction deglitching and linear combination fitting using athena software 21 2 3 performance of catalysts experiments for the catalytic activity of fe bc and fe ac were evaluated using methylene blue a common recalcitrant toxic dye with high solubility which has a detrimental effect on humans and is known to be discharged from various industrial facilities 22 the catalyzed removal of mb was determined by weighing 0 5 g l of fe bc and fe ac derived at different fe impregnation concentrations in glass erlenmeyer flasks followed by adding 100 ml of solutions containing 0 1 g l mb the initial ph of each mixture was adjusted to 4 by the dropwise addition of 0 1 m hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide solution followed by the addition of 0 075 g l h2o2 the reaction was allowed to proceed for 8 h under stirring after all these reactions the samples were centrifuged 4000 rpm 10 min and the supernatants were analyzed for residual mb concentration using a thermo scientific evo 60 visible spectrophotometer usa at 668 nm the residual total organic carbon toc in the mixture solutions after the reaction was determined using a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu japan the concentration of fe released in the solution after the reaction was analyzed by icp aes 2 4 stability and recyclability the stability and recyclability of fe bc and fe ac were evaluated by investigating the catalytic activity in successive reactions and reuse after separation after the first run both mb and h2o2 were added to maintain the same pollutant and oxidant strength for successive run of the fe bc catalyst as in the first run in addition for better comparison both fe bc and fe ac produced with 0 25 m and 0 50 m fe impregnation solutions were used further because thermal treatment of ac for fe impregnation was frequently conducted at low temperatures such as 200 c 23 the evaluation of fe ac was also carried out with the sample produced at 200 c pyrolysis temperature which was named fe ac200 to distinguish it from fe ac prepared at 600 c in addition the stability of each catalyst was evaluated by measuring the concentration of fe released during the successive reactions containing each catalyst 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of physicochemical characteristics the physicochemical properties of fe bc and fe ac are listed in table 1 for convenience of comparison only the properties of fe bc and fe ac produced during fe impregnation using 0 25 m feso4 which yielded high catalytic activity with low fe release are given the yields of fe bc and fe ac were 34 9 and 72 3 respectively in the case of ac since the first pyrolysis had already carbonized most of the organic substances the yield of fe ac in the second thermal treatment was lower than that of ac the ash content of bc before and after fe impregnation was 20 1 and 32 2 respectively the ash content increased due to fe impregnation in bc a similar result was also observed with activated bc before and after fe impregnation on the other hand the ash content of raw bc was higher than that of ac because ac is mostly composed of carbon while bc contains various inorganic components such as k ca mg and na 24 25 in addition the ash content of bc is dominantly influenced by the characteristics of raw materials agricultural byproducts such as sugarcane residues used in this experiment are known to have a higher content of inorganic components than ac based on woody biomass 14 the c content in fe bc and fe ac was 44 6 and 68 9 respectively which were lower than those of bc and ac in particular the c content of fe bc decreased by 33 9 compared to that of bc this is because the impregnation of fe in the bc surface was more than that of fe ac which decreased by 10 9 compared to that of ac the fe content in fe bc 15 6 was approximately twice as high as that in fe ac 8 4 this result confirms our hypothesis that one step pyrolysis can increase fe impregnation efficiency the specific surface areas of bc and fe bc were similar to 224 6 m2 g and 210 2 m2 g respectively however the tpv of fe bc was higher than that of bc by 14 0 1755 vs 0 1521 cm3 g while its microspore volume was slightly lower table 1 it is believed that the melting and volatilization of ferric sulfate feso47 h2o used for fe impregnation of feedstock biomass during pyrolysis helps generate more tpv in the fe bc this suggests that fe impregnation tended to increase macropores in bc a result that was also observed previously 12 on the other hand the tpv of fe ac decreased slightly compared to that of ac corresponding to a decrease in the specific surface area table 1 such a decrease in tpv was likely due to the adhesion of fe and s to the ac surface because the pores were well developed during the manufacturing of ac 26 these results showed different influences of fe impregnation in preparing fe bc and fe ac the microscopic results of bc and ac before and after iron impregnation are shown in fig 1 after iron impregnation both bc and ac were found to have more finer particles than those before iron impregnation which is believed to have contributed to various iron oxides xanes was used to investigate the fe oxidation state and structure in the bulk samples of fe bc and fe ac and the results are shown in fig 2 the main adsorption peaks were observed at 7133 ev for both fe bc and fe ac which were clearly correlated with hematite fe2o3 and ferrihydrite feooh used as reference materials on the other hand the reference compound magnetite fe3o4 which consists of both fe ii and fe iii was assigned a peak at 7130 ev and feo was present at 7127 ev as the fe ions were converted to oxidized forms the main adsorption peaks were observed at higher energy levels shifting from the fe ii peak to fe iii peaks as indicated by the binding energies of 7127 7133 ev which are associated with ferrous sulfate and ferric sulfate respectively this result shows that most of the fe species in bulk fe bc and fe ac exist in the form of fe iii however when comparing pre edge features of fe adsorption at 7114 7115 ev fe bc and fe ac showed characteristics at the same energies as magnetite and ferrihydrite these results prove that the fe species in fe bc and fe ac produced by impregnation and pyrolysis were distributed fe2o3 and feooh as well as fe3o4 the post edge feature of fe adsorption around 7148 ev binding energy in fe ac also proved that most fe species in fe ac are fe iii forms 27 fdez gubieda et al 28 reported that higher energy in the edge point absorption curve indicates more oxidation the edge point adsorption curves of all reference materials except feo exist between ferrous sulfate and ferric sulfate characterized by fe ii and fe iii in particular our results show that the absorption curves of fe ac reach the edge point with higher energy as compared to fe bc which suggests that the fe form in the bulk sample of fe ac is more oxidized than that of fe bc xps was used to distinguish the surface chemical differences between fe bc and fe ac the carbon distribution in fe bc and fe ac through xps is shown in fig 3 a and b the peaks at binding energies of 284 8 286 0 288 8 and 292 7 ev are assigned to cc co co and coo respectively 29 the distribution of carbon in both fe bc and fe ac was similar and a difference was only observed in the coo peak in fe bc on the other hand the distribution of oxygen on the fe bc surface showed completely different characteristics when compared with fe ac fig 3c and d in general the o1s peaks at binding energies of 530 4 532 0 533 5 and 535 2 ev correspond to oxygen in co o i coc o ii coo o iii and h2o o iv groups respectively 30 in terms of fe oxides the peaks at 530 532 and 533 ev can be assigned to the lattice oxygen atoms binding with fe fe o lattice hydroxyl groups fe ohlattice in feooh and adsorbed hydroxyl groups fe ohad respectively 31 in our results the peaks related to coc o ii 68 6 assigned to 532 ev in fe bc was the main component followed by o iii 20 4 and o i 7 3 the relative distributions of o i o ii and o iii on fe ac were found to be 35 5 42 7 and 9 01 respectively among which o i and o ii are the dominant forms fig 2c vs fig 2d as a result of o1s by xps the surface of fe bc was predominantly distributed with feooh and fe ac was closely related to fe oxides such as hematite and magnetite the main peaks of high resolution xps for fe were observed at 710 9 711 4 ev fe 2p3 2 and 724 4 724 9 ev fe 2p1 2 in the fe2p spectra of fe bc and fe ac fig 3e vs f specifically the assigned peaks at binding energies of 709 4 and 710 8 ev in fe bc and fe ac are related to fe ii and fe iii in fe3o4 fe2p3 2 respectively considering the chemical structure of fe3o4 the ratio of fe iii fe ii is 2 1 in particular the ratio of fe iii fe ii was about 2 1 in the xps results of graphene impregnated fe3o4 nanocrystals 32 in our study the area ratio of fe iii fe ii assigned to 709 4 and 710 8 ev was 0 84 for fe bc and 1 42 for fe ac this indicates that fe bc has a relatively higher fe ii form than fe ac additionally the fe2p1 2 peak absorbed at a binding energy of 724 3 ev corresponds to fe2o3 and feooh 33 34 this suggests that the presence of fe at the surface of fe bc is a mixture of fe3o4 feooh and fe2o3 moreover fe satellite peaks assigned at 718 and 733 ev in fe ac have been frequently observed in more oxidized fe forms of oxides 35 this result further indicates the more oxidized fraction of fe in the fe ac surface compared to that of the fe bc surface consistent with evidence of bulk characteristics of these two samples observed by xanes the structures of the carbon and fe in fe bc and fe ac were analyzed by raman spectroscopy fig 4 a vs b the strong peaks assigned to 1350 and 1580 cm 1 represent sp3 carbon hybridization d band and crystalline graphitic sp2 carbon g band respectively 36 37 which were observed in fe bc and fe ac comparing the relative distributions of the g and d bands of fe bc the peak and area of the g band were significantly higher than those of the d band with a relatively high strength and a wide g band as compared to the d band the carbon in the fe bc is composed of a graphite sheet with a high degree of graphitization 38 in the case of fe ac the peak of the g band was relatively stronger than that of the d band but the total area was higher in the d band additionally the g d area ratios ag ad of fe bc and fe ac were 1 70 and 0 81 respectively suggesting that fe bc was more graphitized than fe ac the peaks at the 200 to 800 cm 1 wavenumber regions are generally attributed to fe oxides such as hematite magnetite and goethite 36 the intensity and area of these peaks for fe oxides in fe bc were significantly higher than those of fe ac which could be due to the difference in fe content table 1 in particular fe bc showed a strong fe oxide related peak at 382 cm 1 and weak peaks at 220 and 276 cm 1 which are closely related to hematite and ferrihydrite 39 40 this observation is in agreement with those of xanes and xps in the case of fe ac there was only a broad absorption with no well defined peaks in the fe oxide region the two peaks near 382 and 650 cm 1 in fe ac are also related to hematite and ferrihydrite 39 41 liu et al 39 reported that magnetite related peaks were detected at wavenumbers of 310 540 and 670 cm 1 our results also showed small shoulder peaks in these wavenumber regions various fe oxides are present in the fe bc and fe ac samples however these results showed that fe in fe bc was more abundant and reduced than that in fe ac which is in general agreement with the xanes and xps observations 3 2 comparison of catalytic activities the fe impregnation efficiency and catalytic activity of fe bc and fe ac were investigated in an fe impregnation solution range of 0 063 0 750 m as shown in fig 5 a the fe content tended to increase with an increase in fe impregnation concentration to 0 5 m in both fe bc from 0 08 21 81 and fe ac from 0 02 11 5 but remained relatively constant over 0 5 m 22 3 for fe bc and 12 1 for fe ac this indicates that even if a large amount of fe is added to the solution for impregnation of fe the amount of fe that can be absorbed by the feedstock and ac is limited comparing the fe content of fe bc and fe ac produced at different fe impregnation concentrations fe bcs in all fe impregnation concentrations had significantly higher fe contents than those of fe acs indicating that the feedstock was more capable of absorbing the solution with fe in the impregnation process than ac the effect of fe impregnation concentration on mb removal by fe bc and fe ac is shown in fig 5b the removal efficiency of mb by only h2o2 was very low at 2 6 data not shown the mb removal efficiency of fe bc improved with a 0 063 to 0 50 m increase in the fe impregnation concentration this was likely due to the increased generation of oh radicals by an enhancement in the rate of decomposition of h2o2 42 the removal efficiency of mb was almost 100 with fe bc derived from fe impregnation concentration between 0 25 and 0 75 m on the other hand the removal efficiency of mb by fe ac increased with increasing fe concentration compared to that of ac from 32 3 60 2 but it was remarkably lower than that of fe bc it is interesting to note that the removal efficiency of mb by fe ac was higher than that of fe bc at the fe impregnation concentration of 0 063 m or less this high removal efficiency of mb for fe ac compared to fe bc at low fe impregnation concentration was likely caused by the strong adsorption capacity of ac for organic contaminants due to its large surface area and high pore volume compared to bc table 1 this was especially evident when there was no fe impregnation in which ac showed approximately three times the mb removal compared to bc fig 5b since the removal at no or low fe impregnation was not yet dominant it is well known that ac can significantly adsorb organic compounds through special functional groups π π interactions 43 the removal efficiencies of toc by fe bc and fe ac showed a pattern similar to that of mb fig 5c in other words the removal efficiency of toc by fe bc increased remarkably to 46 8 and showed a significant response to the fe impregnation concentration whereas the toc removal efficiency by fe ac did not show a large difference and was maintained in the narrow range of 17 8 26 5 on the other hand the rate of increase in toc removal efficiency by fe bc tended to maximize beyond 0 5 m indicating that the amount of oh radicals generated by fe bc with the added h2o2 was limited in particular oh radicals can be scavenged or weakened by chain reactions eqs 1 3 and termination reactions eqs 6 8 in the following 44 46 6 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o 7 ho2 ho h2o o2 8 fe ii oh fe iii oh these results suggest that fe ac plays a more important role as an adsorbent rather than a function of a heterogeneous catalyst in contrast fe bc can be fully utilized as a catalyst for hfr and our study suggests that the ideal fe impregnation concentration for preparing fe bc is above 0 25 m 3 3 stability and recyclability as shown in fig 6 a the treatment efficiency of fe bc only slightly decreased from 99 9 82 9 for 0 50 m fe bc and from 99 6 65 7 for 0 25 m fe bc during five consecutive reactions respectively the loss of catalyst activity of fe bc may be due to the difficulty in completely removing residual byproducts and reactants from active catalyst sites after each reaction other studies also reported catalyst deactivation due to the loss of active catalytic sites caused by the replacement of fe from the catalyst surface as well as the catalyst in solution during consecutive reactions 12 47 on the other hand the catalytic activity of mb by both fe ac200 and fe ac was drastically decreased after the first reaction 20 6 for 0 25 m fe ac200 and 52 6 for 0 50 m fe ac200 although fe ac200 exhibited significantly higher catalytic activity than fe ac for fe ac200 it was only done twice as there was a significant loss of fe on the fe ac200 surface after first run which made it difficult to separate the fe ac particles from the solution for further run this result likely suggests that mb removal by fe ac was dominantly influenced by adsorption considering that there was very little fe released in the solution after reaction as compared to fe ac200 it was speculated that the treatment efficiency of fe ac gradually decreased as its adsorption site was saturated by mb which could easily be adsorbed in the carbon matrix through continuous reactions 48 49 the stability of fe during the hfr of fe bc and fe ac significantly affects the removal efficiency and effluent water quality during the actual treatment of wastewater as shown in fig 6b the fe released in the solution decreased after each reaction from 3 420 to 0 215 mg l for 0 50 m fe bc and from 0 341 to 0 020 mg l for 0 25 m fe bc in the catalyst during five consecutive reactions respectively these results indicate that even though the amounts of fe released from 0 50 m fe bc and 0 25 m fe bc in solution are 0 215 and 0 020 mg l after five consecutive reactions the removal efficiencies of mb are still high 65 7 demonstrating the strong stability and reusability of the hfr on the other hand fe ac was highly resistant to fe release regardless of the fe impregnation concentration used while the fe impregnation efficiency of fe ac was lower than that of fe bc the very low release of fe ions could also indicate the stable and less reactive nature of fe forms during the hfr because most of the fe impregnated on ac was converted to fe iii as suggested by xanes xps and raman spectroscopy observations considering the released fe concentration in the first run of the mb removal reaction 0 25 m fe bc yielded 0 34 mg l whereas 0 50 m fe bc released 3 42 mg l of fe ions which exceeded the effluent water quality standard of 2 mg l 50 some researchers reported that the degradation of organic pollutants during a hfr involving fe impregnated catalysts is predominantly influenced by the fe ions released from the catalyst 3 51 therefore in order to determine whether the decomposition of mb by fe bc was due to fe released from fe bc or by fe species impregnated bonded on the fe bc surface a homogeneous fenton reaction was carried out by applying the amount of fe ions that was equivalent to that released from 0 25 m fe bc and 0 50 m fe bc during the hfr the fe solutions were prepared from 0 34 to 3 42 mg l using feso4 and all experimental conditions including h2o2 and mb concentrations were applied in the same manner as in the hfr as a result it was found that the removal efficiency of mb in the homogeneous fenton reaction with fe ii of 0 34 and 3 42 mg l was 3 1 and 42 6 data not shown respectively which was significantly lower than that of fe bc 98 3 in the hfr this result suggests that the decomposition of mb by fe released from fe bc is limited and the decomposition of mb by surface fe species is the dominant mechanism especially for fe bc made at 0 25 m fe impregnation solution resulting in 15 6 fe in fe bc on the other hand the significant decrease in mb removal efficiency and corresponding loss of fe for fe ac200 produced at impregnation concentrations of 0 25 m and 0 50 m which yielded fe release of 4 15 and 9 21 mg l respectively in reaction solution was unexpected fig 6 the results indicate that the fe ion released from fe ac200 reacted similarly to a homogeneous fenton reaction in addition since fe ac200 has no magnetic activity unlike fe ac it was not easily separated from the solution after the reaction these results suggest that fe ac regardless of its preparation using low or high pyrolysis temperatures and low and high fe concentrations would not be as superior as fe bc preparation for use in hfr the 0 25 m fe bc could be a more economical and stable fe impregnated catalyst with higher removal efficiency and recyclability for use in treating recalcitrant organic pollutants in aops 4 conclusions this study demonstrated higher fe impregnation efficiency in preparation of fe bc via one step pyrolysis of fe solution pretreated plant biomass feedstock than traditional fe ac which was prepared by treating already formed ac with fe solution followed by either low or high temperature pyrolysis the optimum fe contents for fe bc and fe ac were 15 6 and 8 4 respectively analysis by xps xanes and raman spectroscopy showed a mixture of fe oxide species in fe bc and fe ac with fe in the fe bc being more reduced than that in the fe ac the fe bc exhibited significantly higher efficiency and reusability in the removal of mb from aqueous solution than fe ac prepared at 600 c pyrolysis temperature in contrast the fe ac200 prepared at low temperatures although showing good catalytic activity had significant fe leaching loss from the particle surface during the first cycle of treatment suggesting significant mb removal by the homogenous fenton reaction overall fe bc could be used as an economical and highly effective catalyst for the treatment of recalcitrant organic pollutants however since most of the removal of recalcitrant pollutants by hfr with fe bc is currently carried out with a focus on a single recalcitrant pollutant its information on complex recalcitrant pollutants is limited therefore the applicability to actual wastewater containing complex recalcitrant pollutants should be evaluated to secure the economy and marketability of hfr with fe bc in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13452,dissolved air flotation daf is a well established flotation technology for the pretreatment of water sources with a high algal bloom however high shear force generated during injection of microbubbles caused breakage of floc this study investigated the removal tendency of algae using daf sedimentation and microhollow beads combined with daf from a water sample collected from the nakdong river in korea the reduction in chl a as algae was 8 5 0 8 in daf and 2 8 0 3 mg m3 in daf with 90 mg l microhollow bead however a further increase in the microhollow bead concentration did not show a significant difference in chl a reduction for conventional daf the optimum flotation time was achieved in 4 min with a removal greater than 91 for daf with microhollow beads optimum flotation time was achieved in 2 min with a removal greater than 95 4 further for the sedimentation case the chl a removal observed was 26 7 and 87 2 for 5 and 30 min respectively different recycle ratios were tested for daf ranging between 5 and 15 the chl a removal achieved with 90 mg l microhollow beads was more than 95 for a 5 recycle ratio upon the addition of microhollow beads the removal was enhanced by 23 6 compared with daf further an increase in the recycle ratio with microhollow bead concentration did not show a significant enhancement in chl a removal keywords blue green algae chlorophyll a dissolved air flotation floc size microhollow bead 1 introduction harmful algal blooms such as blue green algae bga in freshwater pose a high threat to drinking water excessive amounts of bga growth restrict the performance of drinking water treatment plants by clogging the sand filters and inflicting additional harm through disinfection by products because of the higher insolation temperature and nutrient outflow 1 bga is known to bloom more frequently in the summer periods the unicellular bga can control its flotation 2 enabling migration to areas that are more conducive to its growth the ingestion of disinfection by products in laboratory animals showed the occurrence of bladder colon rectal 3 liver and kidney cancer 4 6 further microcystins anatoxin and saxitoxins which are neuro and liver toxins are also caused by blue green algae 7 thus the unicellular blue green algae are highly toxic and can cause harm to humans and animals 1 8 these toxic and harmful disinfection by products can enter the human body by inhalation drinking bathing and swimming 6 9 10 in addition by products are seen to occur more frequently with blue green algae because of geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol which are odor emitting products 11 the chemical methods for the removal of algae and algal organic matter aom from the source water available are the addition of algaecides such as copper ii sulfate oxidizers such as ozone potassium permanganate and sodium hypochlorite 8 12 and there are the physical methods such as coagulation flotation 8 and filtration 13 however dissolved air flotation daf is a well established flotation technology in the drinking water treatment process for the removal of low density floc containing algae 2 14 15 the floc formed during coagulation flocculation is removed from the water by microbubbles generated from daf attached to the floc the attachment of microbubbles to the surface of the floc leads to density reduction of the aggregate floc microbubbles less than density of water making aggregates float on the surface however the main component of the daf process is the saturator which generates microbubbles by saturating the water with air thus the optimization of the design and operation of daf depends on the characteristics of microbubbles and particles present in the water sources compared with conventional sedimentation daf shows a significant reduction of unsettleable particles or algae within a short retention time ranging between 5 and 15 min further daf can be operated at a higher hydraulic loading rate than that of sedimentation which reduces the carbon footprint the annual cost of operation and maintenance for the daf saturator is approximately 50 of the total cost 2 15 normally the recycle ratio of clarified water for the daf ranges between 5 and 15 which is saturated with air by a compressor the operating pressure for the saturator ranges from 450 to 550 kpa 15 the daf is difficult to operate for high turbidity conditions because of high shear force generated during the microbubble injection caused breakage of the floc however the use of low density floating microhollow beads in combination with daf can enhance flotation efficacy with a lower energy requirement coagulant dose and less floating time the use of microhollow beads has been tested for removal of particles of drinking water sources with high turbidity and high algae content in addition the microhollow beads could be used in all existing daf that are in use for the removal of algae and aom there are various types of microhollow beads studied to date as collectors for removing pollutants from water sources microhollow beads were used as absorbent to remove micro or nano particles 16 18 in terms of operation cost polyamine used in the sedimentation process is about 3 times cheaper than microhollow beads used in the flotation process however removal efficiency of algae by polyamine and microhollow beads were shown to be 60 and 95 respectively for stable drinking water production microhollow beads can be sufficiently applied when operating effects are considered rather than cost effects the main purpose of this study was to enhance the removal of algae from the water source by flotation assisted microhollow bead technology this study had several aims 1 to investigate the coagulation characteristics and rise velocity of the microhollow beads 2 to compare the removal behavior of bulk parameters and chlorophyll a chl a by conventional daf with different doses of polyaluminum chloride pac and 3 to investigate the efficacy of conventional sedimentation daf and daf processes assisted with microhollow beads based on chl a and particle removal the experiments were conducted considering various microhollow bead doses different flotation times and different recycle ratios for daf 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of raw water the feed water sample containing algae was collected from the nakdong river the nakdong river is one of the four major sources of drinking and industrial water in korea currently due to the high amounts of domestic and industrial outflow eutrophication occurs resulting in irregular outbursts of algal blooms 19 this occurs more frequently in the downstream area of the rivers where the nutrient collection occurs 20 21 table s1 shows the water quality parameters in the water treatment plant wtp sources in the nakdong river for august 2019 table 1 showed feed water characteristics of the raw water sample of the nakdong river whose average results were ph 7 9 toc 7 14 mg l turbidity 32 2 ntu and chl a 117 mg m3 because of frequent rainfall the water temperature in the nakdong river basin has increased increasing algal matter where the maximum chl a concentration was known to be 105 7 141 9 and 88 2 mg m3 for ds wtp hm wtp and mj wtp respectively this result in reduction of treatment capability of drinking wtps the main species is known to be microcystis sp which has buoyant characteristics owing to the species characteristics the ph of the ds wtp may increase to 9 where the water quality standards are 6 5 8 5 the feed waters of nakdong river used for this study were sampled downstream of the river the dominant species are microcystis sp table 1 shows the feedwater characteristics of the collected water 2 2 experiment setup to compare the characteristics of algae removal all processes were compared sedimentation daf microhollow beads and daf with microhollow beads the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation flotation were conducted using a jar tester phipps bird usa the jar used in the test was a circular acrylic reactor of 100 mm diameter and 200 mm long to inject saturated water and to collect treated water samples a valve was installed at 10 mm and 40 mm height from the bottom as a condition of daf a portable saturator was used to generate microbubbles which was made as a circular stainless steel cylinder of 50 mm diameter and 450 mm long the saturated water was prepared by injecting distilled water into the saturator and air with an air compressor to 550 kpa 2 3 microhollow beads and coagulant the microhollow beads used in this test were low density microhollow beads 3 m glass bubbles 3 m company usa which float after the removal of pollutants by distilled water the coagulant used in the test was pac 10 hongwon industry busan korea the beads were the hollow type with densities of 0 02 0 06 and 0 125 g cm3 the hollow holes enable them to float since micro hollow beads have a negative charge on the surface the influence of negative charge helps to form coagulantion efficiency from positive charge of the floc so the zeta potential mv of the microhollow beads was measured by a zeta analyzer nanoparticle analyzer sz 100 horiba japan at different ph conditions the microhollow bead has a negative charge which is similar to the general particles and it promotes flotation by attaching to the floc the detailed physical and chemical characteristics of the microhollow beads can be found elsewhere 15 before using the microhollow beads malfunctioning and damaged beads were removed by washing with deionized water for numerous cycles to reduce experimental errors the median diameter d 50 of the microhollow beads was found to be 52 8 μm moreover 10 of the microhollow beads were found to be 21 7 μm in diameter 2 4 rise velocity of microhollow beads the terminal rise velocity v of the microbubbles was tested and compared with microhollow beads with different densities using eqs 1 and 2 the rising velocity of microbubbles ʋb and microhollow beads ʋmb are 1 v b g ρ w ρ b d b 2 18 μ w 2 v m b g ρ w ρ m b d m b 2 18 μ w respectively where g is gravitational acceleration m s2 ρw ρb and ρmb are the densities kg m3 of water microbubbles and microhollow beads at 20 c respectively μw is dynamic viscosity n s m2 of water at 20 c and db and dmb is the diameter m of the microbubble and microhollow bead respectively the time of injecting the microhollow bead after forming the flocs was controlled when the coagulant cohered with the raw water particle if the coagulant and the bead are fed at the same time the coagulant recognizes the microhollow bead as a particle and forms a floc and thus more coagulant is required to treat the existing particle which is not economic therefore the technique of removing algae was developed by injecting microhollow beads at optimum condition i e in between mixing process 2 5 jar test experiment the experiment was operated at rapid mixing for 1 min at 150 rpm slow mixing for 5 min at 30 rpm and sedimentation for 30 min flotation followed rapid mixing for 30 s at 150 rpm the process was stopped for 30 s to add microhollow beads then rapid mixing was performed for 30 s at 150 rpm slow mixing for 5 min and flotation the ph was adjusted to 7 0 5 by injecting 0 1 n naoh for algae the pac dose of 1 12 mg l was fed to the reactor the pac amount was determined based on the chl a and total organic carbon toc removal by daf and the treatment tendency was studied by additionally analyzing toc and turbidity to determine the amount of microhollow beads the turbidity and chl a removal were confirmed by injecting 5 30 60 90 120 150 and 200 mg l microhollow beads were used to adhere to floc after dosing with pac the flotation was performed after rapid slow mixing and the sampling was performed within 5 min sampling was performed three times the treatment efficiency was confirmed according to the short flotation time using microhollow beads did not require long flotation time because most floc floats during the slow mixing 2 6 analysis and equipment in the current study the algae quantity was measured by detecting the chl a concentration with an algal concentration analyzer bbe fluorometer moldaenke germany the turbidity was measured with a turbidity meter 2100an hach co usa and the particulate matter was measured with a particle size analyzer accusizer 780a pss nicomp usa the algal species were observed with a fluorescent microscope observer z1 zeiss germany the organic matter was measured with a toc analyzer sievers m9 sievers usa zeta potential was measured with a nano particle analyzer sz 100 horiba japan based on the laser doppler electrophoresis technique coagulation and flocculation experiments were conducted by jar tester philips bird s richmond usa for daf operating a portable saturator was used to produce microbubble daf was designed as a circular stainless steel of diameter 50 mm and length 40 mm the saturated water was produced by injecting both distilled water and air the pressure of saturator was 4 5 5 5 kpa 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the microhollow bead 3 1 1 zeta potential analysis fig 1 shows the zeta potential of microhollow beads at different ph values the microbubbles from the conventional flotation process showed no significant change in the zeta potential at ph 6 3 or higher not shown however the microhollow beads were found to decrease the zeta potential continuously with increasing ph in addition the zeta potential of the microbubbles under ph 6 3 was 51 mv 22 and 34 mv 23 and the microhollow beads used in this study showed a zeta potential of 69 1 mv it means that the microhollow beads had a strong negative charge compared with the microbubbles in the ph 6 3 in particular the characteristics of the microhollow beads formula unit changes depending on the si o ratio in silicate structures 24 table s2 shows that the surface of the microhollow bead made by 3 m company is reported to consist of a si o ratio of 1 2 9 suggesting s i 3 2 making the microhollow bead surface negatively charged whereas the general si o ratio of sio2 quartz is 1 2 15 considering that the microhollow beads are composed of negative charges through the zeta potential it is considered that the sio2 changed to s i 3 2 through si oxidation as a result the microhollow beads are more effective in performing coagulant reactions because the surface potential of ordinary silicon oxide is composed of more negative charges thus the positively charged floc can adhere effectively to the microhollow beads 3 1 2 theoretical rise in the velocity of bubbles and microhollow beads because microhollow beads and microbubbles have a low density they float in water 2 25 the microhollow bead and microbubble under various densities were examined through stokes law which affects the rising velocity according to average particle size fig 2 under the same density conditions as the average particle size decreased the rising velocity had no effect however as particle size increased the microbubbles with low density could be floated at a faster rising velocity microbubbles 0 00119 g cm3 and microhollow beads 0 125 g cm3 with an average particle size of 150 μm showed velocities of 43 88 and 37 43 m h respectively however the general average particle size used in the flotation process is 40 60 μm 26 so under different density conditions the rising velocity showed similar values theoretically the microbubble density 0 00119 g cm3 is about 100 times lower than that of microhollow beads 0 125 g cm3 however water density is 0 998 g cm3 at 20 c which is higher than the other density values i e microhollow beads and microbubbles so both microhollow beads and microbubbles showed similar values at the average particle size of 40 60 μm therefore the rising velocity according to different densities was showed large change with large average particle size whereas it was showed the similar results when the particle size is small as a result there is no change in rising velocity with an identical particle size the microhollow beads have a larger negative charge than the microbubbles so the adhesion of the floc to the microhollow beads was larger than to the microbubbles 3 2 removal behavior of chl a and bulk parameters with varying pac dose microcystis sp has buoyant characteristics and chl a removal is not effective with optimal pac injection through sedimentation this is because there is a space inside the cell that can create buoyancy chl a toc and turbidity values are shown in fig 3 for the daf process with varying pac dose injections chl a removal increased with the increasing dose until 6 mg l of pac and further dose increase did not show a significant reduction the removal was 92 8 with the measured value of 8 5 0 8 mg m3 in a previous study the removal of chl a using microbubbles was more than 90 27 when compared with daf as sedimentation removal of chl a is about 80 it can induce unstable operation of water treatment plants in the summer season 28 toc removal followed the same trend as chl a a significant increase in toc removal was observed until a pac dose of 8 mg l and remained steady with a further increase in dose the value measured was 3 3 mg l or 53 reduction further turbidity removal increased with increasing pac dose a high turbidity removal was observed at 12 mg l of pac as 0 6 ntu i e 98 thus the optimum pac dose was set at 6 mg l for the daf process based on chl a and toc reduction 3 3 effect of daf with different microhollow beads the chl a removal rate with the optimal pac dose 6 mg l was confirmed through daf but the effect of microhollow beads had to be examined in the current experiments the effect of daf with microhollow beads was checked by measuring the removal of chl a and turbidity the addition of microhollow beads resulted in a reduction in chl a and turbidity fig 4 in particular chl a showed a constant value at 90 mg l microhollow beads while turbidity showed a constant value at 150 mg l microhollow beads because the surface of algae has sticky property microhollow bead has high bonding strength with floc so microhollow beads had less injection concentration when removing algae than removing turbidity the chl a concentration reduced from 8 5 0 8 mg m3 with daf to 2 8 0 3 daf with microhollow beads an increase in the removal of about 5 when negatively charged microbubble and microhollow bead are used at the same time the removal efficiency of algae can be improved because the adhesion efficiency of positively charged floc is more increased this indicated that the use of microhollow beads approached the performance of daf with 12 mg l pac over 90 mg l microhollow beads did not significantly affect chl a removal it is because the surface potential of the floc has been converted to neutral so that the residual positively charged microhollow beads are no longer attached to the floc in daf with microhollow beads the chl a removal was 97 5 the removal of turbidity increased by about 4 in daf with microhollow beads 90 mg l when compared with daf alone this is because of the lower specific gravity for the floc which is facilitated by the microhollow beads attaching to the surface of the floc 15 this facilitates the flotation process when daf is applied further microhollow beads facilitate creating a compact floc structure 2 29 3 4 result of microhollow beads attached to floc microcystis sp exist in colonized forms under natural conditions fig 5 because of the pores in the species microcystis sp in the cyanobacteria group can form colonies and float to the surface of water bodies 30 31 in addition microcystis sp exist in the form of colonies with a stable size because they release viscous extracellular organic matter eom thus the addition of microhollow beads after the rapid mixing stage results in the beads existing both inside and on the algae colonies fig 5 when microhollow beads were injected the size of the flocs gradually increased as they were attached to the pin floc thus microhollow bead could be treated by flotation process by increasing the size of floc such methods of algal species removal through flotation have been of constant interest 2 algal species exert metabolic substances in low molecular weight forms such as glycol and amino acids which are generally termed as eom these substances are highly attachable to various substances thereby aiding in the attachment to microhollow beads 3 5 effect of flotation time on daf and daf with microhollow beads because the microhollow bead collided with many flocs during rapid mixing it was found that most of the large flocs were floating in slow mixing therefore an experiment was conducted to determine how daf and daf with microhollow beads affect chl a removal during flotation time the performance of the system depends on the flotation time for the coagulation and flocculation a comparison of chl a removal with flotation time in daf and daf with microhollow beads is shown in fig 6 in the case of daf the chl a concentration was from 7 7 4 3 mg m3 for a 1 5 min flotation time the optimal flotation time was 4 min and chl a removal was 91 7 further increase in flotation time did not show a significant difference for daf with microhollow beads the chl a concentration was from 3 7 2 3 mg m3 for 1 5 min flotation time the optimal flotation time was 2 min and chl a removal was 95 4 daf with a microhollow bead at 1 min flotation time showed chl a removal two times higher than daf this is because as mentioned earlier during slow mixing microhollow beads were removed by floating the high concentration flocs first during flotation time daf with microhollow beads was able to remove chl a by removing low concentration flocs during flotation time the general flotation time of daf is 5 min but if microhollow bead is used the flotation process of daf can show high algae removal rate in 1 min the use of microhollow beads reduces the floc specific gravity which ultimately enhances the flotation within a shorter time 3 6 particle distribution in treated water samples the normalized distribution of particles in treated samples from sedimentation daf and daf with microhollow beads is shown in fig 7 the d 50 values for them were 2 7 1 7 and 1 3 μm respectively for the sedimentation the size of particles detected in the treated sample ranged from 1 to 200 μm with more than 90 particles 10 μm this is because of the low specific gravity of floc formed with microcystis a cyanobacterium that has a gas vacuole within the cell which facilitates controlling its buoyancy in water 2 which ultimately causes either suspension or flotation of floc on the surface in addition the size of microcystis sp is reported to be between 2 and 10 μm with a spherical shape 32 the number of particles measured in the treated sample from sedimentation was 17 324 counts ml by contrast the size distribution of particles in treated samples from both daf and daf with microhollow beads did not differ significantly with 90 of particles 4 and 3 5 μm respectively however there was a significant difference in the total number of particles measured in the treated sample the total number of particles measured was 20 673 and 7946 counts ml the high number of particles in the daf was because the floc was exposed to high energy created by bubbles which leads to breakage of the floc 2 the shear force of daf is reported to be between 1000 and 7600 s 1 33 for the daf with microhollow beads the lower particle count was because of the high bonding energy of the microhollow beads this caused the floc structure to be compact and even at a high shear force the microhollow beads withstood the force and facilitated a reinforcing role through the chemical bonding 15 3 7 effect of different recycle ratio for daf and daf with microhollow beads because daf has a high carbon footprint it is required to save energy in the water treatment process as a method of reducing the circulation ratio of the pressurized tank an experiment was conducted to test whether microhollow beads can effectively remove chl a as illustrated in fig 8 the performance of both daf and daf with microhollow beads depends on the recycle ratio for daf the chl a concentration ranged from 14 7 to 2 52 mg m3 as the recycle ratio increased from 5 to 15 the highest removal of 95 2 was observed for a 15 recycle ratio for the daf process daf with 90 mg l microhollow bead increased the removal of chl a for instance the achieved removal of chl a was more than 95 for a 5 recycle ratio with 90 mg l microhollow beads the removal was enhanced by 23 6 upon the addition of microhollow beads when compared with daf further an increase in the recycle ratio with microhollow bead concentration did not significantly enhance chl a removal the concentration of chl a ranged from 2 3 to 1 3 mg m3 for a recycle ratio of 5 15 for a 15 recycle ratio with microhollow beads the removal was 97 5 compared to daf daf with microhollow beads showed high efficiency of chl a treatment even with short floatation times from the results observed the added microhollow beads improved the flotation because the small spheres increased the incorporation of algae into the floc which resulted in less nonflocculated algae in the coagulation and flocculation processes further the smaller size of the microhollow beads may have provided nucleation points for coagulation precipitation for encouragement of floc formation and promote enmeshment of algae within the floc matrix 2 in addition for sedimentation chl a removal was 26 7 and 87 2 in a sedimentation time of 5 and 30 min respectively although the cost associated with microhollow beads injection was not considered chl a can be quickly removed when algae bloom occurs in the water treatment plant overall the use of microhollow beads can reduce the carbon footprint 3 8 floc breakage experiment of microhollow beads the breakage of flocs for with and without microhollow beads were conducted by floc breakage under the same conditions the results were analyzed by comparing the size of the destroyed flocs to determine the adhesion of microhollow beads fig 9 fig 9a showed the adhesion experiment of microhollow beads by the floc breakage experiment to demonstrate the floc strength the raw water collected was spiked using kaolin at a concentration of 200 mg l the experiment was conducted under without microhollow beads sedimentation and with microhollow beads with 200 mg l the concentration of pac used was 20 mg l the breakage of floc was facilitated by operating at 300 rpm and was analyzed by particle count analysis after 15 min the sizes of flocs d 50 for sedimentation and with microhollow beads were found to be 25 and 42 5 μm respectively however compared with microhollow beads the number of flocs with an average size of 15 μm was nearly two times higher for sedimentation the number of flocs measured was 1112 and 669 counts ml for sedimentation and with microhollow beads respectively further for the average floc size of 85 μm the numbers measured were 1224 and 1812 counts ml as a result a tendency was observed that under sedimentation large flocs are broken and transformed to flocs of small size in addition for with microhollow beads flocs of large and smaller sizes remained relatively higher and lower than sedimentation respectively this suggests that the microhollow beads support in increasing the strength of flocs and can withstand the high shear force therefore it is considered that the microhollow beads adhesion to the floc was effective and flocs of large size formed at low density could be an effective treatment of the flotation process fig 9b showed the cumulative percentage amount of broken flocs after operating at 300 rpm for 15 min with the increasing dose of microhollow beads the d 50 value increased d 50 for 100 200 400 800 and 1000 mg l were found to be 38 42 5 56 64 64 7 μm respectively it was confirmed that floc breakage decreased with an increasing dose of the microhollow beads 4 conclusion the present study investigated daf with microhollow beads to remove algae in terms of flotation process compared with daf the process supplemented with the microhollow beads daf with microhollow beads showed enhanced removal of chl a with the addition of the microhollow beads flotation time was reduced by half as compared with daf and the need for a high recycle ratio was minimized in addition when compared with sedimentation a smaller pac dose was required the floc breakage experiment revealed that the floc with microhollow beads was less prone to the high shear force compared with floc without microhollow beads in with microhollow beads the floc was exposed to a high shear force because of pressure release and microbubbles which caused floc breakage the daf with microhollow beads could be used in existing daf plants to overcome the high turbidity and algal bloom problem declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this paper is supported by

13452,dissolved air flotation daf is a well established flotation technology for the pretreatment of water sources with a high algal bloom however high shear force generated during injection of microbubbles caused breakage of floc this study investigated the removal tendency of algae using daf sedimentation and microhollow beads combined with daf from a water sample collected from the nakdong river in korea the reduction in chl a as algae was 8 5 0 8 in daf and 2 8 0 3 mg m3 in daf with 90 mg l microhollow bead however a further increase in the microhollow bead concentration did not show a significant difference in chl a reduction for conventional daf the optimum flotation time was achieved in 4 min with a removal greater than 91 for daf with microhollow beads optimum flotation time was achieved in 2 min with a removal greater than 95 4 further for the sedimentation case the chl a removal observed was 26 7 and 87 2 for 5 and 30 min respectively different recycle ratios were tested for daf ranging between 5 and 15 the chl a removal achieved with 90 mg l microhollow beads was more than 95 for a 5 recycle ratio upon the addition of microhollow beads the removal was enhanced by 23 6 compared with daf further an increase in the recycle ratio with microhollow bead concentration did not show a significant enhancement in chl a removal keywords blue green algae chlorophyll a dissolved air flotation floc size microhollow bead 1 introduction harmful algal blooms such as blue green algae bga in freshwater pose a high threat to drinking water excessive amounts of bga growth restrict the performance of drinking water treatment plants by clogging the sand filters and inflicting additional harm through disinfection by products because of the higher insolation temperature and nutrient outflow 1 bga is known to bloom more frequently in the summer periods the unicellular bga can control its flotation 2 enabling migration to areas that are more conducive to its growth the ingestion of disinfection by products in laboratory animals showed the occurrence of bladder colon rectal 3 liver and kidney cancer 4 6 further microcystins anatoxin and saxitoxins which are neuro and liver toxins are also caused by blue green algae 7 thus the unicellular blue green algae are highly toxic and can cause harm to humans and animals 1 8 these toxic and harmful disinfection by products can enter the human body by inhalation drinking bathing and swimming 6 9 10 in addition by products are seen to occur more frequently with blue green algae because of geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol which are odor emitting products 11 the chemical methods for the removal of algae and algal organic matter aom from the source water available are the addition of algaecides such as copper ii sulfate oxidizers such as ozone potassium permanganate and sodium hypochlorite 8 12 and there are the physical methods such as coagulation flotation 8 and filtration 13 however dissolved air flotation daf is a well established flotation technology in the drinking water treatment process for the removal of low density floc containing algae 2 14 15 the floc formed during coagulation flocculation is removed from the water by microbubbles generated from daf attached to the floc the attachment of microbubbles to the surface of the floc leads to density reduction of the aggregate floc microbubbles less than density of water making aggregates float on the surface however the main component of the daf process is the saturator which generates microbubbles by saturating the water with air thus the optimization of the design and operation of daf depends on the characteristics of microbubbles and particles present in the water sources compared with conventional sedimentation daf shows a significant reduction of unsettleable particles or algae within a short retention time ranging between 5 and 15 min further daf can be operated at a higher hydraulic loading rate than that of sedimentation which reduces the carbon footprint the annual cost of operation and maintenance for the daf saturator is approximately 50 of the total cost 2 15 normally the recycle ratio of clarified water for the daf ranges between 5 and 15 which is saturated with air by a compressor the operating pressure for the saturator ranges from 450 to 550 kpa 15 the daf is difficult to operate for high turbidity conditions because of high shear force generated during the microbubble injection caused breakage of the floc however the use of low density floating microhollow beads in combination with daf can enhance flotation efficacy with a lower energy requirement coagulant dose and less floating time the use of microhollow beads has been tested for removal of particles of drinking water sources with high turbidity and high algae content in addition the microhollow beads could be used in all existing daf that are in use for the removal of algae and aom there are various types of microhollow beads studied to date as collectors for removing pollutants from water sources microhollow beads were used as absorbent to remove micro or nano particles 16 18 in terms of operation cost polyamine used in the sedimentation process is about 3 times cheaper than microhollow beads used in the flotation process however removal efficiency of algae by polyamine and microhollow beads were shown to be 60 and 95 respectively for stable drinking water production microhollow beads can be sufficiently applied when operating effects are considered rather than cost effects the main purpose of this study was to enhance the removal of algae from the water source by flotation assisted microhollow bead technology this study had several aims 1 to investigate the coagulation characteristics and rise velocity of the microhollow beads 2 to compare the removal behavior of bulk parameters and chlorophyll a chl a by conventional daf with different doses of polyaluminum chloride pac and 3 to investigate the efficacy of conventional sedimentation daf and daf processes assisted with microhollow beads based on chl a and particle removal the experiments were conducted considering various microhollow bead doses different flotation times and different recycle ratios for daf 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of raw water the feed water sample containing algae was collected from the nakdong river the nakdong river is one of the four major sources of drinking and industrial water in korea currently due to the high amounts of domestic and industrial outflow eutrophication occurs resulting in irregular outbursts of algal blooms 19 this occurs more frequently in the downstream area of the rivers where the nutrient collection occurs 20 21 table s1 shows the water quality parameters in the water treatment plant wtp sources in the nakdong river for august 2019 table 1 showed feed water characteristics of the raw water sample of the nakdong river whose average results were ph 7 9 toc 7 14 mg l turbidity 32 2 ntu and chl a 117 mg m3 because of frequent rainfall the water temperature in the nakdong river basin has increased increasing algal matter where the maximum chl a concentration was known to be 105 7 141 9 and 88 2 mg m3 for ds wtp hm wtp and mj wtp respectively this result in reduction of treatment capability of drinking wtps the main species is known to be microcystis sp which has buoyant characteristics owing to the species characteristics the ph of the ds wtp may increase to 9 where the water quality standards are 6 5 8 5 the feed waters of nakdong river used for this study were sampled downstream of the river the dominant species are microcystis sp table 1 shows the feedwater characteristics of the collected water 2 2 experiment setup to compare the characteristics of algae removal all processes were compared sedimentation daf microhollow beads and daf with microhollow beads the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation flotation were conducted using a jar tester phipps bird usa the jar used in the test was a circular acrylic reactor of 100 mm diameter and 200 mm long to inject saturated water and to collect treated water samples a valve was installed at 10 mm and 40 mm height from the bottom as a condition of daf a portable saturator was used to generate microbubbles which was made as a circular stainless steel cylinder of 50 mm diameter and 450 mm long the saturated water was prepared by injecting distilled water into the saturator and air with an air compressor to 550 kpa 2 3 microhollow beads and coagulant the microhollow beads used in this test were low density microhollow beads 3 m glass bubbles 3 m company usa which float after the removal of pollutants by distilled water the coagulant used in the test was pac 10 hongwon industry busan korea the beads were the hollow type with densities of 0 02 0 06 and 0 125 g cm3 the hollow holes enable them to float since micro hollow beads have a negative charge on the surface the influence of negative charge helps to form coagulantion efficiency from positive charge of the floc so the zeta potential mv of the microhollow beads was measured by a zeta analyzer nanoparticle analyzer sz 100 horiba japan at different ph conditions the microhollow bead has a negative charge which is similar to the general particles and it promotes flotation by attaching to the floc the detailed physical and chemical characteristics of the microhollow beads can be found elsewhere 15 before using the microhollow beads malfunctioning and damaged beads were removed by washing with deionized water for numerous cycles to reduce experimental errors the median diameter d 50 of the microhollow beads was found to be 52 8 μm moreover 10 of the microhollow beads were found to be 21 7 μm in diameter 2 4 rise velocity of microhollow beads the terminal rise velocity v of the microbubbles was tested and compared with microhollow beads with different densities using eqs 1 and 2 the rising velocity of microbubbles ʋb and microhollow beads ʋmb are 1 v b g ρ w ρ b d b 2 18 μ w 2 v m b g ρ w ρ m b d m b 2 18 μ w respectively where g is gravitational acceleration m s2 ρw ρb and ρmb are the densities kg m3 of water microbubbles and microhollow beads at 20 c respectively μw is dynamic viscosity n s m2 of water at 20 c and db and dmb is the diameter m of the microbubble and microhollow bead respectively the time of injecting the microhollow bead after forming the flocs was controlled when the coagulant cohered with the raw water particle if the coagulant and the bead are fed at the same time the coagulant recognizes the microhollow bead as a particle and forms a floc and thus more coagulant is required to treat the existing particle which is not economic therefore the technique of removing algae was developed by injecting microhollow beads at optimum condition i e in between mixing process 2 5 jar test experiment the experiment was operated at rapid mixing for 1 min at 150 rpm slow mixing for 5 min at 30 rpm and sedimentation for 30 min flotation followed rapid mixing for 30 s at 150 rpm the process was stopped for 30 s to add microhollow beads then rapid mixing was performed for 30 s at 150 rpm slow mixing for 5 min and flotation the ph was adjusted to 7 0 5 by injecting 0 1 n naoh for algae the pac dose of 1 12 mg l was fed to the reactor the pac amount was determined based on the chl a and total organic carbon toc removal by daf and the treatment tendency was studied by additionally analyzing toc and turbidity to determine the amount of microhollow beads the turbidity and chl a removal were confirmed by injecting 5 30 60 90 120 150 and 200 mg l microhollow beads were used to adhere to floc after dosing with pac the flotation was performed after rapid slow mixing and the sampling was performed within 5 min sampling was performed three times the treatment efficiency was confirmed according to the short flotation time using microhollow beads did not require long flotation time because most floc floats during the slow mixing 2 6 analysis and equipment in the current study the algae quantity was measured by detecting the chl a concentration with an algal concentration analyzer bbe fluorometer moldaenke germany the turbidity was measured with a turbidity meter 2100an hach co usa and the particulate matter was measured with a particle size analyzer accusizer 780a pss nicomp usa the algal species were observed with a fluorescent microscope observer z1 zeiss germany the organic matter was measured with a toc analyzer sievers m9 sievers usa zeta potential was measured with a nano particle analyzer sz 100 horiba japan based on the laser doppler electrophoresis technique coagulation and flocculation experiments were conducted by jar tester philips bird s richmond usa for daf operating a portable saturator was used to produce microbubble daf was designed as a circular stainless steel of diameter 50 mm and length 40 mm the saturated water was produced by injecting both distilled water and air the pressure of saturator was 4 5 5 5 kpa 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the microhollow bead 3 1 1 zeta potential analysis fig 1 shows the zeta potential of microhollow beads at different ph values the microbubbles from the conventional flotation process showed no significant change in the zeta potential at ph 6 3 or higher not shown however the microhollow beads were found to decrease the zeta potential continuously with increasing ph in addition the zeta potential of the microbubbles under ph 6 3 was 51 mv 22 and 34 mv 23 and the microhollow beads used in this study showed a zeta potential of 69 1 mv it means that the microhollow beads had a strong negative charge compared with the microbubbles in the ph 6 3 in particular the characteristics of the microhollow beads formula unit changes depending on the si o ratio in silicate structures 24 table s2 shows that the surface of the microhollow bead made by 3 m company is reported to consist of a si o ratio of 1 2 9 suggesting s i 3 2 making the microhollow bead surface negatively charged whereas the general si o ratio of sio2 quartz is 1 2 15 considering that the microhollow beads are composed of negative charges through the zeta potential it is considered that the sio2 changed to s i 3 2 through si oxidation as a result the microhollow beads are more effective in performing coagulant reactions because the surface potential of ordinary silicon oxide is composed of more negative charges thus the positively charged floc can adhere effectively to the microhollow beads 3 1 2 theoretical rise in the velocity of bubbles and microhollow beads because microhollow beads and microbubbles have a low density they float in water 2 25 the microhollow bead and microbubble under various densities were examined through stokes law which affects the rising velocity according to average particle size fig 2 under the same density conditions as the average particle size decreased the rising velocity had no effect however as particle size increased the microbubbles with low density could be floated at a faster rising velocity microbubbles 0 00119 g cm3 and microhollow beads 0 125 g cm3 with an average particle size of 150 μm showed velocities of 43 88 and 37 43 m h respectively however the general average particle size used in the flotation process is 40 60 μm 26 so under different density conditions the rising velocity showed similar values theoretically the microbubble density 0 00119 g cm3 is about 100 times lower than that of microhollow beads 0 125 g cm3 however water density is 0 998 g cm3 at 20 c which is higher than the other density values i e microhollow beads and microbubbles so both microhollow beads and microbubbles showed similar values at the average particle size of 40 60 μm therefore the rising velocity according to different densities was showed large change with large average particle size whereas it was showed the similar results when the particle size is small as a result there is no change in rising velocity with an identical particle size the microhollow beads have a larger negative charge than the microbubbles so the adhesion of the floc to the microhollow beads was larger than to the microbubbles 3 2 removal behavior of chl a and bulk parameters with varying pac dose microcystis sp has buoyant characteristics and chl a removal is not effective with optimal pac injection through sedimentation this is because there is a space inside the cell that can create buoyancy chl a toc and turbidity values are shown in fig 3 for the daf process with varying pac dose injections chl a removal increased with the increasing dose until 6 mg l of pac and further dose increase did not show a significant reduction the removal was 92 8 with the measured value of 8 5 0 8 mg m3 in a previous study the removal of chl a using microbubbles was more than 90 27 when compared with daf as sedimentation removal of chl a is about 80 it can induce unstable operation of water treatment plants in the summer season 28 toc removal followed the same trend as chl a a significant increase in toc removal was observed until a pac dose of 8 mg l and remained steady with a further increase in dose the value measured was 3 3 mg l or 53 reduction further turbidity removal increased with increasing pac dose a high turbidity removal was observed at 12 mg l of pac as 0 6 ntu i e 98 thus the optimum pac dose was set at 6 mg l for the daf process based on chl a and toc reduction 3 3 effect of daf with different microhollow beads the chl a removal rate with the optimal pac dose 6 mg l was confirmed through daf but the effect of microhollow beads had to be examined in the current experiments the effect of daf with microhollow beads was checked by measuring the removal of chl a and turbidity the addition of microhollow beads resulted in a reduction in chl a and turbidity fig 4 in particular chl a showed a constant value at 90 mg l microhollow beads while turbidity showed a constant value at 150 mg l microhollow beads because the surface of algae has sticky property microhollow bead has high bonding strength with floc so microhollow beads had less injection concentration when removing algae than removing turbidity the chl a concentration reduced from 8 5 0 8 mg m3 with daf to 2 8 0 3 daf with microhollow beads an increase in the removal of about 5 when negatively charged microbubble and microhollow bead are used at the same time the removal efficiency of algae can be improved because the adhesion efficiency of positively charged floc is more increased this indicated that the use of microhollow beads approached the performance of daf with 12 mg l pac over 90 mg l microhollow beads did not significantly affect chl a removal it is because the surface potential of the floc has been converted to neutral so that the residual positively charged microhollow beads are no longer attached to the floc in daf with microhollow beads the chl a removal was 97 5 the removal of turbidity increased by about 4 in daf with microhollow beads 90 mg l when compared with daf alone this is because of the lower specific gravity for the floc which is facilitated by the microhollow beads attaching to the surface of the floc 15 this facilitates the flotation process when daf is applied further microhollow beads facilitate creating a compact floc structure 2 29 3 4 result of microhollow beads attached to floc microcystis sp exist in colonized forms under natural conditions fig 5 because of the pores in the species microcystis sp in the cyanobacteria group can form colonies and float to the surface of water bodies 30 31 in addition microcystis sp exist in the form of colonies with a stable size because they release viscous extracellular organic matter eom thus the addition of microhollow beads after the rapid mixing stage results in the beads existing both inside and on the algae colonies fig 5 when microhollow beads were injected the size of the flocs gradually increased as they were attached to the pin floc thus microhollow bead could be treated by flotation process by increasing the size of floc such methods of algal species removal through flotation have been of constant interest 2 algal species exert metabolic substances in low molecular weight forms such as glycol and amino acids which are generally termed as eom these substances are highly attachable to various substances thereby aiding in the attachment to microhollow beads 3 5 effect of flotation time on daf and daf with microhollow beads because the microhollow bead collided with many flocs during rapid mixing it was found that most of the large flocs were floating in slow mixing therefore an experiment was conducted to determine how daf and daf with microhollow beads affect chl a removal during flotation time the performance of the system depends on the flotation time for the coagulation and flocculation a comparison of chl a removal with flotation time in daf and daf with microhollow beads is shown in fig 6 in the case of daf the chl a concentration was from 7 7 4 3 mg m3 for a 1 5 min flotation time the optimal flotation time was 4 min and chl a removal was 91 7 further increase in flotation time did not show a significant difference for daf with microhollow beads the chl a concentration was from 3 7 2 3 mg m3 for 1 5 min flotation time the optimal flotation time was 2 min and chl a removal was 95 4 daf with a microhollow bead at 1 min flotation time showed chl a removal two times higher than daf this is because as mentioned earlier during slow mixing microhollow beads were removed by floating the high concentration flocs first during flotation time daf with microhollow beads was able to remove chl a by removing low concentration flocs during flotation time the general flotation time of daf is 5 min but if microhollow bead is used the flotation process of daf can show high algae removal rate in 1 min the use of microhollow beads reduces the floc specific gravity which ultimately enhances the flotation within a shorter time 3 6 particle distribution in treated water samples the normalized distribution of particles in treated samples from sedimentation daf and daf with microhollow beads is shown in fig 7 the d 50 values for them were 2 7 1 7 and 1 3 μm respectively for the sedimentation the size of particles detected in the treated sample ranged from 1 to 200 μm with more than 90 particles 10 μm this is because of the low specific gravity of floc formed with microcystis a cyanobacterium that has a gas vacuole within the cell which facilitates controlling its buoyancy in water 2 which ultimately causes either suspension or flotation of floc on the surface in addition the size of microcystis sp is reported to be between 2 and 10 μm with a spherical shape 32 the number of particles measured in the treated sample from sedimentation was 17 324 counts ml by contrast the size distribution of particles in treated samples from both daf and daf with microhollow beads did not differ significantly with 90 of particles 4 and 3 5 μm respectively however there was a significant difference in the total number of particles measured in the treated sample the total number of particles measured was 20 673 and 7946 counts ml the high number of particles in the daf was because the floc was exposed to high energy created by bubbles which leads to breakage of the floc 2 the shear force of daf is reported to be between 1000 and 7600 s 1 33 for the daf with microhollow beads the lower particle count was because of the high bonding energy of the microhollow beads this caused the floc structure to be compact and even at a high shear force the microhollow beads withstood the force and facilitated a reinforcing role through the chemical bonding 15 3 7 effect of different recycle ratio for daf and daf with microhollow beads because daf has a high carbon footprint it is required to save energy in the water treatment process as a method of reducing the circulation ratio of the pressurized tank an experiment was conducted to test whether microhollow beads can effectively remove chl a as illustrated in fig 8 the performance of both daf and daf with microhollow beads depends on the recycle ratio for daf the chl a concentration ranged from 14 7 to 2 52 mg m3 as the recycle ratio increased from 5 to 15 the highest removal of 95 2 was observed for a 15 recycle ratio for the daf process daf with 90 mg l microhollow bead increased the removal of chl a for instance the achieved removal of chl a was more than 95 for a 5 recycle ratio with 90 mg l microhollow beads the removal was enhanced by 23 6 upon the addition of microhollow beads when compared with daf further an increase in the recycle ratio with microhollow bead concentration did not significantly enhance chl a removal the concentration of chl a ranged from 2 3 to 1 3 mg m3 for a recycle ratio of 5 15 for a 15 recycle ratio with microhollow beads the removal was 97 5 compared to daf daf with microhollow beads showed high efficiency of chl a treatment even with short floatation times from the results observed the added microhollow beads improved the flotation because the small spheres increased the incorporation of algae into the floc which resulted in less nonflocculated algae in the coagulation and flocculation processes further the smaller size of the microhollow beads may have provided nucleation points for coagulation precipitation for encouragement of floc formation and promote enmeshment of algae within the floc matrix 2 in addition for sedimentation chl a removal was 26 7 and 87 2 in a sedimentation time of 5 and 30 min respectively although the cost associated with microhollow beads injection was not considered chl a can be quickly removed when algae bloom occurs in the water treatment plant overall the use of microhollow beads can reduce the carbon footprint 3 8 floc breakage experiment of microhollow beads the breakage of flocs for with and without microhollow beads were conducted by floc breakage under the same conditions the results were analyzed by comparing the size of the destroyed flocs to determine the adhesion of microhollow beads fig 9 fig 9a showed the adhesion experiment of microhollow beads by the floc breakage experiment to demonstrate the floc strength the raw water collected was spiked using kaolin at a concentration of 200 mg l the experiment was conducted under without microhollow beads sedimentation and with microhollow beads with 200 mg l the concentration of pac used was 20 mg l the breakage of floc was facilitated by operating at 300 rpm and was analyzed by particle count analysis after 15 min the sizes of flocs d 50 for sedimentation and with microhollow beads were found to be 25 and 42 5 μm respectively however compared with microhollow beads the number of flocs with an average size of 15 μm was nearly two times higher for sedimentation the number of flocs measured was 1112 and 669 counts ml for sedimentation and with microhollow beads respectively further for the average floc size of 85 μm the numbers measured were 1224 and 1812 counts ml as a result a tendency was observed that under sedimentation large flocs are broken and transformed to flocs of small size in addition for with microhollow beads flocs of large and smaller sizes remained relatively higher and lower than sedimentation respectively this suggests that the microhollow beads support in increasing the strength of flocs and can withstand the high shear force therefore it is considered that the microhollow beads adhesion to the floc was effective and flocs of large size formed at low density could be an effective treatment of the flotation process fig 9b showed the cumulative percentage amount of broken flocs after operating at 300 rpm for 15 min with the increasing dose of microhollow beads the d 50 value increased d 50 for 100 200 400 800 and 1000 mg l were found to be 38 42 5 56 64 64 7 μm respectively it was confirmed that floc breakage decreased with an increasing dose of the microhollow beads 4 conclusion the present study investigated daf with microhollow beads to remove algae in terms of flotation process compared with daf the process supplemented with the microhollow beads daf with microhollow beads showed enhanced removal of chl a with the addition of the microhollow beads flotation time was reduced by half as compared with daf and the need for a high recycle ratio was minimized in addition when compared with sedimentation a smaller pac dose was required the floc breakage experiment revealed that the floc with microhollow beads was less prone to the high shear force compared with floc without microhollow beads in with microhollow beads the floc was exposed to a high shear force because of pressure release and microbubbles which caused floc breakage the daf with microhollow beads could be used in existing daf plants to overcome the high turbidity and algal bloom problem declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this paper is supported by

13453,a new type of composite adsorbent encapsulated chitosan modified magnetic carbon nanotubes cs mwcnts fe beads were used to remove hexavalent chromium cr vi from aqueous solutions in a fixed bed column among the various combination of operating parameters we obtain a maximum volume of treated effluent 210 ml under the following conditions flow rate 1 ml min 1 bed height 8 cm feed cr vi concentration 30 mg l 1 and solution ph 4 0 0 2 the corresponding adsorption capacity was 1 54 mg g 1 and the overall cr vi removal efficiency was 54 in characterizing the dynamics of the adsorption process and breakthrough profiles we found that the thomas model and the yoon nelson model both accurately described the breakthrough curves under all experimental conditions while the adams bohart model was applicable only for an early phase of dynamic behavior c t c 0 0 5 of the cs mwcnts fe beads column columns with shorter bed heights favored the global mass transfer rate especially during the early breakthrough periods moreover the bed depth service time bdst model was validated experimentally enabling the prediction of service time of the adsorption bed at different outlet concentrations using hypothetical flow rates and inlet concentrations scaled up study was performed to observe the column performance at higher throughputs the high selectivity of cr vi adsorption in the simulated wastewater in the presence of other heavy metals copper and cadmium and background anion phosphate suggests the applicability of cs mwcnts fe beads for cr vi removal from industrial effluents keywords chitosan chromium removal carbon nanotubes alginate water treatment fixed bed adsorption 1 introduction adsorption of hazardous heavy metals has been regarded as a matured cost effective and versatile method for industrial effluent treatment 1 one of the most concerned release of heavy metals is hexavalent chromium cr vi commonly in the forms of cro4 2 hcro4 and cr2o7 2 due to its strong solubility and diffusivity allowing the compounds to penetrate tissue membrane 2 the united states environmental protection agency usepa has set a maximum contamination level mcl for cr vi at 0 1 mg l 1 as total cr whereas the world health organization s who guideline is 0 05 mg l 1 and california s mcl is 0 01 mg l 1 legacy adsorption processes using pyrolyzed biomass residues biosorbents activated carbons typically perform at an adsorption capacity of 1 9 435 mg g 1 3 4 in recent years composite materials with modified functional components by crosslinking and grafting have been developed to improve both adsorption performance and regeneration for instance researchers have identified several types of materials for uptake of chromium cr and other heavy metal ions with excellent selectivity high uptake capacity and fast adsorption kinetics at low concentrations of metal ions these materials include electrospun polyacrylonitrile carbon nanotubes amine functionalized tio2 nanoparticles 732 mg cr vi g 1 5 amino functionalized polymer grafted mesoporous silica 415 mg cr vi g 1 6 magnetic mesoporous tio2 core shell microspheres immobilized with graphene oxide 118 mg cr vi g 1 7 chitosan g maleic anhydride ethylene dimethacrylate adsorbent 189 mg cr vi g 1 8 thiol decorated mesoporous silica 86 mg cd ii g 1 9 graphene oxide functionalized with amine 210 mg pb ii g 1 10 carbon nanotubes grafted with polypropylene amine 92 mg pd ii g 1 11 and a tailor made polymer 20 mg cr vi g 1 12 recently our research group prepared and characterized an encapsulated chitosan modified magnetic multi walled carbon nanotubes cs mwcnts fe beads for aqueous phase cr vi the cs mwcnts fe beads showed highest cr vi removal ct c0 0 06 than any of its components such as maghemite laden mwcnts beads 0 35 maghemite nanoparticles 0 58 and oxidized mwcnts 0 82 as well as most of the nano adsorbents 13 the improved cr vi uptake was attributed to the electrostatic interactions and the complexation between cr vi ions and amine groups incorporated in chitosan cs worked synergistically in the cs mwcnts fe beads the presence of mwcnts offered the enhanced porosity surface area and supporting functional groups hydroxyl and carboxyl groups to result in the improved adsorption capacity of 119 mg g 1 although the adsorbents mentioned above have demonstrated excellent adsorption capacities in sequestering cr and other heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions most of the experiments were performed in batch modes to characterize the equilibrium isotherms and adsorption kinetics adsorption parameters acquired from batch studies however may not be sufficient to determine the performance in treatment systems operated in continuous flow column and completely mixed modes 14 several researchers have reported that the fixed bed adsorption systems are the most effective method of adsorption desorption cycles because such systems can elucidate the effects of the concentration gradient i e adsorption driving force 15 in addition fixed bed adsorption systems also have many process design advantages including high volume operations and can be systematically scaled between bench and industrial units 16 however very few studies have investigated the removal of cr vi in fixed bed column adsorption process as in regard to the evaluation of the breakthrough curve using column models the present study aimed to determine the cr vi uptake performance by cs mwcnts fe beads in continuous flow fixed bed columns using different parameters including flow rate bed depth feed cr vi concentration and solution ph values several empirical models that have been used to characterize the adsorption of heavy metal ions namely the thomas model 17 18 yoon nelson y n model 19 20 and adams bohart a b model 21 22 are applied to fit the experimental data these models describe the breakthrough curves and obtain design process parameters such as adsorption kinetics and maximum uptake capacity furthermore the bed depth surface time bdst model is applied to analyze the service time of adsorbent bed at different outlet concentrations and to obtain data for scale up purposes we evaluated the cr vi adsorptivity when challenged with a mixture of heavy metals cu cd and an anions phosphate in the simulated wastewater representative of metal plating process discharges the adsorption capacity adsorbent breakthrough and saturation rate and processed bed volume are used as performance indicators of the cs mwcnts fe beads 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of composite beads the synthesis of the composite beads used for cr vi adsorption was described in details in our recent work 13 the paper also presents the materials

diffractometer xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and thermally with thermogravimetric analysis tga and differential thermal analysis dta briefly as received mwcnts were impregnated in a 3 1 v v mixture of reagent grade acids containing h2so4 and hno3 5 m at 100 c to remove any organic impurities and to functionalize the surface with hydroxyl and carboxyl groups the product was then filtered and washed with deionized water diw until ph neutrality was reached and then oven dried at 80 c for 12 h to prepare the iron laden mwcnts the conditioned mwcnts were re suspended in diw 1 g l 1 under sonication for 1 h to this a solution mixture 2 1 molar ratio containing fecl36 h2o 4 ml and feso47 h2o 1 ml was added gradually followed by dropping ammonium hydroxide to adjust the ph value to about 10 the magnetically precipitated iron laden mwcnt particles were rinsed with ethanol oven dried for the ensuing steps cs mwcnts fe particles were prepared by dissolving purified cs medium molecular weight sigma aldrich germany in diw containing 2 v v acetic acid 1 0 g l 1 the solution was gradually mixed with mwcnts fe suspension 1 0 g l 1 followed by adding galatraldehyde as the crosslinking agent the prepared cs mwcnts fe nanoparticles were encapsulated by alginate beads by adding 1 0 g cs mwcnts fe particles to sodium alginate solution 1 0 g l 1 the mixture was injected into 200 ml of calcium chloride solution 50 mm at a rate of 0 01 l h 1 while gently stirring for 12 h to allow crosslinking of ca2 with sodium alginate to form cs mwcnts fe beads finally the collected beads were washed air dried and stored for further use in adsorption experiment different stock solutions of cr vi cu ii cd ii and phosphate anions 1000 mg l 1 each were prepared by dissolving 2 8287 g of k2cr2o7 3 9293 g of cuso45 h2o 2 7442 g of cd no3 2 and 2 2350 g of k3po4 in 1 0 l of diw respectively further the required samples were prepared by diluting the stock solutions to a desired concentration the ph of these sample solutions was adjusted to a specified value using 1 m h2so4 and naoh solutions all the chemicals used in this study were of reagent grade 2 2 fixed bed adsorption studies fixed bed adsorption tests were performed using a glass column of 14 cm in length and 2 cm in internal diameter the column studies were operated using the following range of parameters flow rate 1 2 3 and 4 ml min 1 bed depth 4 6 and 8 cm feed cr vi concentration 30 50 and 100 mg l 1 ph 2 4 6 and 8 after packing with the cs mwcnts fe beads to a prescribed height the cr vi solution of predetermined concentrations and ph were fed to the column using a peristaltic pump eyela mp 2000 japan with a specified flow rates in the downward direction the effluent samples collected after a specified time interval at the outlet of the column were tested for residual cr vi ions through a spectrophotometry t60uv visble spectrophotometer u k using diphenylcarbazide as colorimetric reagent at the wavelength of 540 nm 23 among several important factors that affect the feasibility of a fixed bed adsorption system the potential interference of coexisting pollutants that usually contain other anionic and cationic pollutants in industrial wastewater effluent is also very important for this reason the simulated wastewater was used as the column feed and column adsorption process experiments were conducted for the simultaneous uptake of cr vi cu ii and cd ii at an initial feed concentration of 1 mg l 1 each other standard experimental conditions were 30 mg l 1 of phosphate as background anions a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 a bed depth of 8 cm and a solution ph of 4 0 2 the concentration of total chromium cu ii and cd ii was measured by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer model 7800 icp ms agilent u s a 2 3 determination of adsorption breakthrough curves the performance evaluation of the fixed bed column was studied based on the breakthrough behavior obtained by plotting ct c0 effluent to influent ratio versus time t the bed breakthrough and saturation were defined as the times for which the value of ct c0 reaches 5 and 95 respectively the total cr vi adsorbed in the adsorbent bed qtotal mg is determined through the following equation 1 q t o t a l q 1000 t 0 t t t o t a l c a d d t where q ml min 1 is the volumetric flow rate ttotal h is the total time of flow and cad mg l 1 is the difference in total cr vi ions at initial time and the time t caused by the adsorption in the column i e c a d c 0 c t here the adsorption capacity of

and tb and te h are the column breakthrough and saturation times respectively 2 4 empirical adsorption breakthrough models the adsorption dynamics of a fixed bed column can be described by using suitable models fitted on the experimental data necessary for the scale up proposes and performance comparison multiple mass transport factors such as the adsorption kinetics axial dispersion film mass transfer resistance and intraparticle diffusion limitations are involved in the fixed bed adsorption process complicating the adsorption process it necessitates the use of a set of nonlinear partial differential equations to simulate phenomenologically the process steps and to predict the breakthrough behavior of adsorption columns nevertheless fixed bed adsorption models usually exhibit some discrepancies between experimental and predicted data and empirical models are valuable in simplifying the process conceptualization to adequately characterize column breakthroughs these empirical models include the thomas model y n model and a b model furthermore the mass transfer factor mtf models were applied to determine the mass transfer resistance from the adsorption of cr vi onto cs mwcnts fe beads packed in the column the bdst model was also fitted to estimate the kinetic parameters depicting the relationship between bed depth and service time the model equations key assumptions and characteristics are summarized in table 1 detail narratives can be found in supplementary text s1 the models parameters were obtained by linear and non linear regression fit a nonlinear curve fitting was obtained using the regression tool solver add in in ms excel based on the magnitude of the coefficient of the determination r2 by minimizing the value of sum of squared error sse in this study standard error se and sse were used as instruments to measure the degree of model fits with the experimental values the expression for se and sse analysis are as follows 7 s e

mass transfer factor model the mtf models were employed to analyze the global internal and external mass transfer resistance from the adsorption onto the surface of adsorbent 24 25 at different bed heights of the column the external mass transfer coefficient can be expressed detail narratives can be found in supplementary text s1 9 l n c 0 c t k l a f t where k l a f indicates the external or film or volumetric film mass transfer coefficient h 1 kl m h 1 is the mass transfer coefficient a m 1 is the surface interfacial liquid solid and t h is the time of water fed to the column the relationship between the external and the global mass transfer coefficients can be expressed as follows 24 25 10 k l a f k l a g e β l n q by substituting eq 10 into eq 9 the following relation can be obtained 11 l n c 0 c t k l a g e β l n q t where k l a g is global mass transfer coefficient h 1 β g h mg 1 is the absorbate adsorbent affinity and q mg g 1 is the is quantity of the cr vi to adsorb

is the porous diffusion factor h 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of operating parameters fig 1 shows the adsorption capacity and saturation time i e time needed to achieve a 95 breakthrough when one of the operating parameters are varied and others kept constant as shown in fig 1a when the flow rate was increased from 1 to 2 ml min 1 the cr vi adsorption capacity of cs mwcnts fe beads increased from 1 52 mg g 1 to 1 79 mg g 1 while the saturation time decreased from 11 5 h to 6 0 h the increasing flow rates in this range led to both an increased mass loading and a reduced residence time for the cr vi solution in the column thereby causing the increased adsorption capacity and reduced saturation time further increases in flow rates however resulted in only a marginal change in both adsorption capacity and saturation time table s1 as the reynolds numbers 0 8 3 0 corresponding to the flow rate changes stayed within the laminar regime the effect of fluid turbulence on the external mass transfer resistance on the absorbent surface was minimal table s2 however the peclet numbers table s2 have been reported to have a marked impact on mass transfer coefficients in packed beds when its value transitioned from 100 at 1 ml min 1 in this study to 200 at a flow rate 3 ml min 1 26 therefore we reasoned that reduced residence time was the primary factor for the observed shorter saturation time however the effects of increased mass transfer resistance at a greater flow velocity may have compromised the adsorption capacity as flow rate increased of note our recent study on batch adsorption experiments exhibited much higher equilibrium adsorption capacity 119 mg g 1 than the value observed in column tests demonstrating that mass transfer process in continuous flow column operations represents a limiting factor in the adsorption of cr vi ions by the cs mwcnts fe beads in fixed bed column system additionally as the flow rate increases the effluent volume at breakthrough time v b decreases while the effluent volume at time of saturation vs increases for example at the flow rate of 2 ml min 1 the maximum removal efficiency reached 55 with a vb of 180 ml as compared to a removal rate of 53 and a vb of 210 ml at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the increase in cr vi removal efficiency with increasing flow rate from 1 to 2 ml min 1 is attributed to the mtz expansion from 5 6 to 6 0 cm details of calculation shown in table s1 these results corroborated with those described with the pattern of adsorption capacities at the various flow rates when the bed depth was increased from 4 cm to 8 cm the adsorption capacity increased from 0 60 mg g 1 to 1 52 mg g 1 as shown in fig 1b also the saturation time extended from 3 5 h to 11 5 h fig 1b the increase in the saturation time can also be attributed to a longer mtz 3 4 5 6 cm and ebct 0 21 to 0 42 h with the increment in bed depth the reduced adsorption capacity with the smaller bed depth was owing to the formation of a slow and shortened mtz that magnifies the adverse effect of axial dispersion resulting in the reduced diffusion of cr vi ions into the adsorbent beads cr vi removal efficiency increased from 27 0 53 6 for increasing adsorbent bed height from 4 to 8 cm table s1 summarily a longer bed depth is desired for improved adsorption capacity fig 1c shows that when the feed concentrations were 30 50 and 100 mg l 1 the adsorption capacities were 1 52 mg g 1 1 22 mg g 1 and 1 40 mg g 1 and the corresponding saturation times were about 11 5 h 6 0 h and 4 5 h furthermore with increasing in inlet cr vi concentration 30 100 mg l 1 the breakthrough time and removal efficiency decreased from 3 5 h to 0 5 h and from 53 6 to 35 1 respectively table s1 it is worth noting that a considerable increase in concentration provide a higher driving force and crowding of the diffusion path of cr vi which leads to fast mass transfer of cr vi ions into the cs mwcnt fe beads and increases the competition between metal ions which ultimately results in to quick breakthrough and rapid saturation solution ph is important to study because it greatly influence the ionic state of cr species and active sites present in the adsorbent that governs the pattern of adsorption fig 1d shows that at the solution ph of 2 4 6 and 8 the saturation times were 7 5 h 11 5 h 6 0 h and 3 0 h and the corresponding adsorption capacities were 1 01 mg g 1 1 52 mg g 1 0 70 mg g 1 and 0 26 mg g 1 respectively the longer saturation time and higher adsorption capacity observed for the solution at the ph of 4 0 2 revealed that the protonated groups cooh2 oh2 and nh3 present in cs mwcnts fe beads are capable of capturing the cr vi ions present in the solution in the form of hcro4 resulting in the higher removal of metal ions in acid regime i e ph 4 therefore ph 4 was taken as the optimum value for cr vi adsorption in other column experiments these trends matched well with those of the batch experiments reported in our prior study 13 in addition to these results we also investigated the chemical stability of cs mwcnts fe beads in acidic and alkaline conditions see supplementary text s2 and fig s2 the composite beads exhibited good stability within the ph range of 1 to 9 where minimal weight loss was observed however when the solution ph value increased from 10 to 13 the weight loss also increased from 4 to 10 the loss in final weight is attributed to the acidic and alkaline corrosion of the adsorbent beads therefore we postulated that the potential risk of the leakage of nanomaterials from the beads within the optimal ph range ph 4 0 remains negligible 3 2 adsorption breakthrough modeling fig 2 a c show the experimental breakthrough profiles for cr vi adsorption using the various operating parameters delineated earlier these experimental profiles were fitted with the thomas model curves in blue y n model red and a b model green the fitted model constants are summarized in supplemental materials table s3 for all model fittings nonlinear regression analysis provided higher accuracy as determined by se ranging from 7 10 9 to 1 10 3 for the thomas model and the y n model 7 10 7 to 2 10 4 for the a b model and by sse 9 10 3 to 1 10 2 for the thomas model and the y n model 4 10 4 to 1 10 2 for the a b model the r2 value ranged from 0 981 to 0 999 for the thomas model and y n model and from 0 944 to 0 993 for the a b model note that the a b model only fits well for the early phase of breakthrough curve c t c 0 0 5 and that the thomas model and the y n model share identical mathematical form hence the identical regression accuracies despite taking the same mathematical form the parameters in the thomas model and the y n model offer different interpretations for the thomas model as the flow rate increases 1 to 4 ml min 1 the kth value also increases 0 021 to 0 054 l h 1 mg 1 owing to the diminished mass transport resistance with the increased in flow rates 27 moreover with the initial increase in the flow rate from 1 to 2 ml min 1 the qth value also increase from 1 64 to 2 07 mg g 1 then it remains steady on further flow rate increase additionally with increasing bed depth from 4 cm to 8 cm leads to a decrease in kth value from 0 054 l h 1 mg 1 to 0 021 l h 1 mg 1 whereas qth values increases from 0 78 mg g 1 to 1 64 mg g 1 when cr vi feed concentration increases from 30 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 the kth values remained in the range of 0 021 to 0 012 l h 1 mg 1 while the qth values remained relatively constant between 1 64 and 1 73 mg g 1 the behaviors of kth and qth with respect to flow rate bed depth and feed concentration remain in parallel with what we presented in fig 1a c this is not the case for the two key parameters in the y n model where the kyn value generally increases from 0 62 h 1 to 1 61 h 1 with increasing flow rates decreases from 1 62 to 0 62 h 1 with greater bed heights and increases from 0 62 to 1 29 h 1 with feed concentrations the τ value has the opposite trends as it is inversely proportional to kyn for the a b model the value of nab increases from 662 3 mg l 1 to 913 2 mg l 1 with an increased flow rate from 1 to 3 ml min 1 followed by a decrease to 845 1 mg l 1 upon further increasing flow rate to 4 ml min 1 in addition the kab value increases from 0 014 l mg 1 h 1 to 0 036 l mg 1 h 1 with the increased flow rate from 1 ml min 1 to 4 ml min 1 suggesting that the adsorption kinetics in the early part of the adsorption ct c0 0 5 is controlled by external mass transfer 28 30 when bed height is expanded from 4 cm to 8 cm the nab value increases from 353 1 mg l 1 to 662 3 mg l 1 while the kab value declines from 0 035 l mg 1 h 1 to 0 014 l mg 1 h 1 the increase in feed cr vi concentration from 30 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 also leads to an increase in nab value from 662 3 mg l 1 to 750 0 mg l 1 but the kab value decreases from 0 014 l mg 1 h 1 to 0 009 l mg 1 h 1 these results further support our earlier hypothesis that the film mass transfer control the adsorption kinetics of the system at the early phase of adsorption at a larger flow rate as such the thomas model parameters kth and qth have physical implications reflecting the mass transfer rate and adsorption capacity for example a larger value in kth at a lower cr vi feed concentration indicates that the adsorption of cr vi ions onto the cs mwcnts fe beads in packed bed columns was kinetically favorable at lower concentrations this model is best fit for the conditions with minimal external and internal diffusion resistance the high correlation values and the consistency of qth with those of experimental values indicates that cr vi adsorption mechanism by cs mwcnts fe beads follows the langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order adsorption kinetics 27 31 in comparison the y n model takes advantage of the symmetric nature of the equation and uses the first 50 column breakthrough to project the entire breakthrough pattern in this study the τ values determined by the model equation are consistently close to the experimental data therefore the y n model can reliably predict the saturation time of the cs mwcnts fe beads column by comparison the a b model assumes that that the rate of adsorption process is influenced by external mass transfer and that equilibrium does not occur instantaneously rendering the model applicable only to the initial part of a breakthrough curve ct c0 0 5 here the fact that the a b model agrees well with our experimental data for the initial breakthrough curves reflects that external mass transfer is prominent during the early portion of the adsorption process 3 3 mass transfer analysis using the mtf models 24 25 the linearized plots of ln q versus ln t resulted in good correlation r2 0 96 that enables the determination of the value 1 β slope and of b i e intercept the values of b decreased from 1 58 to 1 86 mg g 1 and 1 β from 1 12 to 1 05 g h mg 1 with increment in bed heights from 4 to 8 cm table s4 indicating that a shorter bed depth is advantageous for better mass transfer than longer depths to elucidate the controlling mass transfer factor we plotted the global mass transfer coefficient and its two components i e external and porous diffusion fig 3 a shows the rate of global mass transfer for the adsorption of cr vi onto cs mwcnts fe beads it is evident that during early breakthrough periods ct c0 0 2 there were marked differences in the global mass transfer rate favoring columns with shorter bed depths i e kla g values in the order of 4 cm 6 cm 8 cm furthermore the analysis of film transfer rate coefficient fig 3b and diffusion mass transfer coefficient fig 3c illustrate an opposite trend all kla f profiles exhibited an asymptotic pattern approaching zero when significant breakthroughs occurred clearly impelled by the greater concentration gradient between the bulk solution and the solid surface in the early phase of breakthroughs moreover we noted that significant film transfer occurred only in the limited breakthrough window ct c0 0 05 for the bed height of 8 cm whereas a similar rate could still be observed at ct c0 0 4 for the 4 cm packed column conversely fig 3c reveals that the rate of pore diffusion kla d that occurs once an ion penetrates the film and reaches the solid surface was greater for longer bed depths while the reversal of the trend was largely a result of the differences in film transfer rate another conceivable explanation for this result is that the interstitial hydrodynamics changed as the packed bed was extended these analyses point to the fact that packing depth represents a design variable that influences the mass transfer rates and the cr vi adsorption on cs mwcnts fe beads 3 4 bdst model and column scaleup fig 4 reveals the of service time as a function of adsorbent bed height using four saturation ratios ct c0 0 05 0 25 0 50 and 0 95 fitting with the experimental data indicates a highly linear relationship r2 0 98 this result enables us to use the bdst model equation to estimate the model parameters n0 and kb via determining the slope a n 0 c 0 v and intercept b 1 k b c 0 l n c 0 c t 1 of the fitted linear curves with the increase of ct c0 from 0 05 to 0 95 the value of n0 increased from 5 97 mg l 1 to 19 10 mg l 1 while the kb values decreased calculated results can be found in supplemental table s5 the parameter n0 is the adsorption equilibrium capacity and kb is the adsorption rate both dependent of the mass loading reflected by the presence of c0 and v a significant increase in n0 value versus ct c0 reflects the high adsorption capacity of the bed with increased mass loadings conversely a decreasing kb value is indicative of slower adsorption rate of cr vi ions as the process approaches complete breakthrough it is worth noting that despite its simplicity for the prediction of breakthrough time the bdst model may not be applicable for depicting the adsorption behavior over the entire breakthrough range because its symmetric nature of a logic function i e s shaped curve does not match well with most breakthrough profiles consequently the parameter values n0 and kb at the extended breakthrough range should only be taken with limited contexts such as observing its trend as opposed of using it as a design basis the high correlation between the experimental tb and calculated breakthrough time tc validates the applicability of bdst for this study therefore we further applied the model to predict column performance at other hypothetical operating conditions flow rates and feed concentrations for cr vi adsorption on to cs mwcnts fe beads in packed bed column this prediction step can be achieved by establishing new values of slope a and intercept b proportional to the ratio of hypothetical and validated conditions in both c0 and v 15 a a v v a c 0 c 0 16 b b c 0 c 0 l n c 0 1 l n c 0 1 the prediction utilizes n0 and kb values determined from the same flow rate and feed cr vi concentration to modify the bdst model by using a hypothetical concentration c0 5 mg l 1 and bed height 30 cm at a low flow rate 1 ml min 1 the predicted service time for ct c0 0 05 0 25 and 0 50 were about 118 210 and 282 h respectively the service time decreased to 3 3 5 9 and 7 85 h for the corresponding ct c0 values upon increasing feed cr vi concentration to 200 mg l 1 similarly with a hypothetically high flow rate 10 ml min 1 while maintaining identical feed concentration 5 mg l 1 and bed height 30 cm the predicted service time became 16 4 29 1 and 38 5 h for the corresponding ct c0 ratios the predicted breakthrough time for new bed depth z feed concentration c0 and flow rate q are listed in table s6 the scale up study was further extended by using the number of bed volume nbv method whose value can be calculated for particular experimental conditions such as flow rate bed height and inlet cr vi concentration nbv can be expressed as 30 17 n b v v o l u m e o f w a t e r t r e a t e d t i l l b r e a k t h r o u g h p o i n t v o l u m e o f t h e a d s o r b e n t b e d at any bed height and cross sectional area of the scaled up column the volume of treated effluent can be estimated by nbv times with the packed bed volume the new packed bed volume can be obtained by changing the bed height and cross sectional area of the column while maintaining one as a constant at a time the breakthrough time can be estimated by using the obtained volume of effluent processed divided by the flow rate for this study the estimated amount of cs mwcnts fe beads required for packing the column to achieve the desired breakthrough time can be obtained by multiplying the bulk density 0 4718 g cm 3 as measured by the cylinder method of adsorbent with the volume of scaled up bed the calculations were executed at a feed cr vi concentration 30 mg l 1 and two flow rates 50 ml min 1 and 100 ml min 1 fig 5 a shows the scaled up column performance at varying bed depths 10 cm 60 cm while keeping the column diameter 10 cm constant the scaling criteria was selected on the basis of linear flow velocity 0 32 cm min 1 as observed for the baseline conditions used in the lab scale study for example 4 4 kg of adsorbent would be needed to obtain a breakthrough time of 26 h for a flow rate of 50 ml min 1 and 13 h for 100 ml min 1 similarly 8 8 kg would be required to extend the breakthrough time to 53 h for a flow rate of 50 ml min 1 and 26 h for 100 ml min 1 conversely one can estimate the breakthrough time by varying the column diameter 10 cm 20 cm while maintaining a constant bed height 30 cm for example fig 5b indicates that 6 4 kg of adsorbent would be needed to pack a column with a diameter of 14 cm to obtain a breakthrough time of 52 h at a flow rate of 50 ml min 1 and 26 h at 100 ml min 1 when the column diameter is increased to 20 cm 17 8 kg would be required to achieve a breakthrough time of 105 h at 50 ml min 1 and 53 h at 100 ml min 1 3 5 applicability of cs mwcnts fe beads fixed bed column in treating a simulated effluent the simultaneous uptake of three metal ions cr vi cu ii and cd ii each at a feed concentration of 1 mg l 1 by the fixed bed columns packed with cs mwcnts fe beads was investigated in the presence of phosphate 30 mg l 1 as a background anion the ph of the simulated effluent was kept at 4 0 0 2 a condition identified as the optimal for cr vi adsorption in the single component system fig 6 a shows that cd ii broke through the column within two hours followed in the order by cu ii and cr vi notably the cr vi adsorption breakthrough profile exhibited a highly symmetric pattern that still fitted well with the thomas model r2 0 98 a b model r2 0 94 for ct c0 50 and y n model r2 0 98 in contrast the breakthrough curves of cu ii and cd ii showed a distinctly different pattern from that of cr vi not only did cd ii completely break through within a period of time its ct c0 value overshot to a value of 1 25 before stabilizing toward the equilibrium in contrast cu ii also broke through immediately after the commencement of the column run then stabilized at c c0 0 8 but never reached complete breakthrough the time it took to reach a ct c0 plateau was significantly longer for cr vi than they were for cu ii and cd ii the longer time to experience a breakthrough suggests that the column favored the cr vi adsorption over the two other metal ions the preference of cr vi in the ternary system at ph 4 clearly exhibited a competitive adsorption phenomenon we hypothesized that the electrosorption between hcro4 and protonated binding groups cooh2 oh2 nh3 on cs mwcnts fe beads dominated the adsorption over chelation n h 2 c u 2 c d 2 n h 2 c u 2 c d 2 or ion exchange c a 2 with c u 2 and c d 2 that were likely the main adsorption mechanisms for divalent cations between cu ii and cd ii the higher electronegativity 1 95 and smaller hydrated ionic radii 0 419 nm of cu ii might be responsible of its higher adsorption affinity than that of cd ii electronegativity 1 69 hydrated ionic radii 0 426 nm leading to a competitive advantage furthermore phosphate as a background anion matrix did not significantly interfere with the adsorption and breakthrough behaviors of cr vi and cd ii however the formation of stable precipitates such as cu3 po4 2 during the adsorption process is a plausible explanation to why cu ii never approached complete breakthrough by monitoring the effluent concentration altogether we present fig 6b to illustrate the following process i all three metal ions were adsorbed on cs mwcnts fe beads at the beginning when unoccupied active sites were abundant ii adsorption sites occupied by cd ii ions were replaced by both cr vi and cu ii ions as they continued to be adsorbed iii cr vi ions continued to be adsorbed while cu ii attained an equilibrium iv cr vi ions adsorption attained an equilibrium an early level cost estimate indicates that a cost window between us 10 and us 11 per kilogram of the cs mwcnts fe composite beads including basic cost components associated with materials and energy derived from the laboratory scale synthesis economy of scale would certainly drive down the production cost if a market demand exists even so the estimated cost is on par with the market price of commercial activated carbons table s7 commonly used for the treatment of wastewater concerning the operating costs while pilot scale testing data are not available to justify a reliable cost estimate we projected that 1 kg of cs mwcnts fe beads can process approximately 25 l of cr vi laden wastewater at 5 breakthrough ratio ct c0 during its first cycle of operation with a minimum of five consecutive cycles as demonstrated in our previous study 13 4 conclusions the present study characterizes the performance of cs mwcnts fe beads for aqueous phase cr vi removal in fixed bed columns a maximum volume of treated effluent of 210 ml and an cr vi uptake capacity of 1 52 mg g 1 were achieved at 1 ml min 1 in flow rate 8 cm in bed height 30 mg l 1 in feed cr vi concentration and a ph value of 4 both the thomas model and y n model are well suited to describe the dynamics of the adsorption breakthrough process of cr vi while the a b model was applicable only to describe the early phase of the dynamic behavior ct c0 0 5 of the column the parameters in the thomas model and a b model possess physical implications that reflect the effects of the various operating parameters flow

13453,a new type of composite adsorbent encapsulated chitosan modified magnetic carbon nanotubes cs mwcnts fe beads were used to remove hexavalent chromium cr vi from aqueous solutions in a fixed bed column among the various combination of operating parameters we obtain a maximum volume of treated effluent 210 ml under the following conditions flow rate 1 ml min 1 bed height 8 cm feed cr vi concentration 30 mg l 1 and solution ph 4 0 0 2 the corresponding adsorption capacity was 1 54 mg g 1 and the overall cr vi removal efficiency was 54 in characterizing the dynamics of the adsorption process and breakthrough profiles we found that the thomas model and the yoon nelson model both accurately described the breakthrough curves under all experimental conditions while the adams bohart model was applicable only for an early phase of dynamic behavior c t c 0 0 5 of the cs mwcnts fe beads column columns with shorter bed heights favored the global mass transfer rate especially during the early breakthrough periods moreover the bed depth service time bdst model was validated experimentally enabling the prediction of service time of the adsorption bed at different outlet concentrations using hypothetical flow rates and inlet concentrations scaled up study was performed to observe the column performance at higher throughputs the high selectivity of cr vi adsorption in the simulated wastewater in the presence of other heavy metals copper and cadmium and background anion phosphate suggests the applicability of cs mwcnts fe beads for cr vi removal from industrial effluents keywords chitosan chromium removal carbon nanotubes alginate water treatment fixed bed adsorption 1 introduction adsorption of hazardous heavy metals has been regarded as a matured cost effective and versatile method for industrial effluent treatment 1 one of the most concerned release of heavy metals is hexavalent chromium cr vi commonly in the forms of cro4 2 hcro4 and cr2o7 2 due to its strong solubility and diffusivity allowing the compounds to penetrate tissue membrane 2 the united states environmental protection agency usepa has set a maximum contamination level mcl for cr vi at 0 1 mg l 1 as total cr whereas the world health organization s who guideline is 0 05 mg l 1 and california s mcl is 0 01 mg l 1 legacy adsorption processes using pyrolyzed biomass residues biosorbents activated carbons typically perform at an adsorption capacity of 1 9 435 mg g 1 3 4 in recent years composite materials with modified functional components by crosslinking and grafting have been developed to improve both adsorption performance and regeneration for instance researchers have identified several types of materials for uptake of chromium cr and other heavy metal ions with excellent selectivity high uptake capacity and fast adsorption kinetics at low concentrations of metal ions these materials include electrospun polyacrylonitrile carbon nanotubes amine functionalized tio2 nanoparticles 732 mg cr vi g 1 5 amino functionalized polymer grafted mesoporous silica 415 mg cr vi g 1 6 magnetic mesoporous tio2 core shell microspheres immobilized with graphene oxide 118 mg cr vi g 1 7 chitosan g maleic anhydride ethylene dimethacrylate adsorbent 189 mg cr vi g 1 8 thiol decorated mesoporous silica 86 mg cd ii g 1 9 graphene oxide functionalized with amine 210 mg pb ii g 1 10 carbon nanotubes grafted with polypropylene amine 92 mg pd ii g 1 11 and a tailor made polymer 20 mg cr vi g 1 12 recently our research group prepared and characterized an encapsulated chitosan modified magnetic multi walled carbon nanotubes cs mwcnts fe beads for aqueous phase cr vi the cs mwcnts fe beads showed highest cr vi removal ct c0 0 06 than any of its components such as maghemite laden mwcnts beads 0 35 maghemite nanoparticles 0 58 and oxidized mwcnts 0 82 as well as most of the nano adsorbents 13 the improved cr vi uptake was attributed to the electrostatic interactions and the complexation between cr vi ions and amine groups incorporated in chitosan cs worked synergistically in the cs mwcnts fe beads the presence of mwcnts offered the enhanced porosity surface area and supporting functional groups hydroxyl and carboxyl groups to result in the improved adsorption capacity of 119 mg g 1 although the adsorbents mentioned above have demonstrated excellent adsorption capacities in sequestering cr and other heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions most of the experiments were performed in batch modes to characterize the equilibrium isotherms and adsorption kinetics adsorption parameters acquired from batch studies however may not be sufficient to determine the performance in treatment systems operated in continuous flow column and completely mixed modes 14 several researchers have reported that the fixed bed adsorption systems are the most effective method of adsorption desorption cycles because such systems can elucidate the effects of the concentration gradient i e adsorption driving force 15 in addition fixed bed adsorption systems also have many process design advantages including high volume operations and can be systematically scaled between bench and industrial units 16 however very few studies have investigated the removal of cr vi in fixed bed column adsorption process as in regard to the evaluation of the breakthrough curve using column models the present study aimed to determine the cr vi uptake performance by cs mwcnts fe beads in continuous flow fixed bed columns using different parameters including flow rate bed depth feed cr vi concentration and solution ph values several empirical models that have been used to characterize the adsorption of heavy metal ions namely the thomas model 17 18 yoon nelson y n model 19 20 and adams bohart a b model 21 22 are applied to fit the experimental data these models describe the breakthrough curves and obtain design process parameters such as adsorption kinetics and maximum uptake capacity furthermore the bed depth surface time bdst model is applied to analyze the service time of adsorbent bed at different outlet concentrations and to obtain data for scale up purposes we evaluated the cr vi adsorptivity when challenged with a mixture of heavy metals cu cd and an anions phosphate in the simulated wastewater representative of metal plating process discharges the adsorption capacity adsorbent breakthrough and saturation rate and processed bed volume are used as performance indicators of the cs mwcnts fe beads 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of composite beads the synthesis of the composite beads used for cr vi adsorption was described in details in our recent work 13 the paper also presents the materials

diffractometer xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and thermally with thermogravimetric analysis tga and differential thermal analysis dta briefly as received mwcnts were impregnated in a 3 1 v v mixture of reagent grade acids containing h2so4 and hno3 5 m at 100 c to remove any organic impurities and to functionalize the surface with hydroxyl and carboxyl groups the product was then filtered and washed with deionized water diw until ph neutrality was reached and then oven dried at 80 c for 12 h to prepare the iron laden mwcnts the conditioned mwcnts were re suspended in diw 1 g l 1 under sonication for 1 h to this a solution mixture 2 1 molar ratio containing fecl36 h2o 4 ml and feso47 h2o 1 ml was added gradually followed by dropping ammonium hydroxide to adjust the ph value to about 10 the magnetically precipitated iron laden mwcnt particles were rinsed with ethanol oven dried for the ensuing steps cs mwcnts fe particles were prepared by dissolving purified cs medium molecular weight sigma aldrich germany in diw containing 2 v v acetic acid 1 0 g l 1 the solution was gradually mixed with mwcnts fe suspension 1 0 g l 1 followed by adding galatraldehyde as the crosslinking agent the prepared cs mwcnts fe nanoparticles were encapsulated by alginate beads by adding 1 0 g cs mwcnts fe particles to sodium alginate solution 1 0 g l 1 the mixture was injected into 200 ml of calcium chloride solution 50 mm at a rate of 0 01 l h 1 while gently stirring for 12 h to allow crosslinking of ca2 with sodium alginate to form cs mwcnts fe beads finally the collected beads were washed air dried and stored for further use in adsorption experiment different stock solutions of cr vi cu ii cd ii and phosphate anions 1000 mg l 1 each were prepared by dissolving 2 8287 g of k2cr2o7 3 9293 g of cuso45 h2o 2 7442 g of cd no3 2 and 2 2350 g of k3po4 in 1 0 l of diw respectively further the required samples were prepared by diluting the stock solutions to a desired concentration the ph of these sample solutions was adjusted to a specified value using 1 m h2so4 and naoh solutions all the chemicals used in this study were of reagent grade 2 2 fixed bed adsorption studies fixed bed adsorption tests were performed using a glass column of 14 cm in length and 2 cm in internal diameter the column studies were operated using the following range of parameters flow rate 1 2 3 and 4 ml min 1 bed depth 4 6 and 8 cm feed cr vi concentration 30 50 and 100 mg l 1 ph 2 4 6 and 8 after packing with the cs mwcnts fe beads to a prescribed height the cr vi solution of predetermined concentrations and ph were fed to the column using a peristaltic pump eyela mp 2000 japan with a specified flow rates in the downward direction the effluent samples collected after a specified time interval at the outlet of the column were tested for residual cr vi ions through a spectrophotometry t60uv visble spectrophotometer u k using diphenylcarbazide as colorimetric reagent at the wavelength of 540 nm 23 among several important factors that affect the feasibility of a fixed bed adsorption system the potential interference of coexisting pollutants that usually contain other anionic and cationic pollutants in industrial wastewater effluent is also very important for this reason the simulated wastewater was used as the column feed and column adsorption process experiments were conducted for the simultaneous uptake of cr vi cu ii and cd ii at an initial feed concentration of 1 mg l 1 each other standard experimental conditions were 30 mg l 1 of phosphate as background anions a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 a bed depth of 8 cm and a solution ph of 4 0 2 the concentration of total chromium cu ii and cd ii was measured by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer model 7800 icp ms agilent u s a 2 3 determination of adsorption breakthrough curves the performance evaluation of the fixed bed column was studied based on the breakthrough behavior obtained by plotting ct c0 effluent to influent ratio versus time t the bed breakthrough and saturation were defined as the times for which the value of ct c0 reaches 5 and 95 respectively the total cr vi adsorbed in the adsorbent bed qtotal mg is determined through the following equation 1 q t o t a l q 1000 t 0 t t t o t a l c a d d t where q ml min 1 is the volumetric flow rate ttotal h is the total time of flow and cad mg l 1 is the difference in total cr vi ions at initial time and the time t caused by the adsorption in the column i e c a d c 0 c t here the adsorption capacity of adsorbent bed qe mg g 1 and the equilibrium concentration of cr vi ions ce mg l 1 are calculated as follows 2 q e q t o t a l w 3 c e 1000 m t o t a l q t o t a l q t t o t a l where w g is the amount adsorbent packed in the column and mtotal mg is the amount of total cr vi ions passing through the column i e m t o t a l c 0 q t t o t a l 1000 the fractional removal of cr vi ions r can be expressed as the ratio of qtotal and mtotal other parameters associated with fixed bed column characterizations are the linear flow velocity v cm min 1 the empty bed contact time ebct h and the length of mass

and tb and te h are the column breakthrough and saturation times respectively 2 4 empirical adsorption breakthrough models the adsorption dynamics of a fixed bed column can be described by using suitable models fitted on the experimental data necessary for the scale up proposes and performance comparison multiple mass transport factors such as the adsorption kinetics axial dispersion film mass transfer resistance and intraparticle diffusion limitations are involved in the fixed bed adsorption process complicating the adsorption process it necessitates the use of a set of nonlinear partial differential equations to simulate phenomenologically the process steps and to predict the breakthrough behavior of adsorption columns nevertheless fixed bed adsorption models usually exhibit some discrepancies between experimental and predicted data and empirical models are valuable in simplifying the process conceptualization to adequately characterize column breakthroughs these empirical models include the thomas model y n model and a b model furthermore the mass transfer factor mtf models were applied to determine the mass transfer resistance from the adsorption of cr vi onto cs mwcnts fe beads packed in the column the bdst model was also fitted to estimate the kinetic parameters depicting the relationship between bed depth and service time the model equations key assumptions and characteristics are summarized in table 1 detail narratives can be found in supplementary text s1 the models parameters were obtained by linear and non linear regression fit a nonlinear curve fitting was obtained using the regression tool solver add in in ms excel based on the magnitude of the coefficient of the determination r2 by minimizing the value of sum of squared error sse in this study standard error se and sse were used as instruments to measure the degree of model fits with the experimental values the expression for se and sse analysis are as follows 7 s e c c a l c e x p 2 n 8 s s e c c a l c e x p 2 where ccal and cexp are the calculated and experimental outlet concentrations respectively in terms of ct c0 and n is the experimental observations 2 5 mass transfer factor model the mtf models were employed to analyze the global internal and external mass transfer resistance from the adsorption onto the surface of adsorbent 24 25 at different bed heights of the column the external mass transfer coefficient can be expressed detail narratives can be found in supplementary text s1 9 l n c 0 c t k l a f t where k l a f indicates the external or film or volumetric film mass transfer coefficient h 1 kl m h 1 is the mass transfer coefficient a m 1 is the surface interfacial liquid solid and t h is the time of water fed to the column the relationship between the external and the global mass transfer coefficients can be expressed as follows 24 25 10 k l a f k l a g e β l n q by substituting eq 10 into eq 9 the following relation can be obtained 11 l n c 0 c t k l a g e β l n q t where k l a g is global mass transfer coefficient h 1 β g h mg 1 is the absorbate adsorbent affinity and q mg g 1 is the is quantity of the cr vi to adsorb by the cs mwcnts fe beads the mathematical deduction and linearization of eq 11 leads to 12 l n q b 1 β l n t where b mg g 1 indicates the potential mass transfer index relating to the driving force

is the porous diffusion factor h 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of operating parameters fig 1 shows the adsorption capacity and saturation time i e time needed to achieve a 95 breakthrough when one of the operating parameters are varied and others kept constant as shown in fig 1a when the flow rate was increased from 1 to 2 ml min 1 the cr vi adsorption capacity of cs mwcnts fe beads increased from 1 52 mg g 1 to 1 79 mg g 1 while the saturation time decreased from 11 5 h to 6 0 h the increasing flow rates in this range led to both an increased mass loading and a reduced residence time for the cr vi solution in the column thereby causing the increased adsorption capacity and reduced saturation time further increases in flow rates however resulted in only a marginal change in both adsorption capacity and saturation time table s1 as the reynolds numbers 0 8 3 0 corresponding to the flow rate changes stayed within the laminar regime the effect of fluid turbulence on the external mass transfer resistance on the absorbent surface was minimal table s2 however the peclet numbers table s2 have been reported to have a marked impact on mass transfer coefficients in packed beds when its value transitioned from 100 at 1 ml min 1 in this study to 200 at a flow rate 3 ml min 1 26 therefore we reasoned that reduced residence time was the primary factor for the observed shorter saturation time however the effects of increased mass transfer resistance at a greater flow velocity may have compromised the adsorption capacity as flow rate increased of note our recent study on batch adsorption experiments exhibited much higher equilibrium adsorption capacity 119 mg g 1 than the value observed in column tests demonstrating that mass transfer process in continuous flow column operations represents a limiting factor in the adsorption of cr vi ions by the cs mwcnts fe beads in fixed bed column system additionally as the flow rate increases the effluent volume at breakthrough time v b decreases while the effluent volume at time of saturation vs increases for example at the flow rate of 2 ml min 1 the maximum removal efficiency reached 55 with a vb of 180 ml as compared to a removal rate of 53 and a vb of 210 ml at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the increase in cr vi removal efficiency with increasing flow rate from 1 to 2 ml min 1 is attributed to the mtz expansion from 5 6 to 6 0 cm details of calculation shown in table s1 these results corroborated with those described with the pattern of adsorption capacities at the various flow rates when the bed depth was increased from 4 cm to 8 cm the adsorption capacity increased from 0 60 mg g 1 to 1 52 mg g 1 as shown in fig 1b also the saturation time extended from 3 5 h to 11 5 h fig 1b the increase in the saturation time can also be attributed to a longer mtz 3 4 5 6 cm and ebct 0 21 to 0 42 h with the increment in bed depth the reduced adsorption capacity with the smaller bed depth was owing to the formation of a slow and shortened mtz that magnifies the adverse effect of axial dispersion resulting in the reduced diffusion of cr vi ions into the adsorbent beads cr vi removal efficiency increased from 27 0 53 6 for increasing adsorbent bed height from 4 to 8 cm table s1 summarily a longer bed depth is desired for improved adsorption capacity fig 1c shows that when the feed concentrations were 30 50 and 100 mg l 1 the adsorption capacities were 1 52 mg g 1 1 22 mg g 1 and 1 40 mg g 1 and the corresponding saturation times were about 11 5 h 6 0 h and 4 5 h furthermore with increasing in inlet cr vi concentration 30 100 mg l 1 the breakthrough time and removal efficiency decreased from 3 5 h to 0 5 h and from 53 6 to 35 1 respectively table s1 it is worth noting that a considerable increase in concentration provide a higher driving force and crowding of the diffusion path of cr vi which leads to fast mass transfer of cr vi ions into the cs mwcnt fe beads and increases the competition between metal ions which ultimately results in to quick breakthrough and rapid saturation solution ph is important to study because it greatly influence the ionic state of cr species and active sites present in the adsorbent that governs the pattern of adsorption fig 1d shows that at the solution ph of 2 4 6 and 8 the saturation times were 7 5 h 11 5 h 6 0 h and 3 0 h and the corresponding adsorption capacities were 1 01 mg g 1 1 52 mg g 1 0 70 mg g 1 and 0 26 mg g 1 respectively the longer saturation time and higher adsorption capacity observed for the solution at the ph of 4 0 2 revealed that the protonated groups cooh2 oh2 and nh3 present in cs mwcnts fe beads are capable of capturing the cr vi ions present in the solution in the form of hcro4 resulting in the higher removal of metal ions in acid regime i e ph 4 therefore ph 4 was taken as the optimum value for cr vi adsorption in other column experiments these trends matched well with those of the batch experiments reported in our prior study 13 in addition to these results we also investigated the chemical stability of cs mwcnts fe beads in acidic and alkaline conditions see supplementary text s2 and fig s2 the composite beads exhibited good stability within the ph range of 1 to 9 where minimal weight loss was observed however when the solution ph value increased from 10 to 13 the weight loss also increased from 4 to 10 the loss in final weight is attributed to the acidic and alkaline corrosion of the adsorbent beads therefore we postulated that the potential risk of the leakage of nanomaterials from the beads within the optimal ph range ph 4 0 remains negligible 3 2 adsorption breakthrough modeling fig 2 a c show the experimental breakthrough profiles for cr vi adsorption using the various operating parameters delineated earlier these experimental profiles were fitted with the thomas model curves in blue y n model red and a b model green the fitted model constants are summarized in supplemental materials table s3 for all model fittings nonlinear regression analysis provided higher accuracy as determined by se ranging from 7 10 9 to 1 10 3 for the thomas model and the y n model 7 10 7 to 2 10 4 for the a b model and by sse 9 10 3 to 1 10 2 for the thomas model and the y n model 4 10 4 to 1 10 2 for the a b model the r2 value ranged from 0 981 to 0 999 for the thomas model and y n model and from 0 944 to 0 993 for the a b model note that the a b model only fits well for the early phase of breakthrough curve c t c 0 0 5 and that the thomas model and the y n model share identical mathematical form hence the identical regression accuracies despite taking the same mathematical form the parameters in the thomas model and the y n model offer different interpretations for the thomas model as the flow rate increases 1 to 4 ml min 1 the kth value also increases 0 021 to 0 054 l h 1 mg 1 owing to the diminished mass transport resistance with the increased in flow rates 27 moreover with the initial increase in the flow rate from 1 to 2 ml min 1 the qth value also increase from 1 64 to 2 07 mg g 1 then it remains steady on further flow rate increase additionally with increasing bed depth from 4 cm to 8 cm leads to a decrease in kth value from 0 054 l h 1 mg 1 to 0 021 l h 1 mg 1 whereas qth values increases from 0 78 mg g 1 to 1 64 mg g 1 when cr vi feed concentration increases from 30 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 the kth values remained in the range of 0 021 to 0 012 l h 1 mg 1 while the qth values remained relatively constant between 1 64 and 1 73 mg g 1 the behaviors of kth and qth with respect to flow rate bed depth and feed concentration remain in parallel with what we presented in fig 1a c this is not the case for the two key parameters in the y n model where the kyn value generally increases from 0 62 h 1 to 1 61 h 1 with increasing flow rates decreases from 1 62 to 0 62 h 1 with greater bed heights and increases from 0 62 to 1 29 h 1 with feed concentrations the τ value has the opposite trends as it is inversely proportional to kyn for the a b model the value of nab increases from 662 3 mg l 1 to 913 2 mg l 1 with an increased flow rate from 1 to 3 ml min 1 followed by a decrease to 845 1 mg l 1 upon further increasing flow rate to 4 ml min 1 in addition the kab value increases from 0 014 l mg 1 h 1 to 0 036 l mg 1 h 1 with the increased flow rate from 1 ml min 1 to 4 ml min 1 suggesting that the adsorption kinetics in the early part of the adsorption ct c0 0 5 is controlled by external mass transfer 28 30 when bed height is expanded from 4 cm to 8 cm the nab value increases from 353 1 mg l 1 to 662 3 mg l 1 while the kab value declines from 0 035 l mg 1 h 1 to 0 014 l mg 1 h 1 the increase in feed cr vi concentration from 30 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 also leads to an increase in nab value from 662 3 mg l 1 to 750 0 mg l 1 but the kab value decreases from 0 014 l mg 1 h 1 to 0 009 l mg 1 h 1 these results further support our earlier hypothesis that the film mass transfer control the adsorption kinetics of the system at the early phase of adsorption at a larger flow rate as such the thomas model parameters kth and qth have physical implications reflecting the mass transfer rate and adsorption capacity for example a larger value in kth at a lower cr vi feed concentration indicates that the adsorption of cr vi ions onto the cs mwcnts fe beads in packed bed columns was kinetically favorable at lower concentrations this model is best fit for the conditions with minimal external and internal diffusion resistance the high correlation values and the consistency of qth with those of experimental values indicates that cr vi adsorption mechanism by cs mwcnts fe beads follows the langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order adsorption kinetics 27 31 in comparison the y n model takes advantage of the symmetric nature of the equation and uses the first 50 column breakthrough to project the entire breakthrough pattern in this study the τ values determined by the model equation are consistently close to the experimental data therefore the y n model can reliably predict the saturation time of the cs mwcnts fe beads column by comparison the a b model assumes that that the rate of adsorption process is influenced by external mass transfer and that equilibrium does not occur instantaneously rendering the model applicable only to the initial part of a breakthrough curve ct c0 0 5 here the fact that the a b model agrees well with our experimental data for the initial breakthrough curves reflects that external mass transfer is prominent during the early portion of the adsorption process 3 3 mass transfer analysis using the mtf models 24 25 the linearized plots of ln q versus ln t resulted in good correlation r2 0 96 that enables the determination of the value 1 β slope and of b i e intercept the values of b decreased from 1 58 to 1 86 mg g 1 and 1 β from 1 12 to 1 05 g h mg 1 with increment in bed heights from 4 to 8 cm table s4 indicating that a shorter bed depth is advantageous for better mass transfer than longer depths to elucidate the controlling mass transfer factor we plotted the global mass transfer coefficient and its two components i e external and porous diffusion fig 3 a shows the rate of global mass transfer for the adsorption of cr vi onto cs mwcnts fe beads it is evident that during early breakthrough periods ct c0 0 2 there were marked differences in the global mass transfer rate favoring columns with shorter bed depths i e kla g values in the order of 4 cm 6 cm 8 cm furthermore the analysis of film transfer rate coefficient fig 3b and diffusion mass transfer coefficient fig 3c illustrate an opposite trend all kla f profiles exhibited an asymptotic pattern approaching zero when significant breakthroughs occurred clearly impelled by the greater concentration gradient between the bulk solution and the solid surface in the early phase of breakthroughs moreover we noted that significant film transfer occurred only in the limited breakthrough window ct c0 0 05 for the bed height of 8 cm whereas a similar rate could still be observed at ct c0 0 4 for the 4 cm packed column conversely fig 3c reveals that the rate of pore diffusion kla d that occurs once an ion penetrates the film and reaches the solid surface was greater for longer bed depths while the reversal of the trend was largely a result of the differences in film transfer rate another conceivable explanation for this result is that the interstitial hydrodynamics changed as the packed bed was extended these analyses point to the fact that packing depth represents a design variable that influences the mass transfer rates and the cr vi adsorption on cs mwcnts fe beads 3 4 bdst model and column scaleup fig 4 reveals the of service time as a function of adsorbent bed height using four saturation ratios ct c0 0 05 0 25 0 50 and 0 95 fitting with the experimental data indicates a highly linear relationship r2 0 98 this result enables us to use the bdst model equation to estimate the model parameters n0 and kb via determining the slope a n 0 c 0 v and intercept b 1 k b c 0 l n c 0 c t 1 of the fitted linear curves with the increase of ct c0 from 0 05 to 0 95 the value of n0 increased from 5 97 mg l 1 to 19 10 mg l 1 while the kb values decreased calculated results can be found in supplemental table s5 the parameter n0 is the adsorption equilibrium capacity and kb is the adsorption rate both dependent of the mass loading reflected by the presence of c0 and v a significant increase in n0 value versus ct c0 reflects the high adsorption capacity of the bed with increased mass loadings conversely a decreasing kb value is indicative of slower adsorption rate of cr vi ions as the process approaches complete breakthrough it is worth noting that despite its simplicity for the prediction of breakthrough time the bdst model may not be applicable for depicting the adsorption behavior over the entire breakthrough range because its symmetric nature of a logic function i e s shaped curve does not match well with most breakthrough profiles consequently the parameter values n0 and kb at the extended breakthrough range should only be taken with limited contexts such as observing its trend as opposed of using it as a design basis the high correlation between the experimental tb and calculated breakthrough time tc validates the applicability of bdst for this study therefore we further applied the model to predict column performance at other hypothetical operating conditions flow rates and feed concentrations for cr vi adsorption on to cs mwcnts fe beads in packed bed column this prediction step can be achieved by establishing new values of slope a and intercept b proportional to the ratio of hypothetical and validated conditions in both c0 and v 15 a a v v a c 0 c 0 16 b b c 0 c 0 l n c 0 1 l n c 0 1 the prediction utilizes n0 and kb values determined from the same flow rate and feed cr vi concentration to modify the bdst model by using a hypothetical concentration c0 5 mg l 1 and bed height 30 cm at a low flow rate 1 ml min 1 the predicted service time for ct c0 0 05 0 25 and 0 50 were about 118 210 and 282 h respectively the service time decreased to 3 3 5 9 and 7 85 h for the corresponding ct c0 values upon increasing feed cr vi concentration to 200 mg l 1 similarly with a hypothetically high flow rate 10 ml min 1 while maintaining identical feed concentration 5 mg l 1 and bed height 30 cm the predicted service time became 16 4 29 1 and 38 5 h for the corresponding ct c0 ratios the predicted breakthrough time for new bed depth z feed concentration c0 and flow rate q are listed in table s6 the scale up study was further extended by using the number of bed volume nbv method whose value can be calculated for particular experimental conditions such as flow rate bed height and inlet cr vi concentration nbv can be expressed as 30 17 n b v v o l u m e o f w a t e r t r e a t e d t i l l b r e a k t h r o u g h p o i n t v o l u m e o f t h e a d s o r b e n t b e d at any bed height and cross sectional area of the scaled up column the volume of treated effluent can be estimated by nbv times with the packed bed volume the new packed bed volume can be obtained by changing the bed height and cross sectional area of the column while maintaining one as a constant at a time the breakthrough time can be estimated by using the obtained volume of effluent processed divided by the flow rate for this study the estimated amount of cs mwcnts fe beads required for packing the column to achieve the desired breakthrough time can be obtained by multiplying the bulk density 0 4718 g cm 3 as measured by the cylinder method of adsorbent with the volume of scaled up bed the calculations were executed at a feed cr vi concentration 30 mg l 1 and two flow rates 50 ml min 1 and 100 ml min 1 fig 5 a shows the scaled up column performance at varying bed depths 10 cm 60 cm while keeping the column diameter 10 cm constant the scaling criteria was selected on the basis of linear flow velocity 0 32 cm min 1 as observed for the baseline conditions used in the lab scale study for example 4 4 kg of adsorbent would be needed to obtain a breakthrough time of 26 h for a flow rate of 50 ml min 1 and 13 h for 100 ml min 1 similarly 8 8 kg would be required to extend the breakthrough time to 53 h for a flow rate of 50 ml min 1 and 26 h for 100 ml min 1 conversely one can estimate the breakthrough time by varying the column diameter 10 cm 20 cm while maintaining a constant bed height 30 cm for example fig 5b indicates that 6 4 kg of adsorbent would be needed to pack a column with a diameter of 14 cm to obtain a breakthrough time of 52 h at a flow rate of 50 ml min 1 and 26 h at 100 ml min 1 when the column diameter is increased to 20 cm 17 8 kg would be required to achieve a breakthrough time of 105 h at 50 ml min 1 and 53 h at 100 ml min 1 3 5 applicability of cs mwcnts fe beads fixed bed column in treating a simulated effluent the simultaneous uptake of three metal ions cr vi cu ii and cd ii each at a feed concentration of 1 mg l 1 by the fixed bed columns packed with cs mwcnts fe beads was investigated in the presence of phosphate 30 mg l 1 as a background anion the ph of the simulated effluent was kept at 4 0 0 2 a condition identified as the optimal for cr vi adsorption in the single component system fig 6 a shows that cd ii broke through the column within two hours followed in the order by cu ii and cr vi notably the cr vi adsorption breakthrough profile exhibited a highly symmetric pattern that still fitted well with the thomas model r2 0 98 a b model r2 0 94 for ct c0 50 and y n model r2 0 98 in contrast the breakthrough curves of cu ii and cd ii showed a distinctly different pattern from that of cr vi not only did cd ii completely break through within a period of time its ct c0 value overshot to a value of 1 25 before stabilizing toward the equilibrium in contrast cu ii also broke through immediately after the commencement of the column run then stabilized at c c0 0 8 but never reached complete breakthrough the time it took to reach a ct c0 plateau was significantly longer for cr vi than they were for cu ii and cd ii the longer time to experience a breakthrough suggests that the column favored the cr vi adsorption over the two other metal ions the preference of cr vi in the ternary system at ph 4 clearly exhibited a competitive adsorption phenomenon we hypothesized that the electrosorption between hcro4 and protonated binding groups cooh2 oh2 nh3 on cs mwcnts fe beads dominated the adsorption over chelation n h 2 c u 2 c d 2 n h 2 c u 2 c d 2 or ion exchange c a 2 with c u 2 and c d 2 that were likely the main adsorption mechanisms for divalent cations between cu ii and cd ii the higher electronegativity 1 95 and smaller hydrated ionic radii 0 419 nm of cu ii might be responsible of its higher adsorption affinity than that of cd ii electronegativity 1 69 hydrated ionic radii 0 426 nm leading to a competitive advantage furthermore phosphate as a background anion matrix did not significantly interfere with the adsorption and breakthrough behaviors of cr vi and cd ii however the formation of stable precipitates such as cu3 po4 2 during the adsorption process is a plausible explanation to why cu ii never approached complete breakthrough by monitoring the effluent concentration altogether we present fig 6b to illustrate the following process i all three metal ions were adsorbed on cs mwcnts fe beads at the beginning when unoccupied active sites were abundant ii adsorption sites occupied by cd ii ions were replaced by both cr vi and cu ii ions as they continued to be adsorbed iii cr vi ions continued to be adsorbed while cu ii attained an equilibrium iv cr vi ions adsorption attained an equilibrium an early level cost estimate indicates that a cost window between us 10 and us 11 per kilogram of the cs mwcnts fe composite beads including basic cost components associated with materials and energy derived from the laboratory scale synthesis economy of scale would certainly drive down the production cost if a market demand exists even so the estimated cost is on par with the market price of commercial activated carbons table s7 commonly used for the treatment of wastewater concerning the operating costs while pilot scale testing data are not available to justify a reliable cost estimate we projected that 1 kg of cs mwcnts fe beads can process approximately 25 l of cr vi laden wastewater at 5 breakthrough ratio ct c0 during its first cycle of operation with a minimum of five consecutive cycles as demonstrated in our previous study 13 4 conclusions the present study characterizes the performance of cs mwcnts fe beads for aqueous phase cr vi removal in fixed bed columns a maximum volume of treated effluent of 210 ml and an cr vi uptake capacity of 1 52 mg g 1 were achieved at 1 ml min 1 in flow rate 8 cm in bed height 30 mg l 1 in feed cr vi concentration and a ph value of 4 both the thomas model and y n model are well suited to describe the dynamics of the adsorption breakthrough process of cr vi while the a b model was applicable only to describe the early phase of the dynamic behavior ct c0 0 5 of the column the parameters in the thomas model and a b model possess physical implications that reflect the effects of the various operating parameters flow rate initial concentration and bed height on the mass transfer rate and adsorption capacity by successfully characterizing the breakthrough behaviors with the models we further applied the bdst model for the prediction of system behavior under several hypothetical operating conditions and the subsequent scale up we demonstrated that the packed bed dimensions and flow rates determined the amount of adsorbent beads needed to achieve a prescribed breakthrough criterion we also demonstrated that when the synthetic solution contained multiple heavy metals i e cr vi cu ii and cd ii cr vi was selectively adsorbed in the cs mwcnts fe beads column and was less impacted by the presence of a background anion in phosphate declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

13454,currently antibiotics are widely used in clinics graziery and aquaculture antibiotics are prescribed to treat infections by bacteria and parasites therefore the industry generates significant quantities of antibiotics however a large amount of wastewater also gathers simultaneously which contains high level chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen pollutants that must be reduced to permissible standards before disposal for this purpose an industrial scale lincomycin production wastewater treatment plant wwtp that employs physicochemical and biological processes for neutralization and subsequent removal of concerning pollutants is built the wwtp consists of three types of bioreactors including four hydrolysis acidification bioreactors hat eight anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed egsb bioreactors and four aeration oxic bioreactors aot this study has been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the wwtp the study data revealed removal of 98 9 of 28922 1 kg d cod and 98 0 of 1557 8 kg d nh3 n after treatment of wastewater in wwtp thus matching the effluent criteria the hat egsb aot and physicochemical treatment accounted for 11 1 61 9 20 2 and 6 8 of cod removal respectively the aot bioreactors removed major amounts of nh3 n the analyses of microbiota showed that diverse microbial species were harboring in the bioreactors which could treat the toxic bacteria in the wastewater moreover dominant microbes in these three types of bioreactors were significantly different and formed three clusters according to the network analyses several keystone species found in the system participated in the cod and nh3 n removal process demonstrating the pollutant removal ability at the species level in summary a lincomycin production wwtp exhibited good performance and efficiency for the pollutant removal microbiota and keystone species involved in the pollutant removal process were identified which would help to discover the mechanism of pollutant removal and to improve the removing ability in future designs abbreviations cod chemical oxygen demand wwtp wastewater treatment plant hat hydrolysis acidification bioreactors egsb anaerobic expanded

treatment anaerobic and aerobic bioreactors microbial communities nh3 n removal cod removal 1 introduction antibiotics are either given as injections or applied as creams ointments or lotions on skin to treat epidermal infections antibiotics are extensively used in the clinics livestock and aquaculture industries 1 3 therefore their consumption is rising globally at an unprecedented rate 4 from 2000 to 2015 the global antibiotic consumption rate increased by 39 4 the livestock industry consumed 63 151 tons year of antibiotics in 2010 and the expected number might increase at the rate of 67 to reach 105 596 tons year by 2030 5 most of the antibiotics are produced by microbial fermentation and purification modification under chemical processes 6 the industrial antibiotics production usually generates a large amount of wastewater which has very high chemical oxygen demand cod and contains nitrogen pollutants in a significant quantity 7 the main pollutants in the wastewater from the antibiotic industry are microbial fermented metabolites the residual antibiotics surfactants and the organic solvents whereas some of them are unbiodegradable 8 9 the release of improperly treated antibiotic wastewater would induce a serious spread of antibiotic resistance and environmental disaster in this situation developing efficient processes for large scale wastewater treatment is of interest to the antibiotic production industry 8 so many physicochemical processes had been tested and applied in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment such as filtration sedimentation electrochemical oxidation 10 11 and hydrogen peroxide treatment 12 13 generally the physicochemical treatment strategies are expensive 12 13 therefore biological strategies were also previously used for the treatment of wastewater generated during pharmaceutical production which include using anaerobic bioreactors 14 aerobic bioreactors 15 and anaerobic aerobic bioreactors 16 17 the biological processes might be useful for efficient removal of most biodegradable pollutants but may not be sufficient to completely remove all the pollutants in the wastewater from the antibiotic industry 12 the antibiotic residues and other solvents in the wastewater are harmful to microorganisms 18 19 hence the total efficient industrial scale biological process for antibiotic wastewater treatment is difficult to be identified and established therefore in actual practice a combination of physicochemical and biological processes is recommended for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment 8 lincomycin is mainly produced by streptomyces lincolnensis and extracted with diverse chemical solvents 20 21 the lincomycin fermentation and extraction generated a large amount of wastewater 22 the pollutants in lincomycin production wastewater contained high level cod and nitrogen pollutants 22 23 moreover the residual lincomycin would induce the spread of antibiotic resistance genes which adds adverse effects on humans and environments 24 25 the wastewater needs to be properly treated before releasing the effluent into the environment 12 the industrial scale combination of physicochemical and biological processes in lincomycin pollutant removal has been rarely reported previously 26 27 though microorganisms in the bioreactors are the main drivers of pollutant removal 28 29 the microbiota functioned in the pollutant removal process are largely unknown the establishment of microbiota and identification of keystone species functioning in wastewater treatment bioreactors is essential to understand the antibiotic wastewater treatment process 30 with microbial communities linked to lincomycin degradation further isolation and bioaugmentation would provide clues to enhance pollutant removal ability which is helpful for lincomycin production wastewater pollutant removal 31 34 in this study the hydrolysis acidification anaerobic bioreactors aeration oxic bioreactors combined with physicochemical processes were used for industrial scale lincomycin fermentation wastewater treatment the pollutant removal efficiency and the running parameters of each step in the process were assessed the identification of residual microorganisms harboring in bioreactors and reservoirs were also undertaken further microbiota analyses were used to identify the keystone functional species in pollutant removal which might help in understanding the pollutant removal mechanisms and future synthetic microbiota for pollutant removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 the industrial scale plant and its parameters an industrial scale plant was built to produce lincomycin by xinyu pharmaceutical co ltd suzhou anhui province china the plant can generate about 1 4 million tons wastewater annually 146 207 5 m3 h accordingly the annual total amount of chemical oxygen demand cod and nh3 n pollutants in the wastewater were approximately 10 000 tons and 568 tons respectively the main pollutants are expected to be composed of residual chemicals formed during the lincomycin fermentation and extraction processes 21 an industrial scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp integrated with physicochemical and biological processes was built to treat lincomycin production wastewater in order to remove wastewater derived pollutants prior to discharge 26 the schematic representation of the wastewater plant is illustrated in fig 1 there were several parts of the industrial scale wwtp whereas the main components were the regulating reservoir rr four hydrolysis acidification tanks hat the primary settling tank pst eight anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed egsb bioreactors egsb1 to egsb8 four anoxic oxic tanks aot1 to aot4 bioreactors the secondary settling tank sst polymeric ferric sulfate pfs reactor and settling tank fenton reactor and the third settling tank tst fig 1 2 2 description of the mechanism of lincomycin production wwtp the generated wastewater during the lincomycin production process was mixed in the rr to start the treatment process the wastewater in rr was pumped to hat 146 207 5 m3 h while hat effluent was further pumped to eight egsb bioreactors fig 1 the wastewater in egsbs was proceeded to flow into aot the aot was composed of four compartments aot1 to aot4 compressed air was introduced from the bottom of the aot compartments to keep the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the anoxic tank and the oxic tank at less than 0 5 mg l and more than 2 5 mg l respectively the aot effluent passed through various physicochemical processes like coagulation sedimentation and oxidation finally the treated wastewater meeting all the required standards was disposed into the municipal sewage wastewater treatment network for further handling by concerned municipal departments besides three settling tanks were designed in the industrial scale lincomycin production wwtp and that were functioning for pollutant sedimentation fig 1 the ph of the bioreactors or tanks was autonomously controlled while the ph of the pfs reactor and fenton reactor was regulated with calculated sulfuric acid additions the egsbs contained one adiabatic layer heated in winter to maintain the running temperature of egsbs at 35 2 when temperatures go lower than these values for aot the running temperature was maintained at 33 2 in summer if the environmental temperature was high water heat exchangers were used for decreasing aot temperatures 2 3 the influent and effluent wastewater the pollutants in the influent are generally formed during the lincomycin production process 21 23 the main pollutants during fermentation might be the residual substrates such as glucose starches proteins and other metabolites 21 moreover different kinds of chemicals are used to extract lincomycin and part of the chemicals could be the polluting source of wastewater 20 therefore the main pollutants in the influent were organic matters and nitrogen containing pollutants the influent cod was assessed as 6000 8000 mg l suspended solids ss were 1000 2000 mg l and the nh3 n and total nitrogen concentration were 90 100 mg l and 500 600 mg l respectively the total phosphate concentration was 50 60 mg l the influent ph was 11 12 6 the total amount of pollutant for lincomycin are required to control by the law of china therefore tons d was used to indicate the total amount of pollutants the average mass of influent cod was 27 5 tons d 4 1 36 6 tons d at various time the average nh3 n of aot influent was 1 6 tons d 0 6 2 4 tons d the effluent was transferred to municipal wwtp for further treatment and disposal the criteria of different parameters were effluent cod after the lincomycin production wastewater treatment should be 100 mg l the effluent ss should be 60 mg l the effluent nh3 n and total nitrogen concentration should be 25 mg l and 50 mg l respectively total phosphate concentration should be 1 mg l and the ph should be 6 9 no inoculation was added to the hat bioreactors the eight egsb reactors can be divided into two subgroups based on volume loading rate egsb subgroup 1 egsb1 to egsb4 and egsb subgroup 2 egsb5 to egsb8 the size of the egsb subgroup 1 bioreactors was 1800 m3 φ 9 55 m 26 0 m and that of the egsb subgroup 2 bioreactors was 1400 m3 φ 9 55 m 21 0 m these eight egsb bioreactors didn t work simultaneously as some egsb bioreactors are reserved to halt or any bioreactor was malfunctioning or when the influent wastewater was low in volume the bioreactors of egsb subgroup 1 started running earlier than the other four bioreactors the initial inoculations of the egsb subgroup 1 bioreactors were anaerobic granular sludge collected from starch wwtp the average particle diameter of the sludge was 1 mm the water content was 95 and volatile suspended solids vss total suspended solids tss was 80 for the egsb subgroup 2 bioreactors egsb5 egsb8 and the initial inoculations were flocculent sludge derived from egsb subgroup 1 bioreactors the ratio of volatile suspended solids vss total suspended solids tss was 80 whereas the water content was 97 the initial inoculation sludge volume was determined to match the sludge mass concentration and the concentration of the inoculation was 10 15 kg ss m3 the initial inoculation of aot was the sludge collected from municipal wwtp the wwtp has been stably operational for more than two years the running temperature of egsb bioreactors and aot bioreactors were 35 2 and 33 2 respectively the operational parameters including the cod and ph of rr the cod ph volatile fatty acids vfa concentration and nh3 n concentration of the egsb and aot bioreactors were monitored every day the methods to measure the parameters and the calculation of the performance parameters such as cod and nh3 n removal efficiency were following the methods described before 26 the annual running parameters were used for analyses in this study 2 4 microbiota analyses of the egsb and aot bioreactors four samples of hat eight samples of egsb bioreactors and four samples of aot were collected from the wwtp on october 15 2019 the total dna of these 16 samples was extracted with the dneasy powersoil pro kit qiagen germany and the dna amount was determined the v3 v4 regions of 16s rrna genes were amplified from the dna of these 16 samples and used for high throughput sequencing details of 16s rrna gene fragment sequencing were described previously 26 the raw sequencing results were processed with an integrated pipeline of dix seq and all the amplicon results were obtained in one step 35 the details of parameter selection and analysis steps were described in previous publication 35 the zero radius operational taxonomic units zotus were represented with 97 identity 35 the microbial communities in the wwtp were revealed with microbial distribution based on analyses of different phylogenetic levels 36 besides the microbiota relationship between these 16 samples was analyzed with beta diversity 31 35 the raw reads were submitted to the sra database with the accession numbers of srr12012424 srr12012439 microbial co occurrence was applied to reveal the network between different species and identify keystone taxa in the microbiota 33 the otus with a relative abundance of more than 0 5 in each microbiota were selected for co occurrence the co occurring network construction selection standards were spearman s correlation ρ 0 6 and p values 0 05 both positive and negative correlations were selected for network construction 34 37 moreover the numbers of edges degree betweenness diameter and other network properties were generated with the igraph package in r software the network visualization was generated in the r environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of cod removal ability of the industrial scale lincomycin production wwtp the industrial scale wwtp was installed and integrated physicochemical and biological steps were performed to treat lincomycin production wastewater fig 1 the plant performance was evaluated based on the operation data collected in 2019 the average of the influent volume was 3930 1 344 0 m3 d the average value of influent quantity was 28922 1 3049 9 kg d whereas effluent cod was 325 2 63 2 kg d fig 2 a the total cod removal efficiency of the wwtp was 98 9 0 2 fig 2a the total cod were removed during several stages in the wwtp resulting in a gradual decrease in the cod of wastewater the influent cod was adjusted to 27538 1 3046 5 kg d in rr the cod was partially removed in hat reducing to 25746 1 2878 9 kg d in the effluent the eight egsb bioreactors further removed cod to 8037 8 834 3 kg d the following four aot further decreased cod to 2266 2 352 3 kg d following through a chain of physicochemical treatments the final effluent cod was just 82 6 16 1 mg l which satisfied the environmental protection criteria of 100 mg l fig 2b the percentage calculations revealed 11 1 61 9 20 2 and 6 8 of cod removal respectively by the rr and hat the egsb bioreactors the aot and other processes the egsb bioreactors transform organic nitrogen pollutants into ammonia and the nh3 n pollutants were mainly removed in aot which are similar to previous reports figs 3d and s1c 7 38 39 the nh3 n of aot influent was 1557 8 290 9 kg d whereas that of the aot effluent was 30 4 13 1 kg d fig 3c the nh3 n removal efficiency was 98 0 1 0 revealing a high value of working performance fig 3c the effluent nh3 n and total nitrogen concentrations of aot bioreactors were 7 8 3 4 mg l and 41 6 9 4 mg l respectively both the parameters matched the effluent discharge requirement the ammonia in aerobic bioreactors is mainly transformed to nitrogen via nitrification and denitrification 40 the ammonia in the aot bioreactors might be transformed to nitrogen and the aot effluent only contains low level of nh3 n and total nitrogen concentrations fig 3c besides the ss and total phosphate concentrations were limited in the wastewater and the monitoring results showed that they met the requirement for emission these performance parameters suggested that the effluent was complied with the emission criteria 3 2 the pollutant removal performance of the three biochemical treatment units the major cod pollutant removal steps comprised of eight egsb bioreactors and four aot bioreactors fig 2b the average influent cod and effluent cod of the eight egsb bioreactors were determined as 25746 9 2878 9 kg d and 8037 8 834 3 kg d respectively fig 3a the average cod removal efficiency of the eight egsb bioreactors was computed to be 68 8 3 0 fig 3a these eight egsb bioreactors can be divided into 2 classes based on the volume loading rate the volume capacities of four egsbs egsb1 to egsb4 were 1800 m3 while their volume loading rates vlrs were 3 0 3 3 kg cod m3 d fig s1a the volume capacities of egsb5 to egsb8 were 1400 m3 and their vlrs were measured as 1 2 1 5 kg cod m3 d fig s1b the average cod removal efficiency of egsb1 to egsb8 was observed from 67 5 69 7 figs 3a and s1 the recorded data revealed that average influent cod and effluent cod values of the four aot bioreactors were 8037 8 834 3 kg d and 2266 2 352 3 kg d respectively fig 3b the average cod removal efficiency of the four aot bioreactors was 73 4 1 7 fig 3b the average influent nh3 n and effluent nh3 n of the four aot bioreactors were 1577 8 291 4 kg d and 30 4 13 1 kg d respectively fig 3c the average nh3 n removal efficiency of the four aot bioreactors was 98 0 0 01 fig 3c the average cod vlr of the four aot bioreactors was 0 68 0 2 kg cod m3 d and the average nh3 n volume loading rate of the four aot bioreactors was 0 08 0 02 kg nh3 n m3 d figs 3d and s1c all these results suggested that nh3 n pollutants were mainly removed degraded by microbial communities in aot which was in accordance with the previous finding that anoxic oxic bioreactors can remove nitrogen pollutants efficiently 39 41 the ph of each step in the wastewater was monitored fig 4 a the ph of rr and hat were 11 3 0 5 and 6 8 0 2 respectively the average ph of the eight egsb bioreactors were 7 4 0 2 the average ph of the four aot bioreactors was 7 7 0 1 the final effluent ph was 7 7 0 1 which met the range of effluent ph criteria the ph in each step was stable during the wastewater treatment process fig 4a the anaerobic fermentation would generate vfa and vfa accumulation might lead to microbiota collapse and failure of wastewater treatment 31 42 therefore besides monitoring ph vfa concentration of the egsb bioreactors was measured during operation the mean vfa concentration of egsb effluent was 2 5 0 5 mmol l fig 4a the low vfa concentration was helpful to maintain egsb ph at 7 7 the stable ph and low level vfa indicated that the egsb and other steps in the wwtp remained in a good state 43 44 3 3 microbial diversity of the hat egsb and aot in wwtp microbiota of the four hat bioreactors eight egsb bioreactors and four aot bioreactors were also investigated 31 32 an average of 906 7 189 2 otus were identified the average otu numbers were 543 fig s3 most otus showed less than 97 identity with the known isolates indicating that most otus were uncultured or unknown microbial species the dominant otus abundance 0 5 in each sample were different table 2 and supplementary table 4 and most dominant otus were identified as firmicutes euryarchaea proteobacteria and bacteroidetes supplementary table 4 the richness of these three microbial types in the bioreactors was different and the total otu number of these three groups was 2404 fig s3 the richness of hat was lower than the diversities of egsb and aot the mean richness of hats was 640 99 while egsbs have an average of 1062 47 and aots have an average of 961 8 44 6 the alpha diversity of these samples was calculated which revealed that the microbial distribution in hats egsbs and aots were different table 1 the dominance equitability and shannon 2 parameters of hat and egsb groups were higher than those of the aot group table 1 for the hat group the average chao1 was 743 8 148 5 table 1 the parameters of hat1 and hat2 were slightly different from those parameters of hat3 and hat4 supplementary table 1 for the egsb group all the eight egsb microbiota were similar for the aot group the shannon 2 index was only 5 9 0 5 which was lower than that of the other two groups showing that the diversity of aot was lower than the other two groups table 1 the alpha parameters of the aot group were different supplementary table 1 indicating that these four aot microbiota were different both the pcoa and nmds analysis manifested that samples in each type of reactors were clustered together fig 5 e and f especially the pcoa indicated the difference between hat3 and the other three samples from hats fig 5e in detail the bacteroidetes composition of hat3 was only 12 9 while its compositions in another three hats were 33 3 5 3 supplementary table 2 the upgma result further suggested that samples from these three types of reactors were distinct fig s4 moreover there were differences between the two types of reactors figs 5e f and s4 for egsbs although they can be divided into two subtypes according to vlr the microbiota composition displayed different patterns among them egsb1 egsb2 and egsb4 were clustered together while another five egsb microbiota were clustered showing diverse drivers for microbial composition as regards aots aot1 was clustered with aot4 while aot2 was clustered with aot3 3 4 microbial compositions of the bioreactors the microbial compositions of all the 16 microbiotas were different figs 5 and s2 in the three groups some microbes cannot be assigned at phylum level the unknown above phylum otus accounted for 9 6 1 9 in the three types of reactors fig 5b and supplementary table 2 however the dominant phyla of these three groups were different fig 5a for hats the otus were mainly assigned to firmicutes 44 5 6 0 and bacteroidetes 28 2 11 1 fig 5a which were different from the microbiota of one pilot scale hydrolysis aerobic municipal wastewater treatment 45 for egsbs the otus were mainly assigned to firmicutes 17 9 3 9 euryarchaea 17 0 4 2 proteobacteria 16 1 2 6 and synergistetes 14 7 4 9 fig 5a the dominance of euryarchaea revealed that this microbiota exhibited good performance 31 for aots the otus were mainly assigned to proteobacteria 63 9 5 0 and bacteroidetes 9 1 3 3 fig 5a which were different from those in aerobic bioreactors for petrochemical wastewater treatment 26 in the 16 samples most microbes cannot be assigned at the genus level fig 5c and supplementary table 3 for all the 214 genera identified in the 16 samples 88 of them were common in all these three types of reactors figs 5d and s2b the common genera accounted for 52 8 4 3 of hats 51 2 3 6 of egsbs and 80 8 0 7 of aots supplementary table 3 the most dominant genera of hat group were bacteroides 7 5 5 3 enterococcus 6 7 3 8 and desulfovibrio 6 0 3 9 fig 5c peptostreptococcus with lincomycin degradation potentials was identified in hats supplementary table 3 29 indicating that the lincomycin residues might be degraded during the wastewater treatment process the most dominant genera of egsbs were methanothrix 13 5 4 6 and thermovirga 11 4 5 9 fig 5c hinting methane production ability of egsb bioreactors was high 32 46 the most dominant genera of aots were thaura 4 7 0 9 ignavibacterium 2 5 0 6 and nitrosomonas 1 7 0 3 fig 5c and the nitrosomonas genus can efficiently oxidize ammonia to nitrite moreover nitrospira which can transform nitrite into nitrate composes 0 66 of the microbiota in aot bioreactors the high level availability of nitrogen pollutant removal microbes such as nitrosomnas and nitrospira indicating that aot bioreactors can remove nitrogen pollutant efficiently 47 48 in the future other nitrogen pollutant removal strategies such as partial nitritation and anammox process could be applied in this system in order to further increase nitrogen removal efficiency and lower running costs 40 49 in hats the most dominant species otu 13 was assigned to be desulfovibrio legallii which was considered as a pathogen 50 while other dominant otus in hats such as otu 31 otu 40 otu 42 otu 75 and otu 79 were predicted to be microorganisms which can utilize carbohydrate showing the microbiota of hat bioreactors can help to degrade some easily utilized cod 51 52 in egsbs several dominant otus otu 2 otu 5 otu 10 and otu 19 were predicted to be methanogens among them otu 2 otu 5 and otu 19 were acetogenic methanogens while otu 10 was a hydrogenotrophic methanogen which can only use hydrogen and co2 for methane production table 2 31 both acetogenic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens might be helpful to maintain high methane producing ability in the egsbs 31 considering the nh3 n pollutants in the egsbs the hydrogenotrophic methanogen might play an essential role in methane production 31 53 54 moreover otu 37 syntrophus buswelli could metabolize benzoate to produce acetate co2 and h2 showing that pollutant removal microbes were dominant 1 3 0 2 in the egsb microbiota 55 in aots the most dominant otus were uncharacterized otu 74 paracoccus pantotrophus was believed to be nitrate reducing cysteate oxidizing bacteria 56 the two otus otu 25 and otu 69 were predicted to be nitrogen pollutant removal species in aots 38 moreover otus including otu 16 otu 87 otu 97 otu 71 and otu 106 were proposed to degrade aromatic complex pollutants table 2 the microbial compositions of aots suggested that the main nitrogen removal processes were nitrification and denitrification and replacing the nitrogen pollutant removal process with anammox process might save more energies in the future 57 these results indicated that these 16 microbiotas had been adapted to treat lincomycin production wastewater the residual lincomycin concentration in the influent and effluent was not monitored during wastewater treatment and the interaction between the residual lincomycin and microbiotas can t be evaluated and discussed 3 5 functional differences through the reactors using tax4fun 67 the functional profiles were predicted based on the microbial compositions we found that the microbiota of each group was differentially clustered at the functional level fig s5 in the hat group similar to the upgma result hat3 microbiota were different from those of the other three hat microbiotas in the egsb group the function of microbiota in egsb1 egsb2 and egsb3 were different from that of the other five microbiotas in the aot group aot2 was slightly different from that of the other three aot microbiotas these data suggested microbiotas with different functions and running environments were distinct figs 5e and f figs s4 and s5 62 63 the inoculation of egsb subgroup2 were derived from egsb subgroup1 while the microbial difference between these eight bioreactors needs further investigation which might lead to the discovery of microbial dynamics during lincomycin production wastewater treatment 63 3 6 differential co occurring otus through the reactors the co occurrence network of the 98 nodes otus contained 1860 edges including 1500 positive correlation edges and 360 negative correlation edges fig 6 and supplementary table 5 the mean edge per node otus was 38 and the diameter of the node was 4 the average shortest path length was 1 9 and the edge connectivity was 8 the clustering coefficient was 0 8 and the centralized betweenness was 0 2 with the centralization degree of 0 2 fig 6 these parameters showed that the otus in the network were close related 33 37 part of the otus was closely connected which formed three main dense clusters fig 6 and supplementary table 5 the otus in each cluster were positively connected while the connection between each cluster was negative suggesting that the dominant otus in clusters were different fig 6 especially otus with high abundance in hats and aots were closely connected although these two clusters showed a strong negative correlation this might be due to the aerobic and oxic environments of hat and aot fig 6 in the co occurrence network otu 16 was the connecting node between the egsb cluster and the aot cluster and it had positive correlations with the otus in the aot cluster and negative correlations with the otus in the egsb cluster fig 6 and table 2 though egsbs were tandemly connected with hats the connection between these two groups was weak and the connection nodes of these two groups were only otu 42 and otu 60 fig 6 otu 60 had only one positive correlation edge with otu 42 and more than 10 connection edges with otus in the egsb cluster otu 60 might be able to use several amino acids and proteins 58 and it can survive in both hats and egsbs the co occurrence network approach can identify keystone species and give insight into the drivers of the microbiota 33 and most of the keystone species in the network can degrade cod or nitrogen pollutants supplementary table 5 these data further showed that the microbiotas in each type of reactors were different fig 6 which might be attributed to different environmental factors and pollutants in the bioreactors 59 60 further isolation of keystone taxa and bioaugmentation of the bioreactors with the keystone taxa would enhance lincomycin wastewater treatment ability in the future 61 62 in fact we had used the isolated functional microorganisms to treat lincomycin manufacturing biowaste 63 however these isolated strains were not identified in our bioreactors 63 in the future the microbiome and synthetic biology tools need to be used in the recovery of microbiota for industrial scale wastewater treatment 64 4 conclusions a long term running performance of a lincomycin production wwtp investigation revealed that the plant is capable of treating 1 4 million tons of wastewater per year the wwtp removed 98 9 of 28922 1 kg d cod and 98 0 of 1557 8 kg d nitrogen pollutants from the wastewater that was formed and synthesized during various processes of lincomycin manufacturing at industrial scale the final effluent disposed into municipal sources was in accordance with the environmental protection criteria thus the wwpt was proved highly efficient and effective to remove pollution contained in the wastewater the microbiota in the three types of bioreactors were dis similar and each harbored diverse pollutant removal microorganisms further network analyses identified the keystone species in the microbial communities which would help to improve the wwtp design and performance in the future declaration of competing

13454,currently antibiotics are widely used in clinics graziery and aquaculture antibiotics are prescribed to treat infections by bacteria and parasites therefore the industry generates significant quantities of antibiotics however a large amount of wastewater also gathers simultaneously which contains high level chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen pollutants that must be reduced to permissible standards before disposal for this purpose an industrial scale lincomycin production wastewater treatment plant wwtp that employs physicochemical and biological processes for neutralization and subsequent removal of concerning pollutants is built the wwtp consists of three types of bioreactors including four hydrolysis acidification bioreactors hat eight anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed egsb bioreactors and four aeration oxic bioreactors aot this study has been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the wwtp the study data revealed removal of 98 9 of 28922 1 kg d cod and 98 0 of 1557 8 kg d nh3 n after treatment of wastewater in wwtp thus matching the effluent criteria the hat egsb aot and physicochemical treatment accounted for 11 1 61 9 20 2 and 6 8 of cod removal respectively the aot bioreactors removed major amounts of nh3 n the analyses of microbiota showed that diverse microbial species were harboring in the bioreactors which could treat the toxic bacteria in the wastewater moreover dominant microbes in these three types of bioreactors were significantly different and formed three clusters according to the network analyses several keystone species found in the system participated in the cod and nh3 n removal process demonstrating the pollutant removal ability at the species level in summary a lincomycin production wwtp exhibited good performance and efficiency for the pollutant removal microbiota and keystone species involved in the pollutant removal process were identified which would help to discover the mechanism of pollutant removal and to improve the removing ability in future designs abbreviations cod chemical oxygen demand wwtp wastewater treatment plant hat hydrolysis acidification bioreactors egsb anaerobic expanded

treatment anaerobic and aerobic bioreactors microbial communities nh3 n removal cod removal 1 introduction antibiotics are either given as injections or applied as creams ointments or lotions on skin to treat epidermal infections antibiotics are extensively used in the clinics livestock and aquaculture industries 1 3 therefore their consumption is rising globally at an unprecedented rate 4 from 2000 to 2015 the global antibiotic consumption rate increased by 39 4 the livestock industry consumed 63 151 tons year of antibiotics in 2010 and the expected number might increase at the rate of 67 to reach 105 596 tons year by 2030 5 most of the antibiotics are produced by microbial fermentation and purification modification under chemical processes 6 the industrial antibiotics production usually generates a large amount of wastewater which has very high chemical oxygen demand cod and contains nitrogen pollutants in a significant quantity 7 the main pollutants in the wastewater from the antibiotic industry are microbial fermented metabolites the residual antibiotics surfactants and the organic solvents whereas some of them are unbiodegradable 8 9 the release of improperly treated antibiotic wastewater would induce a serious spread of antibiotic resistance and environmental disaster in this situation developing efficient processes for large scale wastewater treatment is of interest to the antibiotic production industry 8 so many physicochemical processes had been tested and applied in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment such as filtration sedimentation electrochemical oxidation 10 11 and hydrogen peroxide treatment 12 13 generally the physicochemical treatment strategies are expensive 12 13 therefore biological strategies were also previously used for the treatment of wastewater generated during pharmaceutical production which include using anaerobic bioreactors 14 aerobic bioreactors 15 and anaerobic aerobic bioreactors 16 17 the biological processes might be useful for efficient removal of most biodegradable pollutants but may not be sufficient to completely remove all the pollutants in the wastewater from the antibiotic industry 12 the antibiotic residues and other solvents in the wastewater are harmful to microorganisms 18 19 hence the total efficient industrial scale biological process for antibiotic wastewater treatment is difficult to be identified and established therefore in actual practice a combination of physicochemical and biological processes is recommended for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment 8 lincomycin is mainly produced by streptomyces lincolnensis and extracted with diverse chemical solvents 20 21 the lincomycin fermentation and extraction generated a large amount of wastewater 22 the pollutants in lincomycin production wastewater contained high level cod and nitrogen pollutants 22 23 moreover the residual lincomycin would induce the spread of antibiotic resistance genes which adds adverse effects on humans and environments 24 25 the wastewater needs to be properly treated before releasing the effluent into the environment 12 the industrial scale combination of physicochemical and biological processes in lincomycin pollutant removal has been rarely reported previously 26 27 though microorganisms in the bioreactors are the main drivers of pollutant removal 28 29 the microbiota functioned in the pollutant removal process are largely unknown the establishment of microbiota and identification of keystone species functioning in wastewater treatment bioreactors is essential to understand the antibiotic wastewater treatment process 30 with microbial communities linked to lincomycin degradation further isolation and bioaugmentation would provide clues to enhance pollutant removal ability which is helpful for lincomycin production wastewater pollutant removal 31 34 in this study the hydrolysis acidification anaerobic bioreactors aeration oxic bioreactors combined with physicochemical processes were used for industrial scale lincomycin fermentation wastewater treatment the pollutant removal efficiency and the running parameters of each step in the process were assessed the identification of residual microorganisms harboring in bioreactors and reservoirs were also undertaken further microbiota analyses were used to identify the keystone functional species in pollutant removal which might help in understanding the pollutant removal mechanisms and future synthetic microbiota for pollutant removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 the industrial scale plant and its parameters an industrial scale plant was built to produce lincomycin by xinyu pharmaceutical co ltd suzhou anhui province china the plant can generate about 1 4 million tons wastewater annually 146 207 5 m3 h accordingly the annual total amount of chemical oxygen demand cod and nh3 n pollutants in the wastewater were approximately 10 000 tons and 568 tons respectively the main pollutants are expected to be composed of residual chemicals formed during the lincomycin fermentation and extraction processes 21 an industrial scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp integrated with physicochemical and biological processes was built to treat lincomycin production wastewater in order to remove wastewater derived pollutants prior to discharge 26 the schematic representation of the wastewater plant is illustrated in fig 1 there were several parts of the industrial scale wwtp whereas the main components were the regulating reservoir rr four hydrolysis acidification tanks hat the primary settling tank pst eight anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed egsb bioreactors egsb1 to egsb8 four anoxic oxic tanks aot1 to aot4 bioreactors the secondary settling tank sst polymeric ferric sulfate pfs reactor and settling tank fenton reactor and the third settling tank tst fig 1 2 2 description of the mechanism of lincomycin production wwtp the generated wastewater during the lincomycin production process was mixed in the rr to start the treatment process the wastewater in rr was pumped to hat 146 207 5 m3 h while hat effluent was further pumped to eight egsb bioreactors fig 1 the wastewater in egsbs was proceeded to flow into aot the aot was composed of four compartments aot1 to aot4 compressed air was introduced from the bottom of the aot compartments to keep the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the anoxic tank and the oxic tank at less than 0 5 mg l and more than 2 5 mg l respectively the aot effluent passed through various physicochemical processes like coagulation sedimentation and oxidation finally the treated wastewater meeting all the required standards was disposed into the municipal sewage wastewater treatment network for further handling by concerned municipal departments besides three settling tanks were designed in the industrial scale lincomycin production wwtp and that were functioning for pollutant sedimentation fig 1 the ph of the bioreactors or tanks was autonomously controlled while the ph of the pfs reactor and fenton reactor was regulated with calculated sulfuric acid additions the egsbs contained one adiabatic layer heated in winter to maintain the running temperature of egsbs at 35 2 when temperatures go lower than these values for aot the running temperature was maintained at 33 2 in summer if the environmental temperature was high water heat exchangers were used for decreasing aot temperatures 2 3 the influent and effluent wastewater the pollutants in the influent are generally formed during the lincomycin production process 21 23 the main pollutants during fermentation might be the residual substrates such as glucose starches proteins and other metabolites 21 moreover different kinds of chemicals are used to extract lincomycin and part of the chemicals could be the polluting source of wastewater 20 therefore the main pollutants in the influent were organic matters and nitrogen containing pollutants the influent cod was assessed as 6000 8000 mg l suspended solids ss were 1000 2000 mg l and the nh3 n and total nitrogen concentration were 90 100 mg l and 500 600 mg l respectively the total phosphate concentration was 50 60 mg l the influent ph was 11 12 6 the total amount of pollutant for lincomycin are required to control by the law of china therefore tons d was used to indicate the total amount of pollutants the average mass of influent cod was 27 5 tons d 4 1 36 6 tons d at various time the average nh3 n of aot influent was 1 6 tons d 0 6 2 4 tons d the effluent was transferred to municipal wwtp for further treatment and disposal the criteria of different parameters were effluent cod after the lincomycin production wastewater treatment should be 100 mg l the effluent ss should be 60 mg l the effluent nh3 n and total nitrogen concentration should be 25 mg l and 50 mg l respectively total phosphate concentration should be 1 mg l and the ph should be 6 9 no inoculation was added to the hat bioreactors the eight egsb reactors can be divided into two subgroups based on volume loading rate egsb subgroup 1 egsb1 to egsb4 and egsb subgroup 2 egsb5 to egsb8 the size of the egsb subgroup 1 bioreactors was 1800 m3 φ 9 55 m 26 0 m and that of the egsb subgroup 2 bioreactors was 1400 m3 φ 9 55 m 21 0 m these eight egsb bioreactors didn t work simultaneously as some egsb bioreactors are reserved to halt or any bioreactor was malfunctioning or when the influent wastewater was low in volume the bioreactors of egsb subgroup 1 started running earlier than the other four bioreactors the initial inoculations of the egsb subgroup 1 bioreactors were anaerobic granular sludge collected from starch wwtp the average particle diameter of the sludge was 1 mm the water content was 95 and volatile suspended solids vss total suspended solids tss was 80 for the egsb subgroup 2 bioreactors egsb5 egsb8 and the initial inoculations were flocculent sludge derived from egsb subgroup 1 bioreactors the ratio of volatile suspended solids vss total suspended solids tss was 80 whereas the water content was 97 the initial inoculation sludge volume was determined to match the sludge mass concentration and the concentration of the inoculation was 10 15 kg ss m3 the initial inoculation of aot was the sludge collected from municipal wwtp the wwtp has been stably operational for more than two years the running temperature of egsb bioreactors and aot bioreactors were 35 2 and 33 2 respectively the operational parameters including the cod and ph of rr the cod ph volatile fatty acids vfa concentration and nh3 n concentration of the egsb and aot bioreactors were monitored every day the methods to measure the parameters and the calculation of the performance parameters such as cod and nh3 n removal efficiency were following the methods described before 26 the annual running parameters were used for analyses in this study 2 4 microbiota analyses of the egsb and aot bioreactors four samples of hat eight samples of egsb bioreactors and four samples of aot were collected from the wwtp on october 15 2019 the total dna of these 16 samples was extracted with the dneasy powersoil pro kit qiagen germany and the dna amount was determined the v3 v4 regions of 16s rrna genes were amplified from the dna of these 16 samples and used for high throughput sequencing details of 16s rrna gene fragment sequencing were described previously 26 the raw sequencing results were processed with an integrated pipeline of dix seq and all the amplicon results were obtained in one step 35 the details of parameter selection and analysis steps were described in previous publication 35 the zero radius operational taxonomic units zotus were represented with 97 identity 35 the microbial communities in the wwtp were revealed with microbial distribution based on analyses of different phylogenetic levels 36 besides the microbiota relationship between these 16 samples was analyzed with beta diversity 31 35 the raw reads were submitted to the sra database with the accession numbers of srr12012424 srr12012439 microbial co occurrence was applied to reveal the network between different species and identify keystone taxa in the microbiota 33 the otus with a relative abundance of more than 0 5 in each microbiota were selected for co occurrence the co occurring network construction selection standards were spearman s correlation ρ 0 6 and p values 0 05 both positive and negative correlations were selected for network construction 34 37 moreover the numbers of edges degree betweenness diameter and other network properties were generated with the igraph package in r software the network visualization was generated in the r environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of cod removal ability of the industrial scale lincomycin production wwtp the industrial scale wwtp was installed and integrated physicochemical and biological steps were performed to treat lincomycin production wastewater fig 1 the plant performance was evaluated based on the operation data collected in 2019 the average of the influent volume was 3930 1 344 0 m3 d the average value of influent quantity was 28922 1 3049 9 kg d whereas effluent cod was 325 2 63 2 kg d fig 2 a the total cod removal efficiency of the wwtp was 98 9 0 2 fig 2a the total cod were removed during several stages in the wwtp resulting in a gradual decrease in the cod of wastewater the influent cod was adjusted to 27538 1 3046 5 kg d in rr the cod was partially removed in hat reducing to 25746 1 2878 9 kg d in the effluent the eight egsb bioreactors further removed cod to 8037 8 834 3 kg d the following four aot further decreased cod to 2266 2 352 3 kg d following through a chain of physicochemical treatments the final effluent cod was just 82 6 16 1 mg l which satisfied the environmental protection criteria of 100 mg l fig 2b the percentage calculations revealed 11 1 61 9 20 2 and 6 8 of cod removal respectively by the rr and hat the egsb bioreactors the aot and other processes the egsb bioreactors transform organic nitrogen pollutants into ammonia and the nh3 n pollutants were mainly removed in aot which are similar to previous reports figs 3d and s1c 7 38 39 the nh3 n of aot influent was 1557 8 290 9 kg d whereas that of the aot effluent was 30 4 13 1 kg d fig 3c the nh3 n removal efficiency was 98 0 1 0 revealing a high value of working performance fig 3c the effluent nh3 n and total nitrogen concentrations of aot bioreactors were 7 8 3 4 mg l and 41 6 9 4 mg l respectively both the parameters matched the effluent discharge requirement the ammonia in aerobic bioreactors is mainly transformed to nitrogen via nitrification and denitrification 40 the ammonia in the aot bioreactors might be transformed to nitrogen and the aot effluent only contains low level of nh3 n and total nitrogen concentrations fig 3c besides the ss and total phosphate concentrations were limited in the wastewater and the monitoring results showed that they met the requirement for emission these performance parameters suggested that the effluent was complied with the emission criteria 3 2 the pollutant removal performance of the three biochemical treatment units the major cod pollutant removal steps comprised of eight egsb bioreactors and four aot bioreactors fig 2b the average influent cod and effluent cod of the eight egsb bioreactors were determined as 25746 9 2878 9 kg d and 8037 8 834 3 kg d respectively fig 3a the average cod removal efficiency of the eight egsb bioreactors was computed to be 68 8 3 0 fig 3a these eight egsb bioreactors can be divided into 2 classes based on the volume loading rate the volume capacities of four egsbs egsb1 to egsb4 were 1800 m3 while their volume loading rates vlrs were 3 0 3 3 kg cod m3 d fig s1a the volume capacities of egsb5 to egsb8 were 1400 m3 and their vlrs were measured as 1 2 1 5 kg cod m3 d fig s1b the average cod removal efficiency of egsb1 to egsb8 was observed from 67 5 69 7 figs 3a and s1 the recorded data revealed that average influent cod and effluent cod values of the four aot bioreactors were 8037 8 834 3 kg d and 2266 2 352 3 kg d respectively fig 3b the average cod removal efficiency of the four aot bioreactors was 73 4 1 7 fig 3b the average influent nh3 n and effluent nh3 n of the four aot bioreactors were 1577 8 291 4 kg d and 30 4 13 1 kg d respectively fig 3c the average nh3 n removal efficiency of the four aot bioreactors was 98 0 0 01 fig 3c the average cod vlr of the four aot bioreactors was 0 68 0 2 kg cod m3 d and the average nh3 n volume loading rate of the four aot bioreactors was 0 08 0 02 kg nh3 n m3 d figs 3d and s1c all these results suggested that nh3 n pollutants were mainly removed degraded by microbial communities in aot which was in accordance with the previous finding that anoxic oxic bioreactors can remove nitrogen pollutants efficiently 39 41 the ph of each step in the wastewater was monitored fig 4 a the ph of rr and hat were 11 3 0 5 and 6 8 0 2 respectively the average ph of the eight egsb bioreactors were 7 4 0 2 the average ph of the four aot bioreactors was 7 7 0 1 the final effluent ph was 7 7 0 1 which met the range of effluent ph criteria the ph in each step was stable during the wastewater treatment process fig 4a the anaerobic fermentation would generate vfa and vfa accumulation might lead to microbiota collapse and failure of wastewater treatment 31 42 therefore besides monitoring ph vfa concentration of the egsb bioreactors was measured during operation the mean vfa concentration of egsb effluent was 2 5 0 5 mmol l fig 4a the low vfa concentration was helpful to maintain egsb ph at 7 7 the stable ph and low level vfa indicated that the egsb and other steps in the wwtp remained in a good state 43 44 3 3 microbial diversity of the hat egsb and aot in wwtp microbiota of the four hat bioreactors eight egsb bioreactors and four aot bioreactors were also investigated 31 32 an average of 906 7 189 2 otus were identified the average otu numbers were 543 fig s3 most otus showed less than 97 identity with the known isolates indicating that most otus were uncultured or unknown microbial species the dominant otus abundance 0 5 in each sample were different table 2 and supplementary table 4 and most dominant otus were identified as firmicutes euryarchaea proteobacteria and bacteroidetes supplementary table 4 the richness of these three microbial types in the bioreactors was different and the total otu number of these three groups was 2404 fig s3 the richness of hat was lower than the diversities of egsb and aot the mean richness of hats was 640 99 while egsbs have an average of 1062 47 and aots have an average of 961 8 44 6 the alpha diversity of these samples was calculated which revealed that the microbial distribution in hats egsbs and aots were different table 1 the dominance equitability and shannon 2 parameters of hat and egsb groups were higher than those of the aot group table 1 for the hat group the average chao1 was 743 8 148 5 table 1 the parameters of hat1 and hat2 were slightly different from those parameters of hat3 and hat4 supplementary table 1 for the egsb group all the eight egsb microbiota were similar for the aot group the shannon 2 index was only 5 9 0 5 which was lower than that of the other two groups showing that the diversity of aot was lower than the other two groups table 1 the alpha parameters of the aot group were different supplementary table 1 indicating that these four aot microbiota were different both the pcoa and nmds analysis manifested that samples in each type of reactors were clustered together fig 5 e and f especially the pcoa indicated the difference between hat3 and the other three samples from hats fig 5e in detail the bacteroidetes composition of hat3 was only 12 9 while its compositions in another three hats were 33 3 5 3 supplementary table 2 the upgma result further suggested that samples from these three types of reactors were distinct fig s4 moreover there were differences between the two types of reactors figs 5e f and s4 for egsbs although they can be divided into two subtypes according to vlr the microbiota composition displayed different patterns among them egsb1 egsb2 and egsb4 were clustered together while another five egsb microbiota were clustered showing diverse drivers for microbial composition as regards aots aot1 was clustered with aot4 while aot2 was clustered with aot3 3 4 microbial compositions of the bioreactors the microbial compositions of all the 16 microbiotas were different figs 5 and s2 in the three groups some microbes cannot be assigned at phylum level the unknown above phylum otus accounted for 9 6 1 9 in the three types of reactors fig 5b and supplementary table 2 however the dominant phyla of these three groups were different fig 5a for hats the otus were mainly assigned to firmicutes 44 5 6 0 and bacteroidetes 28 2 11 1 fig 5a which were different from the microbiota of one pilot scale hydrolysis aerobic municipal wastewater treatment 45 for egsbs the otus were mainly assigned to firmicutes 17 9 3 9 euryarchaea 17 0 4 2 proteobacteria 16 1 2 6 and synergistetes 14 7 4 9 fig 5a the dominance of euryarchaea revealed that this microbiota exhibited good performance 31 for aots the otus were mainly assigned to proteobacteria 63 9 5 0 and bacteroidetes 9 1 3 3 fig 5a which were different from those in aerobic bioreactors for petrochemical wastewater treatment 26 in the 16 samples most microbes cannot be assigned at the genus level fig 5c and supplementary table 3 for all the 214 genera identified in the 16 samples 88 of them were common in all these three types of reactors figs 5d and s2b the common genera accounted for 52 8 4 3 of hats 51 2 3 6 of egsbs and 80 8 0 7 of aots supplementary table 3 the most dominant genera of hat group were bacteroides 7 5 5 3 enterococcus 6 7 3 8 and desulfovibrio 6 0 3 9 fig 5c peptostreptococcus with lincomycin degradation potentials was identified in hats supplementary table 3 29 indicating that the lincomycin residues might be degraded during the wastewater treatment process the most dominant genera of egsbs were methanothrix 13 5 4 6 and thermovirga 11 4 5 9 fig 5c hinting methane production ability of egsb bioreactors was high 32 46 the most dominant genera of aots were thaura 4 7 0 9 ignavibacterium 2 5 0 6 and nitrosomonas 1 7 0 3 fig 5c and the nitrosomonas genus can efficiently oxidize ammonia to nitrite moreover nitrospira which can transform nitrite into nitrate composes 0 66 of the microbiota in aot bioreactors the high level availability of nitrogen pollutant removal microbes such as nitrosomnas and nitrospira indicating that aot bioreactors can remove nitrogen pollutant efficiently 47 48 in the future other nitrogen pollutant removal strategies such as partial nitritation and anammox process could be applied in this system in order to further increase nitrogen removal efficiency and lower running costs 40 49 in hats the most dominant species otu 13 was assigned to be desulfovibrio legallii which was considered as a pathogen 50 while other dominant otus in hats such as otu 31 otu 40 otu 42 otu 75 and otu 79 were predicted to be microorganisms which can utilize carbohydrate showing the microbiota of hat bioreactors can help to degrade some easily utilized cod 51 52 in egsbs several dominant otus otu 2 otu 5 otu 10 and otu 19 were predicted to be methanogens among them otu 2 otu 5 and otu 19 were acetogenic methanogens while otu 10 was a hydrogenotrophic methanogen which can only use hydrogen and co2 for methane production table 2 31 both acetogenic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens might be helpful to maintain high methane producing ability in the egsbs 31 considering the nh3 n pollutants in the egsbs the hydrogenotrophic methanogen might play an essential role in methane production 31 53 54 moreover otu 37 syntrophus buswelli could metabolize benzoate to produce acetate co2 and h2 showing that pollutant removal microbes were dominant 1 3 0 2 in the egsb microbiota 55 in aots the most dominant otus were uncharacterized otu 74 paracoccus pantotrophus was believed to be nitrate reducing cysteate oxidizing bacteria 56 the two otus otu 25 and otu 69 were predicted to be nitrogen pollutant removal species in aots 38 moreover otus including otu 16 otu 87 otu 97 otu 71 and otu 106 were proposed to degrade aromatic complex pollutants table 2 the microbial compositions of aots suggested that the main nitrogen removal processes were nitrification and denitrification and replacing the nitrogen pollutant removal process with anammox process might save more energies in the future 57 these results indicated that these 16 microbiotas had been adapted to treat lincomycin production wastewater the residual lincomycin concentration in the influent and effluent was not monitored during wastewater treatment and the interaction between the residual lincomycin and microbiotas can t be evaluated and discussed 3 5 functional differences through the reactors using tax4fun 67 the functional profiles were predicted based on the microbial compositions we found that the microbiota of each group was differentially clustered at the functional level fig s5 in the hat group similar to the upgma result hat3 microbiota were different from those of the other three hat microbiotas in the egsb group the function of microbiota in egsb1 egsb2 and egsb3 were different from that of the other five microbiotas in the aot group aot2 was slightly different from that of the other three aot microbiotas these data suggested microbiotas with different functions and running environments were distinct figs 5e and f figs s4 and s5 62 63 the inoculation of egsb subgroup2 were derived from egsb subgroup1 while the microbial difference between these eight bioreactors needs further investigation which might lead to the discovery of microbial dynamics during lincomycin production wastewater treatment 63 3 6 differential co occurring otus through the reactors the co occurrence network of the 98 nodes otus contained 1860 edges including 1500 positive correlation edges and 360 negative correlation edges fig 6 and supplementary table 5 the mean edge per node otus was 38 and the diameter of the node was 4 the average shortest path length was 1 9 and the edge connectivity was 8 the clustering coefficient was 0 8 and the centralized betweenness was 0 2 with the centralization degree of 0 2 fig 6 these parameters showed that the otus in the network were close related 33 37 part of the otus was closely connected which formed three main dense clusters fig 6 and supplementary table 5 the otus in each cluster were positively connected while the connection between each cluster was negative suggesting that the dominant otus in clusters were different fig 6 especially otus with high abundance in hats and aots were closely connected although these two clusters showed a strong negative correlation this might be due to the aerobic and oxic environments of hat and aot fig 6 in the co occurrence network otu 16 was the connecting node between the egsb cluster and the aot cluster and it had positive correlations with the otus in the aot cluster and negative correlations with the otus in the egsb cluster fig 6 and table 2 though egsbs were tandemly connected with hats the connection between these two groups was weak and the connection nodes of these two groups were only otu 42 and otu 60 fig 6 otu 60 had only one positive correlation edge with otu 42 and more than 10 connection edges with otus in the egsb cluster otu 60 might be able to use several amino acids and proteins 58 and it can survive in both hats and egsbs the co occurrence network approach can identify keystone species and give insight into the drivers of the microbiota 33 and most of the keystone species in the network can degrade cod or nitrogen pollutants supplementary table 5 these data further showed that the microbiotas in each type of reactors were different fig 6 which might be attributed to different environmental factors and pollutants in the bioreactors 59 60 further isolation of keystone taxa and bioaugmentation of the bioreactors with the keystone taxa would enhance lincomycin wastewater treatment ability in the future 61 62 in fact we had used the isolated functional microorganisms to treat lincomycin manufacturing biowaste 63 however these isolated strains were not identified in our bioreactors 63 in the future the microbiome and synthetic biology tools need to be used in the recovery of microbiota for industrial scale wastewater treatment 64 4 conclusions a long term running performance of a lincomycin production wwtp investigation revealed that the plant is capable of treating 1 4 million tons of wastewater per year the wwtp removed 98 9 of 28922 1 kg d cod and 98 0 of 1557 8 kg d nitrogen pollutants from the wastewater that was formed and synthesized during various processes of lincomycin manufacturing at industrial scale the final effluent disposed into municipal sources was in accordance with the environmental protection criteria thus the wwpt was proved highly efficient and effective to remove pollution contained in the wastewater the microbiota in the three types of bioreactors were dis similar and each harbored diverse pollutant removal microorganisms further network analyses identified the keystone species in the microbial communities which would help to improve the wwtp design and performance in the future declaration of competing
