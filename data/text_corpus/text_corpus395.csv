constitutes a critical resource however contamination of this water source can have a severe impact on the subsurface environment and overall water security hillel 2003 water contained within porous media plays a vital role in sustaining plant growth and fulfilling human water demands however when contaminated by harmful or carcinogenic soluble components such as nitrates pesticides petroleum products or heavy metals dracos 1987 addiscott et al 1991 miiler 1996 wood and anthony 1997 it can have devastating effects on the living conditions of our planet hillel 2003 thus in order to develop effective strategies for groundwater and soil remediation a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of contaminant fate and transport in aquifer systems is imperative bedient et al 1994 the advection dispersion equation ade is a commonly used tool in describing the fate and transport of contaminants in the environment this equation presumes that the dispersive mass flux is governed by fick s law which establishes a linear relationship between mass flux and concentration gradient however there are some complex physical and chemical processes that may be linked with the mass continuity equations as recent research has demonstrated carr 2020 2021 despite its widespread application the conventional ade which is based on fick s law can sometimes fall short in explaining observed concentration breakthroughs this inadequacy is frequently attributed to the lack of consideration for non fickian behavior non fickian behavior a topic that has been studied for several decades refers to phenomena that do not conform to the linear relationship described by fick s law classical diffusion related to brownian motion and following fick s law is characterized by a linear relationship between the mean squared displacement of a molecular particle and time benson et al 2000 2013 edery et al 2014 kelly and meerschaert 2017 in contrast anomalous transport displays a power law correlation between the average squared displacement and time resulting in a prolonged tailing of the concentration breakthrough curve this phenomenon is believed to arise from the influence of porous medium heterogeneity benson et al 2000 2013 edery et al 2014 kelly and meerschaert 2017 even in low reynolds number systems heterogeneous flow fields can significantly impact anomalous transport berkowitz et al 2006 2008 ongoing research continues to unravel the complexities of non fickian behavior in contaminant transport the phenomenon of anomalous behavior in contaminants has been widely explored through various well established theories kelly et al 2017 these theories include the continuous time random walk dentz and berkowitz 2003 dentz et al 2004 berkowitz et al 2006 boano et al 2007 oliveira et al 2021 two or multiple stage models brusseau et al 1991 gerke and van genuchten 1993 haggerty and gorelick 1995 haggerty et al 2000 huang et al 2010 malama et al 2013 huang and goltz 2015 chen et al 2019 and fractional ades benson et al 2000 2001 berkowitz et al 2002 schumer et al 2003 benson et al 2004 zhang et al 2007 2009 povstenko 2015 chen et al 2017 kelly and meerschaert 2017 the two stage models in particular are noteworthy in simulating solute transport in media that exhibit mobile immobile mim zones and rate limited sorption rls the mim model considers the transfer of solute mass between mobile and immobile zones governed by first order mass transfer kinetics similarly the rls model examines mass transfer between liquid and solid phases also governed by first order rate limited kinetics the mim model is based on the explicit physical mechanism of water transfer between mobile pores and dead end pores or between fractures and matrix blocks van genuchten and wagenet 1989 gao et al 2010 while the rls model allows for the simulation of chemical reactions such as absorption and adsorption huang et al 2010 the model for transport in an aquifer aquitard system brown et al 2012 huang and goltz 2015 rezaei et al 2016 li et al 2021 considers an aquitard located beneath or above a thin aquifer with contaminant transport occurring in the highly permeable aquifer layer and vertical diffusive mass transfer between the aquifer and aquitard these models all take into account the micro or macro scale heterogeneity of porous media intrinsic physical and chemical processes can play a major role in the fate and transport of contaminants exhibiting time dependent features such as concentration breakthrough retardation or tailing the concept of time lags between mass flux and concentration gradient for fick s law known as temporally relaxed theory is inspired by the dual phase lag model which allows for heat flux and thermal gradient to occur at different times in fourier s law tzou 1995 this concept is motivated by the thermal wave behavior observed in pulse laser experiments tzou et al 1994 a similar concept can be found in well hydraulics known as lagging theory which allows for water flow and hydraulic gradient to occur at distinct times in darcy s law lin and yeh 2017 lin et al 2019 for instance in a clay rich formation the well may start pumping at a constant rate but no water is abstracted from the clay even though the hydraulic gradient occurs in advance the temporally relaxed theory is used in this study to distinguish it from dual phase lag and lagging theories the objective of this research is to modify fick s law through the integration of the temporally relaxed theory resulting in the creation of a novel ade and a new model for non fickian transport the theoretical analysis in this work reveals how the relaxation times relate to the intrinsic physical mechanisms that are traditionally governed by multiple equations and contain multiple parameters the solution is derived using the laplace transform technique and a comparison of the present solution with the mim and rls models is carried out in addition a sensitivity analysis is performed to classify the importance of the transport parameters for the model finally the present solution is used to perform parameter estimation by analyzing column experiments performed by liang et al 2018 and li et al 2009 2 methodology 2 1 model setup the distribution of solute concentration c ml 3 can be described using the one dimensional ade given by 1 r c t x j where x is the distance from the source l t is the time t r is the retardation factor and j is the mass flux ml 2t 1 induced by the dispersive and advective terms 2 j t d c t x v c t in eq 2 d τ 0 d 0 α v is the dispersion coefficient l 2 t 1 and v q n is the apparent velocity lt 1 where τ 0 0 1 is the tortuosity d 0 is the aqueous molecular diffusion coefficient l 2 t 1 α is the dispersivity l q is the darcy flux lt 1 and n is the effective porosity typically the influence of d 0 on the aggregate dispersion can be disregarded as its value is substantially smaller than α v in most situations eq 2 states that the mass flux and concentration gradient happen at the same time implying that the speed at which the mass particles move is infinite this assumption may not be accurate when there is an inertial force or structural interaction similar to the dual phase lag tzou et al 1994 for fourier s law or lagging theory lin and yeh 2017 for darcy s law eq 2 for fick s law can be modified so that the mass flux and concentration gradient happen at different times 3 j t τ j d c t τ c x v c t τ c here τ j and τ c are flux lagging and storage lagging t parameters respectively the flux lagging parameter τ j reflects the relaxation time due to the inertial effect caused by the mass particle inertial collision while the storage lagging parameter τ c represents the relaxation time due to structural interactions such as sorption and secondary pore water interaction see fig 1 when τ j τ c this means that the mass flux occurs earlier than the concentration gradient and that the flux is the cause of the gradient if τ j τ c it implies that the mass flux is the result of the concentration gradient for the case of τ j τ c the time lags are negligible and eq 3 can be reduced to 2 assuming that τ j and τ c are quite small compared to the overall time t the taylor series expansion can be applied to eq 3 reading 4 i 0 τ j i i 1 t i 1 j t i 0 τ c i i 1 t i 1 d c t x v c t typically the first order approximation i e truncating at i 1 is capable of capturing the major time lag effect on the concentration response following the work of tzou 1995 eq 4 can be approximated by 5 1 τ j t j t 1 τ c t d c t x v c t substituting eq 5 into 1 the temporall relaxed ade is then obtained as 6 r 1 τ j t c t 1 τ c t α q n 2 c x 2 q n c x x 0 or simplified as 7 r 1 τ c t j t 1 τ c t l x c where l x is the spatial operator equal to α q n 2 x 2 q n x assuming the porous medium is not contaminated initially the associated initial conditions are given as 8 c t 0 c t 0 t 0 when a tracer is introduced into a soil column it may become diluted through mixing with water in the pre inlet reservoir that does not contain the tracer this can be mathematically described as wang et al 2020 shi et al 2022 9 v c t x 0 a q c 0 t c x 0 where v is the volume of the cylindrical pre inlet reservoir l 3 and a is the cross sectional area l 2 with the injecting source c 0 t ml 3 for two injection types 10 c 0 t m q a δ t for instantaneous pulse c i n for continuous injection where m is the mass of the solute injected into the medium m δ t is the dirac delta function of time t 1 and c i n is the constant injection concentration ml 3 a far field boundary condition is also imposed which can be expressed as 11 lim x c x 0 2 2 semi analytical solution applying the laplace transform to eqs 6 11 the transformed equations are obtained as 12 r 1 s τ j s c 1 s τ c l x c 13 v s c x 0 a q c 0 s c x 0 with 14 c 0 s m q a for instantaneous pulse c i n s for continuous injection 15 lim x c x 0 where the c represents the concentration function in the laplace domain and s is the laplace parameter by introducing the peclet number p e v x α x α eq 12 has a general solution expressed as 16 c c 1 exp 1 μ s 2 p e c 2 exp 1 μ s 2 p e with 17 μ s q 1 s τ c 4 n r s α 1 s τ j q 1 s τ c where c 1 and c 2 are undetermined coefficients to satisfy the boundary conditions the undetermined coefficients c 1 and c 2 are obtained respectively as a q c 0 s a q s v and 0 inserting these expressions for c 1 and c 2 into eq 16 the semi analytical solution can then be derived as 18 c a q c 0 s a q s v exp 1 μ s 2 p e eq 18 can be numerically evaluated using numerical laplace inversion schemes such as the stehfest 1970 algorithm and the trefethen et al 2006 algorithm the associated application to ade can be found in previous works of carr and turner 2016 carr 2020 recently horváth et al 2020 developed a numerical laplace inversion scheme called the concentrated matrix exponential cme method compared to the gaver stehfest method gaver 1966 stehfest 1970 euler method rooted in fourier series approximation dubner and abate 1968 and the talbot method trefethen et al 2006 the cme method has the best numerical stability avoids overshooting and undershooting issues and gains accurate results as the order used in the cme increases horváth et al 2020 provided the code written in mathematica matlab and python scripts and the readers can get these codes for free in the github repository at https github com ghorvath78 iltcme here we apply the cms s method horváth et al 2023 an extending version of cms method to inverse our laplace domain solution 2 3 sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of transport parameters on solute transport we conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of parameter uncertainty on the system output dellóca et al 2020 knabe et al 2021 we calculate the normalized sensitivity coefficients x k which kabala 2001 defines as 19 x k o ln p k p k o p k where x k represents the normalized sensitivity of the output o i e concentration c to changes in the k th input transport parameter p k we evaluate this at the observation point x 5 cm in the time interval t 0 s 1000 s using the first order forward or backward finite difference formula to approximate the derivative in eq 19 only provides a first order accurate estimate of the normalized sensitivity coefficients therefore we adopt the three point backward difference approach to improve the accuracy to second order this allows us to compute the normalized sensitivity coefficients using 20 x k p k 3 o p k 4 o p k δ p k o p k 2 δ p k 2 δ p k where δ p k is a small differential change in the k th parameter which we approximate by 1 0 3 p k as suggested by liou and yeh 1997 we use the absolute values to rank the importance of the coefficients a small magnitude of x k indicates that large changes in the parameter p k produce only small changes in the response or output variable o indicating low sensitivity this means that the parameter p k would be difficult to estimate from the o measurements it is also important to have linear independence among the sensitivity coefficients of the different parameters additionally a positive value of x k means that a small increase in p k will result in an increase in concentration values while a negative value of x k indicates that a small increase in p k will decrease concentration values 3 results 3 1 comparison with two existing models there are typically two classical two stage models used to describe transport behavior one is the mim model which is based on the assumption of physical non equilibrium in this model solute particles are transferred between the mobile zone e g fractures and the immobile zone matrix blocks the other model is the rls model which reflects two site sorption due to chemical non equilibrium in this model solutes attach to soil particles through absorption or adsorption a point to note is that although the mim model and rls model involve different non equilibrium transport mechanisms physical versus chemical they are mathematically equivalent to each other in this study we will compare the mim and rls models with the temporally relaxed model so we will discuss them in more detail below for convenience 3 1 1 mobile immobile model the ades derived based on the mim concept for the mobile zone and the immobile zone can be written respectively as van genuchten and wagenet 1989 gao et al 2010 21 β r m c m t 1 β r i m c i m t l x c m x 0 and 22 n i m r i m c i m t ω c m c i m where the subscripts m and i m represent the mobile zone and immobile zone respectively β n m n and 1 β n i m n meaning that n m n i m n and ω is the first order mass transfer rate coefficient t 1 between both continua substituting eq 22 into 21 the mim ade in terms of c m is 23 n m n r m n i m n r i m 1 n m r m n i m r i m ω n m r m n i m r i m t c m t 1 n i m r i m ω t l x c m 3 1 2 rate limited sorption model for the ade derived from the rls concept the governing equations for the liquid phase and the solid phase can be written respectively as follows brusseau et al 1991 huang et al 2010 24 c t ρ b n s t l x c x 0 and 25 s t ω k d c s where s is the mass amount in the solid phase ρ b is the bulk density of the porous medium ml 3 ω is the first order mass transfer coefficient of sorption t 1 and k d is the partition coefficient of adsorption m 3l again substituting eq 25 into 24 the rls ade in terms of c can be derived as 26 1 ρ b k d n 1 ω t c t 1 1 ω t l x c 3 1 3 physical meaning of τ j and τ c compared proposed ade eqs 6 to 23 and 26 we can find the relationships between the parameters in the temporally relaxed model and those in the mim model and rls model as listed in table 1 as table shown the retardation factor defined as s k d c is the same for linear sorption on the other hand the relaxation times τ j and τ c are the reciprocal of the transfer rate coefficient multiplied by different constants this means that an increase in ω or ω reduces the relaxation time values by increasing the mass exchange rate between the primary and secondary pores for the mim model or between the liquid and solid phases for the rls model the two stage process is sped up until the solute transport can be accurately described by a classical ade this shows that the three models share the same two stage process but they cannot be used interchangeably due to their different concepts of the solute transport mechanism the proposed method characterizes the two stage process using two empirically determined relaxation times without the need for knowledge of the matrix blocks or sorption properties and their physical interactions with the system according to the model the relaxation times τ j and τ c provide valuable information about particle collisions and attachment in porous media an increase in τ j is an indicator of a higher frequency of particle collisions leading to an increase in particle inertia on the other hand a higher value of τ c suggests a stronger sorption effect hindering particle attachment to the soil it is important to consider the factors that impact the relaxation times when analyzing solute particles in porous media for particle collisions the causes may include concentration of the solute porosity of the porous media flow rate environmental variables such as temperature or pressure and fluid properties like water density and viscosity mcdowell boyer et al 1986 elimelech and o melia 1990 panfilov et al 2008 for particle attachment the factors that may play a role include surface charge of the solute particles grain shape parameters pore connectivity surface area of the porous matrix interfacial tension chemical composition of both the solute and the matrix and fluid properties such as friction forces bradford et al 2002 yang et al 2022 ogolo and onyekonwu 2022 in order for particle collisions to occur the concentration of solute particles in the porous media must be high as more particles mean a greater likelihood of collision a porous matrix provides more space for solute particles to move leading to an increased chance of collision the velocity and direction of fluid flow also impact collision frequency as fast fluid flow can increase the velocity of solute particles and result in more frequent collisions environmental factors like temperature and pressure can influence the velocity of the solute particles and increase the likelihood of collision finally increased water density or viscosity leads to greater resistance to flow causing more frequent collisions for particle attachment the electric charge on the solute particles affects their ability to adsorb onto the porous matrix if the solute particles are charged they may attract or repel each other hindering attachment the shape of the grains in the porous matrix also plays a role as irregular shapes provide greater surface area for solute particles to adsorb onto a well connected pore network increases the likelihood of attachment by providing greater contact between the solute particles and the porous matrix a larger surface area of the porous matrix can result in increased opportunity for solute particles to adsorb while smaller surface area leads to decreased attachment interfacial tension between the solute particles and the porous matrix affects attachment as does the chemical composition of both the solute and the matrix finally changes in fluid properties such as friction forces can impact the mobility of the solute particles increasing their likelihood of attachment while it may be difficult to mathematically link these factors to the relaxation times using the present model understanding their impact provides a clearer picture of the potential causes of the observed relaxation times 3 2 effects of relaxation times in this section we focus on the impact of the parameters τ j and τ c on the concentration distribution as shown in fig 2 changing the values of these parameters affects the temporal concentration curves for both a an instantaneous pulse and b continuous injection the default values for r q n a α m c i n τ j τ c and observed point x are set as 1 1 0 5 m s 0 2 0 02 5 2 π 1 96 1 0 3 m 2 0 001 m 5 1 0 4 kg 1 kg m 3 100 s 100 s and 0 05 m respectively the volume of cylindrical pre inlet reservoir v is set as zero for the comparison sake these values have been partially adjusted from the estimates presented in the works of liang et al 2018 and li et al 2009 as seen in fig 2 a increasing the value of τ c leads to a higher maximum concentration and a shift of the peak to the right on the other hand increasing τ j causes a decrease in the concentration peak and shifts the peak to the left in fig 2 b we can see that increasing τ j results in a steeper slope of the breakthrough curve while increasing τ c leads to a flatter curve overall these findings demonstrate the importance of considering the time lag effects in the classical ade according to the definitions of τ c and τ j τ c is the result of microstructural interaction due to sorption or secondary pore water transfer while τ j is the result of inertial effects due to particle collision in the cases of fig 2 a the observation that a greater τ j leads to higher concentration values at early times can be attributed to the fact that the injected mass particles collide near the inlet resulting in some particles being pushed forward on the other hand a large value of τ c indicates a stronger interaction between the mass particles and the soil resistance due to structural interaction initially the injected mass particles stick to the soil due to sorption or secondary pore water transfer resulting in low concentration values at early times later the particles attached to the soil start to release leading to a large amount of mass being released into the flow path this results in a higher peak in the intermediate period in contrast fig 2 b shows that a higher τ j leads to lower concentration values at early times and higher concentration values at late times this is because the inertial force constantly exerts its effect on the continuously injected mass particles leading to the particles being retained near the inlet for a while a few times later all of the particles with newly injected particles move toward the outlet resulting in a higher concentration value at late times additionally a greater τ c leads to higher concentration values at early times and lower concentration values at late times this is because the constantly injected mass particles are quickly released from the soil due to faster saturation of the soil pores compared to pulse injection later the particles start to interact with the soil at late times we can conclude that the effects of relaxation times show different results depending on the type of injection 3 3 sensitivity analysis results fig 3 presents the sensitivity curves for both an instantaneous pulse and continuous injection as seen in eq 6 the curves for r and n coincide due to their high correlation the concentrations show high sensitivity to small changes in r n and q followed by α τ j and τ c the sensitivity curves in fig 3 a change sign over time because of the instantaneous pulse while only α τ j and τ c change sign in the case of continuous injection fig 3 b these results indicate that r n and q can be determined with less uncertainty when identifying their values while α has the second highest sensitivity τ j and τ c show the least sensitivity indicating when performing the parameter estimation the estimates of τ j and τ c may be determined with higher uncertainty levels therefore a careful analysis of these two parameters in the inverse problem is needed 3 4 parameter estimation of column experiments 3 4 1 case of instantaneous pulse in liang et al 2018 four instantaneous pulse tracer tests were conducted on two soil columns one containing coarse sand and the other containing finer sand the columns had a length of 1 3 m and a diameter of 0 19 m 0 33 l of chloride with a concentration of 1690 mg l were used as a tracer and measured at distances of 0 35 and 0 8 m from the inlet data from test 1 coarse sand were used to test the proposed solution the values of m and a were calculated as 5 58 1 0 4 kg and 0 028 m 2 respectively the porosity of the sand was chosen as 0 37 on the basis of the estimate in liang et al 2018 the proposed solution and the sauty 1980 solution were used to estimate the values of d i e α v and v i e q n the sauty 1980 solution has the following expression 27 c m 2 n a d π t e x v t 2 4 d t x it should be noted that the retardation factor r was assumed as unit for comparison in addition two statistical measures the standard error estimate see and the mean error me were used to evaluate the goodness of fit the estimated results and the see and me values are listed in table 2 table 2 demonstrates that the proposed model produces lower values of see and me for the two measured points compared to the solution provided by sauty 1980 this is due to the fact that the proposed model has two additional relaxation times making it more flexible and allowing for better fitting of the data it should be noted that the see values already account for the effect of the number of degrees of freedom indicating that the improved fitting results are not solely due to the additional parameters interestingly the estimates of τ c are greater than τ c for both observed points from the perspective of the threshold value θ defined as τ c τ j θ reflects the significance of the relaxation times if θ 1 the lag effects are insignificant while θ 1 implies that τ c dominates and θ 1 implies that τ c governs the system the θ values for the observations of 0 35 m and 0 8 m are 1 5 25 072 3 s 16 719 2 s and 1 67 70 705 3 s 42 357 1 s respectively this indicates that τ c plays a predominant role in solute transport behavior the values of 1 5 and 1 67 imply the consistency of transport properties fig 4 illustrates the btcs predicted by the present solution and the solution provided by sauty 1980 as well as the measured data from liang et al 2018 the curves predicted by the present solution align well with the measured data in comparison to the other solution 3 4 2 case of continuous injection in a series of column experiments li et al 2009 utilized two types of tracer cesium cs and tritium oxide hto to study the transport of solutes in groundwater the experiments were conducted under different operating conditions and the primary material in the column was crushed granite data was collected at the outlet of the column at a distance of x 2 cm 0 02 m using a constant flow rate of 5 ml min 8 33 1 0 8 m 3 s the average flow velocity was calculated to be 4 24 1 0 5 m s and the inner diameter of the column was 5 cm 0 05 m the concentration data was analyzed using the non linear weight least squares method and compared with the solution proposed by ogata and banks 1961 which is given by 28 c c i n 2 erfc x v t 2 d t e v x d erfc x v t 2 d t x where erfc is the complementary error function more information on the experimental setup can be found in fig 2 b of li et al 2009 the estimated results and the see and me values are listed in table 3 the present solution again successfully fits the measured data but here is for the case of continuous injection fig 5 presents the results of our fitting curves which were predicted by our solution and the solution proposed by ogata and banks 1961 to the measured data we observe that our solution shows good agreement with the data with particular focus on the estimates of θ for cs and hto these values are identified as 0 2 and 0 37 respectively and are less than 1 indicating that τ j plays a significant role in affecting solute transport this finding is in contrast to our previous estimates from the experiment by liang et al 2018 where θ 1 using the definition of peclet number p e v x d we can calculate p e values from our experiments on instantaneous pulse table 2 and continuous injection table 3 in the case of instantaneous pulse the p e values for observations at 0 35 m and 0 8 m are 350 and 235 5 respectively in the case of continuous injection the p e values for cs and hto are 0 8 and 5 89 respectively these results show that the p e values for the instantaneous pulse are significantly larger than those for continuous injection leading to higher relaxation time estimates this implies that increased advective transport increases the probability of particle collision and sorption in porous media overall our solution demonstrates superior performance in estimating transport parameters from btc data compared to existing solutions it serves as a useful tool for parameter estimation in situations where the btc exhibits two stage behavior 4 conclusions in this study we introduce the temporally relaxed theory into a mathematical model to describe the non fickian behavior of solute transport in one dimension the concentration response is governed by an advection dispersion equation that includes two relaxation times τ j and τ c which allow for differences in the timing of mass flux and concentration gradient we compare our model with the mim and rls models and demonstrate that the relaxation times are equivalent to lumped parameters in these models see table 1 the use of relaxation times provides a new perspective for classifying solute transport as exemplified by the threshold value θ τ c τ j see section 3 4 the results of parameter estimation from column experiments indicate that our model fits well with the breakthrough curve from experiments by liang et al 2018 and li et al 2009 the estimates of θ also provide insight into the transport mechanisms of the solute for example the tests by liang et al 2018 show that the behavior is dominated by τ c θ 1 indicating resistance from structural interactions while the tests by li et al 2009 show dominance of τ j θ 1 indicating a strong inertial effect in conclusion the temporally relaxed theory provides more reliable estimates compared to existing advection diffusion models and offers a new approach to uncover physical insights in terms of relaxed times that are not otherwise evident in the past works in future work we plan to perform a numerical modeling analysis at the pore scale to investigate the relationship between pore fluid interaction and relaxation times additionally we will require additional experimental data obtained through controlled tracer tests in the laboratory credit authorship

constitutes a critical resource however contamination of this water source can have a severe impact on the subsurface environment and overall water security hillel 2003 water contained within porous media plays a vital role in sustaining plant growth and fulfilling human water demands however when contaminated by harmful or carcinogenic soluble components such as nitrates pesticides petroleum products or heavy metals dracos 1987 addiscott et al 1991 miiler 1996 wood and anthony 1997 it can have devastating effects on the living conditions of our planet hillel 2003 thus in order to develop effective strategies for groundwater and soil remediation a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of contaminant fate and transport in aquifer systems is imperative bedient et al 1994 the advection dispersion equation ade is a commonly used tool in describing the fate and transport of contaminants in the environment this equation presumes that the dispersive mass flux is governed by fick s law which establishes a linear relationship between mass flux and concentration gradient however there are some complex physical and chemical processes that may be linked with the mass continuity equations as recent research has demonstrated carr 2020 2021 despite its widespread application the conventional ade which is based on fick s law can sometimes fall short in explaining observed concentration breakthroughs this inadequacy is frequently attributed to the lack of consideration for non fickian behavior non fickian behavior a topic that has been studied for several decades refers to phenomena that do not conform to the linear relationship described by fick s law classical diffusion related to brownian motion and following fick s law is characterized by a linear relationship between the mean squared displacement of a molecular particle and time benson et al 2000 2013 edery et al 2014 kelly and meerschaert 2017 in contrast anomalous transport displays a power law correlation between the average squared displacement and time resulting in a prolonged tailing of the concentration breakthrough curve this phenomenon is believed to arise from the influence of porous medium heterogeneity benson et al 2000 2013 edery et al 2014 kelly and meerschaert 2017 even in low reynolds number systems heterogeneous flow fields can significantly impact anomalous transport berkowitz et al 2006 2008 ongoing research continues to unravel the complexities of non fickian behavior in contaminant transport the phenomenon of anomalous behavior in contaminants has been widely explored through various well established theories kelly et al 2017 these theories include the continuous time random walk dentz and berkowitz 2003 dentz et al 2004 berkowitz et al 2006 boano et al 2007 oliveira et al 2021 two or multiple stage models brusseau et al 1991 gerke and van genuchten 1993 haggerty and gorelick 1995 haggerty et al 2000 huang et al 2010 malama et al 2013 huang and goltz 2015 chen et al 2019 and fractional ades benson et al 2000 2001 berkowitz et al 2002 schumer et al 2003 benson et al 2004 zhang et al 2007 2009 povstenko 2015 chen et al 2017 kelly and meerschaert 2017 the two stage models in particular are noteworthy in simulating solute transport in media that exhibit mobile immobile mim zones and rate limited sorption rls the mim model considers the transfer of solute mass between mobile and immobile zones governed by first order mass transfer kinetics similarly the rls model examines mass transfer between liquid and solid phases also governed by first order rate limited kinetics the mim model is based on the explicit physical mechanism of water transfer between mobile pores and dead end pores or between fractures and matrix blocks van genuchten and wagenet 1989 gao et al 2010 while the rls model allows for the simulation of chemical reactions such as absorption and adsorption huang et al 2010 the model for transport in an aquifer aquitard system brown et al 2012 huang and goltz 2015 rezaei et al 2016 li et al 2021 considers an aquitard located beneath or above a thin aquifer with contaminant transport occurring in the highly permeable aquifer layer and vertical diffusive mass transfer between the aquifer and aquitard these models all take into account the micro or macro scale heterogeneity of porous media intrinsic physical and chemical processes can play a major role in the fate and transport of contaminants exhibiting time dependent features such as concentration breakthrough retardation or tailing the concept of time lags between mass flux and concentration gradient for fick s law known as temporally relaxed theory is inspired by the dual phase lag model which allows for heat flux and thermal gradient to occur at different times in fourier s law tzou 1995 this concept is motivated by the thermal wave behavior observed in pulse laser experiments tzou et al 1994 a similar concept can be found in well hydraulics known as lagging theory which allows for water flow and hydraulic gradient to occur at distinct times in darcy s law lin and yeh 2017 lin et al 2019 for instance in a clay rich formation the well may start pumping at a constant rate but no water is abstracted from the clay even though the hydraulic gradient occurs in advance the temporally relaxed theory is used in this study to distinguish it from dual phase lag and lagging theories the objective of this research is to modify fick s law through the integration of the temporally relaxed theory resulting in the creation of a novel ade and a new model for non fickian transport the theoretical analysis in this work reveals how the relaxation times relate to the intrinsic physical mechanisms that are traditionally governed by multiple equations and contain multiple parameters the solution is derived using the laplace transform technique and a comparison of the present solution with the mim and rls models is carried out in addition a sensitivity analysis is performed to classify the importance of the transport parameters for the model finally the present solution is used to perform parameter estimation by analyzing column experiments performed by liang et al 2018 and li et al 2009 2 methodology 2 1 model setup the distribution of solute concentration c ml 3 can be described using the one dimensional ade given by 1 r c t x j where x is the distance from the source l t is the time t r is the retardation factor and j is the mass flux ml 2t 1 induced by the dispersive and advective terms 2 j t d c t x v c t in eq 2 d τ 0 d 0 α v is the dispersion coefficient l 2 t 1 and v q n is the apparent velocity lt 1 where τ 0 0 1 is the tortuosity d 0 is the aqueous molecular diffusion coefficient l 2 t 1 α is the dispersivity l q is the darcy flux lt 1 and n is the effective porosity typically the influence of d 0 on the aggregate dispersion can be disregarded as its value is substantially smaller than α v in most situations eq 2 states that the mass flux and concentration gradient happen at the same time implying that the speed at which the mass particles move is infinite this assumption may not be accurate when there is an inertial force or structural interaction similar to the dual phase lag tzou et al 1994 for fourier s law or lagging theory lin and yeh 2017 for darcy s law eq 2 for fick s law can be modified so that the mass flux and concentration gradient happen at different times 3 j t τ j d c t τ c x v c t τ c here τ j and τ c are flux lagging and storage lagging t parameters respectively the flux lagging parameter τ j reflects the relaxation time due to the inertial effect caused by the mass particle inertial collision while the storage lagging parameter τ c represents the relaxation time due to structural interactions such as sorption and secondary pore water interaction see fig 1 when τ j τ c this means that the mass flux occurs earlier than the concentration gradient and that the flux is the cause of the gradient if τ j τ c it implies that the mass flux is the result of the concentration gradient for the case of τ j τ c the time lags are negligible and eq 3 can be reduced to 2 assuming that τ j and τ c are quite small compared to the overall time t the taylor series expansion can be applied to eq 3 reading 4 i 0 τ j i i 1 t i 1 j t i 0 τ c i i 1 t i 1 d c t x v c t typically the first order approximation i e truncating at i 1 is capable of capturing the major time lag effect on the concentration response following the work of tzou 1995 eq 4 can be approximated by 5 1 τ j t j t 1 τ c t d c t x v c t substituting eq 5 into 1 the temporall relaxed ade is then obtained as 6 r 1 τ j t c t 1 τ c t α q n 2 c x 2 q n c x x 0 or simplified as 7 r 1 τ c t j t 1 τ c t l x c where l x is the spatial operator equal to α q n 2 x 2 q n x assuming the porous medium is not contaminated initially the associated initial conditions are given as 8 c t 0 c t 0 t 0 when a tracer is introduced into a soil column it may become diluted through mixing with water in the pre inlet reservoir that does not contain the tracer this can be mathematically described as wang et al 2020 shi et al 2022 9 v c t x 0 a q c 0 t c x 0 where v is the volume of the cylindrical pre inlet reservoir l 3 and a is the cross sectional area l 2 with the injecting source c 0 t ml 3 for two injection types 10 c 0 t m q a δ t for instantaneous pulse c i n for continuous injection where m is the mass of the solute injected into the medium m δ t is the dirac delta function of time t 1 and c i n is the constant injection concentration ml 3 a far field boundary condition is also imposed which can be expressed as 11 lim x c x 0 2 2 semi analytical solution applying the laplace transform to eqs 6 11 the transformed equations are obtained as 12 r 1 s τ j s c 1 s τ c l x c 13 v s c x 0 a q c 0 s c x 0 with 14 c 0 s m q a for instantaneous pulse c i n s for continuous injection 15 lim x c x 0 where the c represents the concentration function in the laplace domain and s is the laplace parameter by introducing the peclet number p e v x α x α eq 12 has a general solution expressed as 16 c c 1 exp 1 μ s 2 p e c 2 exp 1 μ s 2 p e with 17 μ s q 1 s τ c 4 n r s α 1 s τ j q 1 s τ c where c 1 and c 2 are undetermined coefficients to satisfy the boundary conditions the undetermined coefficients c 1 and c 2 are obtained respectively as a q c 0 s a q s v and 0 inserting these expressions for c 1 and c 2 into eq 16 the semi analytical solution can then be derived as 18 c a q c 0 s a q s v exp 1 μ s 2 p e eq 18 can be numerically evaluated using numerical laplace inversion schemes such as the stehfest 1970 algorithm and the trefethen et al 2006 algorithm the associated application to ade can be found in previous works of carr and turner 2016 carr 2020 recently horváth et al 2020 developed a numerical laplace inversion scheme called the concentrated matrix exponential cme method compared to the gaver stehfest method gaver 1966 stehfest 1970 euler method rooted in fourier series approximation dubner and abate 1968 and the talbot method trefethen et al 2006 the cme method has the best numerical stability avoids overshooting and undershooting issues and gains accurate results as the order used in the cme increases horváth et al 2020 provided the code written in mathematica matlab and python scripts and the readers can get these codes for free in the github repository at https github com ghorvath78 iltcme here we apply the cms s method horváth et al 2023 an extending version of cms method to inverse our laplace domain solution 2 3 sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of transport parameters on solute transport we conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of parameter uncertainty on the system output dellóca et al 2020 knabe et al 2021 we calculate the normalized sensitivity coefficients x k which kabala 2001 defines as 19 x k o ln p k p k o p k where x k represents the normalized sensitivity of the output o i e concentration c to changes in the k th input transport parameter p k we evaluate this at the observation point x 5 cm in the time interval t 0 s 1000 s using the first order forward or backward finite difference formula to approximate the derivative in eq 19 only provides a first order accurate estimate of the normalized sensitivity coefficients therefore we adopt the three point backward difference approach to improve the accuracy to second order this allows us to compute the normalized sensitivity coefficients using 20 x k p k 3 o p k 4 o p k δ p k o p k 2 δ p k 2 δ p k where δ p k is a small differential change in the k th parameter which we approximate by 1 0 3 p k as suggested by liou and yeh 1997 we use the absolute values to rank the importance of the coefficients a small magnitude of x k indicates that large changes in the parameter p k produce only small changes in the response or output variable o indicating low sensitivity this means that the parameter p k would be difficult to estimate from the o measurements it is also important to have linear independence among the sensitivity coefficients of the different parameters additionally a positive value of x k means that a small increase in p k will result in an increase in concentration values while a negative value of x k indicates that a small increase in p k will decrease concentration values 3 results 3 1 comparison with two existing models there are typically two classical two stage models used to describe transport behavior one is the mim model which is based on the assumption of physical non equilibrium in this model solute particles are transferred between the mobile zone e g fractures and the immobile zone matrix blocks the other model is the rls model which reflects two site sorption due to chemical non equilibrium in this model solutes attach to soil particles through absorption or adsorption a point to note is that although the mim model and rls model involve different non equilibrium transport mechanisms physical versus chemical they are mathematically equivalent to each other in this study we will compare the mim and rls models with the temporally relaxed model so we will discuss them in more detail below for convenience 3 1 1 mobile immobile model the ades derived based on the mim concept for the mobile zone and the immobile zone can be written respectively as van genuchten and wagenet 1989 gao et al 2010 21 β r m c m t 1 β r i m c i m t l x c m x 0 and 22 n i m r i m c i m t ω c m c i m where the subscripts m and i m represent the mobile zone and immobile zone respectively β n m n and 1 β n i m n meaning that n m n i m n and ω is the first order mass transfer rate coefficient t 1 between both continua substituting eq 22 into 21 the mim ade in terms of c m is 23 n m n r m n i m n r i m 1 n m r m n i m r i m ω n m r m n i m r i m t c m t 1 n i m r i m ω t l x c m 3 1 2 rate limited sorption model for the ade derived from the rls concept the governing equations for the liquid phase and the solid phase can be written respectively as follows brusseau et al 1991 huang et al 2010 24 c t ρ b n s t l x c x 0 and 25 s t ω k d c s where s is the mass amount in the solid phase ρ b is the bulk density of the porous medium ml 3 ω is the first order mass transfer coefficient of sorption t 1 and k d is the partition coefficient of adsorption m 3l again substituting eq 25 into 24 the rls ade in terms of c can be derived as 26 1 ρ b k d n 1 ω t c t 1 1 ω t l x c 3 1 3 physical meaning of τ j and τ c compared proposed ade eqs 6 to 23 and 26 we can find the relationships between the parameters in the temporally relaxed model and those in the mim model and rls model as listed in table 1 as table shown the retardation factor defined as s k d c is the same for linear sorption on the other hand the relaxation times τ j and τ c are the reciprocal of the transfer rate coefficient multiplied by different constants this means that an increase in ω or ω reduces the relaxation time values by increasing the mass exchange rate between the primary and secondary pores for the mim model or between the liquid and solid phases for the rls model the two stage process is sped up until the solute transport can be accurately described by a classical ade this shows that the three models share the same two stage process but they cannot be used interchangeably due to their different concepts of the solute transport mechanism the proposed method characterizes the two stage process using two empirically determined relaxation times without the need for knowledge of the matrix blocks or sorption properties and their physical interactions with the system according to the model the relaxation times τ j and τ c provide valuable information about particle collisions and attachment in porous media an increase in τ j is an indicator of a higher frequency of particle collisions leading to an increase in particle inertia on the other hand a higher value of τ c suggests a stronger sorption effect hindering particle attachment to the soil it is important to consider the factors that impact the relaxation times when analyzing solute particles in porous media for particle collisions the causes may include concentration of the solute porosity of the porous media flow rate environmental variables such as temperature or pressure and fluid properties like water density and viscosity mcdowell boyer et al 1986 elimelech and o melia 1990 panfilov et al 2008 for particle attachment the factors that may play a role include surface charge of the solute particles grain shape parameters pore connectivity surface area of the porous matrix interfacial tension chemical composition of both the solute and the matrix and fluid properties such as friction forces bradford et al 2002 yang et al 2022 ogolo and onyekonwu 2022 in order for particle collisions to occur the concentration of solute particles in the porous media must be high as more particles mean a greater likelihood of collision a porous matrix provides more space for solute particles to move leading to an increased chance of collision the velocity and direction of fluid flow also impact collision frequency as fast fluid flow can increase the velocity of solute particles and result in more frequent collisions environmental factors like temperature and pressure can influence the velocity of the solute particles and increase the likelihood of collision finally increased water density or viscosity leads to greater resistance to flow causing more frequent collisions for particle attachment the electric charge on the solute particles affects their ability to adsorb onto the porous matrix if the solute particles are charged they may attract or repel each other hindering attachment the shape of the grains in the porous matrix also plays a role as irregular shapes provide greater surface area for solute particles to adsorb onto a well connected pore network increases the likelihood of attachment by providing greater contact between the solute particles and the porous matrix a larger surface area of the porous matrix can result in increased opportunity for solute particles to adsorb while smaller surface area leads to decreased attachment interfacial tension between the solute particles and the porous matrix affects attachment as does the chemical composition of both the solute and the matrix finally changes in fluid properties such as friction forces can impact the mobility of the solute particles increasing their likelihood of attachment while it may be difficult to mathematically link these factors to the relaxation times using the present model understanding their impact provides a clearer picture of the potential causes of the observed relaxation times 3 2 effects of relaxation times in this section we focus on the impact of the parameters τ j and τ c on the concentration distribution as shown in fig 2 changing the values of these parameters affects the temporal concentration curves for both a an instantaneous pulse and b continuous injection the default values for r q n a α m c i n τ j τ c and observed point x are set as 1 1 0 5 m s 0 2 0 02 5 2 π 1 96 1 0 3 m 2 0 001 m 5 1 0 4 kg 1 kg m 3 100 s 100 s and 0 05 m respectively the volume of cylindrical pre inlet reservoir v is set as zero for the comparison sake these values have been partially adjusted from the estimates presented in the works of liang et al 2018 and li et al 2009 as seen in fig 2 a increasing the value of τ c leads to a higher maximum concentration and a shift of the peak to the right on the other hand increasing τ j causes a decrease in the concentration peak and shifts the peak to the left in fig 2 b we can see that increasing τ j results in a steeper slope of the breakthrough curve while increasing τ c leads to a flatter curve overall these findings demonstrate the importance of considering the time lag effects in the classical ade according to the definitions of τ c and τ j τ c is the result of microstructural interaction due to sorption or secondary pore water transfer while τ j is the result of inertial effects due to particle collision in the cases of fig 2 a the observation that a greater τ j leads to higher concentration values at early times can be attributed to the fact that the injected mass particles collide near the inlet resulting in some particles being pushed forward on the other hand a large value of τ c indicates a stronger interaction between the mass particles and the soil resistance due to structural interaction initially the injected mass particles stick to the soil due to sorption or secondary pore water transfer resulting in low concentration values at early times later the particles attached to the soil start to release leading to a large amount of mass being released into the flow path this results in a higher peak in the intermediate period in contrast fig 2 b shows that a higher τ j leads to lower concentration values at early times and higher concentration values at late times this is because the inertial force constantly exerts its effect on the continuously injected mass particles leading to the particles being retained near the inlet for a while a few times later all of the particles with newly injected particles move toward the outlet resulting in a higher concentration value at late times additionally a greater τ c leads to higher concentration values at early times and lower concentration values at late times this is because the constantly injected mass particles are quickly released from the soil due to faster saturation of the soil pores compared to pulse injection later the particles start to interact with the soil at late times we can conclude that the effects of relaxation times show different results depending on the type of injection 3 3 sensitivity analysis results fig 3 presents the sensitivity curves for both an instantaneous pulse and continuous injection as seen in eq 6 the curves for r and n coincide due to their high correlation the concentrations show high sensitivity to small changes in r n and q followed by α τ j and τ c the sensitivity curves in fig 3 a change sign over time because of the instantaneous pulse while only α τ j and τ c change sign in the case of continuous injection fig 3 b these results indicate that r n and q can be determined with less uncertainty when identifying their values while α has the second highest sensitivity τ j and τ c show the least sensitivity indicating when performing the parameter estimation the estimates of τ j and τ c may be determined with higher uncertainty levels therefore a careful analysis of these two parameters in the inverse problem is needed 3 4 parameter estimation of column experiments 3 4 1 case of instantaneous pulse in liang et al 2018 four instantaneous pulse tracer tests were conducted on two soil columns one containing coarse sand and the other containing finer sand the columns had a length of 1 3 m and a diameter of 0 19 m 0 33 l of chloride with a concentration of 1690 mg l were used as a tracer and measured at distances of 0 35 and 0 8 m from the inlet data from test 1 coarse sand were used to test the proposed solution the values of m and a were calculated as 5 58 1 0 4 kg and 0 028 m 2 respectively the porosity of the sand was chosen as 0 37 on the basis of the estimate in liang et al 2018 the proposed solution and the sauty 1980 solution were used to estimate the values of d i e α v and v i e q n the sauty 1980 solution has the following expression 27 c m 2 n a d π t e x v t 2 4 d t x it should be noted that the retardation factor r was assumed as unit for comparison in addition two statistical measures the standard error estimate see and the mean error me were used to evaluate the goodness of fit the estimated results and the see and me values are listed in table 2 table 2 demonstrates that the proposed model produces lower values of see and me for the two measured points compared to the solution provided by sauty 1980 this is due to the fact that the proposed model has two additional relaxation times making it more flexible and allowing for better fitting of the data it should be noted that the see values already account for the effect of the number of degrees of freedom indicating that the improved fitting results are not solely due to the additional parameters interestingly the estimates of τ c are greater than τ c for both observed points from the perspective of the threshold value θ defined as τ c τ j θ reflects the significance of the relaxation times if θ 1 the lag effects are insignificant while θ 1 implies that τ c dominates and θ 1 implies that τ c governs the system the θ values for the observations of 0 35 m and 0 8 m are 1 5 25 072 3 s 16 719 2 s and 1 67 70 705 3 s 42 357 1 s respectively this indicates that τ c plays a predominant role in solute transport behavior the values of 1 5 and 1 67 imply the consistency of transport properties fig 4 illustrates the btcs predicted by the present solution and the solution provided by sauty 1980 as well as the measured data from liang et al 2018 the curves predicted by the present solution align well with the measured data in comparison to the other solution 3 4 2 case of continuous injection in a series of column experiments li et al 2009 utilized two types of tracer cesium cs and tritium oxide hto to study the transport of solutes in groundwater the experiments were conducted under different operating conditions and the primary material in the column was crushed granite data was collected at the outlet of the column at a distance of x 2 cm 0 02 m using a constant flow rate of 5 ml min 8 33 1 0 8 m 3 s the average flow velocity was calculated to be 4 24 1 0 5 m s and the inner diameter of the column was 5 cm 0 05 m the concentration data was analyzed using the non linear weight least squares method and compared with the solution proposed by ogata and banks 1961 which is given by 28 c c i n 2 erfc x v t 2 d t e v x d erfc x v t 2 d t x where erfc is the complementary error function more information on the experimental setup can be found in fig 2 b of li et al 2009 the estimated results and the see and me values are listed in table 3 the present solution again successfully fits the measured data but here is for the case of continuous injection fig 5 presents the results of our fitting curves which were predicted by our solution and the solution proposed by ogata and banks 1961 to the measured data we observe that our solution shows good agreement with the data with particular focus on the estimates of θ for cs and hto these values are identified as 0 2 and 0 37 respectively and are less than 1 indicating that τ j plays a significant role in affecting solute transport this finding is in contrast to our previous estimates from the experiment by liang et al 2018 where θ 1 using the definition of peclet number p e v x d we can calculate p e values from our experiments on instantaneous pulse table 2 and continuous injection table 3 in the case of instantaneous pulse the p e values for observations at 0 35 m and 0 8 m are 350 and 235 5 respectively in the case of continuous injection the p e values for cs and hto are 0 8 and 5 89 respectively these results show that the p e values for the instantaneous pulse are significantly larger than those for continuous injection leading to higher relaxation time estimates this implies that increased advective transport increases the probability of particle collision and sorption in porous media overall our solution demonstrates superior performance in estimating transport parameters from btc data compared to existing solutions it serves as a useful tool for parameter estimation in situations where the btc exhibits two stage behavior 4 conclusions in this study we introduce the temporally relaxed theory into a mathematical model to describe the non fickian behavior of solute transport in one dimension the concentration response is governed by an advection dispersion equation that includes two relaxation times τ j and τ c which allow for differences in the timing of mass flux and concentration gradient we compare our model with the mim and rls models and demonstrate that the relaxation times are equivalent to lumped parameters in these models see table 1 the use of relaxation times provides a new perspective for classifying solute transport as exemplified by the threshold value θ τ c τ j see section 3 4 the results of parameter estimation from column experiments indicate that our model fits well with the breakthrough curve from experiments by liang et al 2018 and li et al 2009 the estimates of θ also provide insight into the transport mechanisms of the solute for example the tests by liang et al 2018 show that the behavior is dominated by τ c θ 1 indicating resistance from structural interactions while the tests by li et al 2009 show dominance of τ j θ 1 indicating a strong inertial effect in conclusion the temporally relaxed theory provides more reliable estimates compared to existing advection diffusion models and offers a new approach to uncover physical insights in terms of relaxed times that are not otherwise evident in the past works in future work we plan to perform a numerical modeling analysis at the pore scale to investigate the relationship between pore fluid interaction and relaxation times additionally we will require additional experimental data obtained through controlled tracer tests in the laboratory credit authorship

1976,floods in urban areas which feature interactions between piped and surface networks are hydraulically complex further obtaining in situ calibration data although necessary for robust simulations can be very challenging the aim of this research is to evaluate the performance of a commonly used deterministic 1d 2d flood model calibrated using low resolution data against a higher resolution dataset containing flows depths and velocity fields which are replicated from an experimental scale model water facility calibration of the numerical model was conducted using a lower resolution dataset which consisted of a simple rectangular profile the model was then evaluated against a dataset that was higher in spatial resolution and more complex in geometry a street profile containing parking spaces the findings show that when the model increased in scenario complexity model performance was reduced though most of the simulation error was 10 nrmse similarly there was more error in the validated model that was higher in spatial resolution than lower this was due to calibration not being stringent enough when conducted in a lower spatial resolution however overall the work shows the potential for the use of low resolution datasets for model calibration keywords dual drainage flow exchange model validation surface flow data availability data will be made available on request 1

concern interaction of flows between sewer systems and urban streets have three dimensional features and rapidly change in time hence hydrodynamic models have the challenge to represent a variety of alternating unsteady flow regimes identifying flood routes within complex topography depth averaged two dimensional 2d models solving the full shallow water equations are commonly developed to simulate flooding events and estimate the surface runoff component while pipe network models 1d are commonly applied to quantify the sewer flows chen et al 2007 vojinovic and tutiilic 2009 leandro et al 2009 maksimovic et al 2009 cea et al 2010 pan et al 2012 previous studies have been conducted to assess the accuracy of these 2d models to replicate surface flow dynamics typical of flooding scenarios by comparing numerical simulations against laboratory experiments of flooded urban crossroads mignot et al 2008a b ghostine et al 2009 2010 el kadi abderrezzak et al 2011 bazin et al 2017 or schematic flooded urban areas soares frazâo and zech 2008 van emelen et al 2012 mignot et al 2006 or against surveillance cameras and flooding information extracted from cctv footage leitâo et al 2018 moy de vitry et al 2017 2018 however systematic studies investigating flood model error utilising measured data under different scenarios are uncommon such studies are expensive and the accuracy of the analysis is reliant on the quality of the video footage and technician skill wirahadikusumah et al 1998 calibrating and validating any hydrodynamic model is a crucial aspect of the modelling framework however an important debate that previous studies possess include a lack of empirical data that is needed for calibrating and validating hydraulic simulations hunter et al 2008 collender et al 2016 consequently the accuracy of any flood model is directly related to the possession of high quality data molinari et al 2019 relevant surface flow data includes flood depths and extents inundation times and flow velocities data in a piped systems includes pipe flows and depths though there are many challenges when regarding data availability and acquisition therefore scale model facilities are often used effectively to investigate hydraulic behaviour of flood flows further calibrating a flood model which can entail running several simulations can be very computationally demanding this is especially apparent when using 1d 2d models addison atkinson et al 2022 however the relationship between calibration procedure i e complexity and detail available and model performance has yet to be fully explored in the literature many hydrological studies have identified that higher resolution grids include a higher definition of small streams roads and other permeable and impermeable urban surfaces and narrow flow pathways however some previous studies mateo et al 2017 kim et al 2021 have found that increasing a models spatial resolution may not be beneficial in every case due to increased computational times that are needed along similar lines numerical complexity has been known to be a significant source of error in complex flow regimes willis et al 2019 argued this point and found that simplified models can be just as useful as more complex models due to the error higher resolution dem s offer it is true that high resolution dem s are an integral base layer for modelling flood probability maps yet flood modelling is more convoluted than this another example has been argued by avand et al 2022 the authors point out that dem s cannot simply improve model accuracy alone many other factors e g altitude precipitation and distances from water courses flood risk zones affect simulation outputs this leads to a research question how does flood model performance differ under varying surface complexities and can a lower resolution model still simulate this process with acceptable error this is important to consider because the spatial detail or resolution of a dataset will undoubtedly affect how well a model represents reality similarly computational times can significantly increase in more complex models to address this question the current work aims to explore the relationship between 1d 2d flood simulation complexity and model error in the context of urban flooding utilising high resolution datasets form a large scale physical model representing piped and surface systems and specifically access the performance of a model which is calibrated with data collected at a courser resolution than the validation dataset 2 methods 2 1 water laboratory experiments flow rates water depths and velocity fields were obtained using a physical scale model of a sewer pipe system minor system linked to a hypothetical urban surface major system via a single manhole built at the university of sheffield and 1 6 to scale this unique water laboratory was used for multiple studies martins et al 2017 rubinato et al 2017 2018a b beg et al 2018 for the calibration and validation of many numerical models open access datasets associated with the facility are available at https zenodo org communities floodinteract the full facility is constructed from acrylic it is 8 2 m long and 4 m wide and the street profile replicated has width 1 18 m the minor system does not have a slope although the major system has a slope of 0 001 the manhole that links both systems together have a diameter of 0 240 m simulating a 1 440 m manhole at full scale the sewer pipe has a diameter of a 0 075 m internal and made out of clear acrylic simulating a 0 450 m pipe at full scale electro magnetic flow meters are used to record flows at the surface flow inlet q1 the sewer flow inlet q3 and at the outlets of the surface q2 two surface configurations were used the first was a rectangular street profile configuration 1 see fig 1 the second was a street with parking spaces configuration 2 see fig 2 pressure head was recorded by several pressure transducers which were placed at different locations around the manhole from the recorded output depths could be obtained fig 3 2 2 hydraulic testing conditions three different manhole testing conditions were selected to create hydraulic conditions in the facility for both surface configurations manhole conditions vary to consider different degrees of interactions between the major and minor systems these are as follows 1 the manhole is covered by a solid lid that significantly restricts the flow entering the minor system from the surface some flow is however bypassing a small gap around the edge of the lid and entering the piped system below from the surface there is no surcharge from the pipe network hence interaction between major and minor systems is minimal s1 2 the lid on the top of the manhole is removed flow enters the minor system freely from the surface as the flow in the pipe is minimal s2 3 the lid on the top of the manhole is removed there is significant flow in the sewer pipe resulting in surcharge from the minor to major system s3 each manhole condition was tested under three different hydraulic conditions this involved increasing either the flow running on the surface q1 or the flow entering the sewer pipe q3 measured time averaged hydraulic testing conditions under each test are shown in table 1 in this research all the tests were generated under steady conditions at the upstream boundary of the flood plain flows q1 were discharged into the system by passing over the inlet weir moving towards the downstream section of the surface outlet tank q2 the validation of the flow meters was assessed by volumetric discharge readings that were obtained with the laboratory measurement tank labviewtm software controlled butterfly flow control valves which allowed the flow release in the pipes that fed the minor and major system this therefore set a range of steady inflows for all the tests conducted flows were first created and left to stabilise before values were recorded once stabilised data were collected for a period of 3 min to define reliable temporally averaged values technique previously tested in rubinato et al 2017 and martins et al 2018 2 3 2d velocity experimental measurements surface flow velocity fields were obtained using surface particle image velocimetry spiv this is a common way to characterise 2d velocity fields of surface flow carmer et al 2009 to achieve this during this study the water facility was equipped with a seeding particle dispenser the seeding particles polypropylene 2 3 mm diameter and have a density of 0 90 g cm3 weitbrecht et al 2002 were dispensed in uniform distribution over the flood plain via a roller brush attached to a vibrating particle hopper varying between 0 and 20 rpm to control the release rate this was recorded via three gopro hero 4 black edition cameras set to record video frames of size 1440x1920 pixels the cameras were hung independently to avoid vibrations the cameras were fitted at a height of 1 5 m to acquire the video frames a 1 mm per pixel resolution at the centre of the images was obtained with a consequent maximum frame rate of 80 hz martins et al 2018 this established that each spiv seeding particle was characterised by a cluster of at least 5 pixels this was considered good particle definition and provided rigorous detection by the piv software dynamic studio by dantec dynamics ltd go pro cameras can have issues with lens distortion thus it was removed after spatial calibration by utilising chequerboard images for full description please refer to rojas arques et al 2018 the pixels outside the measurement area were then cropped for each image spatial calibration was carried out for all three go pro cameras for the range of flow depths studied in this paper prior to each test the mean background i e with no seeding particles image was recorded over 5 mins and then spiv instantaneous images were recorded for a period of 3 min for each test these images were subtracted from this background such that the background would turn black while the particles would remain white after having obtained the images with the instantaneous location of the seeding particles these images were analysed using the commercial piv software dynamic studio initially an adaptive correlation was performed to determine the velocity field for each time adjacent image pair and then a range of validation was applied to remove unrealistic high velocities and zero velocities resulting from interrogation areas with no seeding particles for each flow condition tested within the facility the filter removed 5 of the velocity vectors and those removed were then replaced via a 3 3 moving time average routine 2 4 numerical model mike urban dhi 2020 was used in this research as it is relatively simple to use which is further supported with its new interface with widely accessible academic licenses also it is a very popular software so this research may benefit its many users mike urban can simulate both 2d overland and pipe flows by coupling 1d mouse and 2d mike 21 processes together the 1d hydrodynamic pipe flow model uses saint venant 1d equations to solve pipe hydraulics whereas depth average shallow water equations are used to solve depths and velocities over the 2d surface in this study the exact measurements of the physical model were replicated in mike urban for the numerical simulations 2 5 domain discretisation the domain for each surface was created using the mike zero toolbox however a smaller domain was simulated as nothing significantly changed past this area so the new domain geometry was 1 m 5 m for the main flood plain channel two resolutions were used for each configuration a lower resolution of 32x32 g32 containing 25 488 cells and a higher resolution of 16x16 g16 containing 103 660 cells like the water facility both surfaces were assigned a manning s roughness coefficient of 0 009 sm 1 3 and a slope of 0 001 a square mesh was created for each configuration fig 4 shows a mesh example a broad crested weir was shaped along the downstream extent of the surface the weir had a height of 0 05 m and width of 0 1 m a weir coefficient of 0 8 and a weir exponential coefficient of 0 5 was set 2 6 boundary and initial conditions as default in mike urban all grid boundaries are closed an open boundary was therefore assigned to the downstream end of the grid file so flow could leave the domain the q1 boundary inflows were created by adding 14 single point sources along the highest edge on the 2d surface the physical models q1 inflows was divided by 14 at each point for the simulation mean flows from the water laboratory test results were used as inflow boundary conditions at q1 similarly the q3 pipe inflow was assigned to the node in the piped system water laboratory mean flows were used as q3 inflow boundary conditions 2 7 model calibration and validation for configuration 1 simulations were split between calibration and validation fig 5 illustrates which test was used for each scenario calibration test numbers were chosen at random in rstudio using random sample vector selection it was considered that this would be sufficient and non bias way to represent how the model performed under steady flow conditions computational times varied as seen below in table 2 all calibrations took place using the lower resolution surface g32 of configuration 1 all inflow conditions were simulated as continuous flows for the first set of experiments using configuration 1 the simulations included all nine observed water laboratory tests from each scenario s1 s2 s3 pipe calibrations adjusting pipe roughness values and manhole discharge coefficients adjusting coefficients in the manhole exchange and changing manning s roughness values were done manually during the calibration that replicated s1 lid on manhole a weir discharge coefficient of 0 2 was assigned to the manhole this allowed some surface flow to bypass the lid and enter the manhole as seen in the laboratory model when calibrating s2 and s3 a discharge coefficient of 0 9 was applied to the manhole similarly this allowed comparable flows as the laboratory model to enter the manhole the pipes q3 and q4 were both assigned a hazen williams roughness value of 140 to simulate velocity fields both grid surfaces were separately tested with the initial boundary conditions configuration 2 was used to further validate the modelling procedure using tests t10 t18 therefore all parameters were kept the same 2 8 data analysis modelled manhole flow exchange qe sewer pipe outflow q4 surface outflow q2 and the surface depths at p0 p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 were directly taken from the model for comparison with experimental data the velocity fields around the manhole and two meters within the manhole were investigated for configuration 1 fig 6 shows the vector field analysis locations including the parking space for configuration 2 velocity field data was abstracted from the modelling output in a grid around each observation area location 1 2 and 3 and compared with the experimental measured velocities the results were interpolated within the mesh to that same grid then plotted each pair of points in vector fields analysis location 1 velocities from the manhole centre were recorded at 125 mm 250 mm 375 mm and 500 mm in vector fields analysis location 2 velocities from the centre of the flood plain were recorded at 125 mm 250 mm 375 mm and 500 mm a linear regression model was conducted in rstudio which quantified how close the fit was regarding calibration and validation results with the physical testing multiple r2 the absolute fraction of variance normalised root mean square errors nrmse and p values were chosen for quantifying the robustness of the numerical model the normalised root mean square error or sometimes known as relative root mean square error is a quantitative statistical indicator that normalises the root mean square error rmse in this case it was normalised due to different flow inputs being used in each test at q1 and q3 table 1 although there are different ways to normalise rmse this study divided rmse by the absolute mean of measured data as described by despotovic et al 2016 nrmse 10 is considered excellent good if 10 nrmse 20 fair if 20 nrmse 30 and poor if nrmse 30 3 results accuracy is determined by comparing the outputs from each and determining the amount of error the results include errors from combined scenarios and observed and simulated results of manhole pipe and surface flows surface depths and velocity fields the numerical model fit can be quantified by the multiple r2 normalised root mean square error nrmse and statistical significance p values configuration 1 was split for calibration tests t3 t4 t6 t7 and t9 and validation t1 t2 t5 and t8 all of configuration 2 results were used to validate the models performance 3 1 manhole exchange pipe and surface flows results of surface configuration 1 3 1 1 calibration the results are given in table 3 and in appendix a 1 ranges of r2 were between 0 944 and 0 989 ranges of nrmse were between 0 028 and 0 072 the highest error was recorded at qe as seen in table 4 below the calibrated tests t3 t4 and t6 overestimated flows entering the manhole qe by 0 148 1 s 0 125 1 s and 0 150 1 s respectively during surcharged conditions t7 had an additional flow of 0 125 1 s leaving the manhole and t9 had an increase of 0 148 1 s 3 1 2 validation the model s validation results are reported in table 3 and appendix a 2 ranges of r2 were between 0 968 and 0 992 ranges of nrmse were between 0 027 and 0 079 similarly qe had the highest error observed and simulated flows are shown in table 4 for t1 t2 and t5 flows entering qe were over calculated by 0 124 1 s 0 136 1 s and 0 138 1 s respectively however for t8 there was an over estimated surcharge of 0 132 1 s the statistical significance implied a robust model for each split data sets 0 05 the model accuracy illustrates that the mean flows from the numerical model was closely related to the measured water facility flows the results of flow exchange and outflows from configuration 1 are considered excellent nrmse 10 3 2 manhole exchange pipe and surface flows results of surface configuration 2 3 2 1 validation results for the validated flows are shown in table 5 and appendix a 3 ranges of r2 were between 0 994 and 0 997 and ranges of nrmse were between 0 024 and 0 082 corresponding to configuration 1 flow error for configuration 2 was greatest at qe all tests had a significant outcome 0 05 the results of flow exchange and outflows from configuration 2 are considered excellent nrmse 10 this signified that the model accuracy was good and closely related to the measured water facility flows table 6 shows observed and measured flow results from configuration 2 flows were slightly over calculated at qe for configuration 2 also errors during all scenarios increased slightly when parking spaces were incorporated into the study for t10 t11 and t12 flows entering the manhole at qe were over calculated by 0 125 1 s 0 137 1 s and 0 149 1 s respectively for t13 t14 and t15 the hydrodynamic model over calculated flows entering the manhole by 0 126 1 s 0 139 1 s and 0 151 1 s respectively under surcharged conditions flow during t16 t17 and t18 were over calculated by 0 126 1 s 0 133 1 s and 0 149 1 s the increased error of flows in configuration 2 occurred due to an increase in complexity in flow patterns encompassing the manhole although the difference in error is small it is highlighted by greater errors at qe for configuration 2 nrmse 0 082 than at configuration 1 nrmse 0 072 3 3 surface depth results for configuration 1 3 3 1 calibration the calibrated values for surface depths are shown in table 7 and appendix b 1 ranges of r2 were between 0 767 and 0 993 ranges of nrmse were between 0 053 and 0 067 location p0 had the lowest error and p3 had the highest the results show a good statistical significance this indicates the numerical model managed to replicate the observed depths well table 8 illustrates observed and simulated depths during each hydraulic testing scenario when identifying depth location p2 which is right in front of the manhole the depths during t3 t4 and t6 were underestimated they were within 1 08 mm 1 09 mm and 1 76 mm of the experimental data set respectively model performance decreased with increasing q1 inflow depths during t7 and t9 were overestimated at p2 and were within 1 32 mm and 1 53 mm of the experimental data set respectively model performance decrease with increasing q3 inflow 3 3 2 validation the validated model results are shown in table 7 and appendix b 2 and include the tests for t1 t2 t5 and t8 ranges of r2 were between 0 900 and 0 993 similarly p0 had the lowest error statistical significance also explains a good model validation of depths 0 05 ranges of nrmse were between 0 046 and 0 056 when identifying depth location p2 depths at t1 t2 t5 were underestimated and stood within 0 87 mm 0 98 mm and 1 19 mm of the experimental data set respectively model performance decreased with increasing q1 inflow for these three tests however at location p2 t8 over estimated depths and was within 1 35 mm of the experimental data set during this test model performance decreased with increasing q3 inflow table 8 illustrates observed and simulated depths during each hydraulic testing scenario 3 4 surface depth results for configuration 2 3 4 1 validation the accuracy of the validated model is illustrated in table 9 below and appendix b 3 ranges of r2 were between 0 906 and 0 990 ranges of nrmse were between 0 052 and 0 064 all tests were significant 0 05 like configuration 1 the error of depths in configuration 2 were highest at p3 and lowest at p0 this highlights that the wave reflections of the flow had the most disparity at these two points table 10 illustrates observed and simulated depths during each hydraulic scenario during s1 and s2 depths were slightly under calculated and s3 depths were over calculated differences in depths were 2 mm which was comparable to configuration 1 though the differences were slightly larger when parking spaces were added to the flood plain similarly errors in depths increased in relation to increasing q1 inflow for s1 and s2 for s3 errors in depths were related to q3 inflow conditions the error in depths during s1 were the smallest in all hydraulic scenarios as seen in the previous street profile when identifying location p2 depths during t10 t11 and t12 were within 0 88 mm 0 99 mm and 1 10 mm respectively s2 also saw underestimated depths at p2 depths during t13 t14 and t15 were within 1 10 mm 1 20 mm and 1 77 mm correspondingly depths during s3 where pipe inflow dominated flows increased with increasing inflow at p2 depths were within 1 33 mm during t16 1 36 mm during t17 and 1 54 mm during t18 3 5 results of velocity fields for surface configuration 1 analysis area 1 3 5 1 calibration the agreement between the observed and simulated velocities from analysis area 1 are shown in table 11 the results of the velocity fields in analysis area 1 are plotted in appendix c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 the distances from the manhole centre are shown in each the results show that the lower resolution grid g32 had less error than the higher resolution grid g16 longitudinal flow had smaller error than transversal flows velocity error also increased the nearer to the manhole for g32 calibrated nrmse ranged between 0 058 and 0 130 for longitudinal flow calibrated transversal flows had slightly more error nrmse ranged between 0 081 and 0 173 when the calibrated model was run using g16 nrmse ranged between 0 071 and 0 141 for longitudinal flow transversal flows had an nrmse range of 0 101 and 0 192 r2 values were 0 945 with a significant outcome in all calibrated tests p value 0 05 3 5 2 validation the validated model with the g32 surface had a ranging nrmse of between 0 058 and 0 125 for longitudinal velocities and between 0 069 and 0 166 for transversal velocities the validated model with the g16 surface had a ranging nrmse of 0 068 and 0 140 for longitudinal flows and a range of 0 076 and 0 189 for transversal flows in all the tests r2 values were 0 958 and tests were significant p value 0 05 3 6 results of velocity fields for surface configuration 2 analysis area 1 3 6 1 validation the accuracy of the model is shown for both g32 and g16 in longitudinal and transversal vectors in table 12 these results are plotted in appendix d 1 d 2 d 3 and d 4 for g32 longitudinal flows nrmse ranged from between 0 06 and 0 146 transversal flows had slightly higher error they ranged from between 0 08 and 0 183 similarly all tests were significant with r2 0 923 g16 had larger errors nrmse for longitudinal flows ranged between 0 069 and 0 147 and transversal flow error ranged between 0 090 and 0 201 3 7 results of velocity fields for configuration 1 analysis area 2 the agreement between the observed and simulated velocities from analysis area 2 are shown in table 13 and in appendix c 5 c 6 c 7 and c 8 the distances from the manhole centre are shown in each the results show that the lower resolution grid g32 had less error than the higher resolution grid g16 longitudinal flow had smaller error than transversal flows velocity error also increased the nearer to the grid centre 3 7 1 calibration in the calibrated model within g32 the nrmse ranged between 0 057 and 0 114 for longitudinal velocity fields and for transversal velocity fields ranged between 0 075 and 0 125 errors were slightly larger for the higher resolution data set ranges of nrmse were between 0 064 and 0 133 for longitudinal velocity fields and between 0 099 and 0 183 for transversal velocity fields r2 values were 0 816 and all tests were significant 3 7 2 validation the validated model using g32 showed a range of nrmse ranging between 0 048 and 0 109 for longitudinal velocity fields and for transversal velocity fields it ranged between 0 054 and 0 123 r2 values were 0 792 similarly these errors increased in the higher resolution grid ranges of nrmse were between 0 052 and 0 123 for longitudinal velocity fields and between 0 069 and 0 174 for transversal velocity fields r2 values in the validated data set were 0 727 table 13 shows the error with regards to their distance to the centre of the flood plain similarly velocity errors increased the nearest to the centre of the flood plain 3 8 results of velocity fields for configuration 2 analysis area 2 3 8 1 validation the results show that less error occurred with increasing distance from the manhole see table 14 for g32 nrmse ranged between 0 052 and 0 125 for longitudinal flows and between 0 067 and 0 145 for lateral flows multiple r2 values were also high 0 909 for g16 nrmse for longitudinal flows ranged between 0 060 and 0 137 and between 0 081 and 0 227 for transversal flows table 13 shows that error increased with decreasing distance from the grid centre these results are plotted in figs d 5 d 8 in appendix d like configuration 1 the results show that for configuration 2 errors increased with increasing inflows this error increased when under surcharge conditions for example tests being conducted under s1 and s2 had less error than tests under s3 along similar lines the higher resolution grid also had larger error than the lower resolution grid 3 9 results of velocity fields of configuration 2 analysis area 3 3 9 1 validation these results show the velocity field error for analysis area 3 which was situated inside a parking space they are illustrated in table 15 below and figs d 9 d 12 in appendix d the results suggest that the model outcome was acceptable as the nrmse was below the 30 limit and r2 was high 0 979 the results suggest that nrmse ranged between 0 09 and 0 177 for longitudinal flows and for transversal flows it ranged between 0 111 and 0 215 in g32 for g16 nrmse ranged between 0 098 and 0 182 for longitudinal flows and for transversal error ranged between 0 115 and 0 225 4 discussion 4 1 manhole exchange pipe and surface flows as flow rates in the model increased the model performance decreased for example during s1 and s2 the inflow at q1 dominated the flow conditions this meant that as the inflow increased so did the simulated error along the same lines this was apparent for s3 where the model was influenced by q3 input flows this meant that the error of s3 increased with increasing q3 inflows errors in the manhole exchange pipe and surface flows were higher in configuration 2 than configuration 1 similarly this is very likely to do with the increased complexity of the floodplain plus calibration took place using a lower spatial resolution throughout the hydraulic testing scenarios the numerical model overestimated manhole exchange for all scenarios this meant that the model either overestimated pipe outflow or overestimated surface outflow for s1 and s2 simulated pipe outflow q4 was greater in the numerical model than the experimental datasets as a result 2d overland flow was smaller than observed values under these scenarios along similar lines for s3 over calculated surcharged flow meant that pipe outflows were smaller in the numerical model than the experimental datasets such errors have been experienced in previous studies for example fraga et al 2017 found that their model over estimated surcharge by 2 which is slightly in better agreement than the model in the present study rubinato et al 2017 calibrated their flood model under steady flow conditions and found that their model over estimated unsteady surcharge flow rates this occurred due to turbulent conditions created by unsteady flows in the present study the manhole exchange error comes to pass due to s1 and s2 being heavily influenced by q1 inflow whereas s3 is determined by q3 pipe inflow 4 2 surface depths the errors of simulated surface depths increased with increasing flow rate this was also greater in configuration 2 when compared to configuration 1 differences in depths were 2 mm for all depth locations during the three hydraulic testing scenarios this is consistent to other studies rubinato et al 2016 had a l 3 mm disparity after changing downstream boundary conditions adjusting a weir when modelling depths around a manhole similarly martins et al 2017 had a range of depths just above 2 mm when validating 2d shock capturing flood models around a surcharging manhole the results from the present study suggest manhole exchange dynamics are attributable to changes in surface depths for example during s1 and s2 q1 inflow influenced the flow at qe and q2 for both scenarios the results confirm that there was more error at depth locations with higher q1 inflow these results are consistent with a previous study for example martins et al 2017 found that higher q1 increased the variation in depths the biggest depth discrepancy in their study came from p2 as this point is upstream of the manhole this meant that this location was most effected by overland inflow during the present study we conclude that p2 was also strongly affected by q1 during s1 and s2 though most error came from depth location p3 which is situated downstream of the manhole during s3 depths were slightly overestimated this was due to pipe inflow at q3 dominating discharges through the manhole and over the flood plain thus during simulation the manhole magnified this exchange similarly the variation in depths increased at each location with higher inflows at q3 this meant that model error increased with increasing q3 in the current study depths were related to the dominate boundary inflow depths during s1 and s2 increased with increasing q1 and s3 was increased with q3 the variation of depths also increased with the increasing inflow boundary though the results do indicate that there was a stable and balanced flow during the simulations which is agreeable with many of the observed values in the observed data p1 had a greater depth than p5 under s3 even though the locations were the same distance from the manhole this was due to p1 being closer to the boundary wall of the physical model this changes the wave reflections of the flow causing some parts of the 2d surface to have greater depths than others the numerical model was able to replicate this well this is seen by the relationship between the depth trends and qe flow exchange in both the observed and simulated results this has been accurately replicated in other numerical modelling studies for example in the work of kesserwani et al 2015 the authors found that depths increased at p1 and p5 with increasing qe p1 also had a greater depth than p5 due to the geometry of the model 4 3 velocity fields analysis area 1 for configuration 1 the results show that for longitudinal flows in g32 model performance decreased with increasing inflows surface flows and depths were underestimated during s1 and s2 as discussed in the exchange flow results above this meant that velocities were also slightly under calculated for s3 the opposite occurred as flows were over calculated longitudinal flows had more error than transversal flows this meant that the model performed better in flows that were more directional and less turbulent as seen in cross flows along similar lines an increase in error was directly linked to inflow conditions velocity error increased with increasing q1 inflow for s1 and s2 for s3 velocity error increased with q3 inflow the model did not perform as well with the validated higher resolution grid albeit the modelling outcome was considered good the highest nrmse in g16 was 19 2 which is well within the acceptable model performance percentage 30 this agrees to other outcomes for example in the works of willis et al 2019 they found that increasing errors can occur in higher resolution data sets due to an increase in model complexity during configuration 2 the model performance also decreased with increasing inflows which mirrored configuration 1 results due to surface flows and depths being under calculated for s1 and s2 this meant that velocities were also under simulated q1 inflow was responsible for these errors s3 had higher simulated velocities due to over simulated flows and depths due to q3 inflows for g16 the highest nrmse was during lateral flows under t18 20 1 yet this still was still below the acceptable limit 30 the model performed less accurately 26 7 error in analysis area 1 during surcharge conditions in the higher resolution grid this was at a range of 125 mm to the manhole centre during t18 which was consistent to the first street profile 4 4 velocity fields analysis area 2 and 3 model performance improved the further away velocities were recorded from the manhole for example the model performed better in analysis area 2 than 1 this is due to the manhole being a more complex area to simulate as verified in other works martins et al 2018 willis et al 2019 shrestha et al 2022 similarly model performance improved in longitudinal flows than transversal as they were more dominant and less complex as seen in analysis area 1 model performance also decreased in the higher resolution dataset the highest nrmse during surcharge at g16 was 18 3 which is well within the he acceptable model performance percentage 30 out of all velocity field analysis locations model performance in analysis area 3 was the lowest this was likely the most complex region to simulate velocity fields in configuration 2 here flows were more turbulent similarly longitudinal velocity field performance was greater than transversal velocity fields and the performance of the model decreased with increasing spatial resolution which was likely to do with the model being calibrated in a lower resolution 4 5 spatial resolution calibration and computational time trade off the key debate that this paper covers is model performance and the associated errors with regards to increasing inflows and surface complexities the keys findings found that model performance did decrease with increasing pipe and surface inflows spatial resolution of the 2d surfaces used and when parking spaces were introduced also the model performed better in the calibrated lower resolution grids model error linked to numerical complexity has been discussed in previous research for example mateo et al 2017 willis et al 2019 kim et al 2021 the authors found that if parameter calibrations are conducted in lower spatial resolution model performance can decrease when the resolution is increased in future simulations though this uncertainty is far less when flows are less complex they argue that simplified models can be just as useful as more complicated models which agrees with the present paper these differences are likely to be reduced through the calibration process meaning that calibration should take place using the highest resolution possible however one could also argue that there is a trade off between resolution and computational times this is something that the modeller needs to consider for themselves for example table 2 illustrates that in the higher resolution grid computational times were about twice as long than the lower resolution grid therefore we argue that we found it acceptable in our example to use a lower resolution model as errors were not large enough to reduce model performance enough and simulations were far less time consuming 4 6 limitations of study the biggest limitation of this study is that it only looked at two hypothetical street profiles that were both relatively simple therefore the differences in errors were quite small between each configuration and opposing resolution it is proposed that future work may look at creating more obstacles on the floodplain this may resemble street furniture in the real world for example benches plant containers or curbs another important point to consider is that this study only looked at mike urban as the modelling software and made no comparison with any other it is hypothesised that if this work was carried out in a similar commercial package e g info works the results would be similar as both mike and info works use shallow water equations and finite volume numerical schemes though results maybe slightly different if using uim chen et al 2007 as uim uses diffusive wave equations and a finite difference numerical scheme 5 conclusion the need to understand the accuracy of 2d velocity fields across flooded urban surfaces has motivated this research water facilities such as the one used in this study are a useful way to obtain high resolution data yet calibrating high resolution models can be computationally demanding therefore it may be necessary to initially calibrate flood models in lower resolutions reducing simulation times to increase the accuracy of flood models after calibration it is possible to increase spatial resolution this allows for a more detailed investigation of inundation over an area paying closer attention to small streams and narrow flow conduits yet error is likely to increase from the elevated model complexity as such this paper analysed this process by comparing high resolution data sets collected from a water laboratory with a numerical model the level of complexity was increased within two hypothetical street profiles to assess if it could influence the performance of the numerical simulations the model was calibrated before spatial resolution was increased this study suggests that hydrodynamic 1d 2d models with a lower spatial resolution may still be appropriate for modelling urban inundation this is because computational times are reduced and errors may still be acceptable our findings provide a valuable understanding of urban flooding scenarios using a high spatial resolution experimental dataset we conclude that the data set is reproducible for future studies and is suitable for the calibration and validation of other current numerical models the model was able to replicate highly accurate flows surface depths and velocities when compared to the physical experimental data sets model error increased with increasing inflows similarly error increased when the spatial resolution became finer due to the model being calibrated in the less complex system the conclusions can be simplified as follows in both configurations model performance flows depths and velocity fields decreased with increasing pipe and surface inflows model performance decreased in the finer spatial resolution due to calibration taking place with a courser resolution velocity field error increased with decreasing distance to the manhole and grid centre configuration 1 where model performance was improved validated flow errors were 7 9 validated surface depth errors were 5 6 validated velocity field errors were 19 2 configuration 2 where model performance was reduced due to parking spaces being added validated flow errors were 8 2 validated

1976,floods in urban areas which feature interactions between piped and surface networks are hydraulically complex further obtaining in situ calibration data although necessary for robust simulations can be very challenging the aim of this research is to evaluate the performance of a commonly used deterministic 1d 2d flood model calibrated using low resolution data against a higher resolution dataset containing flows depths and velocity fields which are replicated from an experimental scale model water facility calibration of the numerical model was conducted using a lower resolution dataset which consisted of a simple rectangular profile the model was then evaluated against a dataset that was higher in spatial resolution and more complex in geometry a street profile containing parking spaces the findings show that when the model increased in scenario complexity model performance was reduced though most of the simulation error was 10 nrmse similarly there was more error in the validated model that was higher in spatial resolution than lower this was due to calibration not being stringent enough when conducted in a lower spatial resolution however overall the work shows the potential for the use of low resolution datasets for model calibration keywords dual drainage flow exchange model validation surface flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the past decades heavy rainfall events have become more frequent due to a warming climate jongman et al 2014 hall et al 2014 stewart et al 2015 rubinato et al 2019 and had a worldwide significant impact causing social dewan 2015 and economic losses svetlana et al 2015 moreover multiple small scale urban flooding events repeatedly occur in cities where the existing drainage is very old subject to blockages hillas 2014 or was designed to convey smaller volumes of flows now increased due to urbanisation many hydrodynamic models have been developed to understand the risks of urban flooding estrela and quintas 1994 bates and de roo 2000 liang 2010 rubinato et al 2019 however due to the complex flow processes in urban areas when inundation occurs there is still space for improvements and further developments bates 2004 aronica et al 2002 rubinato et al 2021 in particular the difficulty in acquiring appropriate calibration validation data is an ongoing concern interaction of flows between sewer systems and urban streets have three dimensional features and rapidly change in time hence hydrodynamic models have the challenge to represent a variety of alternating unsteady flow regimes identifying flood routes within complex topography depth averaged two dimensional 2d models solving the full shallow water equations are commonly developed to simulate flooding events and estimate the surface runoff component while pipe network models 1d are commonly applied to quantify the sewer flows chen et al 2007 vojinovic and tutiilic 2009 leandro et al 2009 maksimovic et al 2009 cea et al 2010 pan et al 2012 previous studies have been conducted to assess the accuracy of these 2d models to replicate surface flow dynamics typical of flooding scenarios by comparing numerical simulations against laboratory experiments of flooded urban crossroads mignot et al 2008a b ghostine et al 2009 2010 el kadi abderrezzak et al 2011 bazin et al 2017 or schematic flooded urban areas soares frazâo and zech 2008 van emelen et al 2012 mignot et al 2006 or against surveillance cameras and flooding information extracted from cctv footage leitâo et al 2018 moy de vitry et al 2017 2018 however systematic studies investigating flood model error utilising measured data under different scenarios are uncommon such studies are expensive and the accuracy of the analysis is reliant on the quality of the video footage and technician skill wirahadikusumah et al 1998 calibrating and validating any hydrodynamic model is a crucial aspect of the modelling framework however an important debate that previous studies possess include a lack of empirical data that is needed for calibrating and validating hydraulic simulations hunter et al 2008 collender et al 2016 consequently the accuracy of any flood model is directly related to the possession of high quality data molinari et al 2019 relevant surface flow data includes flood depths and extents inundation times and flow velocities data in a piped systems includes pipe flows and depths though there are many challenges when regarding data availability and acquisition therefore scale model facilities are often used effectively to investigate hydraulic behaviour of flood flows further calibrating a flood model which can entail running several simulations can be very computationally demanding this is especially apparent when using 1d 2d models addison atkinson et al 2022 however the relationship between calibration procedure i e complexity and detail available and model performance has yet to be fully explored in the literature many hydrological studies have identified that higher resolution grids include a higher definition of small streams roads and other permeable and impermeable urban surfaces and narrow flow pathways however some previous studies mateo et al 2017 kim et al 2021 have found that increasing a models spatial resolution may not be beneficial in every case due to increased computational times that are needed along similar lines numerical complexity has been known to be a significant source of error in complex flow regimes willis et al 2019 argued this point and found that simplified models can be just as useful as more complex models due to the error higher resolution dem s offer it is true that high resolution dem s are an integral base layer for modelling flood probability maps yet flood modelling is more convoluted than this another example has been argued by avand et al 2022 the authors point out that dem s cannot simply improve model accuracy alone many other factors e g altitude precipitation and distances from water courses flood risk zones affect simulation outputs this leads to a research question how does flood model performance differ under varying surface complexities and can a lower resolution model still simulate this process with acceptable error this is important to consider because the spatial detail or resolution of a dataset will undoubtedly affect how well a model represents reality similarly computational times can significantly increase in more complex models to address this question the current work aims to explore the relationship between 1d 2d flood simulation complexity and model error in the context of urban flooding utilising high resolution datasets form a large scale physical model representing piped and surface systems and specifically access the performance of a model which is calibrated with data collected at a courser resolution than the validation dataset 2 methods 2 1 water laboratory experiments flow rates water depths and velocity fields were obtained using a physical scale model of a sewer pipe system minor system linked to a hypothetical urban surface major system via a single manhole built at the university of sheffield and 1 6 to scale this unique water laboratory was used for multiple studies martins et al 2017 rubinato et al 2017 2018a b beg et al 2018 for the calibration and validation of many numerical models open access datasets associated with the facility are available at https zenodo org communities floodinteract the full facility is constructed from acrylic it is 8 2 m long and 4 m wide and the street profile replicated has width 1 18 m the minor system does not have a slope although the major system has a slope of 0 001 the manhole that links both systems together have a diameter of 0 240 m simulating a 1 440 m manhole at full scale the sewer pipe has a diameter of a 0 075 m internal and made out of clear acrylic simulating a 0 450 m pipe at full scale electro magnetic flow meters are used to record flows at the surface flow inlet q1 the sewer flow inlet q3 and at the outlets of the surface q2 two surface configurations were used the first was a rectangular street profile configuration 1 see fig 1 the second was a street with parking spaces configuration 2 see fig 2 pressure head was recorded by several pressure transducers which were placed at different locations around the manhole from the recorded output depths could be obtained fig 3 2 2 hydraulic testing conditions three different manhole testing conditions were selected to create hydraulic conditions in the facility for both surface configurations manhole conditions vary to consider different degrees of interactions between the major and minor systems these are as follows 1 the manhole is covered by a solid lid that significantly restricts the flow entering the minor system from the surface some flow is however bypassing a small gap around the edge of the lid and entering the piped system below from the surface there is no surcharge from the pipe network hence interaction between major and minor systems is minimal s1 2 the lid on the top of the manhole is removed flow enters the minor system freely from the surface as the flow in the pipe is minimal s2 3 the lid on the top of the manhole is removed there is significant flow in the sewer pipe resulting in surcharge from the minor to major system s3 each manhole condition was tested under three different hydraulic conditions this involved increasing either the flow running on the surface q1 or the flow entering the sewer pipe q3 measured time averaged hydraulic testing conditions under each test are shown in table 1 in this research all the tests were generated under steady conditions at the upstream boundary of the flood plain flows q1 were discharged into the system by passing over the inlet weir moving towards the downstream section of the surface outlet tank q2 the validation of the flow meters was assessed by volumetric discharge readings that were obtained with the laboratory measurement tank labviewtm software controlled butterfly flow control valves which allowed the flow release in the pipes that fed the minor and major system this therefore set a range of steady inflows for all the tests conducted flows were first created and left to stabilise before values were recorded once stabilised data were collected for a period of 3 min to define reliable temporally averaged values technique previously tested in rubinato et al 2017 and martins et al 2018 2 3 2d velocity experimental measurements surface flow velocity fields were obtained using surface particle image velocimetry spiv this is a common way to characterise 2d velocity fields of surface flow carmer et al 2009 to achieve this during this study the water facility was equipped with a seeding particle dispenser the seeding particles polypropylene 2 3 mm diameter and have a density of 0 90 g cm3 weitbrecht et al 2002 were dispensed in uniform distribution over the flood plain via a roller brush attached to a vibrating particle hopper varying between 0 and 20 rpm to control the release rate this was recorded via three gopro hero 4 black edition cameras set to record video frames of size 1440x1920 pixels the cameras were hung independently to avoid vibrations the cameras were fitted at a height of 1 5 m to acquire the video frames a 1 mm per pixel resolution at the centre of the images was obtained with a consequent maximum frame rate of 80 hz martins et al 2018 this established that each spiv seeding particle was characterised by a cluster of at least 5 pixels this was considered good particle definition and provided rigorous detection by the piv software dynamic studio by dantec dynamics ltd go pro cameras can have issues with lens distortion thus it was removed after spatial calibration by utilising chequerboard images for full description please refer to rojas arques et al 2018 the pixels outside the measurement area were then cropped for each image spatial calibration was carried out for all three go pro cameras for the range of flow depths studied in this paper prior to each test the mean background i e with no seeding particles image was recorded over 5 mins and then spiv instantaneous images were recorded for a period of 3 min for each test these images were subtracted from this background such that the background would turn black while the particles would remain white after having obtained the images with the instantaneous location of the seeding particles these images were analysed using the commercial piv software dynamic studio initially an adaptive correlation was performed to determine the velocity field for each time adjacent image pair and then a range of validation was applied to remove unrealistic high velocities and zero velocities resulting from interrogation areas with no seeding particles for each flow condition tested within the facility the filter removed 5 of the velocity vectors and those removed were then replaced via a 3 3 moving time average routine 2 4 numerical model mike urban dhi 2020 was used in this research as it is relatively simple to use which is further supported with its new interface with widely accessible academic licenses also it is a very popular software so this research may benefit its many users mike urban can simulate both 2d overland and pipe flows by coupling 1d mouse and 2d mike 21 processes together the 1d hydrodynamic pipe flow model uses saint venant 1d equations to solve pipe hydraulics whereas depth average shallow water equations are used to solve depths and velocities over the 2d surface in this study the exact measurements of the physical model were replicated in mike urban for the numerical simulations 2 5 domain discretisation the domain for each surface was created using the mike zero toolbox however a smaller domain was simulated as nothing significantly changed past this area so the new domain geometry was 1 m 5 m for the main flood plain channel two resolutions were used for each configuration a lower resolution of 32x32 g32 containing 25 488 cells and a higher resolution of 16x16 g16 containing 103 660 cells like the water facility both surfaces were assigned a manning s roughness coefficient of 0 009 sm 1 3 and a slope of 0 001 a square mesh was created for each configuration fig 4 shows a mesh example a broad crested weir was shaped along the downstream extent of the surface the weir had a height of 0 05 m and width of 0 1 m a weir coefficient of 0 8 and a weir exponential coefficient of 0 5 was set 2 6 boundary and initial conditions as default in mike urban all grid boundaries are closed an open boundary was therefore assigned to the downstream end of the grid file so flow could leave the domain the q1 boundary inflows were created by adding 14 single point sources along the highest edge on the 2d surface the physical models q1 inflows was divided by 14 at each point for the simulation mean flows from the water laboratory test results were used as inflow boundary conditions at q1 similarly the q3 pipe inflow was assigned to the node in the piped system water laboratory mean flows were used as q3 inflow boundary conditions 2 7 model calibration and validation for configuration 1 simulations were split between calibration and validation fig 5 illustrates which test was used for each scenario calibration test numbers were chosen at random in rstudio using random sample vector selection it was considered that this would be sufficient and non bias way to represent how the model performed under steady flow conditions computational times varied as seen below in table 2 all calibrations took place using the lower resolution surface g32 of configuration 1 all inflow conditions were simulated as continuous flows for the first set of experiments using configuration 1 the simulations included all nine observed water laboratory tests from each scenario s1 s2 s3 pipe calibrations adjusting pipe roughness values and manhole discharge coefficients adjusting coefficients in the manhole exchange and changing manning s roughness values were done manually during the calibration that replicated s1 lid on manhole a weir discharge coefficient of 0 2 was assigned to the manhole this allowed some surface flow to bypass the lid and enter the manhole as seen in the laboratory model when calibrating s2 and s3 a discharge coefficient of 0 9 was applied to the manhole similarly this allowed comparable flows as the laboratory model to enter the manhole the pipes q3 and q4 were both assigned a hazen williams roughness value of 140 to simulate velocity fields both grid surfaces were separately tested with the initial boundary conditions configuration 2 was used to further validate the modelling procedure using tests t10 t18 therefore all parameters were kept the same 2 8 data analysis modelled manhole flow exchange qe sewer pipe outflow q4 surface outflow q2 and the surface depths at p0 p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 were directly taken from the model for comparison with experimental data the velocity fields around the manhole and two meters within the manhole were investigated for configuration 1 fig 6 shows the vector field analysis locations including the parking space for configuration 2 velocity field data was abstracted from the modelling output in a grid around each observation area location 1 2 and 3 and compared with the experimental measured velocities the results were interpolated within the mesh to that same grid then plotted each pair of points in vector fields analysis location 1 velocities from the manhole centre were recorded at 125 mm 250 mm 375 mm and 500 mm in vector fields analysis location 2 velocities from the centre of the flood plain were recorded at 125 mm 250 mm 375 mm and 500 mm a linear regression model was conducted in rstudio which quantified how close the fit was regarding calibration and validation results with the physical testing multiple r2 the absolute fraction of variance normalised root mean square errors nrmse and p values were chosen for quantifying the robustness of the numerical model the normalised root mean square error or sometimes known as relative root mean square error is a quantitative statistical indicator that normalises the root mean square error rmse in this case it was normalised due to different flow inputs being used in each test at q1 and q3 table 1 although there are different ways to normalise rmse this study divided rmse by the absolute mean of measured data as described by despotovic et al 2016 nrmse 10 is considered excellent good if 10 nrmse 20 fair if 20 nrmse 30 and poor if nrmse 30 3 results accuracy is determined by comparing the outputs from each and determining the amount of error the results include errors from combined scenarios and observed and simulated results of manhole pipe and surface flows surface depths and velocity fields the numerical model fit can be quantified by the multiple r2 normalised root mean square error nrmse and statistical significance p values configuration 1 was split for calibration tests t3 t4 t6 t7 and t9 and validation t1 t2 t5 and t8 all of configuration 2 results were used to validate the models performance 3 1 manhole exchange pipe and surface flows results of surface configuration 1 3 1 1 calibration the results are given in table 3 and in appendix a 1 ranges of r2 were between 0 944 and 0 989 ranges of nrmse were between 0 028 and 0 072 the highest error was recorded at qe as seen in table 4 below the calibrated tests t3 t4 and t6 overestimated flows entering the manhole qe by 0 148 1 s 0 125 1 s and 0 150 1 s respectively during surcharged conditions t7 had an additional flow of 0 125 1 s leaving the manhole and t9 had an increase of 0 148 1 s 3 1 2 validation the model s validation results are reported in table 3 and appendix a 2 ranges of r2 were between 0 968 and 0 992 ranges of nrmse were between 0 027 and 0 079 similarly qe had the highest error observed and simulated flows are shown in table 4 for t1 t2 and t5 flows entering qe were over calculated by 0 124 1 s 0 136 1 s and 0 138 1 s respectively however for t8 there was an over estimated surcharge of 0 132 1 s the statistical significance implied a robust model for each split data sets 0 05 the model accuracy illustrates that the mean flows from the numerical model was closely related to the measured water facility flows the results of flow exchange and outflows from configuration 1 are considered excellent nrmse 10 3 2 manhole exchange pipe and surface flows results of surface configuration 2 3 2 1 validation results for the validated flows are shown in table 5 and appendix a 3 ranges of r2 were between 0 994 and 0 997 and ranges of nrmse were between 0 024 and 0 082 corresponding to configuration 1 flow error for configuration 2 was greatest at qe all tests had a significant outcome 0 05 the results of flow exchange and outflows from configuration 2 are considered excellent nrmse 10 this signified that the model accuracy was good and closely related to the measured water facility flows table 6 shows observed and measured flow results from configuration 2 flows were slightly over calculated at qe for configuration 2 also errors during all scenarios increased slightly when parking spaces were incorporated into the study for t10 t11 and t12 flows entering the manhole at qe were over calculated by 0 125 1 s 0 137 1 s and 0 149 1 s respectively for t13 t14 and t15 the hydrodynamic model over calculated flows entering the manhole by 0 126 1 s 0 139 1 s and 0 151 1 s respectively under surcharged conditions flow during t16 t17 and t18 were over calculated by 0 126 1 s 0 133 1 s and 0 149 1 s the increased error of flows in configuration 2 occurred due to an increase in complexity in flow patterns encompassing the manhole although the difference in error is small it is highlighted by greater errors at qe for configuration 2 nrmse 0 082 than at configuration 1 nrmse 0 072 3 3 surface depth results for configuration 1 3 3 1 calibration the calibrated values for surface depths are shown in table 7 and appendix b 1 ranges of r2 were between 0 767 and 0 993 ranges of nrmse were between 0 053 and 0 067 location p0 had the lowest error and p3 had the highest the results show a good statistical significance this indicates the numerical model managed to replicate the observed depths well table 8 illustrates observed and simulated depths during each hydraulic testing scenario when identifying depth location p2 which is right in front of the manhole the depths during t3 t4 and t6 were underestimated they were within 1 08 mm 1 09 mm and 1 76 mm of the experimental data set respectively model performance decreased with increasing q1 inflow depths during t7 and t9 were overestimated at p2 and were within 1 32 mm and 1 53 mm of the experimental data set respectively model performance decrease with increasing q3 inflow 3 3 2 validation the validated model results are shown in table 7 and appendix b 2 and include the tests for t1 t2 t5 and t8 ranges of r2 were between 0 900 and 0 993 similarly p0 had the lowest error statistical significance also explains a good model validation of depths 0 05 ranges of nrmse were between 0 046 and 0 056 when identifying depth location p2 depths at t1 t2 t5 were underestimated and stood within 0 87 mm 0 98 mm and 1 19 mm of the experimental data set respectively model performance decreased with increasing q1 inflow for these three tests however at location p2 t8 over estimated depths and was within 1 35 mm of the experimental data set during this test model performance decreased with increasing q3 inflow table 8 illustrates observed and simulated depths during each hydraulic testing scenario 3 4 surface depth results for configuration 2 3 4 1 validation the accuracy of the validated model is illustrated in table 9 below and appendix b 3 ranges of r2 were between 0 906 and 0 990 ranges of nrmse were between 0 052 and 0 064 all tests were significant 0 05 like configuration 1 the error of depths in configuration 2 were highest at p3 and lowest at p0 this highlights that the wave reflections of the flow had the most disparity at these two points table 10 illustrates observed and simulated depths during each hydraulic scenario during s1 and s2 depths were slightly under calculated and s3 depths were over calculated differences in depths were 2 mm which was comparable to configuration 1 though the differences were slightly larger when parking spaces were added to the flood plain similarly errors in depths increased in relation to increasing q1 inflow for s1 and s2 for s3 errors in depths were related to q3 inflow conditions the error in depths during s1 were the smallest in all hydraulic scenarios as seen in the previous street profile when identifying location p2 depths during t10 t11 and t12 were within 0 88 mm 0 99 mm and 1 10 mm respectively s2 also saw underestimated depths at p2 depths during t13 t14 and t15 were within 1 10 mm 1 20 mm and 1 77 mm correspondingly depths during s3 where pipe inflow dominated flows increased with increasing inflow at p2 depths were within 1 33 mm during t16 1 36 mm during t17 and 1 54 mm during t18 3 5 results of velocity fields for surface

appendix d 1 d 2 d 3 and d 4 for g32 longitudinal flows nrmse ranged from between 0 06 and 0 146 transversal flows had slightly higher error they ranged from between 0 08 and 0 183 similarly all tests were significant with r2 0 923 g16 had larger errors nrmse for longitudinal flows ranged between 0 069 and 0 147 and transversal flow error ranged between 0 090 and 0 201 3 7 results of velocity fields for configuration 1 analysis area 2 the agreement between the observed and simulated velocities from analysis area 2 are shown in table 13 and in appendix c 5 c 6 c 7 and c 8 the distances from the manhole centre are shown in each the results show that the lower resolution grid g32 had less error than the higher resolution grid g16 longitudinal flow had smaller error than transversal flows velocity error also increased the nearer to the grid centre 3 7 1 calibration in the calibrated model within g32 the nrmse ranged between 0 057 and 0 114 for longitudinal velocity fields and for transversal velocity fields ranged between 0 075 and 0 125 errors were slightly larger for the higher resolution data set ranges of nrmse were between 0 064 and 0 133 for longitudinal velocity fields and between 0 099 and 0 183 for transversal velocity fields r2 values were 0 816 and all tests were significant 3 7 2 validation the validated model using g32 showed a range of nrmse ranging between 0 048 and 0 109 for longitudinal velocity fields and for transversal velocity fields it ranged between 0 054 and 0 123 r2 values were 0 792 similarly these errors increased in the higher resolution grid ranges of nrmse were between 0 052 and 0 123 for longitudinal velocity fields and between 0 069 and 0 174 for transversal velocity fields r2 values in the validated data set were 0 727 table 13 shows the error with regards to their distance to the centre of the flood plain similarly velocity errors increased the nearest to the centre of the flood plain 3 8 results of velocity fields for configuration 2 analysis area 2 3 8 1 validation the results show that less error occurred with increasing distance from the manhole see table 14 for g32 nrmse ranged between 0 052 and 0 125 for longitudinal flows and between 0 067 and 0 145 for lateral flows multiple r2 values were also high 0 909 for g16 nrmse for longitudinal flows ranged between 0 060 and 0 137 and between 0 081 and 0 227 for transversal flows table 13 shows that error increased with decreasing distance from the grid centre these results are plotted in figs d 5 d 8 in appendix d like configuration 1 the results show that for configuration 2 errors increased with increasing inflows this error increased when under surcharge conditions for example tests being conducted under s1 and s2 had less error than tests under s3 along similar lines the higher resolution grid also had larger error than the lower resolution grid 3 9 results of velocity fields of configuration 2 analysis area 3 3 9 1 validation these results show the velocity field error for analysis area 3 which was situated inside a parking space they are illustrated in table 15 below and figs d 9 d 12 in appendix d the results suggest that the model outcome was acceptable as the nrmse was below the 30 limit and r2 was high 0 979 the results suggest that nrmse ranged between 0 09 and 0 177 for longitudinal flows and for transversal flows it ranged between 0 111 and 0 215 in g32 for g16 nrmse ranged between 0 098 and 0 182 for longitudinal flows and for transversal error ranged between 0 115 and 0 225 4 discussion 4 1 manhole exchange pipe and surface flows as flow rates in the model increased the model performance decreased for example during s1 and s2 the inflow at q1 dominated the flow conditions this meant that as the inflow increased so did the simulated error along the same lines this was apparent for s3 where the model was influenced by q3 input flows this meant that the error of s3 increased with increasing q3 inflows errors in the manhole exchange pipe and surface flows were higher in configuration 2 than configuration 1 similarly this is very likely to do with the increased complexity of the floodplain plus calibration took place using a lower spatial resolution throughout the hydraulic testing scenarios the numerical model overestimated manhole exchange for all scenarios this meant that the model either overestimated pipe outflow or overestimated surface outflow for s1 and s2 simulated pipe outflow q4 was greater in the numerical model than the experimental datasets as a result 2d overland flow was smaller than observed values under these scenarios along similar lines for s3 over calculated surcharged flow meant that pipe outflows were smaller in the numerical model than the experimental datasets such errors have been experienced in previous studies for example fraga et al 2017 found that their model over estimated surcharge by 2 which is slightly in better agreement than the model in the present study rubinato et al 2017 calibrated their flood model under steady flow conditions and found that their model over estimated unsteady surcharge flow rates this occurred due to turbulent conditions created by unsteady flows in the present study the manhole exchange error comes to pass due to s1 and s2 being heavily influenced by q1 inflow whereas s3 is determined by q3 pipe inflow 4 2 surface depths the errors of simulated surface depths increased with increasing flow rate this was also greater in configuration 2 when compared to configuration 1 differences in depths were 2 mm for all depth locations during the three hydraulic testing scenarios this is consistent to other studies rubinato et al 2016 had a l 3 mm disparity after changing downstream boundary conditions adjusting a weir when modelling depths around a manhole similarly martins et al 2017 had a range of depths just above 2 mm when validating 2d shock capturing flood models around a surcharging manhole the results from the present study suggest manhole exchange dynamics are attributable to changes in surface depths for example during s1 and s2 q1 inflow influenced the flow at qe and q2 for both scenarios the results confirm that there was more error at depth locations with higher q1 inflow these results are consistent with a previous study for example martins et al 2017 found that higher q1 increased the variation in depths the biggest depth discrepancy in their study came from p2 as this point is upstream of the manhole this meant that this location was most effected by overland inflow during the present study we conclude that p2 was also strongly affected by q1 during s1 and s2 though most error came from depth location p3 which is situated downstream of the manhole during s3 depths were slightly overestimated this was due to pipe inflow at q3 dominating discharges through the manhole and over the flood plain thus during simulation the manhole magnified this exchange similarly the variation in depths increased at each location with higher inflows at q3 this meant that model error increased with increasing q3 in the current study depths were related to the dominate boundary inflow depths during s1 and s2 increased with increasing q1 and s3 was increased with q3 the variation of depths also increased with the increasing inflow boundary though the results do indicate that there was a stable and balanced flow during the simulations which is agreeable with many of the observed values in the observed data p1 had a greater depth than p5 under s3 even though the locations were the same distance from the manhole this was due to p1 being closer to the boundary wall of the physical model this changes the wave reflections of the flow causing some parts of the 2d surface to have greater depths than others the numerical model was able to replicate this well this is seen by the relationship between the depth trends and qe flow exchange in both the observed and simulated results this has been accurately replicated in other numerical modelling studies for example in the work of kesserwani et al 2015 the authors found that depths increased at p1 and p5 with increasing qe p1 also had a greater depth than p5 due to the geometry of the model 4 3 velocity fields analysis area 1 for configuration 1 the results show that for longitudinal flows in g32 model performance decreased with increasing inflows surface flows and depths were underestimated during s1 and s2 as discussed in the exchange flow results above this meant that velocities were also slightly under calculated for s3 the opposite occurred as flows were over calculated longitudinal flows had more error than transversal flows this meant that the model performed better in flows that were more directional and less turbulent as seen in cross flows along similar lines an increase in error was directly linked to inflow conditions velocity error increased with increasing q1 inflow for s1 and s2 for s3 velocity error increased with q3 inflow the model did not perform as well with the validated higher resolution grid albeit the modelling outcome was considered good the highest nrmse in g16 was 19 2 which is well within the acceptable model performance percentage 30 this agrees to other outcomes for example in the works of willis et al 2019 they found that increasing errors can occur in higher resolution data sets due to an increase in model complexity during configuration 2 the model performance also decreased with increasing inflows which mirrored configuration 1 results due to surface flows and depths being under calculated for s1 and s2 this meant that velocities were also under simulated q1 inflow was responsible for these errors s3 had higher simulated velocities due to over simulated flows and depths due to q3 inflows for g16 the highest nrmse was during lateral flows under t18 20 1 yet this still was still below the acceptable limit 30 the model performed less accurately 26 7 error in analysis area 1 during surcharge conditions in the higher resolution grid this was at a range of 125 mm to the manhole centre during t18 which was consistent to the first street profile 4 4 velocity fields analysis area 2 and 3 model performance improved the further away velocities were recorded from the manhole for example the model performed better in analysis area 2 than 1 this is due to the manhole being a more complex area to simulate as verified in other works martins et al 2018 willis et al 2019 shrestha et al 2022 similarly model performance improved in longitudinal flows than transversal as they were more dominant and less complex as seen in analysis area 1 model performance also decreased in the higher resolution dataset the highest nrmse during surcharge at g16 was 18 3 which is well within the he acceptable model performance percentage 30 out of all velocity field analysis locations model performance in analysis area 3 was the lowest this was likely the most complex region to simulate velocity fields in configuration 2 here flows were more turbulent similarly longitudinal velocity field performance was greater than transversal velocity fields and the performance of the model decreased with increasing spatial resolution which was likely to do with the model being calibrated in a lower resolution 4 5 spatial resolution calibration and computational time trade off the key debate that this paper covers is model performance and the associated errors with regards to increasing inflows and surface complexities the keys findings found that model performance did decrease with increasing pipe and surface inflows spatial resolution of the 2d surfaces used and when parking spaces were introduced also the model performed better in the calibrated lower resolution grids model error linked to numerical complexity has been discussed in previous research for example mateo et al 2017 willis et al 2019 kim et al 2021 the authors found that if parameter calibrations are conducted in lower spatial resolution model performance can decrease when the resolution is increased in future simulations though this uncertainty is far less when flows are less complex they argue that simplified models can be just as useful as more complicated models which agrees with the present paper these differences are likely to be reduced through the calibration process meaning that calibration should take place using the highest resolution possible however one could also argue that there is a trade off between resolution and computational times this is something that the modeller needs to consider for themselves for example table 2 illustrates that in the higher resolution grid computational times were about twice as long than the lower resolution grid therefore we argue that we found it acceptable in our example to use a lower resolution model as errors were not large enough to reduce model performance enough and simulations were far less time consuming 4 6 limitations of study the biggest limitation of this study is that it only looked at two hypothetical street profiles that were both relatively simple therefore the differences in errors were quite small between each configuration and opposing resolution it is proposed that future work may look at creating more obstacles on the floodplain this may resemble street furniture in the real world for example benches plant containers or curbs another important point to consider is that this study only looked at mike urban as the modelling software and made no comparison with any other it is hypothesised that if this work was carried out in a similar commercial package e g info works the results would be similar as both mike and info works use shallow water equations and finite volume numerical schemes though results maybe slightly different if using uim chen et al 2007 as uim uses diffusive wave equations and a finite difference numerical scheme 5 conclusion the need to understand the accuracy of 2d velocity fields across flooded urban surfaces has motivated this research water facilities such as the one used in this study are a useful way to obtain high resolution data yet calibrating high resolution models can be computationally demanding therefore it may be necessary to initially calibrate flood models in lower resolutions reducing simulation times to increase the accuracy of flood models after calibration it is possible to increase spatial resolution this allows for a more detailed investigation of inundation over an area paying closer attention to small streams and narrow flow conduits yet error is likely to increase from the elevated model complexity as such this paper analysed this process by comparing high resolution data sets collected from a water laboratory with a numerical model the level of complexity was increased within two hypothetical street profiles to assess if it could influence the performance of the numerical simulations the model was calibrated before spatial resolution was increased this study suggests that hydrodynamic 1d 2d models with a lower spatial resolution may still be appropriate for modelling urban inundation this is because computational times are reduced and errors may still be acceptable our findings provide a valuable understanding of urban flooding scenarios using a high spatial resolution experimental dataset we conclude that the data set is reproducible for future studies and is suitable for the calibration and validation of other current numerical models the model was able to replicate highly accurate flows surface depths and velocities when compared to the physical experimental data sets model error increased with increasing inflows similarly error increased when the spatial resolution became finer due to the model being calibrated in the less complex system the conclusions can be simplified as follows in both configurations model performance flows depths and velocity fields decreased with increasing pipe and surface inflows model performance decreased in the finer spatial resolution due to calibration taking place with a courser resolution velocity field error increased with decreasing distance to the manhole and grid centre configuration 1 where model performance was improved validated flow errors were 7 9 validated surface depth errors were 5 6 validated velocity field errors were 19 2 configuration 2 where model performance was reduced due to parking spaces being added validated flow errors were 8 2 validated

1977,depth to water table dwt in shallow groundwater affects land salinization ecological system irrigation scheduling and agriculture output few researches have however focused on the impact of the complex transient dynamics of precipitation and evapotranspiration on the behavior of dwt in shallow groundwater this study proposes a one dimensional dwt model driven by complex multi periodic precipitation and evapotranspiration coupling the boussinesq equation with the averianov formula the model is calibrated using multi modes truncated fourier series against 1 d data from the field experiment in guanzhong basin shaanxi province china the experiment shields lateral groundwater flow effectively to ensure an accurate measurement of the effect of precipitation and evapotranspiration on dwt in the vertical direction results of the study show that fluctuations of dwt are driven by multi periodic evapotranspiration and precipitation primarily in the long wave components because the high frequency precipitation and evapotranspiration are essentially filtered out when they propagate through unsaturated zones this result beneficial for future studies on dwt via the fourier series in particular the calibrated model can quickly determine the dwt of guanzhong basin site predict dwt in the short term and simulate the dynamic change of groundwater level the vegetation in the study area besides although the calibrated parameters cannot be directly applied to other sites they may be useful to the prediction of the dwt fluctuations in the sites keywords depth to water table the averianov formula fourier series multi modes approximation composite simpson formula parameter calibration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the depth to water table dwt affects soil moisture and salinity which impact plant diversity irrigation scheduling and agricultural output jin et al 2019 bennett et al 2009 xing et al 2013 the rising dwt in arid and semi arid shallow aquifers in particular indirectly causes soil salinization and ultimately destroys plant diversity tilman et al 2002 dwt is also vital for the irrigation system i e irrigation scheduling should be adjusted according to dwt siebert et al 2010 mi et al 2020 moreover dwt can affect agricultural output by affecting the distribution of water contents of soil and the efficiency of water utilization singh et al 2010 because of broad impacts of dwt researchers have been concerned with the causality of the dwt change jiang et al 2017 2018 for example after studying the dangila well field of upper kliti river ethiopia yenehun et al 2018 found that precipitation directly caused the groundwater level to rise zhai et al 2021 studied the variation of dwt in the yinbei irrigation area in china using a water balance approach their results showed that evapotranspiration was the dominating factor in regulating the shallow groundwater depth of the yinbei irrigation area and a large amount of evapotranspiration reduced the rise of the water level in arid and semi arid areas groundwater is commonly shallow and the evapotranspiration is intense causing salinity to rise and accumulate at the surface salinizing the soil zhou and wang 2019 therefore studying evapotranspiration in these areas is of great practical significance as one of the major mathematical models describing the relation between evapotranspiration and dwt the averianov formula was proposed based on the concept of extinction dwt averianov 1956 schoeller 1961 this formula has been widely used for example by simplifying the relation as linear i e choosing n as 1 in the averianov formula mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mcdonald and harbaugh 1996 developed an evapotranspiration subpackage to modflow chen et al 2020 simulated the effect of groundwater evapotranspiration on dwt during groundwater pumping using the linear relation guo et al 2021 developed a model by coupling the averianov formula to the boussinesq equation using the linear relation and derived a quasi analytical solution of the dwt equation using the fourier series when considering the trend of transient fluctuations in evapotranspiration and precipitation many studies described their seasonal behaviors over time using sinusoidal periodic functions jasechko et al 2014 gnann et al 2020 de la casa and nasello 2010 2012 in particular de la casa et al 2018 modeled the precipitation sequence as a simple sinusoidal function of time soylu et al 2012 described the seasonal variation in evapotranspiration by sinusoidal functions with different frequencies czikowsky and fitzjarrald 2004 also approximated the amplitude and phase of the daily flow fluctuations caused by evapotranspiration using sinusoidal functions guo et al 2021 used single period functions for evapotranspiration and precipitation to study the driving mechanism of dwt by evapotranspiration and precipitation revealing the effect of amplitude and phase of evapotranspiration and precipitation on dwt most studies have considered only single period variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration and few treat evapotranspiration and precipitation as the result of a temporal multi period composite this study uses multi modes truncated fourier series to approximate the temporal multi period composite evapotranspiration and precipitation data collected in guanzhong basin shaanxi province china the solutions of the model are obtained from the combination of the high order simpson s numerical integration and duhamel s formula for a linear ordinary differential equation s solution by minimizing the discrepancy between the analytical solution of the dwt model in the linear regime and the experimental data we calibrated the model parameters with respect to the various approximate representations of the observed data the dwt is predominantly impacted by the long wave seasonal evapotranspiration and precipitation data the model is then used to make predictions for dwt in the short time 2 the dwt model driven by evapotranspiration and precipitation 2 1 conceptual model assuming the uniform recharge and uniform water table we develop a one dimensional in the vertical direction dwt model driven by precipitation and evapotranspiration fig 1 it consists of a vadose zone and a saturated zone to precisely give an explicit expression describing the driving mechanism of precipitation and evapotranspiration on dwt we propose a spatially homogeneous one dimensional time dependent ordinary differential equation ode model in homogeneous and isotropic aquifers the boussinesq equation boussinesq 1872 is used to model groundwater flow bear 1972 1 μ h t h x kh h x q where μ is the specific yield x is the horizontal distance l t is time t h is the relative groundwater level l k is the hydraulic conductivity l t 1 q is the net groundwater recharge rate l t 1 we assume that the aquifer is a uniform medium spatially homogeneous in the horizontal direction with a flat water table in which lateral flow is negligible i e 2 h x 0 substituting eq 2 into eq 1 we have 3 μ h t q noticing that 4 h 0 h d where h 0 is the level of the ground surface at a fixed value l and d is the depth to water table dwt l as shown in fig 1 from eqs 1 2 3 and 4 we obtained 5 μ dd dt q in shallow groundwater systems the thickness of the unsaturated zone is limited and both precipitation and evapotranspiration affect the groundwater recharge the net recharge rate can be expressed as follow in this circumstance zhou and wang 2019 6 q p t e δ t where e δ t is the actual evapotranspiration rate l t 1 and p t is the actual precipitation rate l t 1 not all precipitation infiltrates the soil and only a part of it becomes a source of groundwater recharge rising the ground water level based on preliminary literature surveys we found that the linear relationship between infiltration rate and precipitation rate has been applied and satisfactory and reasonable results have been obtained dunne et al 1991 jannat et al 2014 park and parker 2008 renger et al 1986 as a result we assume that the precipitation infiltration recharge rate is λ 2 p t λ 2 is the ratio of precipitation infiltration recharge 0 λ 2 1 combining eq 5 and eq 6 we have 7 μ dd dt e δ t λ 2 p t soylu et al 2011 proposed that the actual evapotranspiration included a nonlinear relationship with the dwt which can be expressed as 8 e δ t e min t e c t where e min t is the minimum evapotranspiration rate l t 1 e c t is the contribution of groundwater for evapotranspiration l t 1 the ratio of the minimum evapotranspiration rate to the potential evapotranspiration rate can be roughly regarded as a constant 9 e min t λ 1 e 0 t where λ 1 yields the weight of the potential evapotranspiration when the water table is significantly deep 0 λ 1 1 e 0 t is the potential evapotranspiration rate l t 1 the contribution of groundwater to the evapotranspiration rate can then be expressed as a function of the dwt 10 e c t e 0 t 1 λ 1 g d where g d is an empirical formula for the evapotranspiration of groundwater guo et al 2021 commonly used potential evapotranspiration empirical formulas include index formula ye et al 1982 hyperbolic formula shen 1985 potential evapotranspiration empirical formula lei et al 1982 and averianov empirical formula averianov 1956 the averianov empirical formula is convenient for establishing the model of evapotranspiration precipitation driven dwt and this study adopts it 11 g d 1 d d

only the situation where the dwt is not zero and less than the aquifer s thickness is considered in the study in summary the model for evapotranspiration and precipitation driving dwt is given as follows 13 μ dd dt e 0 t λ 1 1 λ 1 1 d d max n λ 2 p t 0 d d max where λ 1 yields the weight of the potential evapotranspiration when the water table is significantly deep 0 λ 1 1 μ is the specific

p and the number of fourier series modes m are vital variables for the numerical solutions of dwt specifically the fluctuation of d t is driven by multi frequency evapotranspiration and precipitation in eq 26 when the value of m is small the fourier series mainly captures the overall trends of precipitation and evapotranspiration while m large the fourier series adds high frequency fluctuations to the trends reflecting the small scale fluctuation details of precipitation and evapotranspiration plus trends although larger m could obtain more accurate approximation of precipitation and evapotranspiration it does not mean that eq 26 could capture the fluctuation of d t more precisely because the high frequency signals of precipitation and evapotranspiration are filtered out when they propagate through the unsaturated zones and they do not appear in d t for this reason seeking a proper value of m to yield the optimal d t is a critical task in model calibration 2 4 model assessment we now have a numerical model in quadrature from duhamel s formula in terms of the model parameters for any given observed precipitation and evapotranspiration data we can calibrate the model parameters by minimizing the differences between the numerical model and the observed data then we use the calibrated model to make predictions to quantitatively assess the fitting and prediction by the model we use the coefficient of determination r 2 the mean absolute percent error mape and the root mean square error rmse as metrics which are defined as follows 27 r 2 i 1 n d t i d d t i d 2 i 1 n d t i d 2 i 1 n d t i d 2 28 mape 1 n i 1 n d t i d t i d t i 100 29 rmse 1 n i 1 n d t i d t i 2 where d t i is the smoothed observed data value at time t i d t i is the computed solution of the model at time t i from the solution of the model d is the mean value of the smoothed observed data values d is the mean value of the computed solution values n is the number of the observed data points the r 2 is a measure of statistical model goodness which ranges from 0 to 1 the closer to 1 the better the model performs okkan et al 2021 the values of mape and rmse are all ranging from 0 to the smaller the values are the better the model is an et al 2020 specifically mape is a commonly used prediction accuracy measure swanson et al 2011 since the percentage error is independent of scale it can compare the verification performance of different datasets 3 description of experimental site and data acquisition the dwt model describes a one dimensional and vertical fluctuation process of dwt driven by precipitation and evapotranspiration which does not consider lateral groundwater flow to obtain the data of dwt without lateral groundwater flow to calibrate and verify the model we design and construct a piece of experimental equipment specifically we use a lysimeter located in the guanzhong basin china 34 22 14 n 108 54 11 e fig 2 as our experimental apparatus to collect the observed data a glass fiber reinforced plastic bucket installed in the field could shield lateral groundwater flow and observe the dwt in the one dimensional vertical direction driven by precipitation and evapotranspiration fig 3 the annual precipitation in the area is around 590 mm year and the annual evapotranspiration of about 961 mm year wang et al 2018 zuo et al 2011 the lysimeter has a surface area of 1 m2 and a depth of 800 mm the lysimeter is filled with sandy soil taken from the mu us desert in northwest of china at the bottom of the lysimeter a water table is maintained in a gravel filter to mimic the presence of an underlying aquifer the initial water table depth is about 0 4 m we use di271 ctd diver van essen instruments delft netherlands to measure the dynamics of groundwater level in the lysimeter in addition we use diver di500 van essen instruments delft netherlands to observe the air pressure for calibrating the groundwater levels due to the variation of atmospheric pressure a weather station is built in the research area from the lysimeter in less than 10 m measuring precipitation air temperature wind speed net radiation and relative humidity all data is recorded every 5 min based on the data we acquire average daily evapotranspiration data from november 2 2016 to october 31 2017 correspondingly precipitation data adopted the daily precipitation data from the observation station during the same period fig 4 4 results and discussions 4 1 data processing the observed data were divided into two parts the first part includes 70 of the data from november 2 2016 to may 31 2017 total 211 days and it is used for calibrating the model parameters calibration period and the second part is the remaining 30 from june 1 2017 to august 30 2017 total 92 days for verification the verification period the moving average method the moving average filter with window width of 30 days in matlab was used to preprocess the data for the first 211 days see fig 4 this procedure eliminates the external noise and captures the large scale trend of evapotranspiration and precipitation in the long wave regime guanzhong basin in shaanxi province is located in the central latitude region with four distinct seasons hot summer and cold winter spring is from march to may summer is from june to august autumn is from september to november and winter is from december to february affected by temperature the distribution of evapotranspiration is uneven during the year and gradually increases in march with the annual evapotranspiration being the strongest in summer and the weakest in winter nie and qu 2018 due to the east asian monsoon precipitation is rare in winter and rainy in early spring and summer zheng et al 2011 4 2 dwt solution with 2 mode truncated fourier series approximation to evapotranspiration and precipitation we approximate the smoothed precipitation and evapotranspiration data for the first part using 2 mode truncated fourier series with the curve fitting toolbox in matlab i e fig 5 the harmonic representations of evapotranspiration and precipitation time variation are described by 30 f t a 0 j α 1 2 a α j cos α ω j t b α j sin α ω j t where a 0 j a α j b α j α 1 2 j e p are fourier coefficients and ω j is the angular frequency of precipitation p and evapotranspiration e given in table 1 substituting the fitted fourier series into eq 21 we have the governing equation with a specified evapotranspiration and precipitation driving term approximated using the 2 mode truncated fourier series the dwt solution is given by duhamel s formula and evaluated using composite simpson numerical integration the composite simpson s formula is applied to each term in the above sum as presented in eqs 23 24 and 25 we then divide the interval of t k 1 t k into 2 intervals each with a step size h 1 2 in eq 24 t 0 1 t s t t 2 3 212 t k t k 1 1 k 1 2 s subsequently the solution of dwt with any given hydrogeological parameters μ β λ 2 are given by the approximated duhamel s formula to calibrate the model to minimize the error between the solution and the smoothed observed data we define an objective function or loss function using the least squares we use the lsqnonlin function a nonlinear least square solver in matlab to minimize loss function 31 l t μ β λ 2 i 2 212 d t i d t i 2 where d t i is the approximated solution value at time t i d t i is the smoothed observational value at time t i μ β λ 2 represent the hydrogeological parameters that to be determined the optimized parameters set are 32 β 0 0014 μ 0 0568 λ 2 0 3854 subsequently we use the optimized approximated solution to predict the dwt for the remaining period i e the verification period see fig 6 the model performance metrics of r 2 m a p e and rmse are presented in table 2 fig 6 shows that the calibrated during the calibration period and verified curve during the verification period match the observed data very well except for a part from mid may to early july the results also reflect that the numerical solution is consistent with the observed data during calibration and verification periods meanwhile table 2 shows that the results of approximating dwt in calibration and verified periods are excellent with r 2 0 7594 and r 2 0 8090 respectively furthermore the mape values are 4 58 and 7 86 respectively and rmse values are all 31 20 the performance metrics in table 2 indicate that the model is satisfactory the under performance period i e mid may to early july is mainly due to the limitation of the experimental equipment the experimental apparatus is a glass fiber reinforced plastic bucket filled with soil with limited water storage capacity during the rainy season the fluctuation of dwt is sharp which causes large uncertainty of dwt as shown in fig 6 frequent rain events in april caused precipitation accumulation in the apparatus until mid may large amounts of water storage capacity of the apparatus are consumed when dwt is sensitive to precipitation and fluctuates sharply this problem explains unsatisfactory dwt fitting during mid may and early july 4 3 dwt solution with high mode truncated fourier series approximation to evapotranspiration and precipitation in eq 26 illustrates that the low mode e g 2 mode truncated fourier series approximation of evapotranspiration and precipitation captures their overall trends the high mode truncated fourier series approximation can add more high frequency fluctuations to the trends reflecting the small fluctuation details of precipitation and evapotranspiration plus the trends although high mode truncated fourier series approximation could yield a more accurate approximation of precipitation and evapotranspiration it does not mean that it could capture the fluctuation of d t because the high frequency signals of precipitation and evapotranspiration are filtered out when they travel through unsaturated zones and do not show up in d t in other words seeking a proper value of m to obtain an optimal d t is a necessary step in model calibration we apply 4 mode 6 mode and 8 mode truncated fourier series to approximate precipitation and evapotranspiration as shown in fig 7 the specific fourier coefficients are listed in appendix a tables a1 a2 and a3 the specific fourier coefficients in appendix a show that although the high frequency fourier series expansion term is overlayed during the calibration comparing with the low frequency fourier coefficients the high frequency ones are relatively small based on the approximation we obtained the solution of dwt in fig 8 the model performance metrics are presented in table 3 fig 7 shows that 4 mode 6 mode and 8 mode truncated fourier series approximation to evapotranspiration and precipitation capture more small periodic fluctuations than 2 mode in fig 5 the higher mode truncated fourier series approximation can reflect more small scale fluctuation of evapotranspiration and precipitation the signals of evapotranspiration and precipitation propagate the unsaturated zone reach the saturated zone and cause dwt variation they decay as they travel down to dwt and their high frequency signals are filtered out fig 8 shows that dwt is barely affected by high frequency signals besides after including all modes the high frequency fourier coefficients become small and barely affect the fitting result consequently higher order approximation could hance the details of precipitation and evapotranspiration variations but it does not lead to higher resolution of the numerical solutions of dwt fig 8 illustrates that the numerical solution based on 4 mode truncated fourier series to approximate precipitation and evapotranspiration has better accuracy than others comparing the values of the performance metrics of the numerical solution of dwt based on 2 mode truncated fourier series in table 2 the performance metrics based on 4 mode 6 mode and 8 mode truncated fourier series in table 3 are better after comprehensive analyses we think the numerical solution of dwt based on 4 mode truncated fourier series are the best indicating that the dwt is mainly affected by long wave seasonal precipitation and evapotranspiration comparing the model parameters based on 2 mode truncated fourier series in eq 32 with the parameters based on 4 mode 6 mode and 8 mode truncated fourier series in table 4 one can see that β is the same to be 0 0014 and μ λ 2 are close which equal to 0 0574 and 0 3889 acquire by calculating the mean value respectively the facts demonstrate that the hydrological processes are stable after examining the geological conditions soil type and climate conditions of guanzhong basin we conclude that the value of the optimal parameter values derived from the fitting are representative in this study the lysimeter is filled with sandy soil taken from the mu us desert in northwest china which the parameter μ ranges from 0 0200 to 0 4000 morris and johnson 1967 hence the parameter μ calibrated in this paper is within the range on the other hand the sandy soil has large infiltration capacity and the precipitation infiltrates quickly with λ 2 value of 0 3889 which the value is well within the range of field observation zhang et al 2019 based on the two observed heavy rains of 62 and 42 8 mm day in field experiment site of mu us desert huang 2013 we calculate the infiltration capacity is 38 6 mm day meanwhile the maximum recorded precipitation is 31 7 mm day in guanzhong experimental site revealing that the maximum precipitation rate did not exceed the infiltration capacity it is likely to be that seldom runoff and depression storage occur so the parameter λ 2 can reflect the infiltration well β i e 1 λ 1 n d max is a comprehensive parameter defined by d max n and λ 1 the value reflects hydrogeological conditions including soil types and features of precipitation and evapotranspiration the dwt in the apparatus is shallow groundwater with range of 0 mm 800 mm restricting to the experimental apparatus and the d max is approximates 1000 mm gong et al 2020 our model is coupled from averianov empirical formula and parameter n is related to the type and structure of soil with ranges from 1 to 3 studies show that n is proportional to dwt ye et al 1982 considering the soil in mu us desert is sandy soil with a shallow groundwater table the empirical index n is close to 1 λ 1 is the ratio of minimum evapotranspiration intensity to potential evapotranspiration intensity however the dwt in guanzhong basin is shallow and most of the evapotranspiration comes from groundwater so the potential evapotranspiration is large and the value λ 1 is very small according to the ranges of above parameters the parameter value of β is reasonable 4 4 limitations and future research the limitations of this study are mainly in two aspects one is the linearization of the model the other is the constraint imposed by experimental equipment 1 the model is linearized to obtain an analytical solution for the dwt and the linear approximation works well in the current experiment apparatus the following numerical experiments can explain the linearization clearly we selected three different sets of d max and n values based on the local hydrogeological conditions as shown in table 5 and calculated n based on the β i e 1 λ 1 n d max the approximation effect of the linear g d i e 1 n d d max red solid line vs the original g d 1 d d max n blue dashed line is presented in fig 9 a b and c the numerical results show that the linearization with the original g d in all three cases has a correlation coefficient above 0 99 and the absolute error is less than 0 05 which indicates that the linear approximation works well in the current experiment apparatus specifically we found that in the case study the n value falls between 1 0 and 1 2 table 5 it stands to reason that when solving the model 1 d d max n can be approximated to 1 n d d max and the cost can be lessened a bit because d d max 1 is not a tight limitation in summary the linearization results are completely reasonable however the linearized model may not be applicable to all experimental sites only to areas with shallow groundwater although the calibrated parameter model can not be directly applied to the sites where the lateral groundwater flow does not exist or can be ignored it can be used as a tool to solve and predict dwt quickly 2 to calibrate the model we install a field experimental experiment in guanzhong basin shaanxi province china which isolates lateral groundwater flow and could only measure the effect of precipitation and evapotranspiration on the dwt in the vertical direction the applied observed data of dwt in this paper are all obtained from the experiment however there is also a limitation to the experimental experiment the experiment is a glass fiber reinforced plastic bucket filled with soil and the total height is only 800 mm consequently when heavy precipitation occurs it can not penetrate more than depth of 800 mm because the bottom of the apparatus is impermeable considering the groundwater level is more sensitive to precipitation and causes the dwt fluctuates sharply which affects the model performances this is why dwt s fitting and verification performances during mid may and early july fig 6 fig 8 are not so well as discussed above the fourier series is very suitable for solving wavelet transforms and it describes the temporal multi periodic composite characteristics well moreover the fourier series approximation with different truncated modes can capture the overall fluctuation trends and not ignore some small scale fluctuations more importantly this study could present very meaningful results that could provide a good model reference when studying the time dependent dynamics in dwt driven by precipitation and evapotranspiration in addition this study is applicable to regions where no lateral groundwater flow exists or the effects of lateral groundwater flow on dwt is negligible in future study we can consider the dynamic changes of dwt in the presence of lateral groundwater flow which is also a challenge furthermore we used traditional numerical methods to calibrate the model parameters in this study in the future machine learning and neural network methods can be considered to invert the model and further study the model s universality 5 conclusions this paper established a one dimensional model to quantify the transient multi periodic evapotranspiration and precipitation driven dwt dynamics the model is calibrated using essentially 1 d observed data collected from a field experimental experiment in guanzhong basin shaanxi province china which isolates lateral groundwater flows to provide accurate measurements of the effect of precipitation and evapotranspiration on dwt in the vertical direction the solution of the model in the linear regime is calculated using duhamel s formula coupled with the composite simpson numerical integration from this study the following conclusions are drawn 1 precipitation and evapotranspiration series with low mode truncated fourier series can capture the overall long scale trend while high mode truncated fourier series can capture the small scale variation plus a large scale trend although high mode truncated fourier series can capture the small scale fluctuation details plus trends of evapotranspiration and precipitation it may not simulate the fluctuation of dwt because the high frequency signals of precipitation and evapotranspiration are filtered out when they travel through the unsaturated zones 2 during calibrating the model with 2 4 6 and 8 modes truncated fourier series we found that the 4 mode truncated fourier series performed best the facts demonstrate that not the high mode truncated fourier series for fitting precipitation and evapotranspiration is optimal to the dwt simulation the calibrated model parameters are consistent with the local hydrogeological conditions the calibrated model can be used as a first cut tool to predict dwt quickly 3 composite simpson numerical integration enables us to solve the integration derived by the duhamel s formula accurately and obtain the analytical solution of dwt which helps us to determine the geological parameter values involved in the model 4 although field observation experiment by a glass fiber reinforced plastic bucket filled with soil could shield later groundwater flow and satisfy the condition of the averianov formula its water storage capacity is limited during rainy seasons the fluctuation of dwt is sharp in the apparatus which is a

1977,depth to water table dwt in shallow groundwater affects land salinization ecological system irrigation scheduling and agriculture output few researches have however focused on the impact of the complex transient dynamics of precipitation and evapotranspiration on the behavior of dwt in shallow groundwater this study proposes a one dimensional dwt model driven by complex multi periodic precipitation and evapotranspiration coupling the boussinesq equation with the averianov formula the model is calibrated using multi modes truncated fourier series against 1 d data from the field experiment in guanzhong basin shaanxi province china the experiment shields lateral groundwater flow effectively to ensure an accurate measurement of the effect of precipitation and evapotranspiration on dwt in the vertical direction results of the study show that fluctuations of dwt are driven by multi periodic evapotranspiration and precipitation primarily in the long wave components because the high frequency precipitation and evapotranspiration are essentially filtered out when they propagate through unsaturated zones this result beneficial for future studies on dwt via the fourier series in particular the calibrated model can quickly determine the dwt of guanzhong basin site predict dwt in the short term and simulate the dynamic change of groundwater level the vegetation in the study area besides although the calibrated parameters cannot be directly applied to other sites they may be useful to the prediction of the dwt fluctuations in the sites keywords depth to water table the averianov formula fourier series multi modes approximation composite simpson formula parameter calibration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the depth to water table dwt affects soil moisture and salinity which impact plant diversity irrigation scheduling and agricultural output jin et al 2019 bennett et al 2009 xing et al 2013 the rising dwt in arid and semi arid shallow aquifers in particular indirectly causes soil salinization and ultimately destroys plant diversity tilman et al 2002 dwt is also vital for the irrigation system i e irrigation scheduling should be adjusted according to dwt siebert et al 2010 mi et al 2020 moreover dwt can affect agricultural output by affecting the distribution of water contents of soil and the efficiency of water utilization singh et al 2010 because of broad impacts of dwt researchers have been concerned with the causality of the dwt change jiang et al 2017 2018 for example after studying the dangila well field of upper kliti river ethiopia yenehun et al 2018 found that precipitation directly caused the groundwater level to rise zhai et al 2021 studied the variation of dwt in the yinbei irrigation area in china using a water balance approach their results showed that evapotranspiration was the dominating factor in regulating the shallow groundwater depth of the yinbei irrigation area and a large amount of evapotranspiration reduced the rise of the water level in arid and semi arid areas groundwater is commonly shallow and the evapotranspiration is intense causing salinity to rise and accumulate at the surface salinizing the soil zhou and wang 2019 therefore studying evapotranspiration in these areas is of great practical significance as one of the major mathematical models describing the relation between evapotranspiration and dwt the averianov formula was proposed based on the concept of extinction dwt averianov 1956 schoeller 1961 this formula has been widely used for example by simplifying the relation as linear i e choosing n as 1 in the averianov formula mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mcdonald and harbaugh 1996 developed an evapotranspiration subpackage to modflow chen et al 2020 simulated the effect of groundwater evapotranspiration on dwt during groundwater pumping using the linear relation guo et al 2021 developed a model by coupling the averianov formula to the boussinesq equation using the linear relation and derived a quasi analytical solution of the dwt equation using the fourier series when considering the trend of transient fluctuations in evapotranspiration and precipitation many studies described their seasonal behaviors over time using sinusoidal periodic functions jasechko et al 2014 gnann et al 2020 de la casa and nasello 2010 2012 in particular de la casa et al 2018 modeled the precipitation sequence as a simple sinusoidal function of time soylu et al 2012 described the seasonal variation in evapotranspiration by sinusoidal functions with different frequencies czikowsky and fitzjarrald 2004 also approximated the amplitude and phase of the daily flow fluctuations caused by evapotranspiration using sinusoidal functions guo et al 2021 used single period functions for evapotranspiration and precipitation to study the driving mechanism of dwt by evapotranspiration and precipitation revealing the effect of amplitude and phase of evapotranspiration and precipitation on dwt most studies have considered only single period variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration and few treat evapotranspiration and precipitation as the result of a temporal multi period composite this study uses multi modes truncated fourier series to approximate the temporal multi period composite evapotranspiration and precipitation data collected in guanzhong basin shaanxi province china the solutions of the model are obtained from the combination of the high order simpson s numerical integration and duhamel s formula for a linear ordinary differential equation s solution by minimizing the discrepancy between the analytical solution of the dwt model in the linear regime and the experimental data we calibrated the model parameters with respect to the various approximate representations of the observed data the dwt is predominantly impacted by the long wave seasonal evapotranspiration and precipitation data the model is then used to make predictions for dwt in the short time 2 the dwt model driven by evapotranspiration and precipitation 2 1 conceptual model assuming the uniform recharge and uniform water table we develop a one dimensional in the vertical direction dwt model driven by precipitation and evapotranspiration fig 1 it consists of a vadose zone and a saturated zone to precisely give an explicit expression describing the driving mechanism of precipitation and evapotranspiration on dwt we propose a spatially homogeneous one dimensional time dependent ordinary differential equation ode model in homogeneous and isotropic aquifers the boussinesq equation boussinesq 1872 is used to model groundwater flow bear 1972 1 μ h t h x kh h x q where μ is the specific yield x is the horizontal distance l t is time t h is the relative groundwater level l k is the hydraulic conductivity l t 1 q is the net groundwater recharge rate l t 1 we assume that the aquifer is a uniform medium spatially homogeneous in the horizontal direction with a flat water table in which lateral flow is negligible i e 2 h x 0 substituting eq 2 into eq 1 we have 3 μ h t q noticing that 4 h 0 h d where h 0 is the level of the ground surface at a fixed value l and d is the depth to water table dwt l as shown in fig 1 from eqs 1 2 3 and 4 we obtained 5 μ dd dt q in shallow groundwater systems the thickness of the unsaturated zone is limited and both precipitation and evapotranspiration affect the groundwater recharge the net recharge rate can be expressed as follow in this circumstance zhou and wang 2019 6 q p t e δ t where e δ t is the actual evapotranspiration rate l t 1 and p t is the actual precipitation rate l t 1 not all precipitation infiltrates the soil and only a part of it becomes a source of groundwater recharge rising the ground water level based on preliminary literature surveys we found that the linear relationship between infiltration rate and precipitation rate has been applied and satisfactory and reasonable results have been obtained dunne et al 1991 jannat et al 2014 park and parker 2008 renger et al 1986 as a result we assume that the precipitation infiltration recharge rate is λ 2 p t λ 2 is the ratio of precipitation infiltration recharge 0 λ 2 1 combining eq 5 and eq 6 we have 7 μ dd dt e δ t λ 2 p t soylu et al 2011 proposed that the actual evapotranspiration included a nonlinear relationship with the dwt which can be expressed as 8 e δ t e min t e c t where e min t is the minimum evapotranspiration rate l t 1 e c t is the contribution of groundwater for evapotranspiration l t 1 the ratio of the minimum evapotranspiration rate to the potential evapotranspiration rate can be roughly regarded as a constant 9 e min t λ 1 e 0 t where λ 1 yields the weight of the potential evapotranspiration when the water table is significantly deep 0 λ 1 1 e 0 t is the potential evapotranspiration rate l t 1 the contribution of groundwater to the evapotranspiration rate can then be expressed as a function of the dwt 10 e c t e 0 t 1 λ 1 g d where g d is an empirical formula for the evapotranspiration of groundwater guo et al 2021 commonly used potential evapotranspiration empirical formulas include index formula ye et al 1982 hyperbolic formula shen 1985 potential evapotranspiration empirical formula lei et al 1982 and averianov empirical formula averianov 1956 the averianov empirical formula is convenient for establishing the model of evapotranspiration precipitation driven dwt and this study adopts it 11 g d 1 d d

only the situation where the dwt is not zero and less than the aquifer s thickness is considered in the study in summary the model for evapotranspiration and precipitation driving dwt is given as follows 13 μ dd dt e 0 t λ 1 1 λ 1 1 d d max n λ 2 p t 0 d d max where λ 1 yields the weight of the potential evapotranspiration when the water table is significantly deep 0 λ 1 1 μ is the specific

the precipitation rate l t 1 λ 2 is the ratio of precipitation infiltration recharge 0 λ 2 1 2 2 linear regime notice that a nonlinear relationship between evapotranspiration and the dwt exists when n 1 in view of practical problems when d is far less than d max d d max is a small quantity and 1 n d d max n can be approximated by 1 n d d max after neglecting the high order terms thus a linear approximation of eq 13 is given by 14 μ dd dt e 0 t λ 1 1 λ 1 1 nd d max λ 2 p t 0 d d max n it is valid in the regime d d max 1 to study the solution of eq 14 we nondimensionalize the equation the

t k 1 t k g τ d τ h 6 g t k 4 r 0 n 1 g t r 1 2 h 2 r 1 n 1 g t r g t k 1 where interval t k t k 1 was divided into n intervals each with a step size h t k t k 1 n from eqs 21 22 23 24 and 25 we obtained a analytical solution of d t as follows 26 d t exp β μ α 1 m 1 α ω e a α e sin α ω e t b α e cos α ω e t a α e sin α ω e t 0 b α e cos α ω e t 0 d 0 k 1 s 1 h 6 g t k 4 r 0 n 1 g t r 1 2 h 2

p and the number of fourier series modes m are vital variables for the numerical solutions of dwt specifically the fluctuation of d t is driven by multi frequency evapotranspiration and precipitation in eq 26 when the value of m is small the fourier series mainly captures the overall trends of precipitation and evapotranspiration while m large the fourier series adds high frequency fluctuations to the trends reflecting the small scale fluctuation details of precipitation and evapotranspiration plus trends although larger m could obtain more accurate approximation of precipitation and evapotranspiration it does not mean that eq 26 could capture the fluctuation of d t more precisely because the high frequency signals of precipitation and evapotranspiration are filtered out when they propagate through the unsaturated zones and they do not appear in d t for this reason seeking a proper value of m to yield the optimal d t is a critical task in model calibration 2 4 model assessment we now have a numerical model in quadrature from duhamel s formula in terms of the model parameters for any given observed precipitation and evapotranspiration data we can calibrate the model parameters by minimizing the differences between the numerical model and the observed data then we use the calibrated model to make predictions to quantitatively assess the fitting and prediction by the model we use the coefficient of determination r 2 the mean absolute percent error mape and the root mean square error rmse as metrics which are defined as follows 27 r 2 i 1 n d t i d d t i d 2 i 1 n d t i d 2 i 1 n d t i d 2 28 mape 1 n i 1 n d t i d t i d t i 100 29 rmse 1 n i 1 n d t i d t i 2 where d t i is the smoothed observed data value at time t i d t i is the computed solution of the model at time t i from the solution of the model d is the mean value of the smoothed observed data values d is the mean value of the computed solution values n is the number of the observed data points the r 2 is a measure of statistical model goodness which ranges from 0 to 1 the closer to 1 the better the model performs okkan et al 2021 the values of mape and rmse are all ranging from 0 to the smaller the values are the better the model is an et al 2020 specifically mape is a commonly used prediction accuracy measure swanson et al 2011 since the percentage error is independent of scale it can compare the verification performance of different datasets 3 description of experimental site and data acquisition the dwt model describes a one dimensional and vertical fluctuation process of dwt driven by precipitation and evapotranspiration which does not consider lateral groundwater flow to obtain the data of dwt without lateral groundwater flow to calibrate and verify the model we design and construct a piece of experimental equipment specifically we use a lysimeter located in the guanzhong basin china 34 22 14 n 108 54 11 e fig 2 as our experimental apparatus to collect the observed data a glass fiber reinforced plastic bucket installed in the field could shield lateral groundwater flow and observe the dwt in the one dimensional vertical direction driven by precipitation and evapotranspiration fig 3 the annual precipitation in the area is around 590 mm year and the annual evapotranspiration of about 961 mm year wang et al 2018 zuo et al 2011 the lysimeter has a surface area of 1 m2 and a depth of 800 mm the lysimeter is filled with sandy soil taken from the mu us desert in northwest of china at the bottom of the lysimeter a water table is maintained in a gravel filter to mimic the presence of an underlying aquifer the initial water table depth is about 0 4 m we use di271 ctd diver van essen instruments delft netherlands to measure the dynamics of groundwater level in the lysimeter in addition we use diver di500 van essen instruments delft netherlands to observe the air pressure for calibrating the groundwater levels due to the variation of atmospheric pressure a weather station is built in the research area from the lysimeter in less than 10 m measuring precipitation air temperature wind speed net radiation and relative humidity all data is recorded every 5 min based on the data we acquire average daily evapotranspiration data from november 2 2016 to october 31 2017 correspondingly precipitation data adopted the daily precipitation data from the observation station during the same period fig 4 4 results and discussions 4 1 data processing the observed data were divided into two parts the first part includes 70 of the data from november 2 2016 to may 31 2017 total 211 days and it is used for calibrating the model parameters calibration period and the second part is the remaining 30 from june 1 2017 to august 30 2017 total 92 days for verification the verification period the moving average method the moving average filter with window width of 30 days in matlab was used to preprocess the data for the first 211 days see fig 4 this procedure eliminates the external noise and captures the large scale trend of evapotranspiration and precipitation in the long wave regime guanzhong basin in shaanxi province is located in the central latitude region with four distinct seasons hot summer and cold winter spring is from march to may summer is from june to august autumn is from september to november and winter is from december to february affected by temperature the distribution of evapotranspiration is uneven during the year and gradually increases in march with the annual evapotranspiration being the strongest in summer and the weakest in winter nie and qu 2018 due to the east asian monsoon precipitation is rare in winter and rainy in early spring and summer zheng et al 2011 4 2 dwt solution with 2 mode truncated fourier series approximation to evapotranspiration and precipitation we approximate the smoothed precipitation and evapotranspiration data for the first part using 2 mode truncated fourier series with the curve fitting toolbox in matlab i e fig 5 the harmonic representations of evapotranspiration and precipitation time variation are described by 30 f t a 0 j α 1 2 a α j cos α ω j t b α j sin α ω j t where a 0 j a α j b α j α 1 2 j e p are fourier coefficients and ω j is the angular frequency of precipitation p and evapotranspiration e given in table 1 substituting the fitted fourier series into eq 21 we have the governing equation with a specified evapotranspiration and precipitation driving term approximated using the 2 mode truncated fourier series the dwt solution is given by duhamel s formula and evaluated using composite simpson numerical integration the composite simpson s formula is applied to each term in the above sum as presented in eqs 23 24 and 25 we then divide the interval of t k 1 t k into 2 intervals each with a step size h 1 2 in eq 24 t 0 1 t s t t 2 3 212 t k t k 1 1 k 1 2 s subsequently the solution of dwt with any given hydrogeological parameters μ β λ 2 are given by the approximated duhamel s formula to calibrate the model to minimize the error between the solution and the smoothed observed data we define an objective function or loss function using the least squares we use the lsqnonlin function a nonlinear least square solver in matlab to minimize loss function 31 l t μ β λ 2 i 2 212 d t i d t i 2 where d t i is the approximated solution value at time t i d t i is the smoothed observational value at time t i μ β λ 2 represent the hydrogeological parameters that to be determined the optimized parameters set are 32 β 0 0014 μ 0 0568 λ 2 0 3854 subsequently we use the optimized approximated solution to predict the dwt for the remaining period i e the verification period see fig 6 the model performance metrics of r 2 m a p e and rmse are presented in table 2 fig 6 shows that the calibrated during the calibration period and verified curve during the verification period match the observed data very well except for a part from mid may to early july the results also reflect that the numerical solution is consistent with the observed data during calibration and verification periods meanwhile table 2 shows that the results of approximating dwt in calibration and verified periods are excellent with r 2 0 7594 and r 2 0 8090 respectively furthermore the mape values are 4 58 and 7 86 respectively and rmse values are all 31 20 the performance metrics in table 2 indicate that the model is satisfactory the under performance period i e mid may to early july is mainly due to the limitation of the experimental equipment the experimental apparatus is a glass fiber reinforced plastic bucket filled with soil with limited water storage capacity during the rainy season the fluctuation of dwt is sharp which causes large uncertainty of dwt as shown in fig 6 frequent rain events in april caused precipitation accumulation in the apparatus until mid may large amounts of water storage capacity of the apparatus are consumed when dwt is sensitive to precipitation and fluctuates sharply this problem explains unsatisfactory dwt fitting during mid may and early july 4 3 dwt solution with high mode truncated fourier series approximation to evapotranspiration and precipitation in eq 26 illustrates that the low mode e g 2 mode truncated fourier series approximation of evapotranspiration and precipitation captures their overall trends the high mode truncated fourier series approximation can add more high frequency fluctuations to the trends reflecting the small fluctuation details of precipitation and evapotranspiration plus the trends although high mode truncated fourier series approximation could yield a more accurate approximation of precipitation and evapotranspiration it does not mean that it could capture the fluctuation of d t because the high frequency signals of precipitation and evapotranspiration are filtered out when they travel through unsaturated zones and do not show up in d t in other words seeking a proper value of m to obtain an optimal d t is a necessary step in model calibration we apply 4 mode 6 mode and 8 mode truncated fourier series to approximate precipitation and evapotranspiration as shown in fig 7 the specific fourier coefficients are listed in appendix a tables a1 a2 and a3 the specific fourier coefficients in appendix a show that although the high frequency fourier series expansion term is overlayed during the calibration comparing with the low frequency fourier coefficients the high frequency ones are relatively small based on the approximation we obtained the solution of dwt in fig 8 the model performance metrics are presented in table 3 fig 7 shows that 4 mode 6 mode and 8 mode truncated fourier series approximation to evapotranspiration and precipitation capture more small periodic fluctuations than 2 mode in fig 5 the higher mode truncated fourier series approximation can reflect more small scale fluctuation of evapotranspiration and precipitation the signals of evapotranspiration and precipitation propagate the unsaturated zone reach the saturated zone and cause dwt variation they decay as they travel down to dwt and their high frequency signals are filtered out fig 8 shows that dwt is barely affected by high frequency signals besides after including all modes the high frequency fourier coefficients become small and barely affect the fitting result consequently higher order approximation could hance the details of precipitation and evapotranspiration variations but it does not lead to higher resolution of the numerical solutions of dwt fig 8 illustrates that the numerical solution based on 4 mode truncated fourier series to approximate precipitation and evapotranspiration has better accuracy than others comparing the values of the performance metrics of the numerical solution of dwt based on 2 mode truncated fourier series in table 2 the performance metrics based on 4 mode 6 mode and 8 mode truncated fourier series in table 3 are better after comprehensive analyses we think the numerical solution of dwt based on 4 mode truncated fourier series are the best indicating that the dwt is mainly affected by long wave seasonal precipitation and evapotranspiration comparing the model parameters based on 2 mode truncated fourier series in eq 32 with the parameters based on 4 mode 6 mode and 8 mode truncated fourier series in table 4 one can see that β is the same to be 0 0014 and μ λ 2 are close which equal to 0 0574 and 0 3889 acquire by calculating the mean value respectively the facts demonstrate that the hydrological processes are stable after examining the geological conditions soil type and climate conditions of guanzhong basin we conclude that the value of the optimal parameter values derived from the fitting are representative in this study the lysimeter is filled with sandy soil taken from the mu us desert in northwest china which the parameter μ ranges from 0 0200 to 0 4000 morris and johnson 1967 hence the parameter μ calibrated in this paper is within the range on the other hand the sandy soil has large infiltration capacity and the precipitation infiltrates quickly with λ 2 value of 0 3889 which the value is well within the range of field observation zhang et al 2019 based on the two observed heavy rains of 62 and 42 8 mm day in field experiment site of mu us desert huang 2013 we calculate the infiltration capacity is 38 6 mm day meanwhile the maximum recorded precipitation is 31 7 mm day in guanzhong experimental site revealing that the maximum precipitation rate did not exceed the infiltration capacity it is likely to be that seldom runoff and depression storage occur so the parameter λ 2 can reflect the infiltration well β i e 1 λ 1 n d max is a comprehensive parameter defined by d max n and λ 1 the value reflects hydrogeological conditions including soil types and features of precipitation and evapotranspiration the dwt in the apparatus is shallow groundwater with range of 0 mm 800 mm restricting to the experimental apparatus and the d max is approximates 1000 mm gong et al 2020 our model is coupled from averianov empirical formula and parameter n is related to the type and structure of soil with ranges from 1 to 3 studies show that n is proportional to dwt ye et al 1982 considering the soil in mu us desert is sandy soil with a shallow groundwater table the empirical index n is close to 1 λ 1 is the ratio of minimum evapotranspiration intensity to potential evapotranspiration intensity however the dwt in guanzhong basin is shallow and most of the evapotranspiration comes from groundwater so the potential evapotranspiration is large and the value λ 1 is very small according to the ranges of above parameters the parameter value of β is reasonable 4 4 limitations and future research the limitations of this study are mainly in two aspects one is the linearization of the model the other is the constraint imposed by experimental equipment 1 the model is linearized to obtain an analytical solution for the dwt and the linear approximation works well in the current experiment apparatus the following numerical experiments can explain the linearization clearly we selected three different sets of d max and n values based on the local hydrogeological conditions as shown in table 5 and calculated n based on the β i e 1 λ 1 n d max the approximation effect of the linear g d i e 1 n d d max red solid line vs the original g d 1 d d max n blue dashed line is presented in fig 9 a b and c the numerical results show that the linearization with the original g d in all three cases has a correlation coefficient above 0 99 and the absolute error is less than 0 05 which indicates that the linear approximation works well in the current experiment apparatus specifically we found that in the case study the n value falls between 1 0 and 1 2 table 5 it stands to reason that when solving the model 1 d d max n can be approximated to 1 n d d max and the cost can be lessened a bit because d d max 1 is not a tight limitation in summary the linearization results are completely reasonable however the linearized model may not be applicable to all experimental sites only to areas with shallow groundwater although the calibrated parameter model can not be directly applied to the sites where the lateral groundwater flow does not exist or can be ignored it can be used as a tool to solve and predict dwt quickly 2 to calibrate the model we install a field experimental experiment in guanzhong basin shaanxi province china which isolates lateral groundwater flow and could only measure the effect of precipitation and evapotranspiration on the dwt in the vertical direction the applied observed data of dwt in this paper are all obtained from the experiment however there is also a limitation to the experimental experiment the experiment is a glass fiber reinforced plastic bucket filled with soil and the total height is only 800 mm consequently when heavy precipitation occurs it can not penetrate more than depth of 800 mm because the bottom of the apparatus is impermeable considering the groundwater level is more sensitive to precipitation and causes the dwt fluctuates sharply which affects the model performances this is why dwt s fitting and verification performances during mid may and early july fig 6 fig 8 are not so well as discussed above the fourier series is very suitable for solving wavelet transforms and it describes the temporal multi periodic composite characteristics well moreover the fourier series approximation with different truncated modes can capture the overall fluctuation trends and not ignore some small scale fluctuations more importantly this study could present very meaningful results that could provide a good model reference when studying the time dependent dynamics in dwt driven by precipitation and evapotranspiration in addition this study is applicable to regions where no lateral groundwater flow exists or the effects of lateral groundwater flow on dwt is negligible in future study we can consider the dynamic changes of dwt in the presence of lateral groundwater flow which is also a challenge furthermore we used traditional numerical methods to calibrate the model parameters in this study in the future machine learning and neural network methods can be considered to invert the model and further study the model s universality 5 conclusions this paper established a one dimensional model to quantify the transient multi periodic evapotranspiration and precipitation driven dwt dynamics the model is calibrated using essentially 1 d observed data collected from a field experimental experiment in guanzhong basin shaanxi province china which isolates lateral groundwater flows to provide accurate measurements of the effect of precipitation and evapotranspiration on dwt in the vertical direction the solution of the model in the linear regime is calculated using duhamel s formula coupled with the composite simpson numerical integration from this study the following conclusions are drawn 1 precipitation and evapotranspiration series with low mode truncated fourier series can capture the overall long scale trend while high mode truncated fourier series can capture the small scale variation plus a large scale trend although high mode truncated fourier series can capture the small scale fluctuation details plus trends of evapotranspiration and precipitation it may not simulate the fluctuation of dwt because the high frequency signals of precipitation and evapotranspiration are filtered out when they travel through the unsaturated zones 2 during calibrating the model with 2 4 6 and 8 modes truncated fourier series we found that the 4 mode truncated fourier series performed best the facts demonstrate that not the high mode truncated fourier series for fitting precipitation and evapotranspiration is optimal to the dwt simulation the calibrated model parameters are consistent with the local hydrogeological conditions the calibrated model can be used as a first cut tool to predict dwt quickly 3 composite simpson numerical integration enables us to solve the integration derived by the duhamel s formula accurately and obtain the analytical solution of dwt which helps us to determine the geological parameter values involved in the model 4 although field observation experiment by a glass fiber reinforced plastic bucket filled with soil could shield later groundwater flow and satisfy the condition of the averianov formula its water storage capacity is limited during rainy seasons the fluctuation of dwt is sharp in the apparatus which is a big challenge for dwt simulation credit authorship contribution statement kaiyan wang formal analysis jun li formal analysis validation wenke wang supervision zaiyong zhang investigation data curation

1978,vehicles exposed to flooding and losing stability may be washed away causing potential injuries and fatalities such vehicles cause additional disruption to traffic already affected by flooding which may lead to significant indirect economic impacts especially in urban areas therefore it is important to analyze the stability of vehicles exposed to flooding to make decisions for reducing damage and hazards in this study a series of experiments were conducted with a small passenger vehicle polo gti a large passenger vehicle audi a6l and a large four wheel drive 4wd vehicle range rover models with a scale of 1 18 the buoyancy forces of the model scale vehicles were measured by buoyancy experiments which allowed for the calculation of the buoyancy force as a function of the flow depth the drag forces and transverse forces at different flow orientations were determined experimentally using a hydraulic flume and the drag coefficients 1 22 c d 6 82 and transverse force coefficients 0 c t 2 40 of the three vehicles were determined by fitting data from all experiments at the same flow direction from 0 to 180 corresponding forces on the full scale prototype vehicles were computed based on the froude similarity laws then stability thresholds and stability curved surfaces for prototype vehicles exposed to flooding were derived based on the experimental results and force analysis of vehicles exposed to flooding the study results provide valuable information for decision makers in the field of urban flood risk management to consider the impact of urban road runoff on vehicle stability thresholds keywords urban flood vehicle stability model scale testing drag coefficient transverse force coefficient stability curved surfaces data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction at present the aggravated global warming and the accelerated urbanized advancement have prompted cities frequently to storm and flood disasters leading to a great challenge to urban flood prevention and reduction measures ma et al 2021 yin et al 2016 vehicle related deaths are becoming an increasingly common type of incident in urban flooding diakakis and deligiannakis 2017 haynes et al 2017 vincendon et al 2016 on 20 july 2021 heavy rainfall hit zhengzhou china causing citywide flooding over 24 h 624 1 mm of rain fell close to the city s annual average rainfall of 641 mm and a total of 247 vehicles were submerged many vehicles lost stability and floated or were washed away and five men and one woman were killed in the jingguang road tunnel liqiang 2021 vehicles exposed to flooding may become debris when unstabilized reducing the safety of people causing traffic accidents and increasing the damage to buildings and infrastructure arrighi et al 2015b in addition to the direct impact of the vehicles washed away including fatalities vehicle damage and increased negative impact of flooding on infrastructure there were also indirect losses due to traffic disruptions bocanegra et al 2020 emergency response organizations had to devote a lot of time and resources to rescuing people from flooded vehicles smith et al 2017 hazards related to vehicles exposed to floodwater are based on their stability threshold which is assessed from hydraulic variables i e water depth and velocity costabile et al 2020 lazzarin et al 2022 martínez gomariz et al 2017 since 1967 several studies have been carried out to investigate the stability limits of flooded vehicles bonham and hattersley 1967 used a 1 25 scale model of a ford falcon car for research tested a model in the flow direction facing the side end and conducted an experimental study of its static stability after consulting with various test laboratories and road experts bonham and hattersley 1967 choose a friction coefficient of 0 3 which is satisfactory for several surface types and is considered likely to be conservative shah et al 2021b laboratory tests were later carried out in 1973 using a 1 16 scale model of the morris miniature car considering three different forms of movement of the model car e g the wheel locking condition front wheels locked rear wheels locked and all wheels locked exposed to flooding in a 1 m wide hydraulic flume gordon and s p b 1973 keller and mitsch 1993 provide a theoretical method for determining the incipient velocity of flooded vehicles based on the data set obtained by analyzing the mechanical conditions of sliding instability of flooded vehicles by considering all the forces exerted by the flood on the vehicle shand et al 2010 point out that with the changes in modern vehicle design it is unlikely that the results of previous research can be directly applied to modern vehicles therefore the limiting depth and velocity product value d v is proposed as a criterion for vehicle stability and recommended stability thresholds are given for the small passenger large passenger and large 4wd vehicles teo 2010 conducted an experimental study of the vehicles hydraulic behaviors in urban flash floods testing the instability of three small scale 1 43 model vehicles mini cooper bmw m5 mitsubishi pajero under partial and full submersion conditions xia et al 2011b derived an equation for predicting the incipient velocity of flooded vehicles under fully submerged conditions based on the mechanics of sliding equilibrium and validated it against the results of an experimental study by teo 2010 shu et al 2011 investigated stability criteria for a partially submerged vehicle by deriving a mechanics based incipient velocity equation and verified its accuracy with a series of laboratory flume datasets against the instability of three scale model vehicles 1 18 ford focus ford transit and volvo xc90 xia et al 2014 conducted experiments in a laboratory flume for two scale model vehicles 1 14 and 1 24 at three orientation angles 0 90 and 180 and two ground slopes 1 50 and 1 100 to obtain the water depth and corresponding velocity conditions at the vehicle instability threshold kramer et al 2016 carried out an experimental study on the stability limits of passenger and emergency vehicles in different directions with respect to the incoming flow and proposed a constant total head as the decisive parameter for determining passability martínez gomariz et al 2017 proposed new stability coefficients based on an experimental campaign including 12 vehicle models and a new method that can define a stability area in the flow depth velocity domain for any vehicles smith et al 2019 conducted an experimental study that investigated the hydrodynamic forces leading to sliding instability modes using scale models while the traction force and floating instability mode were investigated using the full scale models furthermore using a model vehicle with a scale ratio of 1 24 shah et al 2018b conducted a series of flume tests aimed at investigating the thresholds of vehicle instability exposed to flooding in different orientations milanesi and pilotti 2020 developed a dimensionless conceptual model of vehicle stability impacted by flow and estimated optimal values for lift and drag coefficients by fitting experimental data available in the literature based on the theory of sliding equilibrium mechanics shah et al 2020 investigated the hydrodynamic response of partially submerged non stationary vehicles under subcritical flow conditions and proposed an incipient velocity formula and gao et al 2020 carried out a force analysis of a moving vehicle in a partially submerged state in a flood to derive a critical vehicle speed formula when the moving vehicle is unstable and the relevant parameters are determined by experimental rates xia et al 2011a established a numerical study on the stability of submerged vehicles by using a 2d hydrodynamic model for numerical modelling arrighi et al 2015a carried out cfd numerical simulations using openfoam to investigate the incipient motion conditions of submerged vehicles arrighi et al 2016 carried out numerical simulations to investigate the flow around the passenger vehicle model four vehicle orientations including β 0 180 and β 65 90 were tested to clarify the role of flow direction on hydrodynamic forces al qadami et al 2020 2021 carried out 3d cfd numerical simulations to investigate the limits of floating instability in medium sized passenger vehicles al qadami et al 2022a conducted an experiment on a full size passenger vehicle to investigate the hydrodynamic forces on a vehicle in both static and motion and in both 90 and 0 orientations al qadami et al 2022b developed a numerical framework to investigate the response of a full scale medium sized passenger vehicle moving through floodwaters and based on the hydrodynamic forces exerted by the flow on the vehicle s body in both horizontal and vertical directions two modes of instability floating and sliding were investigated however most studies have not considered the specific effects of hydrodynamic forces on vehicles exposed to flooding particularly when a vehicle can have different orientations with respect to the incoming flood where the vehicle may be subject to drag force to the orientation of the flood and transverse force perpendicular to the orientation of the flood that has never been considered in previous studies in our and other past experiments the overall density and centre of gravity of the model vehicle may not match exactly with the density and centre of gravity of the prototype vehicle it is also challenging to reproduce the friction force between tyres and road surface in the model study by following the similarity law therefore we did not choose to observe the instability of the model vehicle directly in the laboratory but attempted to carry out stability analysis by calculating the hydrodynamic forces and friction forces separately in this study the volume of water displaced by the model vehicles is measured in a glass box with water at different depths to obtain a function between the buoyancy of the vehicles and the water depth in addition experiments were carried out in a laboratory flume with three scales 1 18 model vehicles at a total of 13 orientation angles from 0 to 180 to measure and calculate the drag force and the transverse force as well as the drag coefficient and the transverse force coefficient finally based on a combination of glass box and laboratory flume experimental results and force analysis of a vehicle exposed to flooding the water depth and corresponding velocity of the vehicle stability threshold are calculated and the vehicle stability threshold curved surfaces are plotted 2 hydrodynamic forces this research focuses on partially submerged vehicles to determine water depths and corresponding flow velocities at vehicle instability thresholds the flowing fluid exerts pressure and shear forces at all points on the submerged out surface of an object the resultant force on the object has a force component parallel to or along the direction of the flow of fluid called drag force f d and another force component perpendicular to the direction of the flow called lift crowe et al 2009 for a three dimensional object such as a car the resultant lift can have two components the vertical component of lift perpendicular to the ground opposite to gravity force and the horizontal component of lift when the object is asymmetrical or the direction of incoming flow is not parallel to the object s axis of symmetry partially submerged vehicles exposed to flood waters have several vertical forces fig 1 a including the gravitational force or weight f g buoyancy force f b the vertical component of lift force f l and normal reaction force from ground surface f n and several horizontal forces fig 1a including the flow drag force f d friction force f r between the road and tyres and the horizontal component of lift which is also called transverse force streeter et al 1998 f t fig 1b shows three testing cases when the angle α between the symmetry axis of the vehicle dashed line and the direction of the incoming flow blue arrow is 0 30 and 90 respectively and two force components f x and f y measured in this study the positive direction of f x is defined along the symmetry axis of the vehicle from the front to the rear end for the vehicle the angle α which is also called the flow orientation is the counterclockwise angle from the flow direction to the positive f x direction fig 1b according to archimedes principle when an object is submerged in a fluid a buoyancy force acting vertically upwards on the object is created the buoyancy force is due to the increase in pressure with depth and is equal in magnitude to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object the buoyancy f b force can be expressed as 1 f b ρ g v where ρ is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration and v is the submerged volume of the vehicle in recent studies only the effect of buoyancy force on the floating instability of the vehicle in flowing water has been considered while the effect of vertical lift force has been completely ignored in estimating the vertical pushing forces shu et al 2011 teo et al 2012a teo et al 2012b although for high flow velocities the effect of vertical lift force is dominant in which case the effect of buoyancy force can be neglected martínez gomariz et al 2017 the vertical lift force can be given as 2 f l 1 2 ρ c l a l v 2 where f l is the vertical lift force ρ is the density of water c l is the vertical lift coefficient a l is the vertical projected area of the vehicle which is equal to the cross sectional area of the vehicle base and v is the relative flow velocity with respect to the vehicle in most of the studies it is assumed the vehicle is not moving at rest shah et al 2021a and the flooding water is approaching the vehicle at a constant velocity v but the study results can be applied to the situation when the vehicle is moving with a constant velocity v but the ponding runoff has zero velocity this study and most of the previous studies do not consider any accelerations of either inflow runoff or moving vehicle al qadami et al 2022a al qadami et al 2022b martínez gomariz et al 2019 shah et al 2019 shah et al 2020 for vehicles exposed to flooding friction is the total resistance that acts on the vehicle tires from the road surface to prevent the vehicle from sliding the formula for the friction force f r can be expressed as 3 f r μ f n μ f g f b f l where μ is the friction coefficient f n is the normal reaction force from ground surface f g is the gravity force f b is the buoyancy force and f l is the vertical lift force the drag force can be defined as resistance when passing through a fluid which increases with velocity fluid density and object size it can be expressed as 4 f d 1 2 ρ c d a d v 2 where f d is the drag force ρ is the density of water c d is the drag coefficient depending on the reynolds number and the shape of the vehicle a d is the projection area of the submerged part of the vehicle perpendicular to the direction of flow and v is the flow velocity the transverse force is a component of the resultant hydrodynamic force on the surface of an object that is perpendicular to the direction of the incoming flow the flow velocity is different on the two sides of the vehicle when the direction of the incoming flow is not parallel to the long axis of the vehicle fig 1b thus the pressure and shear forces difference between the two sides of the vehicle results in transverse force the transverse force f t can be expressed as 5 f t 1 2 ρ c t a t v 2 where ρ is the density of water c t is the transverse force coefficient a t is the projection area of the submerged part of the vehicle parallel to the direction of flow and v is the relative flow velocity meanwhile to facilitate the calculation of a d and a t this paper approximates the submerged vehicle body as a rectangular body with both length r a d and width r b d as a function of water depth d in order to make the calculation feasible it is assumed that the variables r a d and r b d have a fixed ratio a b so that r a d and r b d can be calculated from the difference between the submerged volumes of vehicle corresponding to two different water depths based on buoyancy experimental data and the four tyres are simplified and combined as a whole rectangular body with length t a and width t b given in appendix a then a d and a t can be expressed as 6 a d t a s i n α t b c o s α d d h c t a s i n α t b c o s α h c r a d s i n α r b d c o s α d h c h c d h i a t t a c o s α t b s i n α d d h c t a c o s α t b s i n α h c r a d c o s α r b d s i n α d h c h c d h i where a and b are the overall vehicle length and width given in table 1 α is the angle between the driver or length side of the vehicle and the direction of incoming flood water see fig 1 b for three example angles d is the water depth h c is the vehicle ground clearance and h i is the water depth corresponding to a sharp reduction in the variable length and width of the vehicle it is worth noting that r a d and r b d change with depth d determined by numerical integration in steps of 0 001 m and using matlab code and buoyancy experimental data for each vehicle moreover each vehicle is already in floating instability when d h i so the a d and a t in this case are not considered in this paper it is now recognized that there are three typical modes of vehicle instability floating sliding and tipping the first two being the most frequent al qadami et al 2020 modern cars are generally well sealed and will not be quickly filled by floodwater the vehicle s overall density is much smaller than water density shah et al 2021a and the floating instability occurs when the combined force of the buoyancy force and the vertical lift force exceeds the weight of the car this mode of instability can be expressed as 7 f g f b f l furthermore the sliding instability occurs when the combined force of the drag force and the transverse force exceeds the resistance force at the same time these two hydrodynamic mechanisms will also interact with each other as the buoyancy reduces the effective gravity thus reducing friction as a resistance force and therefore will be more prone to sliding instability this mode of instability can be expressed as 8 f r f d f t since f d and f t are parallel to the ground surface and orthogonal to each other the flow velocity v is rearranged according to the parallelogram law and combined with eqs 3 5 and 8 to obtain the equation for which the vehicle remained stable 9 v 4 μ f g f b f l 2 ρ 2 c d 2 a d 2 ρ 2 c t 2 a t 2 4 however the instability mode of tipping appears to be restricted to vehicles that are already sliding or floating shand et al 2010 in most cases instability is a combination of floating and sliding therefore the tipping instability is excluded from further analysis in this study this study was carried out in sub critical flow states where the effect of vertical lift force f l was not significant and therefore vertical lift force in eqs 3 7 and 9 was not further considered in the following discussion due to experimental limitations only measure two forces f x and f y on the horizontal plane 3 methodology and experimental facilities 3 1 vehicle types in order to take into account dependency effects it is essential to ensure geometric kinematic and dynamic similarity between the model and its corresponding real world prototype heller 2011 road flooding can be approximated as open channel flow when compared to the effects of gravity and inertial forces the pressure and viscosity effects are inferior it has to be ensured therefore that the froude numbers of the model and prototype experiments are equal 10 f r m v m g l m f r p v p g l p where the subscript m or p stands for model or prototype f r is the froude number v is the velocity g is the gravitational acceleration and l is a characteristic length three common vehicle classes have been used in this research the polo gti audi a6l and range rover have been selected as a small passenger vehicle a large passenger vehicle and a large 4wd vehicle respectively see fig 2 all three model vehicles have a length ratio of 11 l r l p l m 18 where l r is the length ratio l p is the length in the prototype scale and l m is the corresponding length in the model scale the specifications of the vehicle models investigated and the corresponding model and prototype dimensions are given in table 1 furthermore calculation of the prototype water depths velocities drag forces transverse forces and buoyancy forces acting on the vehicle according to froude similarity law 12 h p l r h m v p l r v m f d p l r 3 f d m f t p l r 3 f t m f b p l r 3 f b m where l r is the scale ratio h m and v m are the water depths and velocities in the model scale and h p and v p are the corresponding parameters in the prototype scale f d m f t m and f b m are the drag forces transverse forces and buoyancy forces in the model scale f d p f t p and f b p are the corresponding parameters in the prototype scale to calculate the drag and transverse forces in the prototype it is assumed that the drag and transverse force coefficients cd and ct in eqs 4 and 5 remain the same between the model and prototype under the same flow orientation xia et al 2011b shu et al 2012 3 2 buoyancy force experiment 3 2 1 experimental instrumentation all model vehicles were tested to obtain the volume of water they displaced at different water depths and a relationship between the buoyancy force acting on the vehicle and the water depth was fitted in order to carry out these tests a glass box large enough to hold the largest vehicle model fig 3 was used along with volumetric cylinders a pipette and a point gauge with an accuracy of 0 1 mm a weight was added to the model vehicles to avoid them floating additionally modern vehicles are usually relatively well sealed and flood does not rush into the interior of the car as quickly when it is submerged however for poorly sealed car models vacuum packing bags were used to wrap the car models tightly by vacuum sealing so that no water flows into the car due to the small volume of the bag material the volume of water displaced by the bag can be ignored 3 2 2 experimental procedure first a certain volume of water is added to the glass box with a volumetric cylinder and pipette while the water depth is measured with a point gauge this operation is then repeated to fit a primary function curve of the volume of water in the glass box response at different water depths so the volume of water corresponding to any depth in the glass box can be calculated similarly the vacuum sealed car model is placed in a glass box to which a certain volume of water is added using a volumetric cylinder and pipette and the water depth is measured by using a point gauge repeat this operation until the depth of water reaches the roof of the vehicle as a result the volume of water displaced by the vehicle model is the difference between the volume of water in the glass box with and without the vehicle model at the water depth with the model furthermore the buoyancy force acting on each of the three vehicles can be obtained as a function of water depth by substituting eq 1 3 3 drag force and transverse force experiment 3 3 1 test flume and instrumentation the experiments were conducted in a horizontal rectangular flume of 10 m long 0 4 m wide and 0 8 m high the water is pumped from an underground reservoir to a constant level tank from where it is partially diverted to the flume after which the water is stored in another reservoir with a v notch weir where the discharge can be measured a valve of inflow pipe a sluice gate the swivel tailgate at the end of the flume fig 4 a work

measuring the horizontal hydrodynamic forces f x and f y fig 1b of the vehicle at orientation different angles α fig 1b skd61 steel tubes were connected between the two dimensional load cell mounted on a circular turntable and the vehicle model where the periphery of the circular turntable was perforated at 15 intervals and can be fixed with pins fig 4 in order to securely bond the lower end of the skd61 steel tube to the vehicle model additional sheeting was added to the roof of the vehicle model to increase the contact area the two dimensional load cell constrained the movement of the vehicle in the longitudinal direction while measuring two orthogonal horizontal hydrodynamic forces on the vehicle both with a capacity of 3 kg not a force unit and an accuracy of 0 1 to 0 3 full scale and the experiments were carried out using a weighing transmitter and the data was recorded and saved using the ad7606 multi channel ad data acquisition in addition the water depth was measured by the point gauge with an accuracy of 0 1 mm and the flow velocity was measured using the ls300 a flow velocity meter which has a velocity range of 0 01 4 00 m s with an error of less than 1 5 3 3 2 experimental procedure during the experimental investigation the vehicle model was left slightly suspended to eliminate the effect of friction and at angles of α from 0 to 180 relative to the flooding water flow fig 1b and 4b with an angle interval of 15 at an angle of α 0 the front of the vehicle is facing the flow fig 1b at an angle of α 90 the vehicle s length side is perpendicular to the flow fig 1b and at an angle of α 180 the rear of the vehicle is facing the flow in order to obtain the horizontal hydrodynamic force of the vehicle at different depths and velocities adjust the valve and sluice gate to change the depth and velocity and after the water flow has stabilized record the relevant parameters such as depth velocity and force along the long axis of the vehicle f x and force perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle f y see fig 1b the hydrodynamics of urban road flooding has been investigated using a stationary scale model vehicle by conducting a series of experimental studies in a hydraulic flume the purpose is to obtain the drag force and transverse force of partially submerged vehicles in floodwater flows in all orientations at 0 fig 1b 15 30 fig 1b 45 60 75 90 fig 1b 105 120 135 150 165 and 180 the forces measured along the long axis of the vehicle f x and perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle f y are orthogonally decomposed into the drag force parallel to the direction of the flow f d and the transverse force perpendicular to the direction of the flow f t then the drag force and the transverse force can be expressed as 13 f d f x cos α f y s i n α f t f y cos α f x s i n α where f d and f t are the drag force and the transverse force acting on the vehicle and f x and f y are the experimentally measured forces along and perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle α is the angle between the length side of the vehicle and the direction of incoming floodwater flows fig 1b 4 result and discussion 4 1 buoyancy force experimental studies were carried out on three classes of vehicles without water flooding into the vehicles measuring the volume of water displaced by the vehicles at different water depths and calculating the corresponding buoyancy force according to eq 1 then these buoyancy forces are converted to prototype scale as shown in fig 5 the buoyancy forces are plotted on the vertical coordinate opposite the water depths on the horizontal coordinate it can be found that the buoyancy forces on all three vehicle types increase gradually with increasing water depth but the rates of increase decrease from the perspective of the class the polo gti is the smallest vehicle studied and has almost the least buoyant at the same water depth however the range rover which is the largest vehicle studied is not always the most buoyant as its higher chassis makes it less submerged at relatively low water depths in addition from eqs 1 and 7 it can be seen that when the vehicle weight is equal to the buoyancy force acting on the car it is the threshold of the vehicle s floating instability the threshold for the floating depth of the vehicle is related to the weight and volume of the vehicle the higher the weight of the vehicle the higher the floating depth threshold while the larger the volume of the vehicle the greater the buoyancy force and the smaller the floating depth threshold and it is found that the larger the vehicle the less its increased load contributes to the floating depth threshold see fig 6 for example when the vehicle is empty the unladen masses of polo gti audi a6l and range rover are 1215 kg 1800 kg and 2040 kg respectively and the floating depth thresholds can be calculated as 359 3 mm 378 8 mm and 459 0 mm when there is one driver in the car the average mass is 62 kg rettner 2012 and the floating depth threshold is 368 6 mm 385 5 mm and 465 4 mm respectively when there are four people assumed total of 248 kg in the car the floating depth threshold is 396 0 mm 405 1 mm and 484 6 mm respectively this can be explained by the fact that larger vehicles generally have more volume and weight where volume has a negative effect and weight has a positive effect on the floating depth threshold as the load in the vehicle gradually increases the weight advantage of the larger vehicle becomes less pronounced while its larger size results in a higher buoyancy force leading to a lower critical flotation depth than the smaller vehicle it is worth stating that the study calculates that the floating depth thresholds will be less than the actual situation mainly because in contrary to the actual situation the vacuum packed vehicle model is completely isolated from the water so the results obtained are conservative 4 2 drag force and transverse force fig 7 shows the drag force f d n and the transverse force f t n to prototype scale vehicles in different directions of incoming flow converted from experimentally measured forces using froude similarity law for the three classes of vehicles the direction of incoming flow flow orientation i e the angle α defined in fig 1b from 0 to 180 is plotted on the x axis against the product of flow velocity and water depth vd m2 s on the y axis while the drag force or the transverse force is on the z axis a similar trend in the horizontal hydrodynamic forces of the partially submerged vehicles in different directions of incoming flow can be observed for the three classes of vehicles in more detail the drag force and the transverse force of the vehicles increase as the product of the flow velocity and the depth of the water increase when the direction of the incoming flow is the same which is shown on fig 7 using dashed lines parallel to y axis at one flow orientation for each vehicle and under the same water depth and flow velocity conditions the drag force increases in the direction of incoming flow from 0 to 90 and decreases in the direction of incoming flow from 90 to 180 with a single peak dashed lines parallel to x axis in fig 7a c and e while the transverse force increases in the direction of incoming flow from 0 to 45 and 90 to 135 and decreases in the direction of incoming flow from 45 to 90 and 135 to 180 with double peaks dashed lines parallel to x axis in fig 7b d and f the results show that as the water depth or flow velocity increases the hydrodynamic forces on the vehicle increase and the vehicle becomes more susceptible to instability the vehicle is subjected to the greatest drag force when perpendicular to the incoming floodwaters α 90 and the least when the front end of the vehicle is facing the incoming floodwaters α 0 which is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies shah et al 2018b this is because the submerged and projected area a d in eq 4 available for flow when the vehicle is perpendicular to the incoming floodwaters is larger compared to other directions particularly the front end of the vehicle and the rear end of the vehicle which increases the blockage area and reduces the cross sectional area of the flow through the vehicle and subsequently increases the drag force also at a directional angle of 0 when the incoming flow is above the front bonnet the drag force is minimal due to the aerodynamic front shape and the smooth curve of the front bonnet car in addition the transverse force is maximum when positioned at orientation angles of about 45 and 135 this is because in these directions the asymmetric effect of the vehicle is most pronounced and therefore the pressure difference between the two sides of the vehicle is greatest and the transverse force is maximum the drag coefficient c d and the transverse force coefficient c t for each experimental run can also be directly calculated using eqs 4 and 5 respectively it was found that the directly calculated drag coefficients and the transverse force coefficients for all three vehicles have large variations in different flow conditions i e different velocities and or submerged depths that lead to different values for 0 5 ρ a d v 2 or 0 5 ρ a t v 2 but at the same flow orientation for example for polo gti at 90 flow orientation directly computed drag coefficients range from 2 25 to 5 24 with an average value of 3 83 this is the same as smith et al 2019 reported in his experimental study the drag coefficients vary from 0 98 to 1 83 for all flow conditions at a 90 orientation angle then smith used an average drag coefficient of c d 1 38 for further analysis of vehicle stability therefore it is not recommended to directly calculate or derive drag coefficient and transverse force coefficient for each experimental run according to eqs 4 and 5 the scatter plots of f d and f t n for the polo gti audi a6l and range rover at different flow orientation angles were developed first fig 8 using 0 5 ρ a d v 2 and 0 5 ρ a t v 2 n as horizontal coordinates the linear fit was then developed for each vehicle at each flow orientation tested in the experiments and the slope of the linear fit is considered as the drag coefficient c d or the transverse force coefficient c t for the drag forces all linear fits have adjusted r 2 0 94 most 0 97 to indicate almost perfect regressions to determine a constant c d for each flow orientation for specific vehicle previous studies suggested that when the reynolds number is relatively high the drag coefficient is considered constant for the specified shape of an object at given flow orientation chanson 2004 xia et al 2011b in this study reynolds numbers ranged from 1 5 104 to 9 9 104 which are large enough to have constant drag or transverse force coefficient however the drag coefficient does change with the flow orientation as clearly shown in fig 8 for example for polo gti drag coefficients vary from 1 219 to 4 680 from 1 877 to 6 063 for audi a6l and from 2 252 to 6 820 for range rover for different flow orientations angle α from 0 to 180 for the transverse forces linear fits at 0 and 180 flow orientations have very small or near zero transverse force coefficients with small adjusted r 2 fig 8b 8d and 8f as we know if the vehicle is perfect symmetrical the transverse force coefficients should be zero at 0 and 180 flow orientations the adjusted r 2 at 90 flow orientations are relatively smaller but at all other flow orientations adjusted r 2 are from 0 908 to 0 992 to indicate excellent regressions to determine a constant transverse force coefficient for each flow orientation for specific vehicle and it should be added that when the directional angle is 90 the vehicle is not strictly symmetrical for the incoming flow due to the difference between the front end and the rear end of the vehicle so there may be transverse force while the transverse force coefficient varies from vehicle to vehicle and has been fitted to approximately 0 for the polo gti compared to 0 61 and 1 15 for the audi a6l and range rover for polo gti transverse force coefficients vary from 0 to 1 900 from 0 to 2 311 for audi a6l and from 0 to 2 398 for range rover in summary it is recommended to determine the drag coefficient c d or the transverse force coefficient c t using linear fitting between f d and 0 5 ρ a d v 2 or between f t and 0 5 ρ a t v 2 for all experimental runs at the same flow orientation fig 9 shows bar diagrams of the fitted drag coefficients and the fitted transverse force coefficients of the polo gti audi a6l and range rover at different flow orientations tested in experiments 15 angle increment these coefficients vary in similar patterns as the drag forces and the transverse forces with respect to incoming flow directions fig 7 the drag coefficients of the vehicles increase in the direction of incoming flow from 0 to 90 and decrease in the direction of incoming flow from 90 to 180 the same pattern of f d in fig 7 with magnitudes ranging from 1 22 to 6 82 the transverse force coefficients of the vehicles increase in the direction of incoming flow from 0 to 45 and 90 to 135 and decrease in the direction of incoming flow from 45 to 90 and 135 to 180 the same pattern of f t in fig 7 with magnitudes ranging from 0 to 2 40 a non linear fit between c d or c t and flow orientation angle α was performed for each vehicle studied using equation y y 0 a s i n π x x c ω where y is c d or c t and x is α in degrees detailed results of non linear fitting are given in appendix b and fitted parameters are summarized in table 3 the parameters y0 a 2ω xc are vertical shift amplitude period and phase shift right of the fitted sine function the fitted curves with 95 confidence bands are shown in fig 9c and 9d for c d and c t respectively adjusted r 2 values are equal to or greater than 0 9 to indicate very good non linear fits except for c t for range rover with lower r 2 and wide 95 confidence bands it is important to note that the sidewalls of the hydraulic flume used in the experiment may have certain boundary influence on the flow field particularly when the angle α is large the most significant impact occurs when the angle α is 90 which is when the car is perpendicular to the approach flow this can result in a higher flow velocity around the front and rear of the car compared to the velocity without the sidewall effect as a consequence this can lead to an overestimation of the drag forces and transverse forces as well as the values of the drag coefficients and transverse force coefficients obtained additionally the flow velocity threshold calculated using eq 9 may be underestimated 4 3 stability curved surfaces for vehicles based on the fitted drag and transverse force coefficients and eq 9 the flow conditions velocity and depth can be determined when the polo gti audi a6l and range rover are at the instability threshold in the different incoming flow directions when the water depth is less than the vehicle chassis the projection area of the vehicle is only the corresponding area of the tire which is a very small value resulting in an unusually large threshold value for the corresponding flow velocity at this water depth fig 10 shows the stability curved surfaces for the three classes of vehicles where the vehicle would become unstable when the flow conditions are above the curved surface notably the vehicle will be more prone to instability when its friction coefficient μ and vehicle weight f g are small and its stability curved surface will shift downwards overall the coefficient of friction between the tyre and the ground should take into account a range of potential values gerard 2006 kurtus 2005 the results in fig 10 are therefore based on friction coefficient μ 0 25 0 5 0 75 martínez gomariz et al 2018 and unladen vehicle weight meanwhile it is worth noting that as this study was carried out at subcritical flow condition f l was neglected therefore for calculated stability curved surface of prototype vehicles fig 10 the part of the surface above f r 1 will be used as a reference and subject to error focusing on the three classes of vehicles by and large the range rover large 4wd vehicle has the strongest resistance to instability with a stability curved surface above that of the audi a6l large passenger vehicle and polo gti small passenger vehicle followed by the audi a6l large passenger vehicle and the polo gti small passenger vehicle has the worst resistance to instability the instability threshold of the vehicle was found to be influenced by the incoming flow velocity and water depth at high water depths low flow velocities are sufficient while at low water depths high flow velocities are required to make the vehicle unstable in a partially submerged condition which is consistent with previous studies martínez gomariz et al 2017 shah et al 2018a shu et al 2011 teo et al 2012a teo et al 2012b xia et al 2011b comparing the stability of the vehicle in different directions of incoming floodwaters it is evident that the vehicle instability threshold is greatest at an orientation angle of 0 when the water depth is small when the front end of the vehicle is facing the incoming flow meaning that flow conditions of greater water depth and velocity are required to destabilize it and is most unstable at an orientation angle of 90 which is consistent with previous studies shah et al 2018b teo et al 2012b xia et al 2014 the stability of a car exposed to flooding is caused by the combined effect of drag force transverse force and buoyancy force on the one hand when the drag force and transverse force is high the vehicle will be subjected to a greater resultant force on the other hand when the buoyancy force is high the effective gravity of the vehicle will be reduced leading to a reduction in frictional force both of which will cause the vehicle to become unstable therefore when the water depth is small the vehicle is less buoyant and drag force and transverse force play a dominant role in vehicle stability and as can be seen from fig 7 drag force and transverse force change at different flow orientations so the vehicle stability threshold is more sensitive to changes in the flow orientation at the same time as the water depth gradually increases buoyancy force gradually plays a dominant role and there is no correlation between buoyancy and flow direction so the effect of the change in vehicle stability threshold with flow orientation is not obvious fig 10 further shows that for the same water depth as the orientation angle increases from 0 to 90 the flow velocity threshold corresponding to that water depth decreases gradually and at a slower rate with an inflection point at approximately 45 similarly when the directional angle is 90 to 180 it is nearly symmetrical to the orientation angle of 0 to 90 but its instability threshold is generally smaller this means that once the car starts to turn at a different angle relative to the flood flow its instability threshold will decrease rapidly the reason for this can be suggested that as the orientation angle increases from 0 to 45 the large bluff area projects normal flow compared to the front end of the vehicle this raises the blockage area and therefore the cross sectional area of the flow through the vehicle is reduced and subsequently the drag force and blockage effect are increased at the same time the asymmetric effect due to angular deflection exacerbates the transverse force however at orientation angles of 45 to 90 the asymmetric effect begins to reduce although the blockage area still gradually increases so the rate of reduction in the vehicle instability threshold tends to slow down and it is similar to the above when the orientation angle is 90 to 180 in addition compared to orientation angles of 90 to 180 orientation angles of 0 to 90 are subject to less water flow forces and are less prone to instability this is since modern vehicles use a better streamlined design to reduce wind resistance so the drag coefficient at the front of the vehicle will be less than the drag coefficient at the rear of the vehicle while the front of the vehicle is generally smaller than the rear of the vehicle and is less affected by the drag force 5 summary and conclusions in the current study the hydrodynamic response of a vehicle in different directions of incoming flood is investigated considering the drag forces and transverse forces on the vehicle in the horizontal direction a stability surface was developed based on an incipient velocity formulation of the sliding equilibrium mechanics theory and used to assess the vehicle stability with that regards buoyancy test experiments and laboratory flume experiments were carried out on three types of model vehicles the main findings have highlighted that i the lighter and larger the vehicle the lower the floating depth threshold and the more likely it is to float unstably the theoretical critical floating depths of the three classes of vehicles with no load are 359 3 mm for the polo gti 378 8 mm for the audi a6l and 459 0 mm for the range rover ii when the flood flow is perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle the vehicle is subject to the greatest drag force f d parallel to the direction of flow and when the vehicle is at an angle of about 45 or 135 to the flood flow the vehicle is subject to the greatest transverse force f t perpendicular to the flood flow iii it is recommended to determine the drag coefficient c d or the transverse force coefficient c t using linear fitting between f d and 0 5 ρ a d v 2 or between f t and 0 5 ρ a t v 2 for all experimental runs at the same flow orientation the range of values for the drag coefficient for the three classes of vehicles at different flooding angles 0 to 180 is 1 22 c d 6 82 and the range of values for the transverse force coefficient is 0 c t 2 40 last iv the stability surface shows that for the same depth of water as the directional angle increases from 0 to 90 the velocity threshold for that depth of water decreases and tends to decrease more slowly as the water depth gradually increases the effect of the threshold on the change in flow direction becomes less pronounced similarly when the orientation angle is 90 to 180 it is almost symmetrical to the orientation angle from 0 to 90 but its instability threshold is generally smaller the outcomes provide a preliminary basis for determining the stability of the vehicle under different directions of incoming flood and the stability surface is applied to those vehicles that are similar to those selected in the current investigation it is recommended that more complex scenarios such as different flow regimes and road gradients are considered for the analysis of vehicle stability as well as investigations for non stationary prototype vehicles in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

1978,vehicles exposed to flooding and losing stability may be washed away causing potential injuries and fatalities such vehicles cause additional disruption to traffic already affected by flooding which may lead to significant indirect economic impacts especially in urban areas therefore it is important to analyze the stability of vehicles exposed to flooding to make decisions for reducing damage and hazards in this study a series of experiments were conducted with a small passenger vehicle polo gti a large passenger vehicle audi a6l and a large four wheel drive 4wd vehicle range rover models with a scale of 1 18 the buoyancy forces of the model scale vehicles were measured by buoyancy experiments which allowed for the calculation of the buoyancy force as a function of the flow

made available on request 1 introduction at present the aggravated global warming and the accelerated urbanized advancement have prompted cities frequently to storm and flood disasters leading to a great challenge to urban flood prevention and reduction measures ma et al 2021 yin et al 2016 vehicle related deaths are becoming an increasingly common type of incident in urban flooding diakakis and deligiannakis 2017 haynes et al 2017 vincendon et al 2016 on 20 july 2021 heavy rainfall hit zhengzhou china causing citywide flooding over 24 h 624 1 mm of rain fell close to the city s annual average rainfall of 641 mm and a total of 247 vehicles were submerged many vehicles lost stability and floated or were washed away and five men and one woman were killed in the jingguang road tunnel liqiang 2021 vehicles exposed to flooding may become debris when unstabilized reducing the safety of people causing traffic accidents and increasing the damage to buildings and infrastructure arrighi et al 2015b in addition to the direct impact of the vehicles washed away including fatalities vehicle damage and increased negative impact of flooding on infrastructure there were also indirect losses due to traffic disruptions bocanegra et al 2020 emergency response organizations had to devote a lot of time and resources to rescuing people from flooded vehicles smith et al 2017 hazards related to vehicles exposed to floodwater are based on their stability threshold which is assessed from hydraulic variables i e water depth and velocity costabile et al 2020 lazzarin et al 2022 martínez gomariz et al 2017 since 1967 several studies have been carried out to investigate the stability limits of flooded vehicles bonham and hattersley 1967 used a 1 25 scale model of a ford falcon car for research tested a model in the flow direction facing the side end and conducted an experimental study of its static stability after consulting with various test laboratories and road experts bonham and hattersley 1967 choose a friction coefficient of 0 3 which is satisfactory for several surface types and is considered likely to be conservative shah et al 2021b laboratory tests were later carried

and all wheels locked exposed to flooding in a 1 m wide hydraulic flume gordon and s p b 1973 keller and mitsch 1993 provide a theoretical method for determining the incipient velocity of flooded vehicles based on the data set obtained by analyzing the mechanical conditions of sliding instability of flooded vehicles by considering all the forces exerted by the flood on the vehicle shand et al 2010 point out that with the changes in modern vehicle design it is unlikely that the results of previous research can be directly applied to modern vehicles therefore the limiting depth and velocity product value d v is proposed as a criterion for vehicle stability and recommended stability thresholds are given for the small passenger large passenger and large 4wd vehicles teo 2010 conducted an experimental study of the vehicles hydraulic behaviors in urban flash floods testing the instability of three small scale 1 43 model vehicles mini cooper bmw m5 mitsubishi pajero under partial and full submersion conditions xia et al 2011b derived an equation for predicting the incipient velocity of flooded vehicles under fully submerged conditions based on the mechanics of sliding equilibrium and validated it against the results of an experimental study by teo 2010 shu et al 2011 investigated stability criteria for a partially submerged vehicle by deriving a mechanics based incipient velocity equation and verified its accuracy with a series of laboratory flume datasets against the instability of three scale model vehicles 1 18 ford focus ford transit and volvo xc90 xia et al 2014 conducted experiments in a laboratory flume for two scale model vehicles 1 14 and 1 24 at three orientation angles 0 90 and 180 and two ground slopes 1 50 and 1 100 to obtain the water depth and corresponding velocity conditions at the vehicle instability threshold kramer et al 2016 carried out an experimental study on the stability limits of passenger and emergency vehicles in different directions with respect to the incoming flow and proposed a constant total head as the decisive parameter for determining passability martínez gomariz et al 2017 proposed new stability coefficients based on an experimental campaign including 12 vehicle models and a new method that can define a stability area in the flow depth velocity domain for any vehicles smith et al 2019 conducted an experimental study that investigated the hydrodynamic forces leading to sliding instability modes using scale models while the traction force and floating instability mode were investigated using the full scale models furthermore using a model vehicle with a scale ratio of 1 24 shah et al 2018b conducted a series of flume tests aimed at investigating the thresholds of vehicle instability exposed to flooding in different orientations milanesi and pilotti 2020 developed a dimensionless conceptual model of vehicle stability impacted by flow and estimated optimal values for lift and drag coefficients by fitting experimental data available in the literature based on the theory of sliding equilibrium mechanics shah et al 2020 investigated the hydrodynamic response of partially submerged non stationary vehicles under subcritical flow conditions and proposed an incipient velocity formula and gao et al 2020 carried out a force analysis of a moving vehicle in a partially submerged state in a flood to derive a critical vehicle speed formula when the moving vehicle is unstable and the relevant parameters are determined by experimental rates xia et al 2011a established a numerical study on the stability of submerged vehicles by using a 2d hydrodynamic model for numerical modelling arrighi et al 2015a carried out cfd numerical simulations using openfoam to investigate the incipient motion conditions of submerged vehicles arrighi et al 2016 carried out numerical simulations to investigate the flow around the passenger vehicle model four vehicle orientations including β 0 180 and β 65 90 were tested to clarify the role of flow direction on hydrodynamic forces al qadami et al 2020 2021 carried out 3d cfd numerical simulations to investigate the limits of floating instability in medium sized passenger vehicles al qadami et al 2022a conducted an experiment on a full size passenger vehicle to investigate the hydrodynamic forces on a vehicle in both static and motion and in both 90 and 0 orientations al qadami et al 2022b developed a numerical framework to investigate the response of a full scale medium sized passenger vehicle moving through floodwaters and based on the hydrodynamic forces exerted by the flow on the vehicle s body in both horizontal and vertical directions two modes of instability floating and sliding were investigated however most studies have not considered the specific effects of hydrodynamic forces on vehicles exposed to flooding particularly when a vehicle can have different orientations with respect to the incoming flood where the vehicle may be subject to drag force to the orientation of the flood and transverse force perpendicular to the orientation of the flood that has never been considered in previous studies in our and other past experiments the overall density and centre of gravity of the model vehicle may not match exactly with the density and centre of gravity of the prototype vehicle it is also challenging to reproduce the friction force between tyres and road surface in the model study by following the similarity law therefore we did not choose to observe the instability of the model vehicle directly in the laboratory but attempted to carry out stability analysis by calculating the hydrodynamic forces and friction forces separately in this study the volume of water displaced by the model vehicles is measured in a glass box with water at different depths to obtain a function between the buoyancy of the vehicles and the water depth in addition experiments were carried out in a laboratory flume with three scales 1 18 model vehicles at a total of 13 orientation angles from 0 to 180 to measure and calculate the drag force and the transverse force as well as the drag coefficient and the transverse force coefficient finally based on a combination of glass box and laboratory flume experimental results and force analysis of a vehicle exposed to flooding the water depth and corresponding velocity of the vehicle stability threshold are calculated and the vehicle stability threshold curved surfaces are plotted 2 hydrodynamic forces this research focuses on partially submerged vehicles to determine water depths and corresponding flow velocities at vehicle instability thresholds the flowing fluid exerts pressure and shear forces at all points on the submerged out surface of an object the resultant force on the object has a force component parallel to or along the direction of the flow of fluid called drag force f d and another force component perpendicular to the direction of the flow called lift crowe et al 2009 for a three dimensional object such as a car the resultant lift can have two components the vertical component of lift perpendicular to the ground opposite to gravity force and the horizontal component of lift when the object is asymmetrical or the direction of incoming flow is not parallel to the object s axis of symmetry partially submerged vehicles exposed to flood waters have several vertical forces fig 1 a including the gravitational force or weight f g buoyancy force f b the vertical component of lift force f l and normal reaction force from ground surface f n and several horizontal forces fig 1a including the flow drag force f d friction force f r between the road and tyres and the horizontal component of lift which is also called transverse force streeter et al 1998 f t fig 1b shows three testing cases when the angle α between the symmetry axis of the vehicle dashed line and the direction of the incoming flow blue arrow is 0 30 and 90 respectively and two force components f x and f y measured in this study the positive direction of f x is defined along the symmetry axis of the vehicle from the front to the rear end for the vehicle the angle α which is also called the flow orientation is the counterclockwise angle from the flow direction to the positive f x direction fig 1b according to archimedes principle when an object is submerged in a fluid a buoyancy force acting vertically upwards on the object is created the buoyancy force is due to the increase in pressure with depth and is equal in magnitude to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object the buoyancy f b force can be expressed as 1 f b ρ g v where ρ is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration and v is the submerged volume of the vehicle in recent studies only the effect of buoyancy force on the floating instability of the vehicle in flowing water has been considered while the effect of vertical lift force has been completely ignored in estimating the vertical pushing forces shu et al 2011 teo et al 2012a teo et al 2012b although for high flow velocities the effect of vertical lift force is dominant in which case the effect of buoyancy force can be neglected martínez gomariz et al 2017 the vertical lift force can be given as 2 f l 1 2 ρ c l a l v 2 where f l is the vertical lift force ρ is the density of water c l is the vertical lift coefficient a l is the vertical projected area of the vehicle which is equal to the cross sectional area of the vehicle base and v is the relative flow velocity with respect to the vehicle in most of the studies it is assumed the vehicle is not moving at rest shah et al 2021a and the flooding water is approaching the vehicle at a constant velocity v but the study results can be applied to the situation when the vehicle is moving with a constant velocity v but the ponding runoff has zero velocity this study and most of the previous studies do not consider any accelerations of either inflow runoff or moving vehicle al qadami et al 2022a al qadami et al 2022b martínez gomariz et al 2019 shah et al 2019 shah et al 2020 for vehicles exposed to flooding friction is the total resistance that acts on the vehicle tires from the road surface to prevent the vehicle from sliding the formula for the friction force f r can be expressed as 3 f r μ f n μ f g f b f l where μ is the friction coefficient f n is the normal reaction force from ground surface f g is the gravity force f b is the buoyancy force and f l is the vertical lift force the drag force can be defined as resistance when passing through a fluid which increases with velocity fluid density and object size it can be expressed as 4 f d 1 2 ρ c d a d v 2 where f d is the drag force ρ is the density of water c d is the drag coefficient depending on the reynolds number and the shape of the vehicle a d is the projection area of the submerged part of the vehicle perpendicular to the direction of flow and v is the flow velocity the transverse force is a component of the resultant hydrodynamic force on the surface of an object that is perpendicular to the direction of the incoming flow the flow velocity is different on the two sides of the vehicle when the direction of the incoming flow is not parallel to the long axis of the vehicle fig 1b thus the pressure and shear forces difference between the two sides of the vehicle results in transverse force the transverse force f t can be expressed as 5 f t 1 2 ρ c t a t v 2 where ρ is the density of water c t is the transverse force coefficient a t is the projection area of the submerged part of the vehicle parallel to the direction of flow and v is the relative flow velocity meanwhile to facilitate the calculation of a d and a t this paper approximates the submerged vehicle body as a rectangular body with both length r a d and width r b d as a function of water depth d in order to make the calculation feasible it is assumed that the variables r a d and r b d have a fixed ratio a b so that r a d and r b d can be calculated from the difference between the submerged volumes of vehicle corresponding to two different water depths based on buoyancy experimental data and the four tyres are simplified and combined as a whole rectangular body with length t a and width t b given in appendix a then a d and a t can be expressed as 6 a d t a s i n α t b c o s α d d h c t a s i n α t b c o s α h c r a d s i n α r b d c o s α d h c h c d h i a t t a c o s α t b s i n α d d h c t a c o s α t b s i n α h c r a d c o s α r b d s i n α d h c h c d h i where a and b are the overall vehicle length and width given in table 1 α is the angle between the driver or length side of the vehicle and the direction of incoming flood water see fig 1 b for three example angles d is the water depth h c is the vehicle ground clearance and h i is the water depth corresponding to a sharp reduction in the variable length and width of the vehicle it is worth noting that r a d and r b d change with depth d determined by numerical integration in steps of 0 001 m and using matlab code and buoyancy experimental data for each vehicle moreover each vehicle is already in floating instability when d h i so the a d and a t in this case are not considered in this paper it is now recognized that there are three typical modes of vehicle instability floating sliding and tipping the first two being the most frequent al qadami et al 2020 modern cars are generally well sealed and will not be quickly filled by floodwater the vehicle s overall density is much smaller than water density shah et al 2021a and the floating instability occurs when the combined force of the buoyancy force and the vertical lift force exceeds the weight of the car this mode of instability can be expressed as 7 f g f b f l furthermore the sliding instability occurs when the combined force of the drag force and the transverse force exceeds the resistance force at the same time these two hydrodynamic mechanisms will also interact with each other as the buoyancy reduces the effective gravity thus reducing friction as a resistance force and therefore will be more prone to sliding instability this mode of instability can be expressed as 8 f r f d f t since f d and f t are parallel to the ground surface and orthogonal to each other the flow velocity v is rearranged according to the parallelogram law and combined with eqs 3 5 and 8 to obtain the equation for which the vehicle remained stable 9 v 4 μ f g f b f l 2 ρ 2 c d 2 a d 2 ρ 2 c t 2 a t 2 4 however the instability mode of tipping appears to be restricted to vehicles that are already sliding or floating shand et al 2010 in most cases instability is a combination of floating and sliding therefore the tipping instability is excluded from further analysis in this study this study was carried out in sub critical flow states where the effect of vertical lift force f l was not significant and therefore vertical lift force in eqs 3 7 and 9 was not further considered in the following discussion due to experimental limitations only measure two forces f x and f y on the horizontal plane 3 methodology and experimental facilities 3 1 vehicle types in order to take into account dependency effects it is essential to ensure geometric kinematic and dynamic similarity between the model and its corresponding real world prototype heller 2011 road flooding can be approximated as open channel flow when compared to the effects of gravity and inertial forces the pressure and viscosity effects are inferior it has to be ensured therefore that the froude numbers of the model and prototype experiments are equal 10 f r m v m g l m f r p v p g l p where the subscript m or p stands for model or prototype f r is the froude number v is the velocity g is the gravitational acceleration and l is a characteristic length three common vehicle classes have been used in this research the polo gti audi a6l and range rover have been selected as a small passenger vehicle a large passenger vehicle and a large 4wd vehicle respectively see fig 2 all three model vehicles have a length ratio of 11 l r l p l m 18 where l r is the length ratio l p is the length in the prototype scale and l m is the corresponding length in the model scale the specifications of the vehicle models investigated and the corresponding model and prototype dimensions are given in table 1 furthermore calculation of the prototype water depths velocities drag forces transverse forces and buoyancy forces acting on the vehicle according to froude similarity law 12 h p l r h m v p l r v m f d p l r 3 f d m f t p l r 3 f t m f b p l r 3 f b m where l r is the scale ratio h m and v m are the water depths and velocities in the model scale and h p and v p are the corresponding parameters in the prototype scale f d m f t m and f b m are the drag forces transverse forces and buoyancy forces in the model scale f d p f t p and f b p are the corresponding parameters in the prototype scale to calculate the drag and transverse forces in the prototype it is assumed that the drag and transverse force coefficients cd and ct in eqs 4 and 5 remain the same between the model and prototype under the same flow orientation xia et al 2011b shu et al 2012 3 2 buoyancy force experiment 3 2 1 experimental instrumentation all model vehicles were tested to obtain the volume of water they displaced at different water depths and a relationship between the buoyancy force acting on the vehicle and the water depth was fitted in order to carry out these tests a glass box large enough to hold the largest vehicle model fig 3 was used along with volumetric cylinders a pipette and a point gauge with an accuracy of 0 1 mm a weight was added to the model vehicles to avoid them floating additionally modern vehicles are usually relatively well sealed and flood does not rush into the interior of the car as quickly when it is submerged however for poorly sealed car models vacuum packing bags were used to wrap the car models tightly by vacuum sealing so that no water flows into the car due to the small volume of the bag material the volume of water displaced by the bag can be ignored 3 2 2 experimental procedure first a certain volume of water is added to the glass box with a volumetric cylinder and pipette while the water depth is measured with a point gauge this operation is then repeated to fit a primary function curve of the volume of water in the glass box response at different water depths so the volume of water corresponding to any depth in the glass box can be calculated similarly the vacuum sealed car model is placed in a glass box to which a certain volume of water is added using a volumetric cylinder and pipette and the water depth is measured by using a point gauge repeat this operation until the depth of water reaches the roof of the vehicle as a result the volume of water displaced by the vehicle model is the difference between the volume of water in the glass box with and without the vehicle model at the water depth with the model furthermore the buoyancy force acting on each of the three vehicles can be obtained as a function of water depth by substituting eq 1 3 3 drag force and transverse force experiment 3 3 1 test flume and instrumentation the experiments were conducted in a horizontal rectangular flume of 10 m long 0 4 m wide and 0 8 m high the water is pumped from an underground reservoir to a constant level tank from where it is partially diverted to the flume after which the water is stored in another reservoir with a v notch weir where the discharge can be measured a valve of inflow pipe a sluice gate the swivel tailgate at the end of the flume fig 4 a work together to adjust the water depth and velocity in the test channel the water flowing through the flume finally flows back into the underground reservoir to circulate experimental water tested flow conditions were subcritical and table 2 provides a summary of the experimental flow conditions for three model vehicles including flow depth d velocity v froude number fr and reynolds number re compared with the model car length 0 22 0 28 m 0 4 m wide channel may have a certain boundary effect on the flow field which could be limited due to the high reynolds numbers table 2 it is challenging to mimic the flow field of runoff during a flooding event that could be affected by various factors e g multiple flooded vehicles adjacent lanes green belts and surrounding buildings walls for measuring the horizontal hydrodynamic forces f x and f y fig 1b of the vehicle at orientation different angles α fig 1b skd61 steel tubes were connected between the two dimensional load cell mounted on a circular turntable and the vehicle model where the periphery of the circular turntable was perforated at 15 intervals and can be fixed with pins fig 4 in order to securely bond the lower end of the skd61 steel tube to the vehicle model additional sheeting was added to the roof of the vehicle model to increase the contact area the two dimensional load cell constrained the movement of the vehicle in the longitudinal direction while measuring two orthogonal horizontal hydrodynamic forces on the vehicle both with a capacity of 3 kg not a force unit and an accuracy of 0 1 to 0 3 full scale and the experiments were carried out using a weighing transmitter and the data was recorded and saved using the ad7606 multi channel ad data acquisition in addition the water depth was measured by the point gauge with an accuracy of 0 1 mm and the flow velocity was measured using the ls300 a flow velocity meter which has a velocity range of 0 01 4 00 m s with an error of less than 1 5 3 3 2 experimental procedure during the experimental investigation the vehicle model was left slightly suspended to eliminate the effect of friction and at angles of α from 0 to 180 relative to the flooding water flow fig 1b and 4b with an angle interval of 15 at an angle of α 0 the front of the vehicle is facing the flow fig 1b at an angle of α 90 the vehicle s length side is perpendicular to the flow fig 1b and at an angle of α 180 the rear of the vehicle is facing the flow in order to obtain the horizontal hydrodynamic force of the vehicle at different depths and velocities adjust the valve and sluice gate to change the depth and velocity and after the water flow has stabilized record the relevant parameters such as depth velocity and force along the long axis of the vehicle f x and force perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle f y see fig 1b the hydrodynamics of urban road flooding has been investigated using a stationary scale model vehicle by conducting a series of experimental studies in a hydraulic flume the purpose is to obtain the drag force and transverse force of partially submerged vehicles in floodwater flows in all orientations at 0 fig 1b 15 30 fig 1b 45 60 75 90 fig 1b 105 120 135 150 165 and 180 the forces measured along the long axis of the vehicle f x and perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle f y are orthogonally decomposed into the drag force parallel to the direction of the flow f d and the transverse force perpendicular to the direction of the flow f t then the drag force and the transverse force can be expressed as 13 f d f x cos α f y s i n α f t f y cos α f x s i n α where f d and f t are the drag force and the transverse force acting on the vehicle and f x and f y are the experimentally measured forces along and perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle α is the angle between the length side of the vehicle and the direction of incoming floodwater flows fig 1b 4 result and discussion 4 1 buoyancy force experimental studies were carried out on three classes of vehicles without water flooding into the vehicles measuring the volume of water displaced by the vehicles at different water depths and calculating the corresponding buoyancy force according to eq 1 then these buoyancy forces are converted to prototype scale as shown in fig 5 the buoyancy forces are plotted on the vertical coordinate opposite the water depths on the horizontal coordinate it can be found that the buoyancy forces on all three vehicle types increase gradually with increasing water depth but the rates of increase decrease from the perspective of the class the polo gti is the smallest vehicle studied and has almost the least buoyant at the same water depth however the range rover which is the largest vehicle studied is not always the most buoyant as its higher chassis makes it less submerged at relatively low water depths in addition from eqs 1 and 7 it can be seen that when the vehicle weight is equal to the buoyancy force acting on the car it is the threshold of the vehicle s floating instability the threshold for the floating depth of the vehicle is related to the weight and volume of the vehicle the higher the weight of the vehicle the higher the floating depth threshold while the larger the volume of the vehicle the greater the buoyancy force and the smaller the floating depth threshold and it is found that the larger the vehicle the less its increased load contributes to the floating depth threshold see fig 6 for example when the vehicle is empty the unladen masses of polo gti audi a6l and range rover are 1215 kg 1800 kg and 2040 kg respectively and the floating depth thresholds can be calculated as 359 3 mm 378 8 mm and 459 0 mm when there is one driver in the car the average mass is 62 kg rettner 2012 and the floating depth threshold is 368 6 mm 385 5 mm and 465 4 mm respectively when there are four people assumed total of 248 kg in the car the floating depth threshold is 396 0 mm 405 1 mm and 484 6 mm respectively this can be explained by the fact that larger vehicles generally have more volume and weight where volume has a negative effect and weight has a positive effect on the floating depth threshold as the load in the vehicle gradually increases the weight advantage of the larger vehicle becomes less pronounced while its larger size results in a higher buoyancy force leading to a lower critical flotation depth than the smaller vehicle it is worth stating that the study calculates that the floating depth thresholds will be less than the actual situation mainly because in contrary to the actual situation the vacuum packed vehicle model is completely isolated from the water so the results obtained are conservative 4 2 drag force and transverse force fig 7 shows the drag force f d n and the transverse force f t n to prototype scale vehicles in different directions of incoming flow converted from experimentally measured forces using froude similarity law for the three classes of vehicles the direction of incoming flow flow orientation i e the angle α defined in fig 1b from 0 to 180 is plotted on the x axis against the product of flow velocity and water depth vd m2 s on the y axis while the drag force or the transverse force is on the z axis a similar trend in the horizontal hydrodynamic forces of the partially submerged vehicles in different directions of incoming flow can be observed for the three classes of vehicles in more detail the drag force and the transverse force of the vehicles increase as the product of the flow velocity and the depth of the water increase when the direction of the incoming flow is the same which is shown on fig 7 using dashed lines parallel to y axis at one flow orientation for each vehicle and under the same water depth and flow velocity conditions the drag force increases in the direction of incoming flow from 0 to 90 and decreases in the direction of incoming flow from 90 to 180 with a single peak dashed lines parallel to x axis in fig 7a c and e while the transverse force increases in the direction of incoming flow from 0 to 45 and 90 to 135 and decreases in the direction of incoming flow from 45 to 90 and 135 to 180 with double peaks dashed lines parallel to x axis in fig 7b d and f the results show that as the water depth or flow velocity increases the hydrodynamic forces on the vehicle increase and the vehicle becomes more susceptible to instability the vehicle is subjected to the greatest drag force when perpendicular to the incoming floodwaters α 90 and the least when the front end of the vehicle is facing the incoming floodwaters α 0 which is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies shah et al 2018b this is because the submerged and projected area a d in eq 4 available for flow when the vehicle is perpendicular to the incoming floodwaters is larger compared to other directions particularly the front end of the vehicle and the rear end of the vehicle which increases the blockage area and reduces the cross sectional area of the flow through the vehicle and subsequently increases the drag force also at a directional angle of 0 when the incoming flow is above the front bonnet the drag force is minimal due to the aerodynamic front shape and the smooth curve of the front bonnet car in addition the transverse force is maximum when positioned at orientation angles of about 45 and 135 this is because in these directions the asymmetric effect of the vehicle is most pronounced and therefore the pressure difference between the two sides of the vehicle is greatest and the transverse force is maximum the drag coefficient c d and the transverse force coefficient c t for each experimental run can also be directly calculated using eqs 4 and 5 respectively it was found that the directly calculated drag coefficients and the transverse force coefficients for all three vehicles have large variations in different flow conditions i e different velocities and or submerged depths that lead to different values for 0 5 ρ a d v 2 or 0 5 ρ a t v 2 but at the same flow orientation for example for polo gti at 90 flow orientation directly computed drag coefficients range from 2 25 to 5 24 with an average value of 3 83 this is the same as smith et al 2019 reported in his experimental study the drag coefficients vary from 0 98 to 1 83 for all flow conditions at a 90 orientation angle then smith used an average drag coefficient of c d 1 38 for further analysis of vehicle stability therefore it is not recommended to directly calculate or derive drag coefficient and transverse force coefficient for each experimental run according to eqs 4 and 5 the scatter plots of f d and f t n for the polo gti audi a6l and range rover at different flow orientation angles were developed first fig 8 using 0 5 ρ a d v 2 and 0 5 ρ a t v 2 n as horizontal coordinates the linear fit was then developed for each vehicle at each flow orientation tested in the experiments and the slope of the linear fit is considered as the drag coefficient c d or the transverse force coefficient c t for the drag forces all linear fits have adjusted r 2 0 94 most 0 97 to indicate almost perfect regressions to determine a constant c d for each flow orientation for specific vehicle previous studies suggested that when the reynolds number is relatively high the drag coefficient is considered constant for the specified shape of an object at given flow orientation chanson 2004 xia et al 2011b in this study reynolds numbers ranged from 1 5 104 to 9 9 104 which are large enough to have constant drag or transverse force coefficient however the drag coefficient does change with the flow orientation as clearly shown in fig 8 for example for polo gti drag coefficients vary from 1 219 to 4 680 from 1 877 to 6 063 for audi a6l and from 2 252 to 6 820 for range rover for different flow orientations angle α from 0 to 180 for the transverse forces linear fits at 0 and 180 flow orientations have very small or near zero transverse force coefficients with small adjusted r 2 fig 8b 8d and 8f as we know if the vehicle is perfect symmetrical the transverse force coefficients should be zero at 0 and 180 flow orientations the adjusted r 2 at 90 flow orientations are relatively smaller but at all other flow orientations adjusted r 2 are from 0 908 to 0 992 to indicate excellent regressions to determine a constant transverse force coefficient for each flow orientation for specific vehicle and it should be added that when the directional angle is 90 the vehicle is not strictly symmetrical for the incoming flow due to the difference between the front end and the rear end of the vehicle so there may be transverse force while the transverse force coefficient varies from vehicle to vehicle and has been fitted to approximately 0 for the polo gti compared to 0 61 and 1 15 for the audi a6l and range rover for polo gti transverse force coefficients vary from 0 to 1 900 from 0 to 2 311 for audi a6l and from 0 to 2 398 for range rover in summary it is recommended to determine the drag coefficient c d or the transverse force coefficient c t using linear fitting between f d and 0 5 ρ a d v 2 or between f t and 0 5 ρ a t v 2 for all experimental runs at the same flow orientation fig 9 shows bar diagrams of the fitted drag coefficients and the fitted transverse force coefficients of the polo gti audi a6l and range rover at different flow orientations tested in experiments 15 angle increment these coefficients vary in similar patterns as the drag forces and the transverse forces with respect to incoming flow directions fig 7 the drag coefficients of the vehicles increase in the direction of incoming flow from 0 to 90 and decrease in the direction of incoming flow from 90 to 180 the same pattern of f d in fig 7 with magnitudes ranging from 1 22 to 6 82 the transverse force coefficients of the vehicles increase in the direction of incoming flow from 0 to 45 and 90 to 135 and decrease in the direction of incoming flow from 45 to 90 and 135 to 180 the same pattern of f t in fig 7 with magnitudes ranging from 0 to 2 40 a non linear fit between c d or c t and flow orientation angle α was performed for each vehicle studied using equation y y 0 a s i n π x x c ω where y is c d or c t and x is α in degrees detailed results of non linear fitting are given in appendix b and fitted parameters are summarized in table 3 the parameters y0 a 2ω xc are vertical shift amplitude period and phase shift right of the fitted sine function the fitted curves with 95 confidence bands are shown in fig 9c and 9d for c d and c t respectively adjusted r 2 values are equal to or greater than 0 9 to indicate very good non linear fits except for c t for range rover with lower r 2 and wide 95 confidence bands it is important to note that the sidewalls of the hydraulic flume used in the experiment may have certain boundary influence on the flow field particularly when the angle α is large the most significant impact occurs when the angle α is 90 which is when the car is perpendicular to the approach flow this can result in a higher flow velocity around the front and rear of the car compared to the velocity without the sidewall effect as a consequence this can lead to an overestimation of the drag forces and transverse forces as well as the values of the drag coefficients and transverse force coefficients obtained additionally the flow velocity threshold calculated using eq 9 may be underestimated 4 3 stability curved surfaces for vehicles based on the fitted drag and transverse force coefficients and eq 9 the flow conditions velocity and depth can be determined when the polo gti audi a6l and range rover are at the instability threshold in the different incoming flow directions when the water depth is less than the vehicle chassis the projection area of the vehicle is only the corresponding area of the tire which is a very small value resulting in an unusually large threshold value for the corresponding flow velocity at this water depth fig 10 shows the stability curved surfaces for the three classes of vehicles where the vehicle would become unstable when the flow conditions are above the curved surface notably the vehicle will be more prone to instability when its friction coefficient μ and vehicle weight f g are small and its stability curved surface will shift downwards overall the coefficient of friction between the tyre and the ground should take into account a range of potential values gerard 2006 kurtus 2005 the results in fig 10 are therefore based on friction coefficient μ 0 25 0 5 0 75 martínez gomariz et al 2018 and unladen vehicle weight meanwhile it is worth noting that as this study was carried out at subcritical flow condition f l was neglected therefore for calculated stability curved surface of prototype vehicles fig 10 the part of the surface above f r 1 will be used as a reference and subject to error focusing on the three classes of vehicles by and large the range rover large 4wd vehicle has the strongest resistance to instability with a stability curved surface above that of the audi a6l large passenger vehicle and polo gti small passenger vehicle followed by the audi a6l large passenger vehicle and the polo gti small passenger vehicle has the worst resistance to instability the instability threshold of the vehicle was found to be influenced by the incoming flow velocity and water depth at high water depths low flow velocities are sufficient while at low water depths high flow velocities are required to make the vehicle unstable in a partially submerged condition which is consistent with previous studies martínez gomariz et al 2017 shah et al 2018a shu et al 2011 teo et al 2012a teo et al 2012b xia et al 2011b comparing the stability of the vehicle in different directions of incoming floodwaters it is evident that the vehicle instability threshold is greatest at an orientation angle of 0 when the water depth is small when the front end of the vehicle is facing the incoming flow meaning that flow conditions of greater water depth and velocity are required to destabilize it and is most unstable at an orientation angle of 90 which is consistent with previous studies shah et al 2018b teo et al 2012b xia et al 2014 the stability of a car exposed to flooding is caused by the combined effect of drag force transverse force and buoyancy force on the one hand when the drag force and transverse force is high the vehicle will be subjected to a greater resultant force on the other hand when the buoyancy force is high the effective gravity of the vehicle will be reduced leading to a reduction in frictional force both of which will cause the vehicle to become unstable therefore when the water depth is small the vehicle is less buoyant and drag force and transverse force play a dominant role in vehicle stability and as can be seen from fig 7 drag force and transverse force change at different flow orientations so the vehicle stability threshold is more sensitive to changes in the flow orientation at the same time as the water depth gradually increases buoyancy force gradually plays a dominant role and there is no correlation between buoyancy and flow direction so the effect of the change in vehicle stability threshold with flow orientation is not obvious fig 10 further shows that for the same water depth as the orientation angle increases from 0 to 90 the flow velocity threshold corresponding to that water depth decreases gradually and at a slower rate with an inflection point at approximately 45 similarly when the directional angle is 90 to 180 it is nearly symmetrical to the orientation angle of 0 to 90 but its instability threshold is generally smaller this means that once the car starts to turn at a different angle relative to the flood flow its instability threshold will decrease rapidly the reason for this can be suggested that as the orientation angle increases from 0 to 45 the large bluff area projects normal flow compared to the front end of the vehicle this raises the blockage area and therefore the cross sectional area of the flow through the vehicle is reduced and subsequently the drag force and blockage effect are increased at the same time the asymmetric effect due to angular deflection exacerbates the transverse force however at orientation angles of 45 to 90 the asymmetric effect begins to reduce although the blockage area still gradually increases so the rate of reduction in the vehicle instability threshold tends to slow down and it is similar to the above when the orientation angle is 90 to 180 in addition compared to orientation angles of 90 to 180 orientation angles of 0 to 90 are subject to less water flow forces and are less prone to instability this is since modern vehicles use a better streamlined design to reduce wind resistance so the drag coefficient at the front of the vehicle will be less than the drag coefficient at the rear of the vehicle while the front of the vehicle is generally smaller than the rear of the vehicle and is less affected by the drag force 5 summary and conclusions in the current study the hydrodynamic response of a vehicle in different directions of incoming flood is investigated considering the drag forces and transverse forces on the vehicle in the horizontal direction a stability surface was developed based on an incipient velocity formulation of the sliding equilibrium mechanics theory and used to assess the vehicle stability with that regards buoyancy test experiments and laboratory flume experiments were carried out on three types of model vehicles the main findings have highlighted that i the lighter and larger the vehicle the lower the floating depth threshold and the more likely it is to float unstably the theoretical critical floating depths of the three classes of vehicles with no load are 359 3 mm for the polo gti 378 8 mm for the audi a6l and 459 0 mm for the range rover ii when the flood flow is perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle the vehicle is subject to the greatest drag force f d parallel to the direction of flow and when the vehicle is at an angle of about 45 or 135 to the flood flow the vehicle is subject to the greatest transverse force f t perpendicular to the flood flow iii it is recommended to determine the drag coefficient c d or the transverse force coefficient c t using linear fitting between f d and 0 5 ρ a d v 2 or between f t and 0 5 ρ a t v 2 for all experimental runs at the same flow orientation the range of values for the drag coefficient for the three classes of vehicles at different flooding angles 0 to 180 is 1 22 c d 6 82 and the range of values for the transverse force coefficient is 0 c t 2 40 last iv the stability surface shows that for the same depth of water as the directional angle increases from 0 to 90 the velocity threshold for that depth of water decreases and tends to decrease more slowly as the water depth gradually increases the effect of the threshold on the change in flow direction becomes less pronounced similarly when the orientation angle is 90 to 180 it is almost symmetrical to the orientation angle from 0 to 90 but its instability threshold is generally smaller the outcomes provide a preliminary basis for determining the stability of the vehicle under different directions of incoming flood and the stability surface is applied to those vehicles that are similar to those selected in the current investigation it is recommended that more complex scenarios such as different flow regimes and road gradients are considered for the analysis of vehicle stability as well as investigations for non stationary prototype vehicles in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

1979,monitoring soil water content swc distribution is crucial for better understanding soil water dynamics and accurate hydrological modeling in this study a pipeline robot system for monitoring swc distribution is designed to improve the current technical problems of insufficient measurement distance and low positioning accuracy of the existing swc monitoring platform the system consists of a pipeline robot a fixed base station and a pvc pipe the robot could fit into a 55 mm diameter pvc pipe to measure swc distribution horizontally vertically or at any angle to the horizontal direction the base station serves as a data collector and also supplies power and distance information for recharging and positioning the robot respectively a series of tests for evaluating the performance of the pipeline robot system were conducted field experiments were also conducted to monitor soil water infiltration and horizontal distribution of swc of crop root zone at three plots the results showed that the minimum radius of volume of sensitivity of the dielectric sensor is about 2 25 cm the robot for mobile measurement performed stable both in horizontal and vertical directions and the response of the dielectric sensor output to different dielectric materials is significant the accumulated error of the encoder is effectively decreased from 4 3 to 1 2 by correcting the position error using the laser ranging sensor the measured swcs during the calibration experiment were highly correlated with those obtained by the drying method r2 0 990 and rmse 0 0181 cm3 cm 3 the results of the field experiments demonstrated that the system is feasible for monitoring soil water infiltration in the vertical direction and swc distributions of crop root zone horizontally at the three plots indicating that the potential application of the developed system for long term monitoring of swc distribution under field conditions in the near future keywords pipeline robot dielectric sensor laser ranging sensor robot positioning soil water content distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil water content swc is considered as a crucial hydrological parameter since it serves as a link between soil plants and atmosphere the availability and distribution of soil water content can be a significant impact on plant growth nutrient cycling and soil erosion among other factors veihmeyer and hendrickson 1950 wijewardana et al 2019 swc is also required as an initial condition for the accurate simulation and reliable prediction of many meteorological crop and hazard models e g xia et al 2014 however swc is highly variable in time and spatial scales under the influence of soil texture capacity tillage patterns vegetation distribution precipitation and irrigation methods some previous studies have shown that swc varies spatially under a series of hydrological processes such as infiltration and evapotranspiration bell et al 1980 vereecken et al 2014 wang et al 2015 this variation is reflected not only in the horizontal position but also in the vertical direction schwen et al 2014 therefore monitoring swc distributions in the different directions to obtain spatio temporal continuous swc observations are important for better understanding the soil water dynamics accurate hydrological modeling and optimizing agricultural water management for decades various swc sensors have been developed and widely used however the majority of these sensors can only measure swc at a point scale therefore researchers have tried various approaches such as sensor arrays e g francia et al 2022 and wireless sensor networks e g bogena et al 2010 to expand the measuring range of swc however these methods require more cost on sensor purchase and are laborious to install and maintain these sensors in addition remote sensing and model simulations are also common methods for large scale swc observations the depth of remote sensing is limited by the penetration depth of electromagnetic waves into the soil peng et al 2017 and remote sensing is also lacking high spatial resolution in recent years some studies have started to use hydrological and climate models or remote sensing observations combined with land surface models to simulate swc e g eroglu et al 2019 or groundwater data e g abbaszadeh shahri et al 2022 at different spatial scales in recent years there has been an increasing number of studies focusing on monitoring swc distribution in horizontal and vertical directions for the measurement in the vertical direction commercially available sensors such as diviner 2000 and enviroscan can be used to measure the water content of soil profile up to 16 depths yu et al 2021 designed a novel dielectric tube sensor to continuously measure swc and matric potential at multiple depths the sensor is moving inside an in situ mounted pvc pipe under the control of a step motor and cable for the measurement in the horizontal direction gravalos et al 2012 developed a pipeline mobile sensor platform consisting of a commercially available swc sensor diviner 2000 and two identical motor driven mobile structures that move through pipes buried horizontally in a soil tank to measure the water content of soil profile then they deployed multiple mobile sensor platforms at different depths and finally integrated the data to obtain a 3d swc distribution gravalos et al 2013 according to their description gravalos et al 2012 automatic positioning was not equipped on the mobile sensor platform therefore sun et al 2014 proposed an alternative prototype consisting of a dielectric tube sensor a step motor and a dc motor during each measurement cycle the dielectric tube sensor is pulled by the step motor and cable moving in the pipe the dc motor tightens the nylon string to keep the sensor in the center of the pipeline at the same time the approximate position of the sensor in the pipeline can be obtained by the excitation times of the step motor they finally applied this prototype to monitor swc distribution in the tomato root zone shan et al 2016 it is verified that the sensor platform can not only measure the swc of the root zone but also estimate plant transpiration and soil evaporation with mulches covering the soil surface the platforms mentioned above can be applied to measure the water content of soil profile in horizontal or vertical directions however there were some shortcomings among them the commercial sensors diviner 2000 and enviroscan can only measure a limited depth in the vertical direction 16 depth max the mobile sensor platform based on the pipeline network is not equipped with an automatic positioning system pulling the dielectric tube sensor by the motor and the cable solves the problem of autonomous positioning to a certain extent but the measuring distance is restricted due to the limited length of the signal cable therefore there are still limitations of previous platforms including a lack of i large depth or long distance swc distribution measurement ii high positioning accuracy and iii a prototype suitable for both horizontal and vertical monitoring in this study a pipeline robot system was designed for monitoring dynamics of swc distribution under field conditions the advantages of the pipeline robot system are freed from the constraints of cables so that it can move over a longer distance or larger depth in pipes in addition the encoder and the laser ranging sensor in this system were used to position the robot for improving the measuring accuracy of swc distribution experiments were designed and conducted to test the feasibility of the novel pipeline robot system for monitoring dynamics of swc distribution both in horizontal and vertical directions under field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 development of the pipeline robot system a schematic illustration of a prototype of the pipeline robot system for monitoring swc distribution is shown in fig 1 a the system consisted of three parts a pvc pipe a pipeline robot and a base station the pvc pipe 55 mm inner diameter can be installed in soils horizontally vertically or at any angle to the horizontal direction the pipeline robot with a length of 320 mm can fit into the pvc pipe to move and measure swc at different positions consequently yielding swc distribution the base station collects the data measured by the robot measures the position of the robot and recharges the battery of the robot the control circuit of the system is illustrated in fig 1b two microcontroller units mcu are used in the robot and the base station respectively volumetric swc is measured by a dielectric swc sensor and the motor installed on the robot is operated by a motor driver chip an encoder and a laser ranging sensor are used to record the position of the robot the data measured will be stored in tf cards besides a bluetooth low energy ble module is used to transmit data wirelessly between the pipeline robot and the base station finally the time is recorded using a real time clock rtc to facilitate data synchronization between the robot and the base station besides the cost for developing the robot system is about 1700 cny 250 usd which greatly reduces the cost compared with sensor array and other methods during a measurement event the robot at initial position first moves forward through the pvc pipe to measure the swc and the corresponding position after arriving at a set distance the robot moves back to the initial position and transmits data to the base station using ble after rigorous testing the pipeline robot was determined to possess a standby time of 10 h and in practical measurement conditions it can sustain a continuous operation for a minimum of 4 h 2 1 1 design of the pipeline robot as shown in fig 2 a the pipeline robot can be divided into three main units a drive unit a measure control unit and a power supply unit each unit is connected by a universal joint driving structure of a pipeline robot can be classified as a wheel crawler or bionic a screw wheel driving structure was finally chosen in the drive unit after comprehensively considering the driving ability vertical movement performance and structural complexity ab rashid et al 2020 chen et al 2015 roh and choi 2005 verma et al 2022 a dc motor 12 v 333 rpm 2 kgf cm is used as the driving source of the robot in addition the encoder installed on the driven wheel is also an essential part which can determine the position of the robot running in a pipe when the recorded data from the encoder has reached the set distance the robot runs backward and eventually returns to the initial position and keeps a low power mode as shown in fig 2b e the dielectric swc sensor circuit board and control circuit board of the robot are installed inside the measure control unit two copper rings are installed on the shell of the unit which serve as electrodes of the swc sensor to generate a fringe field that extends into the soil to measure water content the distance between the two electrodes is 10 mm with a 53 mm outer diameter and a 50 mm inner diameter for each copper ring to avoid signal interference it is necessary to maintain a distance of 15 mm between the control circuit board fig 2e and the high frequency circuit board of the swc sensor fig 2d as depicted in fig 2b the measurement principle is based on the dielectric frequency domain method as shown in fig 2c because the relative permittivity of water ε water ε 0 81 is much greater than the permittivity of soil minerals ε soil ε 0 3 5 and air ε air ε 0 1 volumetric swc θ v an be determined indirectly using soil dielectric permittivity topp et al 1980 the electrical impedance of the electrodes z p was determined as 1 z p ε u b u a u b z 0 where ε is the relative permittivity of the soil z 0 is the balance impedance and u a and u b are the output voltage of each wave detector the output voltage u o can be calculated by using the amplifier to amplify the difference between u a and u b 2 u o a f u a u b where a f is the gain of the amplifier from formulas 1 and 2 u o can be expressed as 3 u o a f z 0 z p u b the input impedance z p of the sensor will be affected by the swc variation which will vary the output voltage u o of the sensor as well the power supply unit includes a small li ion battery 12 6 v 1200 mah and a power supply circuit board the power supply circuit board shown in fig 2f includes the functions of battery charging management power path power conversion and power monitoring the pipeline robot will automatically return to the base station to recharge if a low battery energy lower than 10 5 v is detected after performing a measurement event in addition there is a charging interface at the end of the power supply unit it can cooperate with another charging interface installed at the base station to charge the li ion battery when the pipeline robot sleeps 2 1 2 design of the base station fig 3 shows structure of the base station the main functions of the base station are to provide the robot with access to battery charging data collection and position measurement and correction as is shown in fig 3 the size of the base station is 80 80 80 mm a backup battery a control circuit board and a laser ranging sensor are placed inside the box at the front of the box there is also a pipe with a diameter of 55 mm a thickness of 2 mm and a length of 50 mm facilitating the connection between the pvc pipe and the base station furthermore there is a charging interface at the front of the base station to connect the recharge interface of the robot the battery carried by the robot can be recharged when the robot is in a low power status at the initial position meanwhile there is also a laser ranging sensor 80 m 1 mm in the base station during the measurement event the position of the robot can be recorded by the laser ranging sensor finally these position data will be used to correct the position recorded by the encoder in order to facilitate data collection we also designed a usb interface which can easily read the data collected by the base station through a computer or mobile phone 2 2 performance tests of the system 2 2 1 determination of minimum radius of volume of sensitivity vos of the dielectric sensor the device designed for determining minimum radius of volume of sensitivity vos of the dielectric swc sensor is illustrated in fig 4 the pvc pipe was horizontally placed at the bottom of the square container and the pipeline robot was put into the pvc pipe a saturated sandy soil sample was added into the square container layer by layer the minimum radius of vos of the sensor is defined as the distance from the pvc pipe outer wall to the soil surface when the dielectric sensor output does not change 2 2 2 test of mobile measurement of the robot and response of the dielectric sensor to different materials in the horizontal or vertical direction fig 5 depicts an experimental device for testing horizontal mobile measurement of the robot and response of the dielectric sensor to different soil textures and swc variation under laboratory condition a soil tank with a 1 m length 0 35 m width and 0 35 m height is equally divided into four sections which were labeled nos 1 4 from right to left no 1 section was filled with loam and the other three sections were filled with sandy soil a pvc pipe 2 m length 63 mm outer diameter and 55 mm inner diameter was installed horizontally through the center of the soil tank drip irrigation was conducted in the no 3 soil section every 5 min the pipe robot performed a measurement task along the pvc pipe the pipeline robot performed a measurement task vertically downward from the top of the pvc pipe and returns when it runs to the bottom of the pipe for testing the vertical mobile measurement of the robot and the response of the dielectric sensor to the copper foil and hands attached to the pipe a 10 m long pvc pipe spliced by three 3 m long pvc pipes and one 1 m long pvc pipe was used for this test these pvc pipes have the same inner diameter of 55 mm and outer diameter of 63 mm an array of copper foil rings 15 mm width 0 05 mm thickness was pasted on the outer wall of the pvc pipe with an interval of 0 5 m then the 10 m long pvc pipe was placed vertically with holding hands at about 6 m height as shown in fig 6 2 2 3 correction of the encoder for the robot positioning using laser ranging sensor a test was designed to allow the pipeline robot to run back and forth in a 3 m long pvc pipe and both the encoder and the laser ranging sensor recorded the position of the robot taking the measurement of the laser ranging sensor as references the accumulated error of the encoder during one measurement was analyzed to correct the encoder for the robot positioning 2 3 calibration of the dielectric sensor for soil water content swc measurement a pvc bucket with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 15 cm was used for calibrating the dielectric sensor for swc measurement there was a pvc pipe inner diameter 55 mm outer diameter 63 mm vertically inserted in the center of the pvc bucket as shown in fig 7 the soil sample used for the calibration was loam being sampled from the national field scientific observation and research station on efficient water use of oasis agriculture in wuwei of gansu province the soil sample was firstly oven dried at 105 c for 24 h then water was continuously added to the dry soil and mixed evenly the soil was put into the pvc bucket and then a pvc rod was used to fall freely from about 5 cm onto the soil surface to tamp the soil the pipeline robot runs in the pvc pipe to measure the swc finally the actual volumetric swc θ v was determined using the drying method and fitted to the output of the dielectric sensor 2 4 field experiments 2 4 1 monitoring soil water infiltration under field condition an infiltration experiment was conducted under field condition as illustrated in fig 8 a 1 m long pvc pipe with one end sealed by a tube cap was vertically inserted into the soil the pipeline robot was inserted into the pvc pipe from the top the base station was then installed at the top of the pvc pipe and connected to the laptop via a usb cable the experiment lasted about five hours irrigation was conducted continuously around the pvc pipe the pipeline robot moved up and down inside the pipe to record soil water dynamics at different depths during the infiltration process 2 4 2 horizontally monitoring swc distribution of crop root zone at three plots the experiment was conducted at the national field scientific observation and research station on efficient water use of oasis agriculture in wuwei of gansu province 37 49 39 n 102 52 54 e elev 1 586 m wuwei gansu china three 6 m long pvc pipes were placed at the depth of 25 cm in three plots before crop planting after installing the pipeline robots into the pvc pipes the base stations were mounted on the left side of the pipe and the two ends of the pvc pipes were finally sealed for waterproof each plot was mulched to minimize the soil evaporation the crops in the three plots were planted as maize monocrop plot 1 soybean monocrop plot 2 and maize and soybean intercrop plot 3 the variety of maize is xianyu 1225 and the soybean is longhuang 3 the spacing in the rows of the maize monocrop plot was 40 cm and that of the soybean monocrop plot was 35 cm the planting strategy of crops in plot 3 was shown in fig 9 three groups of crops consisting of soybeans and maize were planted in the plot each crop group contains three maize and three soybeans the spacing in the rows between maize and soybean is 25 cm the swc distribution was monitored in the three plots for two weeks the pipeline robot was configured to work at a speed of 5 cm s with each sampling point incurring a time cost of about 100 ms and an interval of 1 s between sampling points was established the data at 3 00 p m every day was finally selected for analysis to verify the measurement accuracy of the robot under field condition seven different points 1 m 2 m 2 75 m 3 m 3 5 m 4 m and 5 m in the plot 1 sep 1 3 00 p m were chosen the swcs at the seven points were firstly measured by the robot and then sampled and measured by oven drying method 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of minimum radius of vos of the dielectric sensor fig 10 depicts the output of the dielectric sensor as the soil layer thickness increased within the first 1 5 cm the sensor output changed significantly from 1 5 cm to 2 25 cm the change rate of the sensor output gradually decreases and finally tends to remain stable therefore the minimum radius of vos of the sensor is about 2 25 cm this parameter is important because it can be used to determine the minimum water weight in the root zone based on the measured volume swc and thus the water uptake in this root zone could be roughly calculated 3 2 results of the mobile measurement of the robot and response of the dielectric sensor to the changes of dielectric material in the horizontal or vertical direction fig 11 illustrates the response of the dielectric sensor to the changes of the soil texture and soil water content during the mobile measurement of the pipeline robot in the horizontal direction under the drip irrigation test condition as shown in fig 11 the pipeline robot entered the no 1 soil section fig 5 from the air at the position of 0 4 m due to the change of medium from air to loamy soil the sensor output increased accordingly at the position of 0 65 m the medium i e soil texture changes once again from no 1 loamy soil to no 2 sandy soil and thus the dielectric sensor output changes accordingly the swc at the no 3 soil section from 0 9 m to 1 15 m gradually increased over time due to the application of a constant rate of drip irrigation as evidenced by a progressively larger sensor output the dielectric sensor output changes from the initial 0 4 v to 0 8 v due to the change of swc in the no 3 section from 1 15 m to 1 4 m since the robot entered the no 4 section without drip irrigation the swc decreased and the output of the dielectric sensor decreased accordingly after 1 4 m the pipe robot runs from the no 4 soil section into the air where the medium changes and the sensor output returns to the same magnitude as that from 0 3 to 0 4 m this experiment demonstrates that the developed pipeline robot has good performance of mobile measurement and response to the changes of the soil texture and soil water content in the horizontal direction fig 12 depicts the response of the dielectric sensor to the changes of the different materials during the mobile measurement of the pipeline robot in the vertical direction every 0 5 m a spike pulse c a 0 18 v appears in the sensor output which was caused by the ring of copper foil attached to the outer wall of the pvc pipe at about 4 m two larger pulses c a 0 43 v appear due to the human s hands holding on the pvc pipe the hand has a higher dielectric permittivity than the copper foil has therefore the amplitude of the pulse made by the hand is higher than that made by copper foil this experiment demonstrated that the pipeline robot has good performance of mobile measurement in the vertical direction and can accurately distinguish different materials out of the pipe indicating that the pipeline robot is feasible to monitor soil water content distribution to a depth or distance of at least 10 m 3 3 correcting result of accumulative error of the encoder the positions of the encoder and laser ranging sensor outputs are shown in fig 13 a the difference between the distance measured by the encoder and that measured by the laser ranging sensor was increasing as the robot moved away from the initial position at the maximum measurement distance the position measured by the laser ranging sensor was 2 676 m while the position measured by the encoder was 2 517 m because the pipeline robot has a length of 0 32 m the actual distance recorded by the laser ranging sensor was 2 996 m and the absolute error and the relative error were 0 004 m and 0 13 respectively in comparison the actual distance measured by the encoder was 2 837 m and the absolute error and the relative error were 0 163 m and 5 4 respectively the relative error of the encoder is much larger than that of the laser ranging sensor which may be caused by the wheel slippage or the spiral forward motion of the pipeline robot inside the pipeline taking the laser ranging sensor measurements as references the error of the encoder was calculated fig 13b demonstrates that the relationship between the cumulative error of the encoder and the recorded distance is linear after fitting the relationship between the cumulative error of the encoder and the position measured by the encoder the pipeline robot was running once again in a 3 m long pvc pipe and the corrected results are shown in fig 13c forward and 13d backward the accumulated error at the 3 m position is reduced from 0 129 m to 0 036 m and the relative error is reduced from 4 3 to 1 2 suggesting that using the corrected curve the difference between the corrected encoder and the laser ranging sensor was significantly reduced 3 4 results of the dielectric sensor calibration for swc measurement fig 14 shows the calibration results of volumetric swc measurements in the loam the results demonstrate that the sensor output consistently shows a linear relationship with the actual volumetric swc from 0 cm3 cm 3 to 0 40 cm3 cm 3 the determination coefficient r2 of the fitting curve is 0 990 mean absolute percentage error mape is 5 1 and root mean squared error rmse is 0 018 cm3 cm 3 indicating that the dielectric sensor can be used to determine volumetric swc 3 5 experimental results of the robot system for vertically monitoring swc distribution under field condition the results of variations of the swc distribution measured by the robot system as the time elapsed during the soil water infiltration process under field condition are shown in fig 15 before the irrigation the volumetric swc gradually decreased with the increasing depth 0 min in fig 15a and the volumetric swc 0 0 1 m near the soil surface was about 0 280 cm3 cm 3 while the volumetric swc was about 0 130 cm3 cm 3 at the deeper layer of the soil 0 6 0 7 m as the irrigation started the water infiltrated into the soil and the volumetric swc from 0 to 0 4 m depth increased as shown in fig 15a the depth of soil water infiltration as the time elapsed is shown in fig 15b the water infiltrated rapidly to reach about 0 35 m depth within the first 100 min of irrigation the water infiltration rate decreased gradually over the next 200 min reaching a depth of approximately 0 43 m at the end of 300 min these results illustrate that the developed robot system is feasible for measuring swc distribution in the vertical direction 3 6 experimental results of the robot system for horizontally monitoring swc distribution of crop root zone at the three plots the dynamics of swc distribution measured by the robot system at the three plots from aug 28 to sep 15 are shown in fig 16 a 16c the total volumetric swc at the three plots generally decreased over the two weeks at the sep 3 sep 5 and sep 9 the swc at the three plots increased because there were rains at the three days the swc distribution in plot 1 was not uniform as shown in fig 16a during the two week observation the swcs in the north 0 2 5 m part of plot 1 was always higher than that in the south 3 5 6 m part the swcs in the middle 2 5 3 5 m were lower than those in either the north or south part in contrast the swc distribution in plot 2 was relatively uniform from 0 to 6 m fig 16b and the average swc was significantly lower than that in plot 1 or plot 3 at the beginning aug 28 of the field observation the swc distribution in plot 3 was not uniform reflecting that the swc 0 284 0 011 cm3 cm 3 in the maize strip at the positions of about 0 1 m 2 3 m and 4 5 m was slightly higher than that 0 270 0 005 cm3 cm 3 in the soybean strip at the positions of about 1 2 m 3 4 m and 5 6 m fig 16c at aug 29 finally the average swcs in both strips were almost identical at sep 15 0 178 0 004 cm3 cm 3 in the maize strip and 0 173 0 004 cm3 cm 3 in the soybean strip to compare the difference of the swc variation between the monoculture and intercrop plots fig 16d shows the average swc variation in the maize strips of intercrop plot plot 3 and the average swc variation in the maize monoculture plot plot 1 during the two week observation the average swc of the maize strips in plot 3 was 0 284 0 011 cm3 cm 3 at the beginning of the experiment and finally decreased to 0 178 0 004 cm3 cm 3 with a variation of 0 106 cm3 cm 3 meanwhile the average swc in plot 1 eventually decreased from 0 270 0 005 cm3 cm 3 to 0 178 0 004 cm3 cm 3 with a variation of 0 092 cm3 cm 3 similarly fig 16e shows the average swc variations in the soybean strips in plot 3 and plot 2 the average swc of soybean strips in plot 3 decreased 0 098 cm3 cm 3 from 0 270 0 005 cm3 cm 3 to 0 173 0 004 cm3 cm 3 in comparison the average swc in plot 2 only decreased 0 041 cm3 cm 3 from 0 204 0 005 cm3 cm 3 to 0 163 0 004 cm3 cm 3 it can be concluded that the water consumption of maize strips in intercropping plot was approximately the same as that of maize in the monoculture plot however the water consumption of soybean strips in intercropping plot was significantly higher in comparison with that in the monoculture plot these findings are consistent with some previous studies gao et al 2010 rahman et al 2017 raza et al 2021 ren et al 2017 the dielectric swc sensor output is affected by soil temperature chen et al 2019 soil salinity szypłowska et al 2019 and swc however during the two week experimental period there was minimal variation in soil temperature 5 and soil salinity remained stable indicating that swc was the primary factor affecting the output of the swc sensor to verify the measurement accuracy of the robot under field condition the comparison between the volumetric swc measured by the developed pipeline robot and that measured by oven drying method was shown in fig 16f it can be seen that the swc measured by the self developed system agreed very well with that measured by traditional oven drying method both the field observation and verification indicate that the self developed system is feasible for monitoring soil water content distribution with high accuracy under field condition 3 7 assessment and analysis of the robot system for field application based on the above experimental results the performance and function of the self developed robot system were fully assessed the results of mobile measurement test vertically and horizontally confirm that the measurement distance depth can reach at least 10 m providing an advantage over previous studies such as 1 6 m of diviner 2000 and 4 m of sun et al 2014 in addition the pipeline robot system is equipped with autonomous positioning function and the positioning error after correction was finally determined to be 1 2 providing an advantage over the localization procedure has not been automated yet mentioned in the study of gravalos et al 2012 it was also found that during these experiments several exceptions occurred including low battery capacity unable to conduct one measurement unstable movement of robot and undetectable signal of the laser sensor in the deformed pipeline some anticipate solutions were adopted to solve the exceptions for instance a threshold of battery capacity is defined for recharging alarm in the power management a high speed mode with more driving force is set for unstable movement of the robot and the accuracy of the encoder is sufficient instead of laser sensor for sensor positioning in the deformed pipeline in addition since the experiment of horizontal monitoring of swc distribution of crop root zone only lasted for two weeks the potential influence of soil temperature and salinity on the swc sensor was insignificant however if the pipeline robot system was applied over a longer period especially when the variations of the soil temperature and salinity were significant the accuracy of the swc sensor may be reduced and thus the temperature and salinity corrections need to be conducted for yielding more accurate volumetric swc 4 conclusion in this study a pipeline robot system for accurately monitoring swc distribution was developed after the performance test of the pipeline robot system the experiments of monitoring water infiltration vertically and swc distribution horizontally were conducted under field condition the following are the main conclusions 1 the minimum radius of vos of the swc sensor carried by the pipeline robot was determined to be 2 25 cm and the results of calibration experiment showed that the swc sensor can determine volumetric swc with high accuracy r2 0 990 rmse 0 018 cm3 cm 3 mape 5 1 2 the pipeline robot system is capable of detecting changes in dielectric materials both vertically and horizontally within a distance depth of at least 10 m and after position correction the relative error of the encoder decreased to 1 2 these findings indicate that the developed pipeline robot system can be used to accurately monitor swc distribution and improve both monitoring distance and positioning accuracy 3 the pipeline robot system demonstrated excellent performance under field conditions and can be used to monitor swc of water infiltration and root zone meanwhile sampling in the plot 1 maize monoculture using oven drying method demonstrated the accuracy of the swc sensor carried by the pipeline robot for measuring volumetric swc in general the developed pipeline robot can automatically measure volumetric swc distribution with extendable measurement distance depth improved positioning accuracy and facilitated field application and has the potential application for long term monitoring of swc distribution under field conditions in the near future credit authorship

1979,monitoring soil water content swc distribution is crucial for better understanding soil water dynamics and accurate hydrological modeling in this study a pipeline robot system for monitoring swc distribution is designed to improve the current technical problems of insufficient measurement distance and low positioning accuracy of the existing swc monitoring platform the system consists of a pipeline robot a fixed base station and a pvc pipe the robot could fit into a 55 mm diameter pvc pipe to measure swc distribution horizontally vertically or at any angle to the horizontal direction the base station serves as a data collector and also supplies power and distance information for recharging and positioning the robot respectively a series of tests for evaluating the performance of the pipeline robot system were conducted field experiments were also conducted to monitor soil water infiltration and horizontal distribution of swc of crop root zone at three plots the results showed that the minimum radius of volume of sensitivity of the dielectric sensor is about 2 25 cm the robot for mobile measurement performed stable both in horizontal and vertical directions and the response of the dielectric sensor output to different dielectric materials is significant the accumulated error of the encoder is effectively decreased from 4 3 to 1 2 by correcting the position error using the laser ranging sensor the measured swcs during the calibration experiment were highly correlated with those obtained by the drying method r2 0 990 and rmse 0 0181 cm3 cm 3 the results of the field experiments demonstrated that the system is feasible for monitoring soil water infiltration in the vertical direction and swc distributions of crop root zone horizontally at the three plots indicating that the potential application of the developed system for long term monitoring of swc distribution under field conditions in the near future keywords pipeline robot dielectric sensor laser ranging sensor robot positioning soil water content distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil water content swc is considered as a crucial hydrological parameter since it serves as a link between soil plants and atmosphere the availability and distribution of soil water content can be a significant impact on plant growth nutrient cycling and soil erosion among other factors veihmeyer and hendrickson 1950 wijewardana et al 2019 swc is also required as an initial condition for the accurate simulation and reliable prediction of many meteorological crop and hazard models e g xia et al 2014 however swc is highly variable in time and spatial scales under the influence of soil texture capacity tillage patterns vegetation distribution precipitation and irrigation methods some previous studies have shown that swc varies spatially under a series of hydrological processes such as infiltration and evapotranspiration bell et al 1980 vereecken et al 2014 wang et al 2015 this variation is reflected not only in the horizontal position but also in the vertical direction schwen et al 2014 therefore monitoring swc distributions in the different directions to obtain spatio temporal continuous swc observations are important for better understanding the soil water dynamics accurate hydrological modeling and optimizing agricultural water management for decades various swc sensors have been developed and widely used however the majority of these sensors can only measure swc at a point scale therefore researchers have tried various approaches such as sensor arrays e g francia et al 2022 and wireless sensor networks e g bogena et al 2010 to expand the measuring range of swc however these methods require more cost on sensor purchase and are laborious to install and maintain these sensors in addition remote sensing and model simulations are also common methods for large scale swc observations the depth of remote sensing is limited by the penetration depth of electromagnetic waves into the soil peng et al 2017 and remote sensing is also lacking high spatial resolution in recent years some studies have started to use hydrological and climate models or remote sensing observations combined with land surface models to simulate swc e g eroglu et al 2019 or groundwater data e g abbaszadeh shahri et al 2022 at different spatial scales in recent years there has been an increasing number of studies focusing on monitoring swc distribution in horizontal and vertical directions for the measurement in the vertical direction commercially available sensors such as diviner 2000 and enviroscan can be used to measure the water content of soil profile up to 16 depths yu et al 2021 designed a novel dielectric tube sensor to continuously measure swc and matric potential at multiple depths the sensor is moving inside an in situ mounted pvc pipe under the control of a step motor and cable for the measurement in the horizontal direction gravalos et al 2012 developed a pipeline mobile sensor platform consisting of a commercially available swc sensor diviner 2000 and two identical motor driven mobile structures that move through pipes buried horizontally in a soil tank to measure the water content of soil profile then they deployed multiple mobile sensor platforms at different depths and finally integrated the data to obtain a 3d swc distribution gravalos et al 2013 according to their description gravalos et al 2012 automatic positioning was not equipped on the mobile sensor platform therefore sun et al 2014 proposed an alternative prototype consisting of a dielectric tube sensor a step motor and a dc motor during each measurement cycle the dielectric tube sensor is pulled by the step motor and cable moving in the pipe the dc motor tightens the nylon string to keep the sensor in the center of the pipeline at the same time the approximate position of the sensor in the pipeline can be obtained by the excitation times of the step motor they finally applied this prototype to monitor swc distribution in the tomato root zone shan et al 2016 it is verified that the sensor platform can not only measure the swc of the root zone but also estimate plant transpiration and soil evaporation with mulches covering the soil surface the platforms mentioned above can be applied to measure the water content of soil profile in horizontal or vertical directions however there were some shortcomings among them the commercial sensors diviner 2000 and enviroscan can only measure a limited depth in the vertical direction 16 depth max the mobile sensor platform based on the pipeline network is not equipped with an automatic positioning system pulling the dielectric tube sensor by the motor and the cable solves the problem of autonomous positioning to a certain extent but the measuring distance is restricted due to the limited length of the signal cable therefore there are still limitations of previous platforms including a lack of i large depth or long distance swc distribution measurement ii high positioning accuracy and iii a prototype suitable for both horizontal and vertical monitoring in this study a pipeline robot system was designed for monitoring dynamics of swc distribution under field conditions the advantages of the pipeline robot system are freed from the constraints of cables so that it can move over a longer distance or larger depth in pipes in addition the encoder and the laser ranging sensor in this system were used to position the robot for improving the measuring accuracy of swc distribution experiments were designed and conducted to test the feasibility of the novel pipeline robot system for monitoring dynamics of swc distribution both in horizontal and vertical directions under field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 development of the pipeline robot system a schematic illustration of a prototype of the pipeline robot system for monitoring swc distribution is shown in fig 1 a the system consisted of three parts a pvc pipe a pipeline robot and a base station the pvc pipe 55 mm inner diameter can be installed in soils horizontally vertically or at any angle to the horizontal direction the pipeline robot with a length of 320 mm can fit into the pvc pipe to move and measure swc at different positions consequently yielding swc distribution the base station collects the data measured by the robot measures the position of the robot and recharges the battery of the robot the control circuit of the system is illustrated in fig 1b two microcontroller units mcu are used in the robot and the base station respectively volumetric swc is measured by a dielectric swc sensor and the motor installed on the robot is operated by a motor driver chip an encoder and a laser ranging sensor are used to record the position of the robot the data measured will be stored in tf cards besides a bluetooth low energy ble module is used to transmit data wirelessly between the pipeline robot and the base station finally the time is recorded using a real time clock rtc to facilitate data synchronization between the robot and the base station besides the cost for developing the robot system is about 1700 cny 250 usd which greatly reduces the cost compared with sensor array and other methods during a measurement event the robot at initial position first moves forward through the pvc pipe to measure the swc and the corresponding position after arriving at a set distance the robot moves back to the initial position and transmits data to the base station using ble after rigorous testing the pipeline robot was determined to possess a standby time of 10 h and in practical measurement conditions it can sustain a continuous operation for a minimum of 4 h 2 1 1 design of the pipeline robot as shown in fig 2 a the pipeline robot can be divided into three main units a drive unit a measure control unit and a power supply unit each unit is connected by a universal joint driving structure of a pipeline robot can be classified as a wheel crawler or bionic a screw wheel driving structure was finally chosen in the drive unit after comprehensively considering the driving ability vertical movement performance and structural complexity ab rashid et al 2020 chen et al 2015 roh and choi 2005 verma et al 2022 a dc motor 12 v 333 rpm 2 kgf cm is used as the driving source of the robot in addition the encoder installed on the driven wheel is also an essential part which can determine the position of the robot running in a pipe when the recorded data from the encoder has reached the set distance the robot runs backward and eventually returns to the initial position and keeps a low power mode as shown in fig 2b e the dielectric swc sensor circuit board and control circuit board of the robot are installed inside the measure control unit two copper rings are installed on the shell of the unit which serve as electrodes of the swc sensor to generate a fringe field that extends into the soil to measure water content the distance between the two electrodes is 10 mm with a 53 mm outer diameter and a 50 mm inner diameter for each copper ring to avoid signal interference it is necessary to maintain a distance of 15 mm between the control circuit board fig 2e and the high frequency circuit board of the swc sensor fig 2d as depicted in fig 2b the measurement principle is based on the dielectric frequency domain method as shown in fig 2c because the relative permittivity of water ε water ε 0 81 is much greater than the permittivity of soil minerals ε soil ε 0 3 5 and air ε air ε 0 1 volumetric swc θ v an be determined indirectly using soil dielectric permittivity topp et al 1980 the electrical impedance of the electrodes z p was determined as 1 z p ε u b u a u b z 0 where ε is the relative permittivity of the soil z 0 is the balance impedance and u a and u b are the output voltage of each wave detector the output voltage u o can be calculated by using the amplifier to amplify the difference between u a and u b 2 u o a f u a u b where a f is the gain of the amplifier from formulas 1 and 2 u o can be expressed as 3 u o a f z 0 z p u b the input impedance z p of the sensor will be affected by the swc variation which will vary the output voltage u o of the sensor as well the power supply unit includes a small li ion battery 12 6 v 1200 mah and a power supply circuit board the power supply circuit board shown in fig 2f includes the functions of battery charging management power path power conversion and power monitoring the pipeline robot will automatically return to the base station to recharge if a low battery energy lower than 10 5 v is detected after performing a measurement event in addition there is a charging interface at the end of the power supply unit it can cooperate with another charging interface installed at the base station to charge the li ion battery when the pipeline robot sleeps 2 1 2 design of the base station fig 3 shows structure of the base station the main functions of the base station are to provide the robot with access to battery charging data collection and position measurement and correction as is shown in fig 3 the size of the base station is 80 80 80 mm a backup battery a control circuit board and a laser ranging sensor are placed inside the box at the front of the box there is also a pipe with a diameter of 55 mm a thickness of 2 mm and a length of 50 mm facilitating the connection between the pvc pipe and the base station furthermore there is a charging interface at the front of the base station to connect the recharge interface of the robot the battery carried by the robot can be recharged when the robot is in a low power status at the initial position meanwhile there is also a laser ranging sensor 80 m 1 mm in the base station during the measurement event the position of the robot can be recorded by the laser ranging sensor finally these position data will be used to correct the position recorded by the encoder in order to facilitate data collection we also designed a usb interface which can easily read the data collected by the base station through a computer or mobile phone 2 2 performance tests of the system 2 2 1 determination of minimum radius of volume of sensitivity vos of the dielectric sensor the device designed for determining minimum radius of volume of sensitivity vos of the dielectric swc sensor is illustrated in fig 4 the pvc pipe was horizontally placed at the bottom of the square container and the pipeline robot was put into the pvc pipe a saturated sandy soil sample was added into the square container layer by layer the minimum radius of vos of the sensor is defined as the distance from the pvc pipe outer wall to the soil surface when the dielectric sensor output does not change 2 2 2 test of mobile measurement of the robot and response of the dielectric sensor to different materials in the horizontal or vertical direction fig 5 depicts an experimental device for testing horizontal mobile measurement of the robot and response of the dielectric sensor to different soil textures and swc variation under laboratory condition a soil tank with a 1 m length 0 35 m width and 0 35 m height is equally divided into four sections which were labeled nos 1 4 from right to left no 1 section was filled with loam and the other three sections were filled with sandy soil a pvc pipe 2 m length 63 mm outer diameter and 55 mm inner diameter was installed horizontally through the center of the soil tank drip irrigation was conducted in the no 3 soil section every 5 min the pipe robot performed a measurement task along the pvc pipe the pipeline robot performed a measurement task vertically downward from the top of the pvc pipe and returns when it runs to the bottom of the pipe for testing the vertical mobile measurement of the robot and the response of the dielectric sensor to the copper foil and hands attached to the pipe a 10 m long pvc pipe spliced by three 3 m long pvc pipes and one 1 m long pvc pipe was used for this test these pvc pipes have the same inner diameter of 55 mm and outer diameter of 63 mm an array of copper foil rings 15 mm width 0 05 mm thickness was pasted on the outer wall of the pvc pipe with an interval of 0 5 m then the 10 m long pvc pipe was placed vertically with holding hands at about 6 m height as shown in fig 6 2 2 3 correction of the encoder for the robot positioning using laser ranging sensor a test was designed to allow the pipeline robot to run back and forth in a 3 m long pvc pipe and both the encoder and the laser ranging sensor recorded the position of the robot taking the measurement of the laser ranging sensor as references the accumulated error of the encoder during one measurement was analyzed to correct the encoder for the robot positioning 2 3 calibration of the dielectric sensor for soil water content swc measurement a pvc bucket with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 15 cm was used for calibrating the dielectric sensor for swc measurement there was a pvc pipe inner diameter 55 mm outer diameter 63 mm vertically inserted in the center of the pvc bucket as shown in fig 7 the soil sample used for the calibration was loam being sampled from the national field scientific observation and research station on efficient water use of oasis agriculture in wuwei of gansu province the soil sample was firstly oven dried at 105 c for 24 h then water was continuously added to the dry soil and mixed evenly the soil was put into the pvc bucket and then a pvc rod was used to fall freely from about 5 cm onto the soil surface to tamp the soil the pipeline robot runs in the pvc pipe to measure the swc finally the actual volumetric swc θ v was determined using the drying method and fitted to the output of the dielectric sensor 2 4 field experiments 2 4 1 monitoring soil water infiltration under field condition an infiltration experiment was conducted under field condition as illustrated in fig 8 a 1 m long pvc pipe with one end sealed by a tube cap was vertically inserted into the soil the pipeline robot was inserted into the pvc pipe from the top the base station was then installed at the top of the pvc pipe and connected to the laptop via a usb cable the experiment lasted about five hours irrigation was conducted continuously around the pvc pipe the pipeline robot moved up and down inside the pipe to record soil water dynamics at different depths during the infiltration process 2 4 2 horizontally monitoring swc distribution of crop root zone at three plots the experiment was conducted at the national field scientific observation and research station on efficient water use of oasis agriculture in wuwei of gansu province 37 49 39 n 102 52 54 e elev 1 586 m wuwei gansu china three 6 m long pvc pipes were placed at the depth of 25 cm in three plots before crop planting after installing the pipeline robots into the pvc pipes the base stations were mounted on the left side of the pipe and the two ends of the pvc pipes were finally sealed for waterproof each plot was mulched to minimize the soil evaporation the crops in the three plots were planted as maize monocrop plot 1 soybean monocrop plot 2 and maize and soybean intercrop plot 3 the variety of maize is xianyu 1225 and the soybean is longhuang 3 the spacing in the rows of the maize monocrop plot was 40 cm and that of the soybean monocrop plot was 35 cm the planting strategy of crops in plot 3 was shown in fig 9 three groups of crops consisting of soybeans and maize were planted in the plot each crop group contains three maize and three soybeans the spacing in the rows between maize and soybean is 25 cm the swc distribution was monitored in the three plots for two weeks the pipeline robot was configured to work at a speed of 5 cm s with each sampling point incurring a time cost of about 100 ms and an interval of 1 s between sampling points was established the data at 3 00 p m every day was finally selected for analysis to verify the measurement accuracy of the robot under field condition seven different points 1 m 2 m 2 75 m 3 m 3 5 m 4 m and 5 m in the plot 1 sep 1 3 00 p m were chosen the swcs at the seven points were firstly measured by the robot and then sampled and measured by oven drying method 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of minimum radius of vos of the dielectric sensor fig 10 depicts the output of the dielectric sensor as the soil layer thickness increased within the first 1 5 cm the sensor output changed significantly from 1 5 cm to 2 25 cm the change rate of the sensor output gradually decreases and finally tends to remain stable therefore the minimum radius of vos of the sensor is about 2 25 cm this parameter is important because it can be used to determine the minimum water weight in the root zone based on the measured volume swc and thus the water uptake in this root zone could be roughly calculated 3 2 results of the mobile measurement of the robot and response of the dielectric sensor to the changes of dielectric material in the horizontal or vertical direction fig 11 illustrates the response of the dielectric sensor to the changes of the soil texture and soil water content during the mobile measurement of the pipeline robot in the horizontal direction under the drip irrigation test condition as shown in fig 11 the pipeline robot entered the no 1 soil section fig 5 from the air at the position of 0 4 m due to the change of medium from air to loamy soil the sensor output increased accordingly at the position of 0 65 m the medium i e soil texture changes once again from no 1 loamy soil to no 2 sandy soil and thus the dielectric sensor output changes accordingly the swc at the no 3 soil section from 0 9 m to 1 15 m gradually increased over time due to the application of a constant rate of drip irrigation as evidenced by a progressively larger sensor output the dielectric sensor output changes from the initial 0 4 v to 0 8 v due to the change of swc in the no 3 section from 1 15 m to 1 4 m since the robot entered the no 4 section without drip irrigation the swc decreased and the output of the dielectric sensor decreased accordingly after 1 4 m the pipe robot runs from the no 4 soil section into the air where the medium changes and the sensor output returns to the same magnitude as that from 0 3 to 0 4 m this experiment demonstrates that the developed pipeline robot has good performance of mobile measurement and response to the changes of the soil texture and soil water content in the horizontal direction fig 12 depicts the response of the dielectric sensor to the changes of the different materials during the mobile measurement of the pipeline robot in the vertical direction every 0 5 m a spike pulse c a 0 18 v appears in the sensor output which was caused by the ring of copper foil attached to the outer wall of the pvc pipe at about 4 m two larger pulses c a 0 43 v appear due to the human s hands holding on the pvc pipe the hand has a higher dielectric permittivity than the copper foil has therefore the amplitude of the pulse made by the hand is higher than that made by copper foil this experiment demonstrated that the pipeline robot has good performance of mobile measurement in the vertical direction and can accurately distinguish different materials out of the pipe indicating that the pipeline robot is feasible to monitor soil water content distribution to a depth or distance of at least 10 m 3 3 correcting result of accumulative error of the encoder the positions of the encoder and laser ranging sensor outputs are shown in fig 13 a the difference between the distance measured by the encoder and that measured by the laser ranging sensor was increasing as the robot moved away from the initial position at the maximum measurement distance the position measured by the laser ranging sensor was 2 676 m while the position measured by the encoder was 2 517 m because the pipeline robot has a length of 0 32 m the actual distance recorded by the laser ranging sensor was 2 996 m and the absolute error and the relative error were 0 004 m and 0 13 respectively in comparison the actual distance measured by the encoder was 2 837 m and the absolute error and the relative error were 0 163 m and 5 4 respectively the relative error of the encoder is much larger than that of the laser ranging sensor which may be caused by the wheel slippage or the spiral forward motion of the pipeline robot inside the pipeline taking the laser ranging sensor measurements as references the error of the encoder was calculated fig 13b demonstrates that the relationship between the cumulative error of the encoder and the recorded distance is linear after fitting the relationship between the cumulative error of the encoder and the position measured by the encoder the pipeline robot was running once again in a 3 m long pvc pipe and the corrected results are shown in fig 13c forward and 13d backward the accumulated error at the 3 m position is reduced from 0 129 m to 0 036 m and the relative error is reduced from 4 3 to 1 2 suggesting that using the corrected curve the difference between the corrected encoder and the laser ranging sensor was significantly reduced 3 4 results of the dielectric sensor calibration for swc measurement fig 14 shows the calibration results of volumetric swc measurements in the loam the results demonstrate that the sensor output consistently shows a linear relationship with the actual volumetric swc from 0 cm3 cm 3 to 0 40 cm3 cm 3 the determination coefficient r2 of the fitting curve is 0 990 mean absolute percentage error mape is 5 1 and root mean squared error rmse is 0 018 cm3 cm 3 indicating that the dielectric sensor can be used to determine volumetric swc 3 5 experimental results of the robot system for vertically monitoring swc distribution under field condition the results of variations of the swc distribution measured by the robot system as the time elapsed during the soil water infiltration process under field condition are shown in fig 15 before the irrigation the volumetric swc gradually decreased with the increasing depth 0 min in fig 15a and the volumetric swc 0 0 1 m near the soil surface was about 0 280 cm3 cm 3 while the volumetric swc was about 0 130 cm3 cm 3 at the deeper layer of the soil 0 6 0 7 m as the irrigation started the water infiltrated into the soil and the volumetric swc from 0 to 0 4 m depth increased as shown in fig 15a the depth of soil water infiltration as the time elapsed is shown in fig 15b the water infiltrated rapidly to reach about 0 35 m depth within the first 100 min of irrigation the water infiltration rate decreased gradually over the next 200 min reaching a depth of approximately 0 43 m at the end of 300 min these results illustrate that the developed robot system is feasible for measuring swc distribution in the vertical direction 3 6 experimental results of the robot system for horizontally monitoring swc distribution of crop root zone at the three plots the dynamics of swc distribution measured by the robot system at the three plots from aug 28 to sep 15 are shown in fig 16 a 16c the total volumetric swc at the three plots generally decreased over the two weeks at the sep 3 sep 5 and sep 9 the swc at the three plots increased because there were rains at the three days the swc distribution in plot 1 was not uniform as shown in fig 16a during the two week observation the swcs in the north 0 2 5 m part of plot 1 was always higher than that in the south 3 5 6 m part the swcs in the middle 2 5 3 5 m were lower than those in either the north or south part in contrast the swc distribution in plot 2 was relatively uniform from 0 to 6 m fig 16b and the average swc was significantly lower than that in plot 1 or plot 3 at the beginning aug 28 of the field observation the swc distribution in plot 3 was not uniform reflecting that the swc 0 284 0 011 cm3 cm 3 in the maize strip at the positions of about 0 1 m 2 3 m and 4 5 m was slightly higher than that 0 270 0 005 cm3 cm 3 in the soybean strip at the positions of about 1 2 m 3 4 m and 5 6 m fig 16c at aug 29 finally the average swcs in both strips were almost identical at sep 15 0 178 0 004 cm3 cm 3 in the maize strip and 0 173 0 004 cm3 cm 3 in the soybean strip to compare the difference of the swc variation between the monoculture and intercrop plots fig 16d shows the average swc variation in the maize strips of intercrop plot plot 3 and the average swc variation in the maize monoculture plot plot 1 during the two week observation the average swc of the maize strips in plot 3 was 0 284 0 011 cm3 cm 3 at the beginning of the experiment and finally decreased to 0 178 0 004 cm3 cm 3 with a variation of 0 106 cm3 cm 3 meanwhile the average swc in plot 1 eventually decreased from 0 270 0 005 cm3 cm 3 to 0 178 0 004 cm3 cm 3 with a variation of 0 092 cm3 cm 3 similarly fig 16e shows the average swc variations in the soybean strips in plot 3 and plot 2 the average swc of soybean strips in plot 3 decreased 0 098 cm3 cm 3 from 0 270 0 005 cm3 cm 3 to 0 173 0 004 cm3 cm 3 in comparison the average swc in plot 2 only decreased 0 041 cm3 cm 3 from 0 204 0 005 cm3 cm 3 to 0 163 0 004 cm3 cm 3 it can be concluded that the water consumption of maize strips in intercropping plot was approximately the same as that of maize in the monoculture plot however the water consumption of soybean strips in intercropping plot was significantly higher in comparison with that in the monoculture plot these findings are consistent with some previous studies gao et al 2010 rahman et al 2017 raza et al 2021 ren et al 2017 the dielectric swc sensor output is affected by soil temperature chen et al 2019 soil salinity szypłowska et al 2019 and swc however during the two week experimental period there was minimal variation in soil temperature 5 and soil salinity remained stable indicating that swc was the primary factor affecting the output of the swc sensor to verify the measurement accuracy of the robot under field condition the comparison between the volumetric swc measured by the developed pipeline robot and that measured by oven drying method was shown in fig 16f it can be seen that the swc measured by the self developed system agreed very well with that measured by traditional oven drying method both the field observation and verification indicate that the self developed system is feasible for monitoring soil water content distribution with high accuracy under field condition 3 7 assessment and analysis of the robot system for field application based on the above experimental results the performance and function of the self developed robot system were fully assessed the results of mobile measurement test vertically and horizontally confirm that the measurement distance depth can reach at least 10 m providing an advantage over previous studies such as 1 6 m of diviner 2000 and 4 m of sun et al 2014 in addition the pipeline robot system is equipped with autonomous positioning function and the positioning error after correction was finally determined to be 1 2 providing an advantage over the localization procedure has not been automated yet mentioned in the study of gravalos et al 2012 it was also found that during these experiments several exceptions occurred including low battery capacity unable to conduct one measurement unstable movement of robot and undetectable signal of the laser sensor in the deformed pipeline some anticipate solutions were adopted to solve the exceptions for instance a threshold of battery capacity is defined for recharging alarm in the power management a high speed mode with more driving force is set for unstable movement of the robot and the accuracy of the encoder is sufficient instead of laser sensor for sensor positioning in the deformed pipeline in addition since the experiment of horizontal monitoring of swc distribution of crop root zone only lasted for two weeks the potential influence of soil temperature and salinity on the swc sensor was insignificant however if the pipeline robot system was applied over a longer period especially when the variations of the soil temperature and salinity were significant the accuracy of the swc sensor may be reduced and thus the temperature and salinity corrections need to be conducted for yielding more accurate volumetric swc 4 conclusion in this study a pipeline robot system for accurately monitoring swc distribution was developed after the performance test of the pipeline robot system the experiments of monitoring water infiltration vertically and swc distribution horizontally were conducted under field condition the following are the main conclusions 1 the minimum radius of vos of the swc sensor carried by the pipeline robot was determined to be 2 25 cm and the results of calibration experiment showed that the swc sensor can determine volumetric swc with high accuracy r2 0 990 rmse 0 018 cm3 cm 3 mape 5 1 2 the pipeline robot system is capable of detecting changes in dielectric materials both vertically and horizontally within a distance depth of at least 10 m and after position correction the relative error of the encoder decreased to 1 2 these findings indicate that the developed pipeline robot system can be used to accurately monitor swc distribution and improve both monitoring distance and positioning accuracy 3 the pipeline robot system demonstrated excellent performance under field conditions and can be used to monitor swc of water infiltration and root zone meanwhile sampling in the plot 1 maize monoculture using oven drying method demonstrated the accuracy of the swc sensor carried by the pipeline robot for measuring volumetric swc in general the developed pipeline robot can automatically measure volumetric swc distribution with extendable measurement distance depth improved positioning accuracy and facilitated field application and has the potential application for long term monitoring of swc distribution under field conditions in the near future credit authorship
