8370,study region milan northwestern italy study focus the impact of expected trends in storm temporal structures is analyzed with reference to urban drainage systems featuring catchment areas spanning from 10 ha to 100 ha a bivariate stochastic model for the derivation of flood frequency is developed accounting for the seasonality of storm volumes durations and their mutual dependence structure its reliability is verified by comparing it to continuous hydrodynamic simulations to do so a 21 year long series observed at milan monviso raingauge was used model comparison evidences a satisfactory agreement between models new hydrological insights for the region although the total annual precipitation is not expected to change relevant increases in flood frequencies are predicted such increases vary between 10 20 and appear to be independent of the return period thus great concerns arise for the existing urban drainage systems located in northwestern italy which should basically be unable to face these flood frequency changes a leading role is played by the intensification of summer and spring storms both in terms of increase in volumes and decrease in durations moreover changes in the dependence structure have a significant impact when summer storms are considered conversely flood frequency curves are far less sensitive to the storm temporal structures featuring other seasons these results can be explained by considering the seasonal distribution of storms critical for urban drainage systems keywords bivariate distributions copula functions climate change seasonal non stationarities flood frequency urban drainage systems 1 introduction climate change potential consequences on water resource availability and on extreme events control have increased the debate in the scientific community involved in hydrological sciences and in the design of hydraulic structures indeed the level of awareness of forthcoming hazards has risen after reading the fourth assessment report published by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 and even more after the fifth report ipcc 2014 that confirmed the conclusions regarding the extreme events non stationarity in particular changes in extreme events play a crucial role owing to their stronger impact on societies and ecosystems compared to that related to changes in mean climate characteristics seneviratne et al 2012 in this study the attention focuses on heavy storm non stationarity and their impact on urban drainage systems the necessity to better investigate this issue arises by acknowledging that heavy storms often show disproportionately greater increases with respect to mean precipitations hartmann et al 2013 this occurrence was noticed in many mid latitude regions between 1951 and 2003 even where there had been a reduction of the annual precipitation amount indeed in regions with sufficiently long data series increases in heavy storms have been detected since the late 19th century heavy storms nevertheless feature a less coherent spatial pattern than other climatic variables namely temperatures alexander et al 2006 donat et al 2013b the spatial variability within and among climate regions is such that detecting a simple global trend is quite difficult this variability actually involves both confidence and seasonality on a global scale heavy storm trends can show moderate confidence not higher than the trends for medium precipitation values nevertheless in europe mediterranean sea and north america statistically likely increasing trends were detected in terms of frequency and intensities pryor et al 2009 zolina et al 2009 van den besselaar et al 2012 donat 2013a skansi et al 2013 villarini et al 2013 westra et al 2013 thus the global trend must be regarded as likely increasing trends in more regions than decreasing or non significantly increasing trends in addition seasonality plays a crucial role for instance in europe most of increasing trends were observed in winter but not in northern italy poland and some mediterranean sub regions pavan et al 2008 lupikasza 2010 toreti et al 2010 the above mentioned studies mainly refer to daily precipitation extremes unfortunately the number of studies dealing with sub daily heavy storms is quite limited and their results expressed in terms of variations and spatial patterns depend on the event definition and duration hartmann et al 2013 hence global trends of sub daily heavy storms are more complex to interpret with respect to the daily ones studies regarding impacts of climate change on urban drainage systems however indicate that increases in sub daily storm intensities can potentially range between 10 and 60 from the recent past 1961 1990 up to 2100 willems et al 2012 these short duration storms are of major interest for urban hydrologic applications because they are basically critical for conventional drainage systems owing to their relatively limited extensions strong impermeabilization of the catchment surfaces and the presence of an efficient drainage network most of urban watersheds are characterized by short response times i e times of concentration thus heavy storms featuring hourly or sub hourly durations can yield peak discharges capable to exceed the conveyance capacity of the drainage networks in the regions or sub regions where heavy storm increases of this magnitude are predicted a serious concern regarding the ability of urban drainage systems to face the climate change impact therefore arises pagliara et al 1998 these impacts could consist in increases in the frequency and the severity of both urban floodings water loggings and disposals of untreated pollutant loads into receiving waters through combined sewer overflows revi et al 2014 salerno et al 2018 depending on system characteristics these impacts may rise up to 400 in terms of frequencies and volumes as a result of the highly non linear response of drainage networks to storms willems and vrac 2011 willems et al 2012 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 willems 2013 in consideration of these global warnings and the widespread perception of an increasing trend in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events the development of design verification methodologies for urban drainage systems capable of straightforwardly implementing storm non stationarities is crucial thus a research gap remains to be filled indeed popular design and verification methodologies namely the design storm approaches rely on synthetic storms derived from the depth duration frequency curves whose time patterns are arbitrarily set aiming at maximizing the hydrologic load to the analyzed structure akan and houghtalen 2003 the basic hypothesis of design event methods states that the hydrograph derived through a hydrologic model has the same return period as the synthetic storm generating it depth duration frequency curves however rely on annual maxima statistics of storm volumes defined with respect to conventional durations this makes it impossible to account for the natural variability of other climatic aspects relevant to urban runoff management purposes such as the storm duration the antecedent dry weather period and the time pattern furthermore heavy storms that could be critical to drainage systems are excluded from the event sample if they feature volumes that are slightly less than the annual maximum these drawbacks have already been broadly discussed in the most recent literature adams and howard 1986 guo and adams 1998 according to which the basic hypothesis is conceptually wrong thus design event methods basically lead to biased estimates of the drainage system performances besides they make it difficult to effectively translate in comprehensive future scenarios the expected precipitation characteristic trends as previously discussed such trends are based on climate change observations which can involve likely increases in storm intensities along with decreases or non significant changes in storm volumes this can be explained by advocating decreases in wet weather durations hence representative modelling strategies should rely at least on bivariate statistical approaches accounting for both storm variables moreover predicted changes in the seasonality of the precipitation regime cannot be straightforwardly represented by annual maximum statistics suitable solutions are instead provided by continuous approaches where multiple aspects of the storm process can be explicitly considered these categories include i semi probabilistic methods first introduced by eagleson 1972 successively re proposed by adams and papa 2000 and applied in several urban drainage problems guo and adams 1998 raimondi and becciu 2014 balistrocchi et al 2013 zhang and guo 2015 hassini and guo 2017 ii stochastic approaches analytically derived wang and guo 2018 or relying on monte carlo simulation techniques dotto et al 2012 barone et al 2019 and hydrologic hydraulic continuous simulations elliott and trowsdale 2007 among them the monte carlo simulation techniques have been exploited much less even though they bear several conceptual and practical advantages with respect to the others firstly semi probabilistic methods provide analytical closed form distributions of the runoff variables this can nevertheless be achieved by assuming that the storm variables are mutually independent and often exponentially distributed both hypotheses do not always suit the empirical evidence in particular the first one hence the semi probabilistic method reliability can be justified by advocating error compensations conversely complex multivariate probability functions closely suiting the empirical distributions can be implemented in monte carlo simulations to do so copula functions recently introduced in the hydrologic research favre et al 2004 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 dupuis 2007 salvadori et al 2007 provide a remarkable improvement of the inference capability by separating the assessment of the dependence structure from those of the marginal distributions therefore the dependence structure analysis is no longer affected by the marginal behaviors and copula functions and marginal distributions belonging to different probability families can be combined the assessment procedure becomes straightforward thereby eliminating additional sources of uncertainty and making it possible to effectively verify the model reliability by statistical tests owing to the numerical derivation technique more complex rainfall runoff transformation models capable of better suiting the real word hydrology and hydraulics can be implemented the derivation procedure is still conceptually correct as well as in the semi probabilistic methods secondly if suitable rainfall runoff transformations models are used monte carlo simulations are less computationally intensive than hydrologic hydraulic continuous simulations and are parametrically parsimonious thus diminishing model uncertainties analogously to semi probabilistic methods they are generally applicable whereas outcomes of hydrologic hydraulic continuous simulations are site specific with regard to the assessment of climate change impacts on urban drainage systems transformations of long term series of observed precipitations are very complex since they should involve the implementation of different seasonal projections of multiple aspects of the storm events therefore most studies exploited hydrodynamic model simulations by simply applying a constant multiplier or different seasonal or monthly multipliers to the observed precipitation time series semadeni davies et al 2008 dong et al 2017 salerno et al 2018 thus only precipitation volume non stationarity is properly accounted for while other characteristics of the precipitation process remain unchanged on the contrary monte carlo simulations based on copulas would make it possible to easily implement complex projections by separately modifying the parameterizations of the single probability functions that compose the storm multivariate distribution as well as the annual or seasonal number of storms herein a procedure to derive flood frequency curves ffcs for small medium sized urban watersheds 10 100 ha by means of a bivariate monte carlo simulation technique is developed differently from previous studies guo and adams 1998 1999 balistrocchi et al 2013 the derivation procedure of flood frequency curves implements i a more severe routing scheme than that first suggested by wycoff and sing 1976 ii a more realistic representation of the dependence relating storm volumes to wet weather durations and iii the seasonal variability of the temporal structure of storms the model application is carried out with reference to the monviso raingauge located in milan northwestern italy a 21 year long series of observed precipitation volumes recorded every 15 is available and can be used to define the present scenario becciu and raimondi 2012 in this sub region likely increases in daily heavy storm intensities and the absence of a significant trend of storm volumes were observed in the period between 1800 2003 brunetti et al 2006a brunetti et al 2006c ranzi et al 2018 climate change projections obtained by downscaling climate simulations confirm that significant trends depending on the season are expected within the 21st century bucchignani et al 2016 zollo et al 2016 the model reliability is then verified by building flood frequency curves through continuous simulations the epa storm water management model swmm environmental protection agency 2015 is the model assumed as a benchmark and used for the simulations the paper is organized as follows i in section 2 the stochastic methodology herein proposed to derive flood frequency curves is illustrated ii in section 3 present and future scenarios are defined with regard to available data and the existing literature on sub regional precipitation trends iii in section 4 flood frequency curves derived by using both the proposed stochastic methodology and the hydrologic hydraulic continuous simulations are compared finally changes in flood frequency assessed in this sub region are discussed 2 materials and methods the natural variability of precipitation events is herein represented through a bivariate joint distribution function jdf phd of storm volume h and wet weather duration d which are assumed to be mutually dependent random variables according to the sklar theorem sklar 1959 phd can be decomposed in terms of equation 1 where cθ is the copula function while ph and pd are the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the marginal variables h and d respectively 1 p h d h d c θ p h h p d d the copula function cθ is defined in the unitary square i 0 1 2 with respect to a couple of uniformly distributed random variables u and v which are related to the storm variables through the probability integral transforms shown in eq 2 owing to this definition cθ is independent of the marginal cdfs and is exclusively an expression of the dependence structure salvadori et al 2007 2 c θ u v i 2 i w i t h u p h h a n d v p d d according to equation 1 jdf pieces can be assessed separately from the others and can belong to different probability families to associate the event probabilities to return periods the variability of the number of independent events occurring in a given time period must however be estimated the issues related to the function selection and parameter calibration are thoroughly discussed in the following sub sections 2 1 independent event sampling the sampling of individual independent precipitation events from a continuous series can be performed by applying two discretization thresholds an interevent time definition todorovic 1978 and a storm volume threshold bacchi et al 2008 the first parameter represents the minimum dry weather period needed for two subsequent precipitation bursts to be considered independent the second parameter corresponds to the minimum precipitation volume that must be exceeded to have a storm relevant to the analysis purposes both sampling parameters can be selected through operative criteria suiting the dynamics of the analyzed runoff process dealing with drainage systems the interevent time definition must be long enough for two subsequent storms to produce non overlapping hydrographs while the minimum storm volume can be identified with the initial abstraction of the watershed hydrological losses according to this sampling procedure the precipitation bursts are aggregated into independent storms if they are separated by a dry weather period less than the interevent time definition the wet weather duration d is computed from the beginning of the first one and the end of the last one then if the total volume h of the bursts included in the wet weather duration is less than the storm volume threshold the event is suppressed and its wet weather duration is joined to the adjacent dry weather periods otherwise it is included in the independent event sample to account for seasonality the independent storms sampled by this procedure must be classified with respect to their calendar occurrence so that four samples of seasonal events can be derived the sampling procedure yields the number of events occurring in each season as well the estimate of the average seasonal number of events ω can therefore be obtained 2 2 dependence structure modeling the dependence structure is herein modeled by using the gumbel hougaard copula which provides a suitable model to represent the dependence structure of storm volumes and wet weather durations in various climates zhang and singh 2007 balistrocchi and bacchi 2011 fu and kapelan 2013 this is an extreme value and mono parametric copula belonging to the archimedean family which suits symmetric and concordant associations the bivariate members of this family are written in terms of eq 3 where θ represents the dependence parameter which is a function of the association strength 3 c θ u v exp ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ in this copula θ must be greater than or equal to one and is algebraically related to the kendall coefficient τk through relationship 4 so that the stronger the concordance the larger θ is however the gumbel hougaard copula is comprehensive of the independence copula which is obtained when τk is zero and θ equals one 4 τ k θ 1 θ w i t h θ 1 the gumbel hougaard copula features an upper tail dependence coefficient λu increasing with θ according to eq 5 the lower tail dependence coefficient is instead null consequently a tendency to generate strongly concordant events arises in the upper tail on the contrary in the lower tail events are almost independent 5 λ u 2 2 1 θ to fit the theoretical copula function c θ to data leaving apart the marginal distribution assessments the maximum pseudo likelihood method and the moment like method can be utilized genest and favre 2007 the second method can be exploited in bivariate cases when the copula is mono parametric and greatly reduces the fitting computational burden the fitting procedure can be carried out through the explicit algebraic relationship between the kendall rank correlation coefficient τk and the dependence parameter θ pseudo observations are sample versions of the uniform random variables and can be estimated as weibull plotting positions of the sample variable occurrences of storm volume h ˆ i and of wet weather duration d ˆ i as defined in eq 6 where the rank function applies to the sample sorted in ascending order to verify the goodness of fit of c θ the sample joint variability can be expressed through the empirical copula cn which is a consistent non parametric estimator of the underlying dependence structure in the bivariate case cn can be written in terms of eq 6 by using the indicator function 1 6 c n u v 1 n i 1 n 1 u ˆ i u v ˆ i v w h e r e u ˆ i r a n k h ˆ i n 1 a n d v ˆ i r a n k d ˆ i n 1 an accurate evaluation of the goodness of fit can however be achieved by test statistics in this regard the tested null hypothesis is that the underlying copula is the selected theoretical copula function c θ to do so an effective blanket test was developed by genest et al 2009 to assess the global adaptation of the selected theoretical copula to the empirical one in this test the residuals between the theoretical copula 3 and the empirical copula 6 are summarized in a cramer von mises statistics sn 7 7 s n i 1 n c n u ˆ i v ˆ i c θ u ˆ i v ˆ i 2 by using conditional approaches a number of pseudo observation samples can be generated according to the null hypothesis so that statistics sn k can be assessed by eq 7 for every k th simulated sample an empirical estimate p value of the test significance according to which the null hypothesis cannot be rejected is hence given by expression 8 where n is the number of simulation runs much larger than sample size n 8 p v a l u e 1 n k 1 n 1 s n k s n in addition to the global goodness of fit a particular attention must be paid to the tail behaviors poulin et al 2007 since these aspects are crucial to achieve a reliable return period estimate indeed several empirical estimators of the tail coefficients were developed frahm et al 2005 unfortunately they can only provide a comparison with the theoretical coefficients and are strongly biased if the upper tail dependence does not exist or exhibits a high variance serinaldi 2015 in this study χ plots developed by fisher and switzer 1985 were preferred because they provide an effective tool to analyze the existence and the strength of both upper and lower tail dependences a χ plot is a scatterplot of the departure from bivariate independence χ versus the distance from the bivariate median λ and unlike other graphical tools for bivariate copula assessment these rank based plots clearly evidence distinctive patterns and clustering depending only on the underlying copula to make the test significance evident fisher and switzer 2001 determined χ boundary limits for statistical independence which can be expressed as the reciprocal of the sample size square root and a parameter function of the test significance as suggested by abberger 2005 this test naturally subdivides the complete data scatter into four subsets with respect to quadrants centered in the bivariate median and it can be used to make evident tail dependences when data only from the upper right quadrant are used to construct the χ plot the upper tail dependence properties are depicted the same occurs for the lower tail dependence by using data from the lower left quadrant in addition to these visual assessments a quantitative evaluation of the upper tail dependence coefficient of the empirical copula λ ˆ u is herein carried out by using the non parametric estimator 9 if the empirical copula is properly fitted by a gumbel hougaard copula function λ ˆ u can appropriately be compared to the theoretical value 5 since frahm et al 2005 demonstrated that it performs well when the upper tail dependence exists conversely if the tail association is expected to be negligible the estimator 9 leads to strongly biased estimates so that the equality between the theoretical coefficient 5 and the empirical coefficient 9 must be regarded as a necessary condition for the suitability of the selected copula model 9 λ ˆ u 2 2 exp 1 n i 1 n log log 1 u ˆ i log 1 v ˆ i log 1 max u ˆ i v ˆ i 2 2 3 marginal distribution modeling probability distribution functions popularly adopted in the hydrologic practice were found to be suitable to fit the observed empirical distributions namely the weibull and the generalized pareto distributions for the storm volumes and the gamma and the log normal distributions for the wet weather durations their expressions and parameters are listed in table 1 further details can be found in kottegoda and rosso 2008 in accordance with the event sampling procedure a lower limit x0 is introduced in all the storm volume cdfs this location parameter must not be estimated as it is equal to the storm volume threshold ia so that all probability functions feature two calibration parameters using two parameter distribution functions is a key aspect in order to decrease the uncertainty in the implementation of climate change scenarios projections usually involve at most two conditions one on the mean and the other on the variance or alternatively on upper percentiles different functions were selected with regard to the variable and the season aiming at improving the goodness of fit the kolmogorov smirnov and the anderson darling statistical tests were performed to quantify the adaptation of the selected theoretical cdfs to their empirical counterparts in particular the kolmogorov smirnov test focuses on the global adaptation while the anderson darling test better investigates the tails adaptation 2 4 stochastic generation of flood frequency curves to derive peak discharges from an input rainfall event a simplified lumped hydrological model similar to those commonly adopted in practical applications of urban hydrology is herein exploited in order to approximate the natural depletion of the hydrological losses during the wet weather period the rainfall excess hr 10 is evaluated by means of a runoff coefficient φ applied to the rainfall portion that exceeds the initial abstraction ia this parameter was chosen in accordance with the volume threshold of the discretization procedure consequently the number of storm events ω equals the number of flood events 10 h r φ h ia a popular schematization of the storm flood routing process is based on the assumption first prosed by wycoff and singh 1976 according to which the flood hydrograph can be represented by a triangle featuring a volume equal to the storm excess and a finite base time that is given by the sum of the storm duration and the catchment time of concentration this assumption makes it possible to analytically derive the flood frequency distribution guo and adams 1998 1999 balistrocchi et al 2013 however a more realistic routing scheme can be implemented in a numerical derivation procedure since the hydrograph base time is more suitably assessed by the sum of the storm excess duration dr and the catchment time of concentration tc to evaluate dr a shape must be given to the storm time pattern aiming at generating synthetic events critical to urban drainage systems an isosceles triangular time pattern can be adopted the storm excess duration can therefore be estimated by multiplying the wet weather duration d by the reduction coefficient ςh defined in eq 11 11 ς h 1 ia 2 h the runoff volume 10 must equal the flood hydrograph volume so that the specific peak discharge q can be expressed in terms of the storm random variables h and d as shown in eq 12 12 q h d 2 h r d r t c 2 φ h ia ς h d t c eq 12 is suitable for the application of the derived distribution theory so that the cdf of the peak discharge pq is directly expressed as a function of the natural variability of the bivariate jdf of the storm variables indeed such a model can be considered acceptable with regard to the urban application objectives which allow to adopt simplified lumped approaches for the representation of the hydrological processes its reliability is however supported by comparison with hydrologic continuous simulations according to the monte carlo simulation technique a number of couples of uniform variables u v can be generated from the copula function 3 by using conditional approaches salvadori and de michele 2006 salvadori et al 2007 these couples can then be converted in the corresponding natural counterparts by inverting the marginal cdfs by using eq 12 a univariate sample of peak discharges qi is finally derived the generation can be distinguished to account for seasonality by fitting different copulas with respect to seasonal samples and by taking into consideration the corresponding average seasonal event numbers ω the annual sample is then obtained by joining the seasonal ones hence a flood frequency distribution ffc can be derived by means of eq 13 where weibull plotting positions fi of these generated occurrences are expressed in terms of the return period ti by accounting for the average annual event number ωy given by the sum of the average seasonal numbers of flood events 13 t i 1 ω y 1 f i 3 rainfall data and precipitation scenarios the present scenario sc0 was defined with regard to a continuous precipitation series observed at the rain gauge of via monviso milan northwestern italy the precipitation was recorded at a 15 time step for 21 years between 1971 and 1991 this raingauge belongs to the northwestern climate sub region nw according to the analysis by brunetti et al 2006b as shown in fig 1 bearing in mind applications to small medium size urban catchments 10 100 ha the sampling of the individual independent events from the continuous record was carried out by using an interevent time definition of 3 h and an initial abstraction ia of 5 mm in these kinds of watersheds times of concentrations shorter than 1 h are expected so that the minimum interevent time definition suggested in the literature adams and papa 2000 can be used to ensure that two subsequent rainfalls do not generate overlapping hydrographs in addition owing to the high soil sealing levels a minimal volume threshold is needed for rainfall to exceed the interception and surface storage losses 3 1 present scenario a summary of statistics of the storm events sampled according to these parameter values is reported in table 1 statistics are estimated for the seasonal samples and the whole annual sample aiming at evidencing the main characteristics of the precipitation regime in table 2 values of the number of events ω ˆ the storm volume μ ˆ h and the wet weather duration μ ˆ d are listed along with the kendall coefficient τ ˆ k the last column reports the total precipitation volume hm averagely estimated in the various period these mean values express the rainfall regime traditionally depicted for this climatic region referred to as sub alpine regime bandini 1931 the total amount of annual precipitation is about 900 mm distributed in two wet seasons and two dry seasons the main wet season is spring when most of the events occur but storm volumes are smaller and wet weather durations are shorter than in the other seasons autumn instead represents the secondary rainy season due to a lower number of events but featured by larger volumes and durations than in spring summer and winter differ not only in terms of the total amount of precipitation volumes since the first is the secondary minimum while the second is the primary minimum but also in the event number and wet weather durations in fact summer features shorter and more frequent storms than winter in particular winter wet weather durations are the longest this precipitation regime can be explained by considering that during the warm seasons convective storms are common and short duration events can easily bear large volumes conversely during the cool seasons such events are almost absent and the precipitation is mainly driven by frontal events these characteristics have consequences on the dependence strength as well all seasonal samples show concordant associations though winter events feature a very strong dependence while summer events feature a quite weak dependence an intermediate and similar association is instead shown by the wet seasons indeed short duration storms are characterized by a wider variability with respect to long duration storms as they can be produced by both intense convective events and minor frontal events the association between storm volumes and wet weather durations is therefore weaker than that of the long duration storms hence smaller kendall coefficients are thus assessed during the seasons where short duration storms a more frequent as can be noticed by comparing the seasonal values to the annual ones the wet weather duration and the association strength appear to be particularly sensitive to seasonality for instance summer wet weather durations on average amount to 25 of the winter ones and to 50 of the annual ones furthermore the association strength of winter storm variables is double the annual one the suitability of assessing the pieces of jdf 1 with respect to seasonal samples is therefore clearly supported in fact when a storm seasonality of this magnitude is disregarded ffc derivations basically lead to appreciable underestimations of the peak discharges the dependence parameters estimated by using the moment like criterion based on eq 4 are reported in table 3 along with the results of the statistical tests carried out to evaluate the global goodness of fit as can be seen the gumbel hougaard copula demonstrates a satisfactory capability to suit the empirical copula in all seasons due to low sn values yielding high p values after 105 simulation runs the null hypotheses cannot be rejected with significances routinely adopted in hydrology since p values are larger than 5 10 at least the χ plots investigating the lower tails and the upper tails in the seasonal samples are plotted in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively in these plots boundary limits for independence refer to a 10 test significance to provide a more effective interpretation of these χ plots scatter plots derived from 500 size simulated samples are added to the observed ones in every season the hypothesis of lower tail independence cannot be rejected in spring fig 2b in summer fig 2c and in autumn fig 2d since observations are close to the λ axis and are included mostly in the confidence boundaries fig 2a instead deserves a deeper discussion since a significant amount of observations places out of the upper confidence limit this is mainly due to the high strength of the overall association that generally leads to larger χ values however maximum χ values are less than 0 50 and always decrease as λ increases moreover the fitted gumbel hougaard copula appears to be able to satisfactorily mimic the empirical χ plot since simulations completely overlap observations this also applies to the other χ plots depicting a general suitability of the tested copula to represent the lower tail behavior conversely the upper tail independence hypotheses can definitively be rejected in winter fig 3a in spring fig 3b and in autumn fig 3d for most of the scatter points are not included in the confidence region testing independence in the summer case the overall weak association yields a consistently weak upper tail dependence so that most of observations remains in the confidence region fig 3c the χ values exceeding the upper confidence limit nevertheless occur for the largest λ values this reveals a moderate tendency of the empirical copula to generate associated values in the upper tail as in the lower tail case the upper tail dependence appears to be well represented by the gumbel hougaard copula as simulations fittingly overlap observations in all panels of fig 3 by rejecting the hypotheses of upper tail independence the comparison of the theoretical value assessed by eq 5 and the empirical values assessed by estimator 9 of the upper tail coefficients becomes meaningful such values are reported in table 3 as well showing a satisfactory agreement between the theoretical and the empirical coefficients finally in table 4 and in table 5 the selected marginal distribution functions are listed along with parameter values estimated by means of the maximum likelihood criterion and test statistics dmax and a2 resulting from the kolmogorov smirnov and the anderson darling tests the corresponding critical limits dn α and a α 2 refer to a significance α equal to 10 as can be seen all selected distributions cannot be rejected according to both tests since test statistics are systematically less than the allowed maxima in general the weibull distribution and the gamma distribution are recognized as suitable models for the storm volume and the wet weather duration marginal cdfs respectively exceptions are given by the spring storm volumes and the summer wet weather durations for which more satisfactory fits were achieved by using the generalized pareto distribution and the log normal distribution in both cases a little more skewed distribution was needed to better suit the upper tail behavior 3 2 climate change scenarios changes in the frequency of extremes can be modeled by shifting the overall probability distribution simolo et al 2011 when dealing with threshold exceedance frequency and duration mainly related to departures from mean values however changes in high percentile events which are of major interest in assessing the hydrologic loads on urban drainage systems can be represented by changes in the scale parameter and in the shape parameter of the probability distributions della marta et al 2007 in this study to develop climate change scenarios consistent with seasonal expected trends in northwestern italy both methodologies were utilized hence with respect to the present scenario sc0 three change types were implemented in the storm stochastic structure according to the following changes in the seasonal marginal cdfs and in the copula functions changes in storm volume distributions i decrease of 10 in the mean and increase of 5 in the 95 percentile of winter storms ii increase of 15 in the mean of spring storm volumes iii increase of 10 in the mean of summer storm volumes iv decrease of 10 in the mean of autumn storm volumes changes in wet weather duration distributions i decrease of 5 in the mean of winter wet weather durations ii decrease of 10 in the mean of spring wet weather durations iii decrease of 15 in the mean of summer wet weather durations iv decrease of 10 in the mean of autumn wet weather durations changes in the dependence structure i decrease of 10 in the dependence parameter of winter storms ii increase of 5 in the dependence parameter of spring storms iii decrease of 2 5 in the dependence parameter of summer storms iv decrease of 2 5 in the dependence parameter of autumn storms changes in storm volumes are supported by forecasts formulated by ipcc future scenarios in particular report ar4 ipcc 2007 and confirmed by the following studies ipcc 2014 bucchignani et al 2016 as can be noticed changes mainly involve a redistribution of storm volumes among seasons maintaining the total amount of annual precipitation virtually constant changes in wet weather durations are instead established with regard to a certain number of regional studies concerning trend analyses of daily precipitation series observed in italy from 1800 to 2003 brunetti et al 2006a brunetti et al 2006c according to such studies an average annual decrease of 10 can be expected in northwestern italy see fig 1 for the wet weather durations of daily precipitations therefore changes considered in this study must be regarded as moderately conservative since greater decreases should feature sub daily storms this average annual change is modulated with respect to the season by accounting for moderately greater decreases in those seasons where short duration storms are more frequent in particular summer changes in the marginal distributions can be implemented in jdf 1 independently of those expected for the dependence structure by modifying the corresponding marginal cdfs a further advantage arises from the utilization of two parameter marginal cdfs that makes this implementation actually straightforward in northern italy s climatic region there are no studies that can address the choice of potential changes in the dependence structure of storm variables nevertheless it is not reasonable to expect a modification of the type of dependence structure that is of the copula model but only changes in the dependence strength this assumption is adopted for instance by vinnarasi and dhanya 2019 who observed a decreasing trend in the dependence parameter of the frank copula that relates storm intensities to wet weather durations in bangalore in general the less the dependence strength between the storm volumes and the wet weather durations is the larger the estimated peak discharges are balistrocchi and bacchi 2017 aiming at evidencing the advantages of the proposed stochastic methodology and by evaluating the impact of changes in the storm structure on flood frequency a reasonable scenario can however be derived by the assessment of trends in the monviso rainfall series by using a mobile window equal to five years a slight decreasing trend in the kendall coefficient is evidenced for the annual samples nevertheless when annual samples are separated into seasonal samples only summer storms show such a behavior winter storms and autumn storms instead show more marked decreasing trends the first being the strongest one while spring storms show a moderate increase such results addressed the previously outlined changes in the dependence strength climate change scenarios are therefore developed as follows scenario 1 sc1 accounts only for trends in the storm volume cdfs scenario 2 sc2 accounts for both trends in the marginal cdfs and scenario 3 sc3 accounts for trends in the marginal cdfs and in the dependence structure scenario 1 is intended to evaluate the ffc trend in the sub regions of northern italy where wet weather duration trends are not expected distinguishing between scenario 2 and scenario 3 makes it possible to quantify the effect of disregarding changes in the storm variable dependence structure on flood frequency 4 results and discussion the proposed stochastic methodology was initially tested by model comparison this is a broadly used approach to validate derived models that are applied to urban drainage systems guo and adams 1998 1999 balistrocchi et al 2009 zhang and guo 2014 2015 wang and guo 2019 due to the general scarcity of long term series of observed discharges a benchmarking reference was set up through continuous simulations of a hydrodynamic model developed in swmm environmental protection agency 2015 with regard to a hypothetical but realistic test case the stochastic methodology was then applied to various watershed outlets according to the climate change scenarios delineated in section 3 2 4 1 stochastic model verification the test watershed delineates a recurrent runoff management strategy adopted in urban drainage systems as can be seen in fig 4 where the topologic scheme of the drainage network is illustrated secondary parallel pipes connect to a main interception conduit this conduit features a larger cross section and a lower slope than secondary pipes the total catchment area amounts to 100 ha and is subdivided in ten sub basins major sub basins drain into the secondary pipes and are approximated to rectangular plains symmetrically sloping towards to a central gutter flow path minor sub basins directly drain into the interception conduit and are approximated to rectangular plains completely located on the left hand side of the gutter flow path overland flow widths are therefore estimated as twice and equal to the gutter path length for major sub basins and minor sub basins respectively the hydrologic losses that occurr in the permeable areas were estimated by using the curve number method details regarding the hydrologic and hydraulic characteristics of sub basins and pipes implemented in the swmm hydrodynamic model are provided in fig 4 as well the parameterization of the stochastic model was carried out aiming at maximizing the consistency with hydrodynamic simulations in particular the runoff coefficient φ defined in eq 10 was set with regard to the discretization procedure described in section 2 1 hence the rainfall excess series was obtained from the rainfall series by subtracting the hydrologic losses from the independent storm events separated by an interevent time definition of 3 h the runoff coefficient was set in order to obtain for the complete observation period a ratio between the runoff volume and the rainfall volume equal to that resulting from swmm continuous simulations since it is applied only to the rainfall portion exceeding the initial abstraction this runoff coefficient is basically larger than those usually adopted in urban drainage systems which apply to the total rainfall volume the watershed time of concentration tc was estimated by using eq 14 as the sum of the time needed for the runoff to enter the drainage network te and the time needed for the channelized runoff to reach the outlet section through the longest hydraulic path the second addend is computed as the sum of the delivery times of the single pipes estimated as the ratio between pipe length lj and flow velocity vj 14 t c t e j l j v j with the aim of highlighting a potential influence of the watershed size on the agreement between the hydrodynamic model and the stochastic model ffcs were derived for three control sections depicted in fig 4 corresponding to catchment areas equal to 10 ha section s1 50 ha section s2 and 100 ha section s3 corresponding calibration parameters are listed in table 6 times of concentrations were set by adopting 10 min for te and 1 5 m s for velocities vj in particular the first is suggested in northern italy climate for urban watershed practical applications centro studi idraulica urbana csdu 1997 whereas the latter is intended to represent runoff delivery velocities related to the most frequent storms that features low moderate intensities a runoff coefficient φ equal to 0 75 coupled with an initial abstraction ia equal to 5 mm yields a ratio between the total runoff volume and the total rainfall volume of 50 3 that is consistent with that obtained through the hydrodynamic simulation assessed at 50 5 monte carlo simulations were conducted by generating 2 5 104 years of storm volume and wet weather duration couples in accordance with the parameter set reported from table 2 to table 5 sc0 such couples were transformed in peak discharges by using eq 12 and associated with the corresponding return period by using eq 13 the continuous flow discharge series simulated in the three analyzed sections by swmm were separated into independent runoff events by using a threshold discharge and an interevent time definition equal to 3 h the threshold discharges were set at a few hundreds of liters per second to purge out of the series the insignificant low flow the interevent time definition is consistent with that used in the rainfall series analysis the visual comparison of the ffcs is provided in fig 5 and performance measures of the stochastic model are listed in table 6 as can be seen in fig 5 ffcs derived by the proposed stochastic model mc and by continuous hydrodynamic simulations swmm depict similar trends assessments are particularly close for the peak discharges featuring return periods greater than 2 years which are of major interest for practical application purposes the satisfactory agreement is also evidenced by the root mean square errors rmse reported in table 6 which can be considered acceptable with respect to the order of magnitude of the peak discharges the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse that is a normalized version of the mean square error further confirms this performance evaluation due to values always larger than 0 80 an additional quantitative evaluation of the stochastic model performances is provided by the pearson linear correlation coefficient lcc whose values are satisfactorily near to unity 4 2 stochastic model application in fig 6 ffcs derived by means of the stochastic procedure in accordance with the described scenarios of climate change are compared to those derived in accordance with the present climate sc0 such examples refer to the three sections of the test watershed table 6 used in section 4 2 to verify the soundness of the stochastic model as can be seen all climate change scenarios determine significant increases in the flood frequency whose percentage values appear to be almost constant with respect to both the return period and the catchment area with regard to the return period range of major interest for urban practical applications 2 20 years sc1 yields percentage increases of about 10 12 with respect to sc0 ffcs moreover when sc1 and sc2 are compared additional percentage increases in the flood frequency ranging between 10 12 arise thus the total percentage increases reach 20 24 with respect to sc0 more limited increments are instead predicted if changes in the volume duration dependence structure are considered if ffcs derived for sc2 and sc3 are compared additional percentage increases range between 5 6 so that the total percentage increase with respect to sc0 is estimated at 28 29 this result can be explained by considering that ffcs in urban watersheds are mainly determined by short duration storms in this climate such storms mainly occur in summer and subordinately in spring and autumn a very moderate change was adopted for summer and opposite change trends were implemented for spring storms and autumn storms in the monte carlo generation procedure such results however demonstrate that moderate changes in the temporal structure of storms have dramatic impacts on flood frequency in urban watersheds and that the expected increases in the peak discharges are at least of the same magnitude as those due to changes in the storm volume seasonality in order to demonstrate the significance of the predicted increases regarding the runoff management in urban watersheds a term of comparison is provided by the conveyance capacities of conventional drainage systems to do so one can refer to the ratio between the peak discharge and the full normal flow discharge which expresses the pipe conveyance capacity this ratio is routinely included in the safety range spanning from 0 70 to 0 80 in order the conveyance capacity to be considered suitably sized assuming that a drainage pipe is included in the safety range under the present scenario sc0 the ratio increases up to 0 78 0 90 according to sc1 up to 0 85 0 98 according to sc2 and up to 0 90 1 03 according to sc3 these ranges therefore predict situations in which drainage pipes are undersized or heavily undersized with respect to the original design return period to better investigate the impact of potential changes in the dependence structure of storm variables on flood frequency a sensitivity analysis was conducted by individually changing the seasonal kendall coefficients within the maximum possible range hence the independence τk 0 and the analytical concordant association τk 1 were implemented into the stochastic derivation procedure by substituting the gumbel hougaard copula with the product copula π2 copula and the upper boundary copula m2 copula respectively results are illustrated in fig 7 where ffcs derived according to these assumptions are compared to the those derived by keeping the dependence structure stationary sc2 in all cases the decrease in the association strength leads to an increase in the flood frequency while the contrary occurs when the association is increased nevertheless impacts on ffcs are highly different with regard to the season the most relevant impact is evidenced in summer fig 7c when the largest variation can be observed in particular the independence assumption leads to an increase of 56 5 and the analytical concordant association leads to a decrease of 50 0 in the peak discharges this outcome can be explained by considering that the majority of short duration and intense storms occur in this season such a kind of storm is the most critical for the watersheds herein analyzed which are characterized by times of concentration less than an hour conversely the impact of dependence strength changes in winter appears to be definitively negligible fig 7a this season is actually rich in stratiform storms which are not able to significantly force the urban drainage system due to their basically long durations coupled with low intensities intermediate results are shown in spring fig 7b and in autumn fig 7d which feature a mixture of stratiform storms and convective storms in both seasons the most relevant impact is due to the independence assumption which would yield a marked increase in the peak discharges of 40 0 when spring is considered a modest increase of about 12 5 is instead predicted by neglecting the association strength in autumn the almost null effect of the association strength increase can be explained by the modest impact that the storms belonging to these seasons have on the ffcs and by the moderately high concordance that already characterizes the observed samples in general it must be concluded that individual seasonal trends in the storm volume and wet weather durations can have dramatic consequences on the flood frequency when the season featuring the majority of the storms critical to the analyzed drainage system is taken into consideration 5 conclusions in this paper a stochastic methodology to derive flood frequency distributions from precipitation inputs in small medium sized urban watersheds that is featuring catchment areas between 10 ha and 100 ha was proposed a bivariate approach incorporating the seasonality of storm volumes and wet weather durations was implemented in a computationally cheap simulation procedure section 2 this procedure was applied and tested with reference to an urban watershed located in northwestern italy in this climate a 21 year long series of precipitation volumes recorded every 15 is available milan monviso raingauge copula functions were exploited to carry out a comprehensive seasonal investigation of the precipitation temporal structure section 3 1 in this regard the distribution of convective storms is acknowledged as a fundamental factor affecting both the overall dependence strength and the scale parameters of the marginal variables copulas were used to construct joint distribution functions satisfactorily suiting the empirical distributions of the storm event variables in particular members of the gumbel hougaard family were found to provide suitable representations of the global dependence structures table 3 the lower tail dependences fig 2 and the upper tail dependences fig 3 in all seasons the overall model reliability was verified with respect to hydrologic hydraulic continuous simulations conducted by using epa swmm fig 5 even if a simplified precipitation runoff transformation model was implemented in the stochastic derivation procedure its flood frequency curves demonstrated to be in close agreement with those derived by a hydrologic hydraulic model at spatial scales ranging from 10 ha and 100 ha considering the magnitude of the peak discharges related to the tested urban watershed estimate errors are found to be acceptable potential impacts of climate change on the flood frequency distributions were estimated by accounting for trends of storm volumes wet weather durations and their mutual dependence strength in doing this the probabilistic representation of the precipitation process provided by the copula functions made it possible to implement such trends in the derivation procedure in a very straightforward and computationally efficient manner section 3 2 taking into account changes in the temporal structure of storms leads to significant variations in the derived distribution of flood frequency in particular appreciable changes are expected in the flood frequency even when only the dependence strength of the storm variables is changed fig 6 such aspects therefore deserve to be carefully investigated when facing the assessment of the impact of precipitation non stationarity on the runoff processes a special focus must be given to the season featuring the majority of storms that are critical for the analyzed drainage systems in the application presented in this study this season is summer fig 7 when convective storms with short durations and high intensities are common the proposed approach appears to be more convenient with respect to the hydrologic hydraulic continuous simulations since changes in the mean values or in the high percentile values of the climate variable can be represented by simply modifying the scale and the shape parameters of the marginal distributions further advantages arise from the possibility to avoid computationally intensive numerical simulations and to extrapolate the flood frequency assessment to return periods larger than the length of the available precipitation series moreover it is worth noting that changes in the dependence structure of storm variables are hardy implementable in conventional hydrodynamic simulations since they can be accounted for by generating a sufficiently large number of precipitation time series to be used as an input for the hydrodynamic models thus a prohibitive computational burden should be dealt with finally specific results can be drawn for urban watersheds located in the analyzed climate of northwestern italy fig 6 the assessed impacts demonstrated to be significant in the control of urban runoff by means of conventional drainage systems even though the total annual precipitation volume is expected to remain virtually constant as a consequence of the combination of the storm volume regime redistribution the wet weather duration shortening and a moderate decrease in the dependence strength drainage systems are expected to fail more frequently yielding more severe flooding episodes actually with respect to the return period conventionally adopted in italy for the drainage network design the estimated increases in the hydrologic loads largely exceed the safety range of the conveyance capacity future research developments regarding the proposed stochastic model are manifold on the one hand they could be addressed to additional applications such as the design and performance assessment under non stationary conditions of drainage pipes combined sewer overflow devices runoff capture tanks or flood control reservoirs they could also include quality control issues by adding further steps in the derivation procedure to represent the transport phenomena of non point contaminants on the other hand in consideration of the impact that the temporal structure of storms can exert on the flood frequency extensive and comprehensive studies on trends in wet weather durations and their statistical relationship with storm volumes should be undertaken to recognize potential threats to urban drainage systems bearing in mind the short times of concentration characterizing such watersheds heavy storms are associated with short wet weather durations therefore event based analyses on sub hourly precipitation records must be systematically investigated acknowledgement this paper received funding from the european union s horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant 741657 with the name scishops eu

8370,study region milan northwestern italy study focus the impact of expected trends in storm temporal structures is analyzed with reference to urban drainage systems featuring catchment areas spanning from 10 ha to 100 ha a bivariate stochastic model for the derivation of flood frequency is developed accounting for the seasonality of storm volumes durations and their mutual dependence structure its reliability is verified by comparing it to continuous hydrodynamic simulations to do so a 21 year long series observed at milan monviso raingauge was used model comparison evidences a satisfactory agreement between models new hydrological insights for the region although the total annual precipitation is not expected to change relevant increases in flood frequencies are predicted such increases vary between 10 20 and appear to be independent of the return period thus great concerns arise for the existing urban drainage systems located in northwestern italy which should basically be unable to face these flood frequency changes a leading role is played by the intensification of summer and spring storms both in terms of increase in volumes and decrease in durations moreover changes in the dependence structure have a significant impact when summer storms are considered conversely flood frequency curves are far less sensitive to the storm temporal structures featuring other seasons these results can be explained by considering the seasonal distribution of storms critical for urban drainage systems keywords bivariate distributions copula functions climate change seasonal non stationarities flood frequency urban drainage systems 1 introduction climate change potential consequences on water resource availability and on extreme events control have increased the debate in the scientific community involved in hydrological sciences and in the design of hydraulic structures indeed the level of awareness of forthcoming hazards has risen after reading the fourth assessment report published by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 and even more after the fifth report ipcc 2014 that confirmed the conclusions regarding the extreme events non stationarity in particular changes in extreme events play a crucial role owing to their stronger impact on societies and ecosystems compared to that related to changes in mean climate characteristics seneviratne et al 2012 in this study the attention focuses on heavy storm non stationarity and their impact on urban drainage systems the necessity to better investigate this issue arises by acknowledging that heavy storms often show disproportionately greater increases with respect to mean precipitations hartmann et al 2013 this occurrence was noticed in many mid latitude regions between 1951 and 2003 even where there had been a reduction of the annual precipitation amount indeed in regions with sufficiently long data series increases in heavy storms have been detected since the late 19th century heavy storms nevertheless feature a less coherent spatial pattern than other climatic variables namely temperatures alexander et al 2006 donat et al 2013b the spatial variability within and among climate regions is such that detecting a simple global trend is quite difficult this variability actually involves both confidence and seasonality on a global scale heavy storm trends can show moderate confidence not higher than the trends for medium precipitation values nevertheless in europe mediterranean sea and north america statistically likely increasing trends were detected in terms of frequency and intensities pryor et al 2009 zolina et al 2009 van den besselaar et al 2012 donat 2013a skansi et al 2013 villarini et al 2013 westra et al 2013 thus the global trend must be regarded as likely increasing trends in more regions than decreasing or non significantly increasing trends in addition seasonality plays a crucial role for instance in europe most of increasing trends were observed in winter but not in northern italy poland and some mediterranean sub regions pavan et al 2008 lupikasza 2010 toreti et al 2010 the above mentioned studies mainly refer to daily precipitation extremes unfortunately the number of studies dealing with sub daily heavy storms is quite limited and their results expressed in terms of variations and spatial patterns depend on the event definition and duration hartmann et al 2013 hence global trends of sub daily heavy storms are more complex to interpret with respect to the daily ones studies regarding impacts of climate change on urban drainage systems however indicate that increases in sub daily storm intensities can potentially range between 10 and 60 from the recent past 1961 1990 up to 2100 willems et al 2012 these short duration storms are of major interest for urban hydrologic applications because they are basically critical for conventional drainage systems owing to their relatively limited extensions strong impermeabilization of the catchment surfaces and the presence of an efficient drainage network most of urban watersheds are characterized by short response times i e times of concentration thus heavy storms featuring hourly or sub hourly durations can yield peak discharges capable to exceed the conveyance capacity of the drainage networks in the regions or sub regions where heavy storm increases of this magnitude are predicted a serious concern regarding the ability of urban drainage systems to face the climate change impact therefore arises pagliara et al 1998 these impacts could consist in increases in the frequency and the severity of both urban floodings water loggings and disposals of untreated pollutant loads into receiving waters through combined sewer overflows revi et al 2014 salerno et al 2018 depending on system characteristics these impacts may rise up to 400 in terms of frequencies and volumes as a result of the highly non linear response of drainage networks to storms willems and vrac 2011 willems et al 2012 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 willems 2013 in consideration of these global warnings and the widespread perception of an increasing trend in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events the development of design verification methodologies for urban drainage systems capable of straightforwardly implementing storm non stationarities is crucial thus a research gap remains to be filled indeed popular design and verification methodologies namely the design storm approaches rely on synthetic storms derived from the depth duration frequency curves whose time patterns are arbitrarily set aiming at maximizing the hydrologic load to the analyzed structure akan and houghtalen 2003 the basic hypothesis of design event methods states that the hydrograph derived through a hydrologic model has the same return period as the synthetic storm generating it depth duration frequency curves however rely on annual maxima statistics of storm volumes defined with respect to conventional durations this makes it impossible to account for the natural variability of other climatic aspects relevant to urban runoff management purposes such as the storm duration the antecedent dry weather period and the time pattern furthermore heavy storms that could be critical to drainage systems are excluded from the event sample if they feature volumes that are slightly less than the annual maximum these drawbacks have already been broadly discussed in the most recent literature adams and howard 1986 guo and adams 1998 according to which the basic hypothesis is conceptually wrong thus design event methods basically lead to biased estimates of the drainage system performances besides they make it difficult to effectively translate in comprehensive future scenarios the expected precipitation characteristic trends as previously discussed such trends are based on climate change observations which can involve likely increases in storm intensities along with decreases or non significant changes in storm volumes this can be explained by advocating decreases in wet weather durations hence representative modelling strategies should rely at least on bivariate statistical approaches accounting for both storm variables moreover predicted changes in the seasonality of the precipitation regime cannot be straightforwardly represented by annual maximum statistics suitable solutions are instead provided by continuous approaches where multiple aspects of the storm process can be explicitly considered these categories include i semi probabilistic methods first introduced by eagleson 1972 successively re proposed by adams and papa 2000 and applied in several urban drainage problems guo and adams 1998 raimondi and becciu 2014 balistrocchi et al 2013 zhang and guo 2015 hassini and guo 2017 ii stochastic approaches analytically derived wang and guo 2018 or relying on monte carlo simulation techniques dotto et al 2012 barone et al 2019 and hydrologic hydraulic continuous simulations elliott and trowsdale 2007 among them the monte carlo simulation techniques have been exploited much less even though they bear several conceptual and practical advantages with respect to the others firstly semi probabilistic methods provide analytical closed form distributions of the runoff variables this can nevertheless be achieved by assuming that the storm variables are mutually independent and often exponentially distributed both hypotheses do not always suit the empirical evidence in particular the first one hence the semi probabilistic method reliability can be justified by advocating error compensations conversely complex multivariate probability functions closely suiting the empirical distributions can be implemented in monte carlo simulations to do so copula functions recently introduced in the hydrologic research favre et al 2004 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 dupuis 2007 salvadori et al 2007 provide a remarkable improvement of the inference capability by separating the assessment of the dependence structure from those of the marginal distributions therefore the dependence structure analysis is no longer affected by the marginal behaviors and copula functions and marginal distributions belonging to different probability families can be combined the assessment procedure becomes straightforward thereby eliminating additional sources of uncertainty and making it possible to effectively verify the model reliability by statistical tests owing to the numerical derivation technique more complex rainfall runoff transformation models capable of better suiting the real word hydrology and hydraulics can be implemented the derivation procedure is still conceptually correct as well as in the semi probabilistic methods secondly if suitable rainfall runoff transformations models are used monte carlo simulations are less computationally intensive than hydrologic hydraulic continuous simulations and are parametrically parsimonious thus diminishing model uncertainties analogously to semi probabilistic methods they are generally applicable whereas outcomes of hydrologic hydraulic continuous simulations are site specific with regard to the assessment of climate change impacts on urban drainage systems transformations of long term series of observed precipitations are very complex since they should involve the implementation of different seasonal projections of multiple aspects of the storm events therefore most studies exploited hydrodynamic model simulations by simply applying a constant multiplier or different seasonal or monthly multipliers to the observed precipitation time series semadeni davies et al 2008 dong et al 2017 salerno et al 2018 thus only precipitation volume non stationarity is properly accounted for while other characteristics of the precipitation process remain unchanged on the contrary monte carlo simulations based on copulas would make it possible to easily implement complex projections by separately modifying the parameterizations of the single probability functions that compose the storm multivariate distribution as well as the annual or seasonal number of storms herein a procedure to derive flood frequency curves ffcs for small medium sized urban watersheds 10 100 ha by means of a bivariate monte carlo simulation technique is developed differently from previous studies guo and adams 1998 1999 balistrocchi et al 2013 the derivation procedure of flood frequency curves implements i a more severe routing scheme than that first suggested by wycoff and sing 1976 ii a more realistic representation of the dependence relating storm volumes to wet weather durations and iii the seasonal variability of the temporal structure of storms the model application is carried out with reference to the monviso raingauge located in milan northwestern italy a 21 year long series of observed precipitation volumes recorded every 15 is available and can be used to define the present scenario becciu and raimondi 2012 in this sub region likely increases in daily heavy storm intensities and the absence of a significant trend of storm volumes were observed in the period between 1800 2003 brunetti et al 2006a brunetti et al 2006c ranzi et al 2018 climate change projections obtained by downscaling climate simulations confirm that significant trends depending on the season are expected within the 21st century bucchignani et al 2016 zollo et al 2016 the model reliability is then verified by building flood frequency curves through continuous simulations the epa storm water management model swmm environmental protection agency 2015 is the model assumed as a benchmark and used for the simulations the paper is organized as follows i in section 2 the stochastic methodology herein proposed to derive flood frequency curves is illustrated ii in section 3 present and future scenarios are defined with regard to available data and the existing literature on sub regional precipitation trends iii in section 4 flood frequency curves derived by using both the proposed stochastic methodology and the hydrologic hydraulic continuous simulations are compared finally changes in flood frequency assessed in this sub region are discussed 2 materials and methods the natural variability of precipitation events is herein represented through a bivariate joint distribution function jdf phd of storm volume h and wet weather duration d which are assumed to be mutually dependent random variables according to the sklar theorem sklar 1959 phd can be decomposed in terms of equation 1 where cθ is the copula function while ph and pd are the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the marginal variables h and d respectively 1 p h d h d c θ p h h p d d the copula function cθ is defined in the unitary square i 0 1 2 with respect to a couple of uniformly distributed random variables u and v which are related to the storm variables through the probability integral transforms shown in eq 2 owing to this definition cθ is independent of the marginal cdfs and is exclusively an expression of the dependence structure salvadori et al 2007 2 c θ u v i 2 i w i t h u p h h a n d v p d d according to equation 1 jdf pieces can be assessed separately from the others and can belong to different probability families to associate the event probabilities to return periods the variability of the number of independent events occurring in a given time period must however be estimated the issues related to the function selection and parameter calibration are thoroughly discussed in the following sub sections 2 1 independent event sampling the sampling of individual independent precipitation events from a continuous series can be performed by applying two discretization thresholds an interevent time definition todorovic 1978 and a storm volume threshold bacchi et al 2008 the first parameter represents the minimum dry weather period needed for two subsequent precipitation bursts to be considered independent the second parameter corresponds to the minimum precipitation volume that must be exceeded to have a storm relevant to the analysis purposes both sampling parameters can be selected through operative criteria suiting the dynamics of the analyzed runoff process dealing with drainage systems the interevent time definition must be long enough for two subsequent storms to produce non overlapping hydrographs while the minimum storm volume can be identified with the initial abstraction of the watershed hydrological losses according to this sampling procedure the precipitation bursts are aggregated into independent storms if they are separated by a dry weather period less than the interevent time definition the wet weather duration d is computed from the beginning of the first one and the end of the last one then if the total volume h of the bursts included in the wet weather duration is less than the storm volume threshold the event is suppressed and its wet weather duration is joined to the adjacent dry weather periods otherwise it is included in the independent event sample to account for seasonality the independent storms sampled by this procedure must be classified with respect to their calendar occurrence so that four samples of seasonal events can be derived the sampling procedure yields the number of events occurring in each season as well the estimate of the average seasonal number of events ω can therefore be obtained 2 2 dependence structure modeling the dependence structure is herein modeled by using the gumbel hougaard copula which provides a suitable model to represent the dependence structure of storm volumes and wet weather durations in various climates zhang and singh 2007 balistrocchi and bacchi 2011 fu and kapelan 2013 this is an extreme value and mono parametric copula belonging to the archimedean family which suits symmetric and concordant associations the bivariate members of this family are written in terms of eq 3 where θ represents the dependence parameter which is a function of the association strength 3 c θ u v exp ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ in this copula θ must be greater than or equal to one and is algebraically related to the kendall coefficient τk through relationship 4 so that the stronger the concordance the larger θ is however the gumbel hougaard copula is comprehensive of the independence copula which is obtained when τk is zero and θ equals one 4 τ k θ 1 θ w i t h θ 1 the gumbel hougaard copula features an upper tail dependence coefficient λu increasing with θ according to eq 5 the lower tail dependence coefficient is instead null consequently a tendency to generate strongly concordant events arises in the upper tail on the contrary in the lower tail events are almost independent 5 λ u 2 2 1 θ to fit the theoretical copula function c θ to data leaving apart the marginal distribution assessments the maximum pseudo likelihood method and the moment like method can be utilized genest and favre 2007 the second method can be exploited in bivariate cases when the copula is mono parametric and greatly reduces the fitting computational burden the fitting procedure can be carried out through the explicit algebraic relationship between the kendall rank correlation coefficient τk and the dependence parameter θ pseudo observations are sample versions of the uniform random variables and can be estimated as weibull plotting positions of the sample variable occurrences of storm volume h ˆ i and of wet weather duration d ˆ i as defined in eq 6 where the rank function applies to the sample sorted in ascending order to verify the goodness of fit of c θ the sample joint variability can be expressed through the empirical copula cn which is a consistent non parametric estimator of the underlying dependence structure in the bivariate case cn can be written in terms of eq 6 by using the indicator function 1 6 c n u v 1 n i 1 n 1 u ˆ i u v ˆ i v w h e r e u ˆ i r a n k h ˆ i n 1 a n d v ˆ i r a n k d ˆ i n 1 an accurate evaluation of the goodness of fit can however be achieved by test statistics in this regard the tested null hypothesis is that the underlying copula is the selected theoretical copula function c θ to do so an effective blanket test was developed by genest et al 2009 to assess the global adaptation of the selected theoretical copula to the empirical one in this test the residuals between the theoretical copula 3 and the empirical copula 6 are summarized in a cramer von mises statistics sn 7 7 s n i 1 n c n u ˆ i v ˆ i c θ u ˆ i v ˆ i 2 by using conditional approaches a number of pseudo observation samples can be generated according to the null hypothesis so that statistics sn k can be assessed by eq 7 for every k th simulated sample an empirical estimate p value of the test significance according to which the null hypothesis cannot be rejected is hence given by expression 8 where n is the number of simulation runs much larger than sample size n 8 p v a l u e 1 n k 1 n 1 s n k s n in addition to the global goodness of fit a particular attention must be paid to the tail behaviors poulin et al 2007 since these aspects are crucial to achieve a reliable return period estimate indeed several empirical estimators of the tail coefficients were developed frahm et al 2005 unfortunately they can only provide a comparison with the theoretical coefficients and are strongly biased if the upper tail dependence does not exist or exhibits a high variance serinaldi 2015 in this study χ plots developed by fisher and switzer 1985 were preferred because they provide an effective tool to analyze the existence and the strength of both upper and lower tail dependences a χ plot is a scatterplot of the departure from bivariate independence χ versus the distance from the bivariate median λ and unlike other graphical tools for bivariate copula assessment these rank based plots clearly evidence distinctive patterns and clustering depending only on the underlying copula to make the test significance evident fisher and switzer 2001 determined χ boundary limits for statistical independence which can be expressed as the reciprocal of the sample size square root and a parameter function of the test significance as suggested by abberger 2005 this test naturally subdivides the complete data scatter into four subsets with respect to quadrants centered in the bivariate median and it can be used to make evident tail dependences when data only from the upper right quadrant are used to construct the χ plot the upper tail dependence properties are depicted the same occurs for the lower tail dependence by using data from the lower left quadrant in addition to these visual assessments a quantitative evaluation of the upper tail dependence coefficient of the empirical copula λ ˆ u is herein carried out by using the non parametric estimator 9 if the empirical copula is properly fitted by a gumbel hougaard copula function λ ˆ u can appropriately be compared to the theoretical value 5 since frahm et al 2005 demonstrated that it performs well when the upper tail dependence exists conversely if the tail association is expected to be negligible the estimator 9 leads to strongly biased estimates so that the equality between the theoretical coefficient 5 and the empirical coefficient 9 must be regarded as a necessary condition for the suitability of the selected copula model 9 λ ˆ u 2 2 exp 1 n i 1 n log log 1 u ˆ i log 1 v ˆ i log 1 max u ˆ i v ˆ i 2 2 3 marginal distribution modeling probability distribution functions popularly adopted in the hydrologic practice were found to be suitable to fit the observed empirical distributions namely the weibull and the generalized pareto distributions for the storm volumes and the gamma and the log normal distributions for the wet weather durations their expressions and parameters are listed in table 1 further details can be found in kottegoda and rosso 2008 in accordance with the event sampling procedure a lower limit x0 is introduced in all the storm volume cdfs this location parameter must not be estimated as it is equal to the storm volume threshold ia so that all probability functions feature two calibration parameters using two parameter distribution functions is a key aspect in order to decrease the uncertainty in the implementation of climate change scenarios projections usually involve at most two conditions one on the mean and the other on the variance or alternatively on upper percentiles different functions were selected with regard to the variable and the season aiming at improving the goodness of fit the kolmogorov smirnov and the anderson darling statistical tests were performed to quantify the adaptation of the selected theoretical cdfs to their empirical counterparts in particular the kolmogorov smirnov test focuses on the global adaptation while the anderson darling test better investigates the tails adaptation 2 4 stochastic generation of flood frequency curves to derive peak discharges from an input rainfall event a simplified lumped hydrological model similar to those commonly adopted in practical applications of urban hydrology is herein exploited in order to approximate the natural depletion of the hydrological losses during the wet weather period the rainfall excess hr 10 is evaluated by means of a runoff coefficient φ applied to the rainfall portion that exceeds the initial abstraction ia this parameter was chosen in accordance with the volume threshold of the discretization procedure consequently the number of storm events ω equals the number of flood events 10 h r φ h ia a popular schematization of the storm flood routing process is based on the assumption first prosed by wycoff and singh 1976 according to which the flood hydrograph can be represented by a triangle featuring a volume equal to the storm excess and a finite base time that is given by the sum of the storm duration and the catchment time of concentration this assumption makes it possible to analytically derive the flood frequency distribution guo and adams 1998 1999 balistrocchi et al 2013 however a more realistic routing scheme can be implemented in a numerical derivation procedure since the hydrograph base time is more suitably assessed by the sum of the storm excess duration dr and the catchment time of concentration tc to evaluate dr a shape must be given to the storm time pattern aiming at generating synthetic events critical to urban drainage systems an isosceles triangular time pattern can be adopted the storm excess duration can therefore be estimated by multiplying the wet weather duration d by the reduction coefficient ςh defined in eq 11 11 ς h 1 ia 2 h the runoff volume 10 must equal the flood hydrograph volume so that the specific peak discharge q can be expressed in terms of the storm random variables h and d as shown in eq 12 12 q h d 2 h r d r t c 2 φ h ia ς h d t c eq 12 is suitable for the application of the derived distribution theory so that the cdf of the peak discharge pq is directly expressed as a function of the natural variability of the bivariate jdf of the storm variables indeed such a model can be considered acceptable with regard to the urban application objectives which allow to adopt simplified lumped approaches for the representation of the hydrological processes its reliability is however supported by comparison with hydrologic continuous simulations according to the monte carlo simulation technique a number of couples of uniform variables u v can be generated from the copula function 3 by using conditional approaches salvadori and de michele 2006 salvadori et al 2007 these couples can then be converted in the corresponding natural counterparts by inverting the marginal cdfs by using eq 12 a univariate sample of peak discharges qi is finally derived the generation can be distinguished to account for seasonality by fitting different copulas with respect to seasonal samples and by taking into consideration the corresponding average seasonal event numbers ω the annual sample is then obtained by joining the seasonal ones hence a flood frequency distribution ffc can be derived by means of eq 13 where weibull plotting positions fi of these generated occurrences are expressed in terms of the return period ti by accounting for the average annual event number ωy given by the sum of the average seasonal numbers of flood events 13 t i 1 ω y 1 f i 3 rainfall data and precipitation scenarios the present scenario sc0 was defined with regard to a continuous precipitation series observed at the rain gauge of via monviso milan northwestern italy the precipitation was recorded at a 15 time step for 21 years between 1971 and 1991 this raingauge belongs to the northwestern climate sub region nw according to the analysis by brunetti et al 2006b as shown in fig 1 bearing in mind applications to small medium size urban catchments 10 100 ha the sampling of the individual independent events from the continuous record was carried out by using an interevent time definition of 3 h and an initial abstraction ia of 5 mm in these kinds of watersheds times of concentrations shorter than 1 h are expected so that the minimum interevent time definition suggested in the literature adams and papa 2000 can be used to ensure that two subsequent rainfalls do not generate overlapping hydrographs in addition owing to the high soil sealing levels a minimal volume threshold is needed for rainfall to exceed the interception and surface storage losses 3 1 present scenario a summary of statistics of the storm events sampled according to these parameter values is reported in table 1 statistics are estimated for the seasonal samples and the whole annual sample aiming at evidencing the main characteristics of the precipitation regime in table 2 values of the number of events ω ˆ the storm volume μ ˆ h and the wet weather duration μ ˆ d are listed along with the kendall coefficient τ ˆ k the last column reports the total precipitation volume hm averagely estimated in the various period these mean values express the rainfall regime traditionally depicted for this climatic region referred to as sub alpine regime bandini 1931 the total amount of annual precipitation is about 900 mm distributed in two wet seasons and two dry seasons the main wet season is spring when most of the events occur but storm volumes are smaller and wet weather durations are shorter than in the other seasons autumn instead represents the secondary rainy season due to a lower number of events but featured by larger volumes and durations than in spring summer and winter differ not only in terms of the total amount of precipitation volumes since the first is the secondary minimum while the second is the primary minimum but also in the event number and wet weather durations in fact summer features shorter and more frequent storms than winter in particular winter wet weather durations are the longest this precipitation regime can be explained by considering that during the warm seasons convective storms are common and short duration events can easily bear large volumes conversely during the cool seasons such events are almost absent and the precipitation is mainly driven by frontal events these characteristics have consequences on the dependence strength as well all seasonal samples show concordant associations though winter events feature a very strong dependence while summer events feature a quite weak dependence an intermediate and similar association is instead shown by the wet seasons indeed short duration storms are characterized by a wider variability with respect to long duration storms as they can be produced by both intense convective events and minor frontal events the association between storm volumes and wet weather durations is therefore weaker than that of the long duration storms hence smaller kendall coefficients are thus assessed during the seasons where short duration storms a more frequent as can be noticed by comparing the seasonal values to the annual ones the wet weather duration and the association strength appear to be particularly sensitive to seasonality for instance summer wet weather durations on average amount to 25 of the winter ones and to 50 of the annual ones furthermore the association strength of winter storm variables is double the annual one the suitability of assessing the pieces of jdf 1 with respect to seasonal samples is therefore clearly supported in fact when a storm seasonality of this magnitude is disregarded ffc derivations basically lead to appreciable underestimations of the peak discharges the dependence parameters estimated by using the moment like criterion based on eq 4 are reported in table 3 along with the results of the statistical tests carried out to evaluate the global goodness of fit as can be seen the gumbel hougaard copula demonstrates a satisfactory capability to suit the empirical copula in all seasons due to low sn values yielding high p values after 105 simulation runs the null hypotheses cannot be rejected with significances routinely adopted in hydrology since p values are larger than 5 10 at least the χ plots investigating the lower tails and the upper tails in the seasonal samples are plotted in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively in these plots boundary limits for independence refer to a 10 test significance to provide a more effective interpretation of these χ plots scatter plots derived from 500 size simulated samples are added to the observed ones in every season the hypothesis of lower tail independence cannot be rejected in spring fig 2b in summer fig 2c and in autumn fig 2d since observations are close to the λ axis and are included mostly in the confidence boundaries fig 2a instead deserves a deeper discussion since a significant amount of observations places out of the upper confidence limit this is mainly due to the high strength of the overall association that generally leads to larger χ values however maximum χ values are less than 0 50 and always decrease as λ increases moreover the fitted gumbel hougaard copula appears to be able to satisfactorily mimic the empirical χ plot since simulations completely overlap observations this also applies to the other χ plots depicting a general suitability of the tested copula to represent the lower tail behavior conversely the upper tail independence hypotheses can definitively be rejected in winter fig 3a in spring fig 3b and in autumn fig 3d for most of the scatter points are not included in the confidence region testing independence in the summer case the overall weak association yields a consistently weak upper tail dependence so that most of observations remains in the confidence region fig 3c the χ values exceeding the upper confidence limit nevertheless occur for the largest λ values this reveals a moderate tendency of the empirical copula to generate associated values in the upper tail as in the lower tail case the upper tail dependence appears to be well represented by the gumbel hougaard copula as simulations fittingly overlap observations in all panels of fig 3 by rejecting the hypotheses of upper tail independence the comparison of the theoretical value assessed by eq 5 and the empirical values assessed by estimator 9 of the upper tail coefficients becomes meaningful such values are reported in table 3 as well showing a satisfactory agreement between the theoretical and the empirical coefficients finally in table 4 and in table 5 the selected marginal distribution functions are listed along with parameter values estimated by means of the maximum likelihood criterion and test statistics dmax and a2 resulting from the kolmogorov smirnov and the anderson darling tests the corresponding critical limits dn α and a α 2 refer to a significance α equal to 10 as can be seen all selected distributions cannot be rejected according to both tests since test statistics are systematically less than the allowed maxima in general the weibull distribution and the gamma distribution are recognized as suitable models for the storm volume and the wet weather duration marginal cdfs respectively exceptions are given by the spring storm volumes and the summer wet weather durations for which more satisfactory fits were achieved by using the generalized pareto distribution and the log normal distribution in both cases a little more skewed distribution was needed to better suit the upper tail behavior 3 2 climate change scenarios changes in the frequency of extremes can be modeled by shifting the overall probability distribution simolo et al 2011 when dealing with threshold exceedance frequency and duration mainly related to departures from mean values however changes in high percentile events which are of major interest in assessing the hydrologic loads on urban drainage systems can be represented by changes in the scale parameter and in the shape parameter of the probability distributions della marta et al 2007 in this study to develop climate change scenarios consistent with seasonal expected trends in northwestern italy both methodologies were utilized hence with respect to the present scenario sc0 three change types were implemented in the storm stochastic structure according to the following changes in the seasonal marginal cdfs and in the copula functions changes in storm volume distributions i decrease of 10 in the mean and increase of 5 in the 95 percentile of winter storms ii increase of 15 in the mean of spring storm volumes iii increase of 10 in the mean of summer storm volumes iv decrease of 10 in the mean of autumn storm volumes changes in wet weather duration distributions i decrease of 5 in the mean of winter wet weather durations ii decrease of 10 in the mean of spring wet weather durations iii decrease of 15 in the mean of summer wet weather durations iv decrease of 10 in the mean of autumn wet weather durations changes in the dependence structure i decrease of 10 in the dependence parameter of winter storms ii increase of 5 in the dependence parameter of spring storms iii decrease of 2 5 in the dependence parameter of summer storms iv decrease of 2 5 in the dependence parameter of autumn storms changes in storm volumes are supported by forecasts formulated by ipcc future scenarios in particular report ar4 ipcc 2007 and confirmed by the following studies ipcc 2014 bucchignani et al 2016 as can be noticed changes mainly involve a redistribution of storm volumes among seasons maintaining the total amount of annual precipitation virtually constant changes in wet weather durations are instead established with regard to a certain number of regional studies concerning trend analyses of daily precipitation series observed in italy from 1800 to 2003 brunetti et al 2006a brunetti et al 2006c according to such studies an average annual decrease of 10 can be expected in northwestern italy see fig 1 for the wet weather durations of daily precipitations therefore changes considered in this study must be regarded as moderately conservative since greater decreases should feature sub daily storms this average annual change is modulated with respect to the season by accounting for moderately greater decreases in those seasons where short duration storms are more frequent in particular summer changes in the marginal distributions can be implemented in jdf 1 independently of those expected for the dependence structure by modifying the corresponding marginal cdfs a further advantage arises from the utilization of two parameter marginal cdfs that makes this implementation actually straightforward in northern italy s climatic region there are no studies that can address the choice of potential changes in the dependence structure of storm variables nevertheless it is not reasonable to expect a modification of the type of dependence structure that is of the copula model but only changes in the dependence strength this assumption is adopted for instance by vinnarasi and dhanya 2019 who observed a decreasing trend in the dependence parameter of the frank copula that relates storm intensities to wet weather durations in bangalore in general the less the dependence strength between the storm volumes and the wet weather durations is the larger the estimated peak discharges are balistrocchi and bacchi 2017 aiming at evidencing the advantages of the proposed stochastic methodology and by evaluating the impact of changes in the storm structure on flood frequency a reasonable scenario can however be derived by the assessment of trends in the monviso rainfall series by using a mobile window equal to five years a slight decreasing trend in the kendall coefficient is evidenced for the annual samples nevertheless when annual samples are separated into seasonal samples only summer storms show such a behavior winter storms and autumn storms instead show more marked decreasing trends the first being the strongest one while spring storms show a moderate increase such results addressed the previously outlined changes in the dependence strength climate change scenarios are therefore developed as follows scenario 1 sc1 accounts only for trends in the storm volume cdfs scenario 2 sc2 accounts for both trends in the marginal cdfs and scenario 3 sc3 accounts for trends in the marginal cdfs and in the dependence structure scenario 1 is intended to evaluate the ffc trend in the sub regions of northern italy where wet weather duration trends are not expected distinguishing between scenario 2 and scenario 3 makes it possible to quantify the effect of disregarding changes in the storm variable dependence structure on flood frequency 4 results and discussion the proposed stochastic methodology was initially tested by model comparison this is a broadly used approach to validate derived models that are applied to urban drainage systems guo and adams 1998 1999 balistrocchi et al 2009 zhang and guo 2014 2015 wang and guo 2019 due to the general scarcity of long term series of observed discharges a benchmarking reference was set up through continuous simulations of a hydrodynamic model developed in swmm environmental protection agency 2015 with regard to a hypothetical but realistic test case the stochastic methodology was then applied to various watershed outlets according to the climate change scenarios delineated in section 3 2 4 1 stochastic model verification the test watershed delineates a recurrent runoff management strategy adopted in urban drainage systems as can be seen in fig 4 where the topologic scheme of the drainage network is illustrated secondary parallel pipes connect to a main interception conduit this conduit features a larger cross section and a lower slope than secondary pipes the total catchment area amounts to 100 ha and is subdivided in ten sub basins major sub basins drain into the secondary pipes and are approximated to rectangular plains symmetrically sloping towards to a central gutter flow path minor sub basins directly drain into the interception conduit and are approximated to rectangular plains completely located on the left hand side of the gutter flow path overland flow widths are therefore estimated as twice and equal to the gutter path length for major sub basins and minor sub basins respectively the hydrologic losses that occurr in the permeable areas were estimated by using the curve number method details regarding the hydrologic and hydraulic characteristics of sub basins and pipes implemented in the swmm hydrodynamic model are provided in fig 4 as well the parameterization of the stochastic model was carried out aiming at maximizing the consistency with hydrodynamic simulations in particular the runoff coefficient φ defined in eq 10 was set with regard to the discretization procedure described in section 2 1 hence the rainfall excess series was obtained from the rainfall series by subtracting the hydrologic losses from the independent storm events separated by an interevent time definition of 3 h the runoff coefficient was set in order to obtain for the complete observation period a ratio between the runoff volume and the rainfall volume equal to that resulting from swmm continuous simulations since it is applied only to the rainfall portion exceeding the initial abstraction this runoff coefficient is basically larger than those usually adopted in urban drainage systems which apply to the total rainfall volume the watershed time of concentration tc was estimated by using eq 14 as the sum of the time needed for the runoff to enter the drainage network te and the time needed for the channelized runoff to reach the outlet section through the longest hydraulic path the second addend is computed as the sum of the delivery times of the single pipes estimated as the ratio between pipe length lj and flow velocity vj 14 t c t e j l j v j with the aim of highlighting a potential influence of the watershed size on the agreement between the hydrodynamic model and the stochastic model ffcs were derived for three control sections depicted in fig 4 corresponding to catchment areas equal to 10 ha section s1 50 ha section s2 and 100 ha section s3 corresponding calibration parameters are listed in table 6 times of concentrations were set by adopting 10 min for te and 1 5 m s for velocities vj in particular the first is suggested in northern italy climate for urban watershed practical applications centro studi idraulica urbana csdu 1997 whereas the latter is intended to represent runoff delivery velocities related to the most frequent storms that features low moderate intensities a runoff coefficient φ equal to 0 75 coupled with an initial abstraction ia equal to 5 mm yields a ratio between the total runoff volume and the total rainfall volume of 50 3 that is consistent with that obtained through the hydrodynamic simulation assessed at 50 5 monte carlo simulations were conducted by generating 2 5 104 years of storm volume and wet weather duration couples in accordance with the parameter set reported from table 2 to table 5 sc0 such couples were transformed in peak discharges by using eq 12 and associated with the corresponding return period by using eq 13 the continuous flow discharge series simulated in the three analyzed sections by swmm were separated into independent runoff events by using a threshold discharge and an interevent time definition equal to 3 h the threshold discharges were set at a few hundreds of liters per second to purge out of the series the insignificant low flow the interevent time definition is consistent with that used in the rainfall series analysis the visual comparison of the ffcs is provided in fig 5 and performance measures of the stochastic model are listed in table 6 as can be seen in fig 5 ffcs derived by the proposed stochastic model mc and by continuous hydrodynamic simulations swmm depict similar trends assessments are particularly close for the peak discharges featuring return periods greater than 2 years which are of major interest for practical application purposes the satisfactory agreement is also evidenced by the root mean square errors rmse reported in table 6 which can be considered acceptable with respect to the order of magnitude of the peak discharges the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse that is a normalized version of the mean square error further confirms this performance evaluation due to values always larger than 0 80 an additional quantitative evaluation of the stochastic model performances is provided by the pearson linear correlation coefficient lcc whose values are satisfactorily near to unity 4 2 stochastic model application in fig 6 ffcs derived by means of the stochastic procedure in accordance with the described scenarios of climate change are compared to those derived in accordance with the present climate sc0 such examples refer to the three sections of the test watershed table 6 used in section 4 2 to verify the soundness of the stochastic model as can be seen all climate change scenarios determine significant increases in the flood frequency whose percentage values appear to be almost constant with respect to both the return period and the catchment area with regard to the return period range of major interest for urban practical applications 2 20 years sc1 yields percentage increases of about 10 12 with respect to sc0 ffcs moreover when sc1 and sc2 are compared additional percentage increases in the flood frequency ranging between 10 12 arise thus the total percentage increases reach 20 24 with respect to sc0 more limited increments are instead predicted if changes in the volume duration dependence structure are considered if ffcs derived for sc2 and sc3 are compared additional percentage increases range between 5 6 so that the total percentage increase with respect to sc0 is estimated at 28 29 this result can be explained by considering that ffcs in urban watersheds are mainly determined by short duration storms in this climate such storms mainly occur in summer and subordinately in spring and autumn a very moderate change was adopted for summer and opposite change trends were implemented for spring storms and autumn storms in the monte carlo generation procedure such results however demonstrate that moderate changes in the temporal structure of storms have dramatic impacts on flood frequency in urban watersheds and that the expected increases in the peak discharges are at least of the same magnitude as those due to changes in the storm volume seasonality in order to demonstrate the significance of the predicted increases regarding the runoff management in urban watersheds a term of comparison is provided by the conveyance capacities of conventional drainage systems to do so one can refer to the ratio between the peak discharge and the full normal flow discharge which expresses the pipe conveyance capacity this ratio is routinely included in the safety range spanning from 0 70 to 0 80 in order the conveyance capacity to be considered suitably sized assuming that a drainage pipe is included in the safety range under the present scenario sc0 the ratio increases up to 0 78 0 90 according to sc1 up to 0 85 0 98 according to sc2 and up to 0 90 1 03 according to sc3 these ranges therefore predict situations in which drainage pipes are undersized or heavily undersized with respect to the original design return period to better investigate the impact of potential changes in the dependence structure of storm variables on flood frequency a sensitivity analysis was conducted by individually changing the seasonal kendall coefficients within the maximum possible range hence the independence τk 0 and the analytical concordant association τk 1 were implemented into the stochastic derivation procedure by substituting the gumbel hougaard copula with the product copula π2 copula and the upper boundary copula m2 copula respectively results are illustrated in fig 7 where ffcs derived according to these assumptions are compared to the those derived by keeping the dependence structure stationary sc2 in all cases the decrease in the association strength leads to an increase in the flood frequency while the contrary occurs when the association is increased nevertheless impacts on ffcs are highly different with regard to the season the most relevant impact is evidenced in summer fig 7c when the largest variation can be observed in particular the independence assumption leads to an increase of 56 5 and the analytical concordant association leads to a decrease of 50 0 in the peak discharges this outcome can be explained by considering that the majority of short duration and intense storms occur in this season such a kind of storm is the most critical for the watersheds herein analyzed which are characterized by times of concentration less than an hour conversely the impact of dependence strength changes in winter appears to be definitively negligible fig 7a this season is actually rich in stratiform storms which are not able to significantly force the urban drainage system due to their basically long durations coupled with low intensities intermediate results are shown in spring fig 7b and in autumn fig 7d which feature a mixture of stratiform storms and convective storms in both seasons the most relevant impact is due to the independence assumption which would yield a marked increase in the peak discharges of 40 0 when spring is considered a modest increase of about 12 5 is instead predicted by neglecting the association strength in autumn the almost null effect of the association strength increase can be explained by the modest impact that the storms belonging to these seasons have on the ffcs and by the moderately high concordance that already characterizes the observed samples in general it must be concluded that individual seasonal trends in the storm volume and wet weather durations can have dramatic consequences on the flood frequency when the season featuring the majority of the storms critical to the analyzed drainage system is taken into consideration 5 conclusions in this paper a stochastic methodology to derive flood frequency distributions from precipitation inputs in small medium sized urban watersheds that is featuring catchment areas between 10 ha and 100 ha was proposed a bivariate approach incorporating the seasonality of storm volumes and wet weather durations was implemented in a computationally cheap simulation procedure section 2 this procedure was applied and tested with reference to an urban watershed located in northwestern italy in this climate a 21 year long series of precipitation volumes recorded every 15 is available milan monviso raingauge copula functions were exploited to carry out a comprehensive seasonal investigation of the precipitation temporal structure section 3 1 in this regard the distribution of convective storms is acknowledged as a fundamental factor affecting both the overall dependence strength and the scale parameters of the marginal variables copulas were used to construct joint distribution functions satisfactorily suiting the empirical distributions of the storm event variables in particular members of the gumbel hougaard family were found to provide suitable representations of the global dependence structures table 3 the lower tail dependences fig 2 and the upper tail dependences fig 3 in all seasons the overall model reliability was verified with respect to hydrologic hydraulic continuous simulations conducted by using epa swmm fig 5 even if a simplified precipitation runoff transformation model was implemented in the stochastic derivation procedure its flood frequency curves demonstrated to be in close agreement with those derived by a hydrologic hydraulic model at spatial scales ranging from 10 ha and 100 ha considering the magnitude of the peak discharges related to the tested urban watershed estimate errors are found to be acceptable potential impacts of climate change on the flood frequency distributions were estimated by accounting for trends of storm volumes wet weather durations and their mutual dependence strength in doing this the probabilistic representation of the precipitation process provided by the copula functions made it possible to implement such trends in the derivation procedure in a very straightforward and computationally efficient manner section 3 2 taking into account changes in the temporal structure of storms leads to significant variations in the derived distribution of flood frequency in particular appreciable changes are expected in the flood frequency even when only the dependence strength of the storm variables is changed fig 6 such aspects therefore deserve to be carefully investigated when facing the assessment of the impact of precipitation non stationarity on the runoff processes a special focus must be given to the season featuring the majority of storms that are critical for the analyzed drainage systems in the application presented in this study this season is summer fig 7 when convective storms with short durations and high intensities are common the proposed approach appears to be more convenient with respect to the hydrologic hydraulic continuous simulations since changes in the mean values or in the high percentile values of the climate variable can be represented by simply modifying the scale and the shape parameters of the marginal distributions further advantages arise from the possibility to avoid computationally intensive numerical simulations and to extrapolate the flood frequency assessment to return periods larger than the length of the available precipitation series moreover it is worth noting that changes in the dependence structure of storm variables are hardy implementable in conventional hydrodynamic simulations since they can be accounted for by generating a sufficiently large number of precipitation time series to be used as an input for the hydrodynamic models thus a prohibitive computational burden should be dealt with finally specific results can be drawn for urban watersheds located in the analyzed climate of northwestern italy fig 6 the assessed impacts demonstrated to be significant in the control of urban runoff by means of conventional drainage systems even though the total annual precipitation volume is expected to remain virtually constant as a consequence of the combination of the storm volume regime redistribution the wet weather duration shortening and a moderate decrease in the dependence strength drainage systems are expected to fail more frequently yielding more severe flooding episodes actually with respect to the return period conventionally adopted in italy for the drainage network design the estimated increases in the hydrologic loads largely exceed the safety range of the conveyance capacity future research developments regarding the proposed stochastic model are manifold on the one hand they could be addressed to additional applications such as the design and performance assessment under non stationary conditions of drainage pipes combined sewer overflow devices runoff capture tanks or flood control reservoirs they could also include quality control issues by adding further steps in the derivation procedure to represent the transport phenomena of non point contaminants on the other hand in consideration of the impact that the temporal structure of storms can exert on the flood frequency extensive and comprehensive studies on trends in wet weather durations and their statistical relationship with storm volumes should be undertaken to recognize potential threats to urban drainage systems bearing in mind the short times of concentration characterizing such watersheds heavy storms are associated with short wet weather durations therefore event based analyses on sub hourly precipitation records must be systematically investigated acknowledgement this paper received funding from the european union s horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant 741657 with the name scishops eu

takes place within the context of a complex socio environmental system sustainable management of water resources requires the needs of several agricultural environmental and social domains to be balanced with explicit consideration of a multitude of interacting factors here sustainable refers to water usage that is both beneficial and robust featuring improved farm profitability and environmental outcomes and maintaining these under changing possibly adverse climatic conditions within hypothetical policy contexts revisited in section 4 holistic modelling of this socio environmental system then requires an integrated approach due to the number of system domains under consideration the level of interactions that can occur at different spatial and temporal scales and the uncertainty that comes with it letcher et al 2007 schlüter et al 2019 a well considered integrated approach can reduce the risk of unintentionally disregarding crucial aspects of the management context and the flow on effects without which the conclusions reached may be compromised kelly et al 2013 to this end integrated environmental models iems are often constructed to aid in informing management and policy decisions elsawah et al 2020a janssen et al 2010 voinov and shugart 2013 stakeholder engagement is an important step in integrated modelling particularly in developing socio

such as the murray cod and golden perch exist along the lower campaspe system recent water reforms have included provisions for increased environmental flows to support recovery and maintenance of ecosystem health ghd 2015 gm w 2013 hughes et al 2015 water to support environmental flows include 75 g l reallocated from agriculture as well as estimated water savings due to infrastructure improvements conducted through the goulburn murray connections project nvirp 2011 recreational use of the dam is an additional area of concern with viability of recreational activities e g boating and yachting suffering as the water levels at lake eppalock fall there has been public outcry in this regard as evidenced by local media reports abc news 2015 wines 2015 decisions made in managing the lower campaspe river affect river systems downstream the campaspe being a tributary of the murray therefore beneficial ecological outcomes within the campaspe are likely to support ecological recovery elsewhere downstream the cim was designed and developed to inform management and decision making processes within this context through an exploratory process 3 integrated model development to explore possible futures in the campaspe changes to on farm practices and water allocation policies were modelled and the subsequent effects on farmer income streamflow conditions for platypus colonies native fish and river red gums trees and recreational use of the dam were analysed specifically these scenarios represent the conjunctive management of both surface and groundwater pulido velazquez et al 2011 encouragement of further use of groundwater resources in general and further improvements to irrigation water application efficiency ticehurst and curtis 2017 2016 the cim comprises models to represent climate sequences policy rules agricultural activities surface and groundwater hydrology and indicators of ecological and recreational suitability individual model domains deal with their own unique issues and conceptualise the system and their interactions with other models in separate ways this is most obvious in the represented spatial and temporal scales in building the cim compromises were necessary in order to suit the purpose of the modelling and in the face of inter linked requirements and available resources for this reason further detailed framing of each model domain and where relevant model inputs and indicators of interest are described in the sub sections below 3 1 stakeholders and engagement process as noted in the introduction engagement with local stakeholders was particularly important to both the development and validation of the cim relevant stakeholders were identified through sectoral interests and relevance e g farmers will be interested in policies that affect farming as well as a snowball sampling approach where known experts where recruited to suggest other experts of interest relevant to the study stakeholders involved both prior to and during the modelling process included local farmers gm water and representatives from government departments and non profit organisations these represent actors within the system that use the water managers of the water and those with specialised knowledge of the system including farm management and irrigation specialists ecologists geo hydrologists and catchment managers to name a few a stakeholder group of representatives from gm water the local catchment management authority north central cma and a relevant state government department at the time the department of economic development jobs transport and resources attended workshops to identify potential opportunities for conjunctive use in the region farmers were engaged through interviews and surveys prior to model development details of which can be found in ticehurst and curtis 2017 2016 this engagement identified the current and future intention to adopt various management options including the use of groundwater various irrigation practices and the technical feasibility and social acceptability of the range of conjunctive use opportunities identified in previous workshops gm water also provided irrigator data and aided in defining the spatial scope and boundaries of the study with respect to the represented groundwater catchment and management zones the stakeholder group also took part in later workshops and served to provide information and knowledge which corrected earlier assumptions and provided further feasibility assessment of on farm scenarios issues and concerns surrounding ecological aspects were elicited through engagement with ecologists from the australian platypus conservancy and the north central cma further details may be found in iwanaga et al 2018 3 2 technical implementation a requirement of the integrated model development was to be flexible in the face of changing and evolving understanding of the system due to the amount and spread of knowledge being engaged with through the participatory engagement process that was described in the previous section to facilitate this an iterative component based approach was adopted in the development of the cim construction of the cim involved the use of a mix of programming languages including fortran and python and its compiled cousin cython incorporation of pre existing models and the development of a purpose built software framework through which each component model was coupled interfaces commonly referred to as wrappers were developed for the purpose of invoking component model runs and thus provide the necessary linkage between the framework and the component models fig 2 depicts the inter relationship between the component models inter model communication i e data exchange occurs with the framework acting as an intermediary conversion of data such as between types or units of measurement occurs where necessary and is specifically coded while not adhering to all aspects the structure of the interfaces is similar to those specified by the basic modeling interface peckham et al 2013 in that each interface provides a method to invoke a run of the component model for a given time step this design pattern was selected for its flexibility simplicity and ease of implementation component models are run as a serial process with one model run after the other with feedback occurring across daily time steps further details on the choice of modelled spatial and temporal scale is given in later sub sections for each system component currently the model takes approximately 30 min to run for a single scenario on a desktop computer with a core i5 7500 cpu the groundwater model based on modflow nwt is run as an external program and is currently the primary bottleneck limiting further increases to runtime efficiency although modflow itself is written in fortran considered to be a fast language numerical solution of groundwater models is time consuming and the modflow software itself uses several input files which must be written out for each time step and the results read back in overheads due to the constant file operations takes a large proportion of the runtime as much as 43 of the cim runtime can be attributed to the groundwater model modflow s position as an industry standard was the primary reason for its use the exploratory approach conducted for the study involved many runs and so the cim was designed to run multiple scenarios in parallel in order to overcome computational runtime issues model runs are invoked via the command line and is compatible with both linux and windows systems no graphical user interface was developed for the study as use by non technical end users was not planned and is not expected 3 3 climate and scenarios changes in rainfall and temperature influence water availability and their trends can impact the volume of irrigation water necessary to achieve optimum crop growth and yield throughout a growing season the importance of considering climatic influences in managing farm processes is reflected in the survey conducted by ticehurst and curtis 2016 over 80 of respondents ranked change in rainfall patterns and the impact of drought as important or very important comparing long term 100 year average growing season rainfall against more recent trends highlights the impact of the millennium drought 1996 2010 a growing season refers to the time span in which crops are usually sown and harvested defined here as may to february average long term growing season rainfall between 1892 2013 amounted to 420 mm in line with the reported usual growing season rainfall of 400 500 mm ecodev 2015 growing season rainfall from 1982 to 2016 however shows a decrease of 67 mm to 353 mm see fig 3 the trend of decreased rainfall during crop growth may continue with agricultural water management becoming increasingly challenging to investigate the impacts of a changing climate historic and future climate data were sourced from the climate change in australia data service https www climatechangeinaustralia gov au csiro 2017 the provided datasets consist of daily rainfall and evapotranspiration in 5 km grid format for a 30 year period the future climate data provided were developed through a process of scaling historic observations described in mitchell 2003 and thus exhibit similar rainfall trends to historic observations pearson correlations between climate scenarios are depicted in fig 4 with a minimum correlation value of 0 88 and 0 99 for rainfall and evaporation data respectively future climate datasets are based on the historic timeframe from 1981 to 2011 and thus cover the millennium drought period therefore each climate scenario includes a representation of a multi year drought at differing levels of severity for the purpose of calibration and analysis the historic climate dataset was extended to 2016 in order to capture the post drought recovery the set of climate scenarios covers rcp4 5 and 8 5 for 2016 2045 2036 2065 obtained from multiple climate models best case worst case are wettest and driest across models whilst maximum consensus represents conditions somewhat comparable to historic experience to determine the range of conditions that the climate sequences represent the aridity index a i developed by the un environment programme unep was used to compare the climate scenarios the index is calculated as p p e t where p is the annual average rainfall and p e t is the annual average potential evapotranspiration gamo et al 2013 an a i value of 0 2 to 0 5 indicates a semi arid climate condition sahin 2012 and the a i value for the historic climate dataset falls within these bounds with a value of 0 34 as is expected for this semi arid location of the procured climate datasets the driest conditions are represented by the notation worst case rcp45 2016 2045 a i 0 26 the best case rcp45 2016 2045 scenario was most comparable to historic aridity a i 0 34 while best case rcp45 2036 2065 was the least arid a i 0 35 the indicated climate scenarios are taken to represent the extremes of future climate variability i e the most and least arid conditions and one that is most similar to historically observed conditions for this reason modelling with the other climate scenarios were not conducted in depth interpolation between the extremes would likely provide indicative intermediary results these climate scenarios are referred to as wet usual and dry for brevity from here on and were used to drive the cim in order to investigate the impact of such changing climate conditions 3 4 policy model significant reforms to the water policy in the campaspe introduced water trading user carryover specified below and environmental water provisions alston and whittenbury 2011 mckay 2005 wheeler and cheeseman 2013 as part of these reforms the environment is regarded as a water user with water entitlements and yearly water allocations similar to any other entity with a water licence the policy model provides representations of policies that determine water allocation and carryover access and use of water resources are governed by a licencing system in which a licence held by a water user specifies a given volume of water called an entitlement separate licences are issued for surface and groundwater access to the full entitlement is not guaranteed and is subject to water availability an allocation is announced by gm water each irrigation season indicating the percentage of the entitlement an irrigator can use i e 100 allocation is equal to the full entitlement volume carryover here refers to the amount of unused water allocation which licence holders irrigators and the environment are able to add to the following year s allocation current carryover rules indicate that irrigators are able to carry over 95 of unused surface water with 5 deducted to account for evaporation loss dse 2012a 2012b and 25 of unused groundwater goulburn murray water 2015 while irrigators can decide not to carryover dse 2012b it is assumed in the model that carryover always occurs as indicated in fig 2 the policy model dictates availability of water for agricultural and environmental purposes and is itself influenced by climate conditions dam and groundwater levels 3 4 1 surface water policy surface water allocations in the lower campaspe are calculated based on the available volume of water in the dam as well as projected inflows gm water holds rights to 82 of the dam volume as well as 82 of projected inflows and the sum of these is used to calculate the total allocation for the lower campaspe catchment the allocation is announced on 1 july and is re calculated throughout the irrigation season as such a water user s allocation may increase over the course of the growing season if larger than expected rainfall and inflows occur and so the volume of allocations will not decrease retrospectively dam operation requirements as dictated by local policy and legislative rules including environmental watering and minimum flow rules are also factored into the allocation calculations the model represents this process on a two week basis rather than 6 weekly as happens in reality to allow for better interoperation with the farm model a complication in the surface water policy model is the fact that irrigators in the lower campaspe hold additional licences for water from the neighbouring goulburn catchment east of the campaspe rather than model another catchment in its entirety linear relationships at three different levels were developed between the campaspe and goulburn allocations details on this relationship may be found in appendix c these are referred to as high median or low and represent the level of allocation volume available from the goulburn catchment for a modelled future scenario the separate allocation scenarios allow the model to account for conditions which influence availability of water from the goulburn including variability between the two catchments these different conditions may be due to climate variability water demand and policies that affect goulburn allocations which in turn may affect the indicators of interest for the lower campaspe associated costs were assumed to be identical to that of gm water water entitlements for individual farm zones detailed in section 3 5 below are shown in table 1 and were calculated by proportionally distributing the entitlement based on the water system area under which the given zone falls under 3 4 2 groundwater policy groundwater allocations are restricted by policy rules surrounding what are referred to as trigger levels these indicate the groundwater level at which allocations are reduced to a specified percentage or at its lowest level no allocation at all groundwater use is progressively restricted in this manner as the water table decreases in order to prevent salinity intrusion allocations are determined based on the recorded groundwater level at two reference bores with the ids 62589 in the south and 79324 in the north goulburn murray water 2015 and are detailed in table 2 under current modelled allocation in the current policy context surface and groundwater are managed separately however stakeholders have explicitly suggested a move towards a conjunctive management approach a possible change in the policy space includes the relaxation of trigger levels during dry periods thereby enabling irrigators to use more groundwater followed by compensatory actions to increase recharge during wet periods hypothetical trigger rules for conjunctive use were developed for the model these rules define two sets of trigger levels referred to as the drought and non drought rulesets and management is switched between these depending on the surface water allocation drought trigger rules come into effect after consecutive years of surface water allocations below 60 or 80 depending on scenario this may be after 1 or 3 years after which irrigators are able to use their full groundwater entitlement for all but the lowest trigger level these are detailed in table 2 and referred to collectively as the proposed trigger rules farmers surveyed in the area have indicated that such increased use of groundwater is technically feasible most irrigators are reliant on surface water resources with 91 of those surveyed holding surface water licences compared to 22 who additionally hold groundwater licences ticehurst and curtis 2017 groundwater use historically has reached a maximum of 60 of allocated volumes although this has increased to 80 in recent times 2016 water usage as reported in ticehurst and curtis 2017 recalling that 25 of unused water can be carried over the current view is that irrigators are reserving water for drier times accepting a trade off between enhanced yields in wet years in return for water security in dry conditions hence the farming community could be described as managing water resources in a conjunctive manner albeit informally the cim includes a scaling factor 60 100 to adjust the amount of allocated groundwater considered for use by the farm model to reflect this informal management approach note that setting the scaling factor to 100 only makes all groundwater available it does not enforce its use limiting allocation to 60 then reflects a return to historic behaviour in which farmers intentionally reserve water to enhance future water security water usage and its impact is indicated with percentage increase or decrease in water use both ground and surface water compared to the baseline scenario and the long term decline or improvement as the case may be in terms of depth to groundwater across the farm zones in addition two quantities of interest relate to groundwater average groundwater allocation gw allocation index and the relative depth to groundwater head normalised by the lowest trigger level at each reference bore and averaged over the time series gw level change average allocations indicate reductions in access to groundwater whereas the change in relative depth provides an indication of how sustainable groundwater use is under the given condition negative changes to the gw level change imply increased reliance on groundwater and or reduced groundwater recharge notable model inputs are given in table 3 3 5 farm model the farm model represents the agricultural system by dividing the catchment into 12 zones based on their water entitlements policy rules governing water allocations and land use depicted in fig 6 corresponding to the management zones in use by gm water see goulburn murray water 2015 key attributes of a modelled farm include the costs and capital returns of crop sown nature and cost of irrigation and pumping systems and the soil water holding properties of the soils found within the zone the model focusses on cropping enterprises water use for dairying is not considered here cropping is modelled as a three year rotation of wheat barley and canola further details on the model formulation are provided in appendix b irrigation systems considered in the model include gravity pipe and riser and spray these represent the cheapest and least water efficient to the most expensive and efficient option available to farmers gravity is regarded as the dominant form of irrigation in the lower campaspe although it is known through stakeholder feedback that there is increasing adoption of spray irrigation in the area parameters representing soil water capacity were raised by stakeholders as particularly important as they determine what irrigation system is suitable and influence frequency of irrigation events farms with sandier soils see a greater benefit from a switch to more efficient irrigation systems as such soils have a lower water retention capacity while farmers cannot change the soil type it is possible to improve soil health such that water retention is enhanced through best management practices bruyn 2019 table 4 lists the considered irrigation options for each farm zone based on the weighted zonal average soil water capacity for the presented study only zones 4 and 9 were modelled as being suitable for spray irrigation farmer decisions are modelled through linear programming at the start of and during a growing season the available area is allocated to dryland cropping and irrigation with surface and groundwater by optimising profit calculated with assumed per hectare revenues and costs constrained by water availability the model then optimises for profitable water usage for each subsequent two week time step for each farm zone until the pre determined harvest date again further details of the model formulation are given in appendix b the assumption of this approach is that a series of short term decisions that are financially sound will result in a profitable outcome the two week time step was also necessary to facilitate representation of cross domain interactions as agricultural irrigation pumping activities influence stream and groundwater systems all events irrigation planting sowing harvest are assumed to take place within two week periods in terms of interactions with other component models the farm model is influenced by the water allocation determined by the policy model and subsequently influences the surface and groundwater models through irrigation water extraction pumping and irrigation activities further interaction with the policy model is included due to local policies allowing carryover in which a portion of unused water is made available to irrigators in the following year from the perspective of the farm model three categories of factors can be identified uncontrollable limited control and direct control uncontrollable factors are those that cannot be influenced in any direct manner such as climate condition water allocations or crop water requirements limited control factors are those which a farmer may influence to some degree such as how much water a soil type can hold by applying soil management practices direct control factors are those that a farmer can influence directly such as the irrigation system in use their efficiencies through irrigation design and monitoring and so on groundwater cap gw cap is a model input of note and acts to force the model to limit available water for consideration by the farm model as noted above in the groundwater policy section section 3 4 2 only 60 of allocated groundwater has been used by irrigators in the past the considered parameter range was 60 100 where 60 represents past behaviour and 100 reflects consideration of all available groundwater for use without regard to future water security the cap can be applied in combination with the conjunctive management scenario detailed in section 3 4 above three key indicators were used to represent farm performance 1 the average seasonal farm profit for the scenario 2 the average seasonal water use in ml and 3 the coefficient of variation σ μ for farm income taken as a measure of fluctuations in yearly income i e a volatility index larger values for the volatility index indicate scenarios in which farm income undergoes large variations from year to year irrigation area relative to catchment area and water use are also included 3 6 surface water model the surface water system is represented by a purpose built variant of the ihacres rainfall runoff model croke and jakeman 2004 written in fortran and interfaced with a python wrapper the component model comprises a rainfall streamflow model a routing module and a rating curve module the component is driven by rainfall and potential evapotranspiration climate data estimated groundwater and surface water interactions from the groundwater component dam releases as given by the policy and farm components and water extractions from the stream farm component as water orders are lumped due to the farm model operating on a two week time step the volume extracted is disaggregated uniformly across the 14 days as a daily average effective rainfall i e rainfall that contributes to streamflow is calculated from rainfall via a non linear loss module from croke and jakeman 2004 modified to partition effective rainfall between quick and slow flows based on modelled catchment moisture status croke et al 2015 movement of water through the river network is represented by two parallel exponentially decaying stores representing quick and slow flow contributions a further exponentially decaying store is used to route the flows between nodes croke et al 2006 modelled flows are converted to stage heights by the rating curve module using data available at most gauge sites the single exception is gauge 406218 where available data were limited to water level losses from the river network to groundwater are considered via interactions with the groundwater component similar to the approach in ivkovic et al 2014 dam level streamflow and level were important quantities to represent as these influence water allocations ecological health and recreational use of the dam described in later sections stream flow and level are estimated at specific nodes show in fig 7 which were selected based on the location of gauges with suitable data taking into consideration the needs of the integrated model see fig 2 these values are passed to the groundwater model in order to estimate infiltration loss and baseflow contribution to surface flow calibrating the model against historic observations proved difficult due to variation of parameter values estimated depending on climate sequence and so a decision was made to divide the climate sequence into six time periods and calibrate parameter values for each separately using the differential evolution algorithm storn and price 1997 a good fit with historic dam levels was achieved with this approach with a nse value of 0 96 depicted in fig 8 calibrated values were then used for the corresponding time periods for all climate scenarios each set of parameters have a limited scope of applicability but their use for the segmented time periods is arguably justified for the modelling purpose as similar patterns can be associated with the provided climate scenarios as previously described in section 3 3 time periods defined for calibration purposes are detailed in appendix d 3 7 groundwater model the groundwater component serves two roles in the cim the first is to provide estimations of the exchanges between surface water and groundwater along the lower campaspe river at specific gauge locations the second is to provide estimations of the groundwater levels for each farm zone and at specific bore locations which influence allocations of groundwater and pumping costs and is a factor in the ecological indicator metric see section 3 8 interactions at a daily time step with the surface water farm ecology and policy components are included in this manner and are forced by rainfall irrigation pumping and river stages depicted in fig 9 stakeholders provided knowledge and data with respect to pumping observational groundwater head and chemistry which informed the groundwater model boundaries ensuring that the necessary spatial area is captured in the model the groundwater model represents the lower campaspe at a 5 km grid resolution with 7 layers comprising 1386 active cells spacing of which was informed by hydrogeologic unit rasters from the victorian aquifer framework dse 2012c the relatively large grid resolution was selected as 1 it aligns with the provided climate data and 2 for computational reasons as higher resolutions required prohibitively longer run times modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 was used to construct the groundwater component and is interfaced with via the flopy package bakker et al 2016 modflow was selected due to its open source and well documented nature which complements our iterative development and because the modelling platform is regarded as an industry standard modelled groundwater extraction is distributed across known wells within each farm zone response to input from the streamflow lags the surface water model as component models are run sequentially it is assumed that the daily lag will not have a significant impact on model behaviour recharge is derived by multiplying the sum of rainfall and irrigation by a rainfall reduction parameter between 0 no recharge and 1 no diversion with values being in the range of 0 001 0 43 these rainfall reduction values were derived from a map of recharge ranges for recharge zones defined by rainfall land use and soil type detailed in xie et al 2019 outputs from the groundwater model while not precise at the scale of local wells due to model resolution were fit for purpose for indicative average groundwater levels in areas of interest in the case of the ecology model the requisite groundwater heads obtained from the groundwater model would be subject to the largest variance due to the proximity to the campaspe river and variability of heads within a groundwater model cell for the policy model the trigger bores are chosen to be indicative of larger scale behaviour and hence the use of the average head in cells that correspond with the trigger bores is deemed appropriate effectiveness of policies in maintaining groundwater levels above the lowest trigger level is indicated by two metrics the first indicator is a weighted score based on the percent irrigation season allocation across the scenario period gw allocation index where a score of 1 0 indicates that water users were given 100 of their entitlements every year and values close to zero indicate consistently low water table such that pumping is disallowed the second indicator gw level change is the averaged normalised change in groundwater level between the start and the end of the model period relative to the lowest trigger level negative values then indicate that the lowest trigger level was breached these two indicators are referred to in the results as the gw allocation index and gw level change see section 4 for further detail poor performance of the groundwater model in the integrated context compared to historic observations can be expected due to the integrated model structure and design for one both the policy and farm models were developed to represent a more recent socio hydrological context i e post 2010 as required by the purpose of the modelling this temporal mismatch has the effect of reducing the overall volume of groundwater extraction and recharge compared to historic occurrences as noted in section 2 90 of the irrigators had stopped irrigation practices leading to the closure of the campaspe irrigation district and so the farm model represents this current level of irrigation activity the policy model includes reforms introduced to allow carryover of unused water to the next irrigation season as well as environmental water provisions which has an influence on the level of groundwater extractions contemporary accounts estimate 35 000 ml of water was used for irrigation within the campaspe irrigation district including approximately 3000 ml extracted from the aquifers chiew et al 1992 we also note reported difficulties in representing the groundwater system of the campaspe region in earlier studies it has been previously noted that the campaspe region is a difficult region to model beverly and hocking 2014 goode and barnett 2008 one confounding factor is the long history of system regulation and incomplete data with respect to groundwater extraction and usage at a fine r scale another reason is the local topography and landscape towards the south large elevation changes can be seen which are not captured by the 5 km grid resolution due to the coarse resolution in use for the purpose of the model there are significant differences in elevation between model cells 20 m these model conditions preclude the use of the groundwater model for accurate forecasting the purpose here however is in representing futures expanded on further in section 4 thus the focus in model development was on representing hypothetical groundwater level response to farmer behaviour and the water policies in place these are discussed in sections 4 and 5 3 8 ecology and recreation indicator models the models developed to represent ecological and recreational aspects of the lower campaspe system produce indicator values reflecting the suitability of stream and groundwater flow for key ecological purposes and dam water levels for recreational purposes ecological indicators represent the suitability of flow conditions for breeding feeding nesting and dispersal of platypus 4 indices and native fish 2 indices as well as maintenance and regeneration of the iconic river red gum trees 2 indices suitability thresholds were based on the north central cma environmental water management plan north central cma 2014 in conjunction with feedback from ecologists from the australian platypus conservancy and the north central cma as detailed in iwanaga et al 2018 it was suggested by stakeholders local representatives from the government department ecodev to lump ecological indicators into a single metric to ease interpretability of results the recreation indicator is based on a linear relationship between dam water level and perceived recreational suitability elicited through interviews with stakeholders from gm water caravan park managers and other recreational users all indicator models produce index values which range between 0 being unsuitable and 1 most preferable although ecology and recreation are separate and distinct systems they are lumped together here as the recreation index model constitutes a small aspect of the modelling presented here details specific to each ecological and recreational component are provided in appendix e with further detail available in fu 2017 3 9 conceptual integrated testing an issue in the development of cim was the lack of data to validate coupled model behaviour known as integration testing in software engineering parlance one example is the lack of farm level crop yield data partly due to privacy concerns data that were available describe average yield from both irrigated and dryland cropping on a per farm average basis for the entire north central region of the state of victoria an area of approximately 47 000 km2 compared to 2600 km2 for the lower campaspe additionally the temporal scale of available data is relatively short with records starting from 1990 to the early 2000s under such circumstances model testing and validation chiefly involved high level conceptual checks selected to indicate unacceptable model behaviour data to develop a strict quantitative metric was not generally available across the range of component model contexts and so the adopted approach was to contextualise performance against relevant criteria to provide an indication of model acceptability for example while financial data at the individual farm level were not available regional economic production data are available for the campaspe via australian department of agriculture 2019 performance of the farm modelling was considered unacceptable if calculated crop profits exceed or comprised an unjustifiably high proportion of the agricultural output of the campaspe catchment modelled crop profits under historic climate conditions amounted to 20 54 of the campaspe agricultural activity 13 81 m of 67 26 m which stands to reason given that the campaspe region is principally a dairy farming community long term average values were also used as a qualitative measure of acceptability wherein long term behaviour of the model was in line with historic observations example given in fig 10 it must be noted here that such an approach is subject to available expert knowledge tests at this conceptual level may be the only kind of integration tests applicable given the available resources data and domain knowledge and the purpose of the model for this reason the scope of testing must be carefully targeted and in line with available resources 4 methods for the scenario modelling exploratory scenario modelling was used to identify conditions which led to beneficial outcomes the term scenario here refers to the specific set of model inputs used for a model run which in turn leads to a specific spatial and temporal evolution of system variables and final outcomes from the perspective of farmers and policy managers these scenarios represent a possible farm and policy context the scenarios are run through the model and those with beneficial outcomes are subsequently identified thus the model is used in an exploratory manner rather than to obtain precise prediction of events only factors pertaining to the farm and policy models are considered in the scenario modelling calibration was not conducted for the integrated model in its entirety instead component models were calibrated individually against relevant historic observations of crop yields dam level and observed groundwater head and feedback obtained from stakeholders in cases where quantitative data were not available e g for the recreational indicator the approach is justified as the data used for calibration encompass a wide range of conditions and the trends rather than absolute values of the climate scenarios are similar to observed historical data as explained earlier in section 3 3 the ecology model takes no inputs other than the modelled streamflow and groundwater level the total number of model inputs that are directly considered in the cim comes to 266 of which 212 factors are regarded as constants this still leaves 54 parameters that can vary between scenarios and are largely inputs for the farm models for the different zones covariance analysis was carried out to determine the number of scenarios to run it is desirable for the input values not to be correlated across the sampled scenarios as this could induce artificial correlation within the results for those scenarios i e the covariance value should be as close to zero as possible a threshold of 0 02 for off diagonal values was selected as a compromise between parameter independence and model evaluation time see appendix f latin hypercube sampling a stratified monte carlo sampling approach was used to generate each scenario in total 5625 model evaluations were performed consisting of 1875 scenario samples for each selected climate scenario apart from the 5625 scenarios above the model was initially run using best guess default values for each model parameter for all climate scenarios these are referred to as the baseline results indicator scores from these then establish a baseline against which further comparisons can be made and represent the business as usual case in which the status quo is maintained in terms of farm management and policy under changing climate conditions further scenarios are then run allowing parameter values to vary to explore the possible outcomes under a range of conditions baseline results are compared against modelled historic outcomes while results from exploratory modelling are presented as comparisons to their respective baseline scenario comparing results to a baseline allows like for like comparisons it is assumed that change in a beneficial direction see table 6 is always desired and a scenario which exhibits improvements to system state relative to the baseline scenario is considered a desirable outcome for the purpose of this analysis a desirable outcome is one in which all indicators perform comparatively better when compared against their respective baselines to be explicit avg annual profit ecology index and recreation index were all required to have scores above 1 whilst income volatility should be below 1 choice of farm and policy inputs that lead to these desirable outcomes of improved farm water and environmental conditions across the possible climate futures and policy conditions are then regarded as robust a system state in which desirable outcomes are achieved under a range of plausible conditions mcphail et al 2018 the indicators of interest are described under relevant subsections in section 3 above and are summarised in table 6 with their beneficial direction indicated once desirable scenarios are identified the contributing model inputs were ranked using a random forest feature scoring approach feature scoring identifies factors of relative import towards a given result dimensional stacking suzuki et al 2015 is then used to identify the inputs that led to the outcome of interest appendix a gives a description of terms used in referring to outcomes the above approach allows communication of the model inputs that lead to the outcomes under different scenario conditions the range of results then represent the uncertainty in achieving desirable outcomes and increases confidence that a given condition leads to a desirable change at least under the model assumptions reichert and borsuk 2005 the adopted method also avoids prescribing specific conditions to be undertaken and instead considers a range of alternate decisions that fulfil stakeholder requirements herman et al 2015 5 results and discussion overall the results indicate that further pressures will be placed on farmers and the environment without changes to adapt to uncertain climate conditions as have previous studies and reports in the murray darling basin austin et al 2018 mdba 2019 steffen et al 2018 comparisons of results against the modelled historic climate scenario are depicted in fig 11 surface water allocations are lower in the majority of scenarios which is expected here as they are typically more arid compared to the historic condition as shown in fig 5 in order to cope with this situation the area under irrigation is reduced so as to maintain the necessary ml ha volume to attain crop growth and maximum yields doing so however comes with a commensurate reduction to average annual income along with larger fluctuations from year to year depicted by the income volatility indicator in fig 11 a reduction in groundwater use can also be seen compared to the modelled historic scenario attributable to the reduction in irrigated area groundwater use under drier conditions is higher than their wetter counterparts but does not offset the lack of available surface water as would be expected ecological and recreational indicators diverge from the historic baseline results based on the climatic condition it should be noted that any decrease to the ecological indicator is undesirable given that riverine health is already considered to be highly stressed comparisons of the 5625 scenario results against the historic baseline revealed 796 with desirable outcomes however none of these were robust i e beneficial under all climate conditions with no desirable outcomes identified under dry climate conditions the lack of desirable outcomes for the dry climate scenario suggests that improved outcomes compared to historic conditions become increasingly improbable as the climate becomes drier regardless of what changes are made fig 12 one suggested scenario was the adoption of irrigation systems with higher water application efficiencies to increase water savings across the catchment although soil factors may make such a scenario unlikely see section 3 5 no beneficial outcomes were identified in such cases even in the case where all non dryland zones i e all zones except for 1 3 5 and 12 adopted improved irrigations given no robust scenarios were identified against historic results we then conduct comparisons against baseline results for specific climate conditions in other words scenarios under dry climate conditions were compared against the dry climate baseline in order to identify conditions that led to relative improvements a small number of scenarios were identified as being robust under all climate conditions 93 scenarios input parameters of most import leading to these are related to crop field and irrigation factors followed by policy factors and the maximum amount of groundwater considered these farm level factors are listed in table 5 under section 3 5 the high feature score attributed to crop field and irrigation factors is perhaps unsurprising but it does highlight the importance of a well informed farming community over estimating crop water requirements and costs reduces the irrigation area considered and poorly set up or poorly maintained irrigation infrastructure including pumps and soil health increases costs and water usage thereby impacting farm profitability fig 13 at the field level improving the availability of accurate information on soil water holding capacity has the greatest contribution to farm profitability specifically soil water retention within zones 5 10 and 9 are indicated to influence outcomes more than at other locations in the lower campaspe fig 14 at the same time targeted adoption of spray irrigation within zones 4 and 9 the zones indicated to be most amenable to spray irrigation systems in our analysis did not necessarily lead to robust outcomes further highlighting the point that simply improving irrigation systems across the catchment is not a viable adaptation strategy possible reasons for this include operational costs incurred with spray irrigation and the lower water efficiency of pipe and riser systems contributing to increased recharge or streamflow under certain conditions having the effect of improving ecological outcomes i e due to higher return flows one particular aspect of interest was the percentage of groundwater allocation which irrigators consider for use gw cap previously explained in section 3 4 2 while irrigators have historically used 60 of groundwater allocations in a bid to enhance future water security increased consideration of groundwater use improves the likelihood of desirable outcomes to be experienced under all climate conditions fig 15 increasing the volume of groundwater to be considered for use compensates for the decreased surface water availability under more arid conditions consideration of all available groundwater resources 100 may be necessary under proposed conjunctive use rulesets likely due to the reduction in accessible groundwater in wet periods enforced by the proposed rules this suggests that while the informal and disparate approach to conjunctive use may be adequate farmers who are overly cautious and restrict groundwater use may not experience the maximum possible yields and capital returns in the long term the results shown in fig 13 emphasize the importance of farm level factors towards achieving robust outcomes stakeholders have specified various programmes designed to engage with and promote farm management best practices e g dedjtr 2015a department of economic development 2017 assuming then that farms have little room for further improvement in terms of soil water holding capacity knowledge and consideration of crop properties and on farm infrastructure such as irrigation and pumping systems we can then identify which factors contribute towards robust outcomes focusing the analysis on factors external to the farming system itself the amount of allocations from the goulburn system is identified as playing a large role perhaps unsurprising given the volume of entitlements which campaspe irrigators rely on particularly in zones 8 and 10 see table 1 aside from the goulburn catchment allocations the conjunctive use policy rules in place for a given scenario gw restriction have a notable effect fig 16 in scenarios where goulburn allocations have lowered we see a concentration of robust scenarios wherein conjunctive use of water is allowed under median allocation situations conjunctive use allows robust outcomes to be achieved while maintaining groundwater use in line with historic behaviour without conjunctive use enabled however considered use of groundwater has to increase to 90 100 in order for the changes to be robust fig 17 as goulburn water availability further decreases groundwater use becomes especially important towards achieving robust outcomes robust outcomes are more likely if conjunctive use is enabled along with high levels of groundwater use fig 18 the modelling suggests that groundwater levels can be maintained above the lowest trigger level however careful consideration is required especially with regard to the effect on salinity and water quality issues aspects which the modelling presented here did not cover the results suggest that improvements to farm soils and infrastructure will be beneficial within the campaspe and additional communication training and financial incentive programmes beyond what has already been occurring may increase benefits any such programme should consider possible issues surrounding social acceptability and be cognisant of issues with previous approaches to appraising the cost benefits grafton and wheeler 2018 while increasing groundwater use is generally beneficial possible issues surrounding social acceptability of increased use and water quality particularly salinity should be fully considered the results raise the possibility of increasing groundwater allocations in the lower campaspe especially if managed aquifer recharge is adopted in the region chiew et al 1995 ticehurst and curtis 2017 5 1 model and scenario uncertainty integrated models are constructed through the interfacing of models that collectively cross disciplinary lines and their respective system boundaries intuitively uncertainty will not decrease if more models are added simply due to compound uncertainty this is the uncertainty that arises as outputs from one model are used as inputs to another with each interaction propagating some amount of error dunford et al 2015 refsgaard et al 2007 in the context of the cim the sources of uncertainty and their contributions to total model uncertainty are too great to list out individually within the confines of this paper formal analyses of individual model components and total model uncertainty including structural uncertainty with regards to model selection is the subject of another paper qualitatively however the farm model represents the largest source of compound uncertainty as all components except for climate are influenced by mechanisms internal to the farm model in other words the farm model behaves as a nexus point between models and thus the errors in the interoperated data may be cancelled out or compounded and subsequently propagated through an over estimation of streamflow may be corrected in a sense by over estimation of required crop water and under estimation of irrigation efficiency similarly the opposite may also be true such influence may occur directly e g streamflow reduced due to farm water extraction or indirectly e g ecological suitability influenced by streamflow the reader is once again referred to fig 2 which indicates the component interactions uncertainty within the models was addressed through participatory engagement processes section 3 1 and the conceptual testing process section 3 9 both of which ensured model behaviour is qualitatively plausible as judged by stakeholders and which involved changes in response to their feedback on top of this exploratory modelling was applied to hypothetical policy contexts identified by stakeholders and the range of on farm activities considered using results from the farmer survey ticehurst and curtis 2017 2016 each scenario explored was tied to three specific climate datasets which represent hypothetical shifts in aridity i e dry usual and wet conditions limiting the climate scenarios to these three was done to keep the total number of possible scenario combinations to a manageable level as model runtime was a concern an alternate approach is the use of multiple projections for each aridity scenario this would more comprehensively address scenario uncertainty with respect to climate inputs as it would allow the influence of differing degrees of dryness to wetness to be explored another source of uncertainty rarely discussed is computational infrastructure uncertainty here we define computational infrastructure uncertainty as the uncertainty that arises in model interoperation and integration and application across various computational contexts model technical uncertainty as defined in refsgaard et al 2007 is a related issue which we regard as being specific to the uncertainties that may arise from a model s implementation computational infrastructure uncertainty is distinguishable from model technical uncertainty in that models that have identical implementations may yet exhibit different behaviour when applied on different infrastructure such as operating systems see for example bhandari neupane et al 2019 platforms e g desktop vs supercomputer interoperation of data via various means e g local storages vs over a network and formats and different programming languages or due to the use of different compilers or different versions of the same compiler computational infrastructure uncertainty was addressed by applying the model across various computational infrastructure including but not limited to both windows and linux operating systems different fortran and c compilers and ensuring identical baseline results a major error was discovered through this process due to the declaration of an uninitialized variable in the fortran code which was subsequently used in a later calculation depending on the compiler the default behaviour may be to initialize the undefined variable to 0 0 and thereby will have no effect on the result or may hold junk values from its location in memory space which subsequently propagate throughout the integrated model 6 limitations and future work a difficult aspect to manage in the study was the determination of model scope the collaborative modelling undertaken encompasses several disciplinary domains from economics and finance bio physical and social aspects and computational considerations limiting the scope to a manageable size often boiled down to making pragmatic compromises here we detail some known limitations and avenues for future work climate data used in the modelling display little changes in evapotranspiration from scenario to scenario evapotranspiration is used as a reference value that informs crop water use in the model and ultimately the frequency of irrigation throughout the growing season crop loss due to extreme heat pests or other influences are also not considered changing weather events due to a changing climate will also require the growing season to be shifted earlier or later prokopy et al 2015 wang et al 2019 or timed to take advantage of forecasted rainfall however these planting harvest dates were constants in the modelling an avenue for further enhancement can be expanding the agricultural activities represented in the model dairying is a primary industry in the study area but is not explicitly represented in the model cropping was determined to be the common agricultural activity regardless of farm enterprise and so the decision was made to focus efforts towards representing farm behaviour in that context while irrigation with groundwater was found to be an important aspect towards yielding robust outcomes the model did not incorporate water quality aspects and so further in depth investigation particularly on salinity issues are required cropping enterprise profitability may reflect dairying financial performance and so beneficial model outcomes are used in the study to indicate beneficial outcomes for the catchment generally as noted by stakeholders the relationship between the enterprises is expected to be particularly poor in dry conditions as dairy farmers have the option of acquiring feedstock externally irrigators may also trade water an activity not represented in the model to cover shortfalls in water availability averaging farm water orders across a 14 day time step means that the cim does not represent high volume water orders that are released within a shorter time span consequently the implications of high volume water orders on ecological flow suitability indicator may not be adequately captured on this note the policy model currently includes environmental considerations based on legislated flow requirements but is not reactive to modelled streamflow level or groundwater head and effects on ecological indicators future work could then consider possible adaptive management processes in which water allocations and or their releases are adjusted to meet environmental considerations whilst uncertainty in the modelling is taken into account largely through the use of climate scenarios and sampling of parameter space future work is envisaged to identify the most important sources of uncertainty in the modelling in this endeavour one way forward is to use a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative approach e g refsgaard et al 2007 especially involving stakeholders and experts in helping to rank the criticality of the different sources as to their influence on model outcomes before embarking on a quantitative set of exercises nevertheless we believe the work to this point is a valuable starting point for raising awareness and discussion amongst stakeholders as to opportunities for managing water more beneficially in the catchment one important social aspect not represented in the presented study is the cultural importance of the local flora and fauna and issues of cultural flows the release of water to fulfil activities or conditions of cultural and social importance moggridge et al 2019 indeed it has been increasingly acknowledged that water entitlements for cultural flows are not yet made a consistent part of australian water management legislation policies or guidelines despite being identified as a national priority area jackson et al 2012 williams et al 2019 this limitation will be addressed in planned future work currently under discussion 7 conclusions on sustainable water management opportunities this paper presents a component based integrated environmental model developed to explore sustainable water management options within the lower campaspe sub catchment of the murray darling basin stakeholder participation was critical to the model capabilities as local stakeholders provided knowledge feedback and data to assist in conceptualising the system the participatory and model based collaborative approach yields results that reveal opportunities to consider for achieving improved socio environmental outcomes and water security relative to the modelled historic baseline improvements at the farm level were found to be a prospective contribution towards this goal as were farm water management and changes to governing policy rules specifically conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources and increased use of the latter was found to improve outcomes adoption of the most efficient irrigation systems considered spray and pipe and riser did not necessarily lead to desirable outcomes across all climate conditions it then follows that simply improving irrigation water efficiency is not a sufficient course of action

calculation include the variable costs for the crop sown maintenance of irrigation and pumping systems if applicable costs associated with licensing water ordering and pumping costs the sum of these gives the dollar profit income π for the farm zone in this manner the farm costs expected yields and profit and estimated crop water requirements play a role in scheduling irrigation events the estimated total profit is necessarily an approximation profit after harvest is calculated directly from crop yield as detailed below irrigation scheduling farmers will irrigate ideally when crops require additional water determining when these irrigations occur is referred to as irrigation scheduling in this model it is assumed that farmers are monitoring soil moisture levels and have access to weather data specifically pan evapotranspiration e t 0 soil water deficit s w d is a cumulative indicator of how dry soils can become before additional water is required to be applied to avoid crop losses soil water deficit worsens by subtracting crop evapotranspiration e t c which is calculated by applying a scaling crop coefficient k c i e e t c e t 0 k c with each crop type having a corresponding k c value once s w d reaches a refill point commonly referred to as the net irrigation depth n i d an irrigation event is scheduled and s w d reduced by the effective water applied this approach is commonly applied on farm and examples can be found in publications from state governments see for example hughes 1999 qassim and ashcroft 2002 the n i d value itself is calculated by multiplying the effective root zone at a point in time d r z t with the possible readily available water r a w for the given soil type the effective root zone is the depth at which the crop gets much of its water via its roots and is dependent on soil type and crop properties baker and ahern 1989 here d r z is assumed to be 55 of root depth for the given crop type as in qassim and ashcroft 2002 where relevant information regarding root depths throughout the season and crop growth stages could not be obtained and as such acts as a constant if sufficient data were available the alternative approach would be to calculate it as 2 d r z t r d t e r d t where r d t is the root depth for the stage of growth at time t and e r d t the effective root depth coefficient for the crop type maihol et al in itier et al 1996 nominal values for these parameters were obtained from fao guidelines allen et al 1998 the net irrigation depth can then be calculated as 3 n i d t d r z t r a w r a w t a w p here t a w corresponds to the total amount of water a soil can hold and p represents the crop soil water depletion fraction as in qassim and ashcroft 2002 the values used for t a w is discussed in the next section on soils the soil water deficit at a point in time can be calculated as 4 s w d t min s w d t 1 e t c t e t i w t 0 where e t t 1 n p t i f m o n t h i s j u n e t o a u g u s t t 1 n

the irrigation water applied at the time step no water may be applied in the time step in which case this coefficient will be 0 e t c t is the sum of crop evapotranspiration e t c that occurred within the time step it should be noted here that the intention of this particular model is not to have an accurate representation of effective rainfall or water recharge drainage processes the model is as mentioned above based on the published advice for irrigators in victoria and so represents the assumed behaviour of the irrigation process irrigation occurs to refill s w d once it reaches or goes beyond n i d and these are both represented as negative values or else 0 the base volume of irrigation water i w b to be applied is taken to be equal to s w d t when it reaches this refill point this

s w d t n i d t irrigation efficiency refers to the percentage of water that reaches the crop root zone allowing the crop ease of access to water water applied with less efficient irrigation systems

depicted in fig 19 is repeated until the crop is harvested at the end of the growing season estimated costs for each irrigation system were corroborated by a senior irrigation specialist with ecodev maskey 2016 the simplest irrigation system is gravity which relies on as the name suggests gravity to flood an area with water pipe and riser systems are similar in that it also floods a field but instead uses a pressurized pipe system to transport water increasing costs spray is the most efficient but is also the most expensive to install and operate due to the fuel costs necessary to generate the pressure needed to move and apply water the upper limit for all irrigation systems was set to 90 which is possible for all systems depending on soil type system set up and configuration and additional work conducted to make the field more amenable for the chosen irrigation type finger and morris 2005 for example the field could be laser graded to ensure a more consistent application of gravity fed irrigation water indeed 77 of those survey respondents reported having undertaken additional improvements to gravity irrigation such as laser grading and tail water reuse from excess water reaching the bottom of the field gravity irrigation was then modelled as being 50 and 90 efficient based on this information with the base efficiency set at 50 representing the usual case table 7 soils an early iteration of the model used the dominant soil type found in the lower campaspe area sandy loam see fig 21 as a representative surrogate stakeholders indicated that this approach may not adequately represent the importance of soil type and health in agricultural enterprises due to the diversity found at the smaller zonal scales stakeholders further indicated that farmers with lighter soils on their lands may find spray irrigation more attractive as light soils are not capable of holding as much water as heavy soils the t a w value is comparatively less influencing irrigation scheduling equally true is that farmers with heavier soils may not see a benefit from a move to spray to reflect this only farm zones that were identified as having light soils were modelled to have the option of changing irrigation systems to spray irrigation to better represent the conditions which impact irrigation scheduling and choice of irrigation system it is then necessary to represent the range of soil textures within the model farm zones to achieve this published t a w value ranges for various soil types allen et al 1998 qassim and ashcroft 2002 were used in conjunction with a soil map of the campaspe catchment to create weighted zonal values see fig 20 these values were based on the proportional area of soil types found within a zone a weighted average median value was used as the nominal best guess value with the weighted minimum and maximum values indicating the possible value bounds the soil map was kindly provided by ecodev a victorian state government department pumping pumping water for irrigation typically represents the largest operational costs for a farm depi 2014a seasonal pumping costs were considered as this may vary depending on climate conditions and allocated water availability this cost can itself vary depending on the type of pump and its configuration extracting groundwater decreases the groundwater level thereby increasing pumping costs due to the greater distance and pressure required pumping systems were simplified into two categories indicating whether they are for shallow or deep bore pumping the former represents pumping from an irrigation channel or shallow aquifer with the latter used to represent groundwater pumping at a depth of 20 m or more stakeholders indicated that a mix of diesel and electric pumps are used in the study area 60 and 40 respectively electric pumping costs can range from 16 5c to 32 8c per kilowatt kw while electricity plans with a flat rate of 27c kw can also be arranged bob knowles 8 jan 2018 pers comm diesel fuel was assumed to have a cost of 1 20 per litre with a fuel volume per kw of 0 25 robinson 2002 resolving to 30c kw a weighted average of these values was used to represent the mixed 60 40 use of both diesel and electric pumps 28 5c kw the kw cost of pumping is likely to change over time but was modelled as a constant under the assumption that the cost of upgrading infrastructure is cost prohibitive within the modelled time frame installation of bores to access groundwater incur significant capital costs ranging from 18 000 to 70 000 for a shallow bore and 90 000 to 320 000 for deep bores robinson 2002 it is assumed here that such infrastructure is already in place and so no initial capital costs are considered the average annual maintenance costs are included in the modelling however and are taken to be 5 of capital costs every 5 years and 20 every 15 years minor and major maintenance respectively nominal values for these shallow and deep bore capital costs were 18 000 and 235 000 taken from robinson 2002 the number and location of groundwater bores for each farm zone are indicated in fig 22 pumping costs throughout the irrigation season is then calculated as 7 c p m l c f u e l c k w h m l read as the cost per pumped ml being equal to the cost of fuel per litre by the cost per kilowatt kw hour multiplied by the hours necessary to pump a megaliter of water the total pumping cost can then be determined simply as 8 c p u m p i w c p m l in the presented modelling c k w is calculated in advance 28 5c kw as detailed earlier however it can be calculated directly if needed and the necessary information on the pumping system is available the calculation takes the form of 9 p u m p f u e l p k w f where f 0 25 p k w h f c 102 e p d the volume of diesel fuel p u m p f u e l is based on the required energy p k w and number of litres required to produce 1 kw f 0 25 as given in robinson 2002 the amount of kilowatt energy required is dependent on the total head pressure in metres h the flow capacity of the irrigation system in use f c pump efficiency e p and derating factor d head pressure h is defined as the sum of 1 the discharge pressure head 2 the friction head of water flow i e friction loss and 3 the height between the source of water and the discharge level robinson 2002 the typical total pumping head for a given irrigation system supplied with surface water is taken from smith 2015 these values range from 10 m head pressure for gravity to 60 m for spray irrigation although the values in smith 2015 are intended for irrigators in new south wales the indicated pumping costs were within the value range suggested by a local irrigation specialist maskey 2016 for a type of flood irrigation pipe and riser 8 15 and spray irrigation system centre pivot 30 50 typical head and cost ranges are shown in table 8 head pressure is multiplied by the flow capacity of the irrigation system f c the value of which is taken from literature regarding a farm in the study area given as 138 88 litres second or 12 ml day dedjtr 2015 the literature derived values assume that the pumping system can operate at the desired head pressure and flow rate and that the pump itself is in good condition pump efficiency e p is the percent energy efficiency of the pump representing the amount of energy imparted on the water this value is multiplied by a constant of 102 to convert unit of pressure kpa into metres given in faour 2001 in robinson 2002 the derating factor d accounts for efficiency losses between the total amount of energy required and the energy required at the pump shaft the derating factor is said to be 0 75 for diesel pumps faour 2001 in robinson 2002 as pumping efficiencies may vary model evaluation was conducted with e p set to a conservative value of 0 7 the suggested value to use when the pump configuration and efficiency are unknown vellotti and kalogerinis 2013 other efficiency losses which influence total pumping head are not explicitly considered but are accounted for through the use of this conservative pump efficiency value as in vellotti and kalogerinis 2013 groundwater pumping costs may fluctuate due to the changes in height distance between water source and discharge point resulting in an increase in total pumping head such a decrease in water levels necessitates increased amounts of energy and thus fuel to pump water from the increased distance to account for decreasing water levels the depth of groundwater is added to the head values given by smith 2015 to allow consideration of the effect of fluctuating groundwater levels the time taken to pump a single ml of water h m l is then determined by dividing the number of litres in a ml by the flow rate q in litres per second this resolves to the number of seconds required to pump 1 ml dividing this by the number of seconds in an hour 3600 or 60 2 results in the hour s required to pump 1 ml 10 h m l 10 6 q 60 2 10 6 1ml crops the crops represented include three cereal crops of wheat barley and canola these are applied as a three year rotation i e cultivating wheat one year barley the next and finally canola after which the rotation is repeated an earlier version included tomato however this crop was removed as its widespread cultivation was described as unrealistic and highly improbable by stakeholders as were horticultural crops in general determining seasonal profit values for the expected revenue r and associated production costs c for each crop and irrigation type used in eq 1 are taken from various grey literature sources to determine the optimal irrigation volume throughout the growing season or the irrigated area in the case of the first time step once the growing season has ended however a modified french schultz equation oliver et al 2009 whitbread and hancock 2008 is used to obtain the final crop yield table 9 11 y s s m g s r i w v c w u e 1000 the modified french schultz equation above takes into account the stored soil water at the start of season s s m the effective rainfall that occurred during the growing season g s r which is the sum of e t from eq 4 the sum of any irrigation water applied i w which will be 0 for dryland crops and the crop evaporation coefficient v which represents the required rainfall before a crop will yield these are then adjusted by a crop water use efficiency index c w u e to arrive at the per hectare crop yield y the resulting value is then converted to tonnes per hectare by dividing by 1000 values for the french schultz equation were initially taken from published fao guidelines allen et al 1998 with s s m assumed to be 30 of rainfall that occurred over february to april these were subsequently calibrated against historic per farm average crop yield data for the north central region obtained from the australian bureau of agricultural and resource economics abares the north central region represents an area significantly larger than the lower campaspe sub catchment however it is the most spatially relevant dataset available calibration used the l bfgs b function minimization routine implemented in the scipy python package jones et al 2001 to reduce root square mean error rmse this process achieved results with an overall rmse of 0 68 and a long term average yield comparable to what has occurred historically 2 37 t ha compared to the historic seasonal average of 2 27 t ha for dryland wheat the parameters for irrigated crops were adjusted to return higher yields as is usual for crops under irrigation the modelled results with calibrated values for both dryland and irrigation yields were deemed to be acceptable and reasonable by stakeholders further example calibration results are shown in fig 23 the seasonal profit is calculated in the same manner as used to optimize water usage see eq 1 albeit with yield values y replaced with those calculated by the french schultz equation and the costs now representing the variable and fixed costs associated with the cropping enterprise but also the costs accrued throughout the growing season such as cost of pumping and water access fees from here the per hectare profit for a growing season π h a and profit per ml of water used π w can be determined as 12 π h a π t a t 13 π w π t w t where w t is the total water volume applied for the season and a t is the earlier defined total field area rather than model a global crop market it is assumed here that the harvest for each year is sold appendix c representing goulburn allocations see

based on recommendations outlined in the environmental water management plan set out by the north central catchment management authority north central cma 2014 following these recommendations streamflow is to be maintained to at least 10 ml day in the summer and 50 ml day in winter to allow for movement and food supply macroinvertebrate productivity and dispersal water releases in the summer and autumn freshes are necessary to maintain food supply and in the autumn aid in the movement of platypus young an additional burrow flooding index is used to represent prolonged high flow events during the nursing season which may flood platypus burrows and drown the young fish index fish represented in the ecology model are categorised by their lifespans long and short lived fish examples of long lived fish include the murray cod and the golden perch with their oldest recorded estimated ages being 48 years anderson et al 1992 and 26 years mallen cooper and stuart 2003 respectively short lived fish include the rainbowfish and carp gudgeons which have typical lifespans of 2 3 years species of long lived fish have individual spawning preferences e g murray cod is considered to spawn in low flow conditions whereas golden perch prefer high flow flood conditions in contrast short lived fish generally prefer low flow conditions ralph et al 2010 fish indicators represent suitable conditions during breeding and nesting seasons low flow in summer and winter e g 500 1000 ml day spring freshes to trigger spawning events for long lived fish at least 500 ml day

sustainable water management options possible futures with improved farm profitability and ecological outcomes relative to modelled baselines were identified through exploratory modelling the integrated model and the results produced are intended to raise awareness and facilitate discussion with and amongst stakeholders new hydrological insights the modelling illustrates that improved farm level knowledge and management with regard to crop water requirements soil water capacity and irrigations are the most significant factors towards achieving outcomes that are robust to a range of climate and water policy futures assuming farmer management with regard to these factors are at their most optimal increasing irrigation efficiency alone did not lead to improved farm profitability and ecological outcomes under drier climate conditions likelihood of achieving robust outcomes were further improved through the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater with increased consideration of groundwater use a key factor further discussion on the viability and impact of increased groundwater use and conjunctive use policies should be further considered keywords integrated modelling participatory modelling exploratory modelling scenario discovery conjunctive water use 1 introduction sustainable water management and aims of the integrated modelling management of water resources takes place within the context of a complex socio environmental system sustainable management of water resources requires the needs of several agricultural environmental and social domains to be balanced with explicit consideration of a multitude of interacting factors here sustainable refers to water usage that is both beneficial and robust featuring improved farm profitability and environmental outcomes and maintaining these under changing possibly adverse climatic conditions within hypothetical policy contexts revisited in section 4 holistic modelling of this socio environmental system then requires an integrated approach due to the number of system domains under consideration the level of interactions that can occur at different spatial and temporal scales and the uncertainty that comes with it letcher et al 2007 schlüter et al 2019 a well considered integrated approach can reduce the risk of unintentionally disregarding crucial aspects of the management context and the flow on effects without which the conclusions reached may be compromised kelly et al 2013 to this end integrated environmental models iems are often constructed to aid in informing management and policy decisions elsawah et al 2020a janssen et al 2010 voinov and shugart 2013 stakeholder engagement is an important step in integrated modelling particularly in developing socio economic scenarios that are acceptable and relevant to stakeholders such participatory approaches within water resource modelling processes are now considered best practice in facilitating stakeholder buy in credibility of the modelling and integration of local knowledge and information into the model kelly et al 2013 megdal et al 2017 refsgaard et al 2007 to holistically develop the model an approach such as the one described in badham et al 2019 can be used to elicit stakeholder knowledge to aid in defining the problem frame and key issues the murray darling basin plan introduced in 2012 increases the amount of water allocated for environmental purposes by decreasing the volume for consumptive use bowler 2015 north central cma 2014 the intention of the plan is to rectify the observed long term degradation of environmental health of river systems within the murray darling basin generally to this end beneficial future scenarios would improve or at least maintain current levels of water availability for agricultural environmental and recreational purposes in the face of uncertain future climate conditions the primary aims of the study presented within this paper were to identify these future pathways scenarios to improved environmental and socio economic outcomes under a variety of climate conditions for the lower campaspe catchment in north central victoria australia on farm practices and water allocation policies were modelled and an exploratory modelling approach haasnoot et al 2013 adopted to identify these possible robust outcomes such scenario discovery approaches have been utilised previously to identify viable adaptation strategies with indication of trade offs between scenarios kwakkel et al 2016 the variety of data and knowledge sources number of systems involved and the interactions and feedbacks between them required to represent such a system made the use of an integrated model a natural fit an iem was developed for the study which we refer to as the cim campaspe integrated model the cim includes representations of relevant systems across the socio environmental spectrum and their interactions these include policy farm surface and groundwater hydrology ecology and recreational values climate factors are represented by rainfall and evapotranspiration data which drive the modelled system the cim is used to explore the mix of considered farm and policy level options that are robust in the long term in terms of successfully achieving desirable improvements from a baseline across climate scenarios in this paper we detail the model components developed discuss the integration process and finally present the model results and their implications the specifics of the management context and modelling process are reported in iwanaga et al 2018 however relevant elements will be repeated herein for context 2 lower campaspe study area the lower campaspe study area is a semi arid region situated in the north central region of victoria australia and is named for its primary river the campaspe which flows northwards joining the murray river the primary water source for the lower campaspe is the dam at lake eppalock which divides the campaspe into its lower and upper sub catchments the dam is operated by goulburn murray water gm water subject to local and federally mandated policies such as the aforementioned murray darling basin plan under current policies the environment is regarded as a water user with its own water entitlements north central cma 2014 aside from managing dam operations and other responsibilities gm water is the local irrigation authority determining water allocations for both agricultural and environmental users and managing licencing for water use and access the campaspe catchment is a mixed farming area with a focus on dairy farming with 55 of its land use devoted to annual and perennial pastures cereal cropping amounts to 36 of reported agricultural land area fig 1 displays a map of the lower campaspe in context of the north central region and the murray darling basin historically the campaspe region was an irrigation intensive area but a decade long drought the millennium drought reduced water availability such that 90 of irrigators elected to cease irrigation practices in 2010 north central cma 2014 nvirp 2010 approximately 38 of the lower campaspe is under dryland farming ticehurst and curtis 2016 with the north of the catchment focused on cropping activities depicted in fig 1 water resources have been described as historically over allocated for agricultural purposes and the possibility of a drier climate in the future van dijk et al 2013v implies balancing available water resources between competing needs and interests is expected to become increasingly difficult ecological health of the campaspe river system has been in decline over the past decades as water was historically prioritised for agricultural purposes this has had the effect of substantially decreasing local biodiversity mdba 2012 north central cma 2014 communities of the iconic river red gum eucalypts platypus colonies and populations of native fish such as the murray cod and golden perch exist along the lower campaspe system recent water reforms have included provisions for increased environmental flows to support recovery and maintenance of ecosystem health ghd 2015 gm w 2013 hughes et al 2015 water to support environmental flows include 75 g l reallocated from agriculture as well as estimated water savings due to infrastructure improvements conducted through the goulburn murray connections project nvirp 2011 recreational use of the dam is an additional area of concern with viability of recreational activities e g boating and yachting suffering as the water levels at lake eppalock fall there has been public outcry in this regard as evidenced by local media reports abc news 2015 wines 2015 decisions made in managing the lower campaspe river affect river systems downstream the campaspe being a tributary of the murray therefore beneficial ecological outcomes within the campaspe are likely to support ecological recovery elsewhere downstream the cim was designed and developed to inform management and decision making processes within this context through an exploratory process 3 integrated model development to explore possible futures in the campaspe changes to on farm practices and water allocation policies were modelled and the subsequent effects on farmer income streamflow conditions for platypus colonies native fish and river red gums trees and recreational use of the dam were analysed specifically these scenarios represent the conjunctive management of both surface and groundwater pulido velazquez et al 2011 encouragement of further use of groundwater resources in general and further improvements to irrigation water application efficiency ticehurst and curtis 2017 2016 the cim comprises models to represent climate sequences policy rules agricultural activities surface and groundwater hydrology and indicators of ecological and recreational suitability individual model domains deal with their own unique issues and conceptualise the system and their interactions with other models in separate ways this is most obvious in the represented spatial and temporal scales in building the cim compromises were necessary in order to suit the purpose of the modelling and in the face of inter linked requirements and available resources for this reason further detailed framing of each model domain and where relevant model inputs and indicators of interest are described in the sub sections below 3 1 stakeholders and engagement process as noted in the introduction engagement with local stakeholders was particularly important to both the development and validation of the cim relevant stakeholders were identified through sectoral interests and relevance e g farmers will be interested in policies that affect farming as well as a snowball sampling approach where known experts where recruited to suggest other experts of interest relevant to the study stakeholders involved both prior to and during the modelling process included local farmers gm water and representatives from government departments and non profit organisations these represent actors within the system that use the water managers of the water and those with specialised knowledge of the system including farm management and irrigation specialists ecologists geo hydrologists and catchment managers to name a few a stakeholder group of representatives from gm water the local catchment management authority north central cma and a relevant state government department at the time the department of economic development jobs transport and resources attended workshops to identify potential opportunities for conjunctive use in the region farmers were engaged through interviews and surveys prior to model development details of which can be found in ticehurst and curtis 2017 2016 this engagement identified the current and future intention to adopt various management options including the use of groundwater various irrigation practices and the technical feasibility and social acceptability of the range of conjunctive use opportunities identified in previous workshops gm water also provided irrigator data and aided in defining the spatial scope and boundaries of the study with respect to the represented groundwater catchment and management zones the stakeholder group also took part in later workshops and served to provide information and knowledge which corrected earlier assumptions and provided further feasibility assessment of on farm scenarios issues and concerns surrounding ecological aspects were elicited through engagement with ecologists from the australian platypus conservancy and the north central cma further details may be found in iwanaga et al 2018 3 2 technical implementation a requirement of the integrated model development was to be flexible in the face of changing and evolving understanding of the system due to the amount and spread of knowledge being engaged with through the participatory engagement process that was described in the previous section to facilitate this an iterative component based approach was adopted in the development of the cim construction of the cim involved the use of a mix of programming languages including fortran and python and its compiled cousin cython incorporation of pre existing models and the development of a purpose built software framework through which each component model was coupled interfaces commonly referred to as wrappers were developed for the purpose of invoking component model runs and thus provide the necessary linkage between the framework and the component models fig 2 depicts the inter relationship between the component models inter model communication i e data exchange occurs with the framework acting as an intermediary conversion of data such as between types or units of measurement occurs where necessary and is specifically coded while not adhering to all aspects the structure of the interfaces is similar to those specified by the basic modeling interface peckham et al 2013 in that each interface provides a method to invoke a run of the component model for a given time step this design pattern was selected for its flexibility simplicity and ease of implementation component models are run as a serial process with one model run after the other with feedback occurring across daily time steps further details on the choice of modelled spatial and temporal scale is given in later sub sections for each system component currently the model takes approximately 30 min to run for a single scenario on a desktop computer with a core i5 7500 cpu the groundwater model based on modflow nwt is run as an external program and is currently the primary bottleneck limiting further increases to runtime efficiency although modflow itself is written in fortran considered to be a fast language numerical solution of groundwater models is time consuming and the modflow software itself uses several input files which must be written out for each time step and the results read back in overheads due to the constant file operations takes a large proportion of the runtime as much as 43 of the cim runtime can be attributed to the groundwater model modflow s position as an industry standard was the primary reason for its use the exploratory approach conducted for the study involved many runs and so the cim was designed to run multiple scenarios in parallel in order to overcome computational runtime issues model runs are invoked via the command line and is compatible with both linux and windows systems no graphical user interface was developed for the study as use by non technical end users was not planned and is not expected 3 3 climate and scenarios changes in rainfall and temperature influence water availability and their trends can impact the volume of irrigation water necessary to achieve optimum crop growth and yield throughout a growing season the importance of considering climatic influences in managing farm processes is reflected in the survey conducted by ticehurst and curtis 2016 over 80 of respondents ranked change in rainfall patterns and the impact of drought as important or very important comparing long term 100 year average growing season rainfall against more recent trends highlights the impact of the millennium drought 1996 2010 a growing season refers to the time span in which crops are usually sown and harvested defined here as may to february average long term growing season rainfall between 1892 2013 amounted to 420 mm in line with the reported usual growing season rainfall of 400 500 mm ecodev 2015 growing season rainfall from 1982 to 2016 however shows a decrease of 67 mm to 353 mm see fig 3 the trend of decreased rainfall during crop growth may continue with agricultural water management becoming increasingly challenging to investigate the impacts of a changing climate historic and future climate data were sourced from the climate change in australia data service https www climatechangeinaustralia gov au csiro 2017 the provided datasets consist of daily rainfall and evapotranspiration in 5 km grid format for a 30 year period the future climate data provided were developed through a process of scaling historic observations described in mitchell 2003 and thus exhibit similar rainfall trends to historic observations pearson correlations between climate scenarios are depicted in fig 4 with a minimum correlation value of 0 88 and 0 99 for rainfall and evaporation data respectively future climate datasets are based on the historic timeframe from 1981 to 2011 and thus cover the millennium drought period therefore each climate scenario includes a representation of a multi year drought at differing levels of severity for the purpose of calibration and analysis the historic climate dataset was extended to 2016 in order to capture the post drought recovery the set of climate scenarios covers rcp4 5 and 8 5 for 2016 2045 2036 2065 obtained from multiple climate models best case worst case are wettest and driest across models whilst maximum consensus represents conditions somewhat comparable to historic experience to determine the range of conditions that the climate sequences represent the aridity index a i developed by the un environment programme unep was used to compare the climate scenarios the index is calculated as p p e t where p is the annual average rainfall and p e t is the annual average potential evapotranspiration gamo et al 2013 an a i value of 0 2 to 0 5 indicates a semi arid climate condition sahin 2012 and the a i value for the historic climate dataset falls within these bounds with a value of 0 34 as is expected for this semi arid location of the procured climate datasets the driest conditions are represented by the notation worst case rcp45 2016 2045 a i 0 26 the best case rcp45 2016 2045 scenario was most comparable to historic aridity a i 0 34 while best case rcp45 2036 2065 was the least arid a i 0 35 the indicated climate scenarios are taken to represent the extremes of future climate variability i e the most and least arid conditions and one that is most similar to historically observed conditions for this reason modelling with the other climate scenarios were not conducted in depth interpolation between the extremes would likely provide indicative intermediary results these climate scenarios are referred to as wet usual and dry for brevity from here on and were used to drive the cim in order to investigate the impact of such changing climate conditions 3 4 policy model significant reforms to the water policy in the campaspe introduced water trading user carryover specified below and environmental water provisions alston and whittenbury 2011 mckay 2005 wheeler and cheeseman 2013 as part of these reforms the environment is regarded as a water user with water entitlements and yearly water allocations similar to any other entity with a water licence the policy model provides representations of policies that determine water allocation and carryover access and use of water resources are governed by a licencing system in which a licence held by a water user specifies a given volume of water called an entitlement separate licences are issued for surface and groundwater access to the full entitlement is not guaranteed and is subject to water availability an allocation is announced by gm water each irrigation season indicating the percentage of the entitlement an irrigator can use i e 100 allocation is equal to the full entitlement volume carryover here refers to the amount of unused water allocation which licence holders irrigators and the environment are able to add to the following year s allocation current carryover rules indicate that irrigators are able to carry over 95 of unused surface water with 5 deducted to account for evaporation loss dse 2012a 2012b and 25 of unused groundwater goulburn murray water 2015 while irrigators can decide not to carryover dse 2012b it is assumed in the model that carryover always occurs as indicated in fig 2 the policy model dictates availability of water for agricultural and environmental purposes and is itself influenced by climate conditions dam and groundwater levels 3 4 1 surface water policy surface water allocations in the lower campaspe are calculated based on the available volume of water in the dam as well as projected inflows gm water holds rights to 82 of the dam volume as well as 82 of projected inflows and the sum of these is used to calculate the total allocation for the lower campaspe catchment the allocation is announced on 1 july and is re calculated throughout the irrigation season as such a water user s allocation may increase over the course of the growing season if larger than expected rainfall and inflows occur and so the volume of allocations will not decrease retrospectively dam operation requirements as dictated by local policy and legislative rules including environmental watering and minimum flow rules are also factored into the allocation calculations the model represents this process on a two week basis rather than 6 weekly as happens in reality to allow for better interoperation with the farm model a complication in the surface water policy model is the fact that irrigators in the lower campaspe hold additional licences for water from the neighbouring goulburn catchment east of the campaspe rather than model another catchment in its entirety linear relationships at three different levels were developed between the campaspe and goulburn allocations details on this relationship may be found in appendix c these are referred to as high median or low and represent the level of allocation volume available from the goulburn catchment for a modelled future scenario the separate allocation scenarios allow the model to account for conditions which influence availability of water from the goulburn including variability between the two catchments these different conditions may be due to climate variability water demand and policies that affect goulburn allocations which in turn may affect the indicators of interest for the lower campaspe associated costs were assumed to be identical to that of gm water water entitlements for individual farm zones detailed in section 3 5 below are shown in table 1 and were calculated by proportionally distributing the entitlement based on the water system area under which the given zone falls under 3 4 2 groundwater policy groundwater allocations are restricted by policy rules surrounding what are referred to as trigger levels these indicate the groundwater level at which allocations are reduced to a specified percentage or at its lowest level no allocation at all groundwater use is progressively restricted in this manner as the water table decreases in order to prevent salinity intrusion allocations are determined based on the recorded groundwater level at two reference bores with the ids 62589 in the south and 79324 in the north goulburn murray water 2015 and are detailed in table 2 under current modelled allocation in the current policy context surface and groundwater are managed separately however stakeholders have explicitly suggested a move towards a conjunctive management approach a possible change in the policy space includes the relaxation of trigger levels during dry periods thereby enabling irrigators to use more groundwater followed by compensatory actions to increase recharge during wet periods hypothetical trigger rules for conjunctive use were developed for the model these rules define two sets of trigger levels referred to as the drought and non drought rulesets and management is switched between these depending on the surface water allocation drought trigger rules come into effect after consecutive years of surface water allocations below 60 or 80 depending on scenario this may be after 1 or 3 years after which irrigators are able to use their full groundwater entitlement for all but the lowest trigger level these are detailed in table 2 and referred to collectively as the proposed trigger rules farmers surveyed in the area have indicated that such increased use of groundwater is technically feasible most irrigators are reliant on surface water resources with 91 of those surveyed holding surface water licences compared to 22 who additionally hold groundwater licences ticehurst and curtis 2017 groundwater use historically has reached a maximum of 60 of allocated volumes although this has increased to 80 in recent times 2016 water usage as reported in ticehurst and curtis 2017 recalling that 25 of unused water can be carried over the current view is that irrigators are reserving water for drier times accepting a trade off between enhanced yields in wet years in return for water security in dry conditions hence the farming community could be described as managing water resources in a conjunctive manner albeit informally the cim includes a scaling factor 60 100 to adjust the amount of allocated groundwater considered for use by the farm model to reflect this informal management approach note that setting the scaling factor to 100 only makes all groundwater available it does not enforce its use limiting allocation to 60 then reflects a return to historic behaviour in which farmers intentionally reserve water to enhance future water security water usage and its impact is indicated with percentage increase or decrease in water use both ground and surface water compared to the baseline scenario and the long term decline or improvement as the case may be in terms of depth to groundwater across the farm zones in addition two quantities of interest relate to groundwater average groundwater allocation gw allocation index and the relative depth to groundwater head normalised by the lowest trigger level at each reference bore and averaged over the time series gw level change average allocations indicate reductions in access to groundwater whereas the change in relative depth provides an indication of how sustainable groundwater use is under the given condition negative changes to the gw level change imply increased reliance on groundwater and or reduced groundwater recharge notable model inputs are given in table 3 3 5 farm model the farm model represents the agricultural system by dividing the catchment into 12 zones based on their water entitlements policy rules governing water allocations and land use depicted in fig 6 corresponding to the management zones in use by gm water see goulburn murray water 2015 key attributes of a modelled farm include the costs and capital returns of crop sown nature and cost of irrigation and pumping systems and the soil water holding properties of the soils found within the zone the model focusses on cropping enterprises water use for dairying is not considered here cropping is modelled as a three year rotation of wheat barley and canola further details on the model formulation are provided in appendix b irrigation systems considered in the model include gravity pipe and riser and spray these represent the cheapest and least water efficient to the most expensive and efficient option available to farmers gravity is regarded as the dominant form of irrigation in the lower campaspe although it is known through stakeholder feedback that there is increasing adoption of spray irrigation in the area parameters representing soil water capacity were raised by stakeholders as particularly important as they determine what irrigation system is suitable and influence frequency of irrigation events farms with sandier soils see a greater benefit from a switch to more efficient irrigation systems as such soils have a lower water retention capacity while farmers cannot change the soil type it is possible to improve soil health such that water retention is enhanced through best management practices bruyn 2019 table 4 lists the considered irrigation options for each farm zone based on the weighted zonal average soil water capacity for the presented study only zones 4 and 9 were modelled as being suitable for spray irrigation farmer decisions are modelled through linear programming at the start of and during a growing season the available area is allocated to dryland cropping and irrigation with surface and groundwater by optimising profit calculated with assumed per hectare revenues and costs constrained by water availability the model then optimises for profitable water usage for each subsequent two week time step for each farm zone until the pre determined harvest date again further details of the model formulation are given in appendix b the assumption of this approach is that a series of short term decisions that are financially sound will result in a profitable outcome the two week time step was also necessary to facilitate representation of cross domain interactions as agricultural irrigation pumping activities influence stream and groundwater systems all events irrigation planting sowing harvest are assumed to take place within two week periods in terms of interactions with other component models the farm model is influenced by the water allocation determined by the policy model and subsequently influences the surface and groundwater models through irrigation water extraction pumping and irrigation activities further interaction with the policy model is included due to local policies allowing carryover in which a portion of unused water is made available to irrigators in the following year from the perspective of the farm model three categories of factors can be identified uncontrollable limited control and direct control uncontrollable factors are those that cannot be influenced in any direct manner such as climate condition water allocations or crop water requirements limited control factors are those which a farmer may influence to some degree such as how much water a soil type can hold by applying soil management practices direct control factors are those that a farmer can influence directly such as the irrigation system in use their efficiencies through irrigation design and monitoring and so on groundwater cap gw cap is a model input of note and acts to force the model to limit available water for consideration by the farm model as noted above in the groundwater policy section section 3 4 2 only 60 of allocated groundwater has been used by irrigators in the past the considered parameter range was 60 100 where 60 represents past behaviour and 100 reflects consideration of all available groundwater for use without regard to future water security the cap can be applied in combination with the conjunctive management scenario detailed in section 3 4 above three key indicators were used to represent farm performance 1 the average seasonal farm profit for the scenario 2 the average seasonal water use in ml and 3 the coefficient of variation σ μ for farm income taken as a measure of fluctuations in yearly income i e a volatility index larger values for the volatility index indicate scenarios in which farm income undergoes large variations from year to year irrigation area relative to catchment area and water use are also included 3 6 surface water model the surface water system is represented by a purpose built variant of the ihacres rainfall runoff model croke and jakeman 2004 written in fortran and interfaced with a python wrapper the component model comprises a rainfall streamflow model a routing module and a rating curve module the component is driven by rainfall and potential evapotranspiration climate data estimated groundwater and surface water interactions from the groundwater component dam releases as given by the policy and farm components and water extractions from the stream farm component as water orders are lumped due to the farm model operating on a two week time step the volume extracted is disaggregated uniformly across the 14 days as a daily average effective rainfall i e rainfall that contributes to streamflow is calculated from rainfall via a non linear loss module from croke and jakeman 2004 modified to partition effective rainfall between quick and slow flows based on modelled catchment moisture status croke et al 2015 movement of water through the river network is represented by two parallel exponentially decaying stores representing quick and slow flow contributions a further exponentially decaying store is used to route the flows between nodes croke et al 2006 modelled flows are converted to stage heights by the rating curve module using data available at most gauge sites the single exception is gauge 406218 where available data were limited to water level losses from the river network to groundwater are considered via interactions with the groundwater component similar to the approach in ivkovic et al 2014 dam level streamflow and level were important quantities to represent as these influence water allocations ecological health and recreational use of the dam described in later sections stream flow and level are estimated at specific nodes show in fig 7 which were selected based on the location of gauges with suitable data taking into consideration the needs of the integrated model see fig 2 these values are passed to the groundwater model in order to estimate infiltration loss and baseflow contribution to surface flow calibrating the model against historic observations proved difficult due to variation of parameter values estimated depending on climate sequence and so a decision was made to divide the climate sequence into six time periods and calibrate parameter values for each separately using the differential evolution algorithm storn and price 1997 a good fit with historic dam levels was achieved with this approach with a nse value of 0 96 depicted in fig 8 calibrated values were then used for the corresponding time periods for all climate scenarios each set of parameters have a limited scope of applicability but their use for the segmented time periods is arguably justified for the modelling purpose as similar patterns can be associated with the provided climate scenarios as previously described in section 3 3 time periods defined for calibration purposes are detailed in appendix d 3 7 groundwater model the groundwater component serves two roles in the cim the first is to provide estimations of the exchanges between surface water and groundwater along the lower campaspe river at specific gauge locations the second is to provide estimations of the groundwater levels for each farm zone and at specific bore locations which influence allocations of groundwater and pumping costs and is a factor in the ecological indicator metric see section 3 8 interactions at a daily time step with the surface water farm ecology and policy components are included in this manner and are forced by rainfall irrigation pumping and river stages depicted in fig 9 stakeholders provided knowledge and data with respect to pumping observational groundwater head and chemistry which informed the groundwater model boundaries ensuring that the necessary spatial area is captured in the model the groundwater model represents the lower campaspe at a 5 km grid resolution with 7 layers comprising 1386 active cells spacing of which was informed by hydrogeologic unit rasters from the victorian aquifer framework dse 2012c the relatively large grid resolution was selected as 1 it aligns with the provided climate data and 2 for computational reasons as higher resolutions required prohibitively longer run times modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 was used to construct the groundwater component and is interfaced with via the flopy package bakker et al 2016 modflow was selected due to its open source and well documented nature which complements our iterative development and because the modelling platform is regarded as an industry standard modelled groundwater extraction is distributed across known wells within each farm zone response to input from the streamflow lags the surface water model as component models are run sequentially it is assumed that the daily lag will not have a significant impact on model behaviour recharge is derived by multiplying the sum of rainfall and irrigation by a rainfall reduction parameter between 0 no recharge and 1 no diversion with values being in the range of 0 001 0 43 these rainfall reduction values were derived from a map of recharge ranges for recharge zones defined by rainfall land use and soil type detailed in xie et al 2019 outputs from the groundwater model while not precise at the scale of local wells due to model resolution were fit for purpose for indicative average groundwater levels in areas of interest in the case of the ecology model the requisite groundwater heads obtained from the groundwater model would be subject to the largest variance due to the proximity to the campaspe river and variability of heads within a groundwater model cell for the policy model the trigger bores are chosen to be indicative of larger scale behaviour and hence the use of the average head in cells that correspond with the trigger bores is deemed appropriate effectiveness of policies in maintaining groundwater levels above the lowest trigger level is indicated by two metrics the first indicator is a weighted score based on the percent irrigation season allocation across the scenario period gw allocation index where a score of 1 0 indicates that water users were given 100 of their entitlements every year and values close to zero indicate consistently low water table such that pumping is disallowed the second indicator gw level change is the averaged normalised change in groundwater level between the start and the end of the model period relative to the lowest trigger level negative values then indicate that the lowest trigger level was breached these two indicators are referred to in the results as the gw allocation index and gw level change see section 4 for further detail poor performance of the groundwater model in the integrated context compared to historic observations can be expected due to the integrated model structure and design for one both the policy and farm models were developed to represent a more recent socio hydrological context i e post 2010 as required by the purpose of the modelling this temporal mismatch has the effect of reducing the overall volume of groundwater extraction and recharge compared to historic occurrences as noted in section 2 90 of the irrigators had stopped irrigation practices leading to the closure of the campaspe irrigation district and so the farm model represents this current level of irrigation activity the policy model includes reforms introduced to allow carryover of unused water to the next irrigation season as well as environmental water provisions which has an influence on the level of groundwater extractions contemporary accounts estimate 35 000 ml of water was used for irrigation within the campaspe irrigation district including approximately 3000 ml extracted from the aquifers chiew et al 1992 we also note reported difficulties in representing the groundwater system of the campaspe region in earlier studies it has been previously noted that the campaspe region is a difficult region to model beverly and hocking 2014 goode and barnett 2008 one confounding factor is the long history of system regulation and incomplete data with respect to groundwater extraction and usage at a fine r scale another reason is the local topography and landscape towards the south large elevation changes can be seen which are not captured by the 5 km grid resolution due to the coarse resolution in use for the purpose of the model there are significant differences in elevation between model cells 20 m these model conditions preclude the use of the groundwater model for accurate forecasting the purpose here however is in representing futures expanded on further in section 4 thus the focus in model development was on representing hypothetical groundwater level response to farmer behaviour and the water policies in place these are discussed in sections 4 and 5 3 8 ecology and recreation indicator models the models developed to represent ecological and recreational aspects of the lower campaspe system produce indicator values reflecting the suitability of stream and groundwater flow for key ecological purposes and dam water levels for recreational purposes ecological indicators represent the suitability of flow conditions for breeding feeding nesting and dispersal of platypus 4 indices and native fish 2 indices as well as maintenance and regeneration of the iconic river red gum trees 2 indices suitability thresholds were based on the north central cma environmental water management plan north central cma 2014 in conjunction with feedback from ecologists from the australian platypus conservancy and the north central cma as detailed in iwanaga et al 2018 it was suggested by stakeholders local representatives from the government department ecodev to lump ecological indicators into a single metric to ease interpretability of results the recreation indicator is based on a linear relationship between dam water level and perceived recreational suitability elicited through interviews with stakeholders from gm water caravan park managers and other recreational users all indicator models produce index values which range between 0 being unsuitable and 1 most preferable although ecology and recreation are separate and distinct systems they are lumped together here as the recreation index model constitutes a small aspect of the modelling presented here details specific to each ecological and recreational component are provided in appendix e with further detail available in fu 2017 3 9 conceptual integrated testing an issue in the development of cim was the lack of data to validate coupled model behaviour known as integration testing in software engineering parlance one example is the lack of farm level crop yield data partly due to privacy concerns data that were available describe average yield from both irrigated and dryland cropping on a per farm average basis for the entire north central region of the state of victoria an area of approximately 47 000 km2 compared to 2600 km2 for the lower campaspe additionally the temporal scale of available data is relatively short with records starting from 1990 to the early 2000s under such circumstances model testing and validation chiefly involved high level conceptual checks selected to indicate unacceptable model behaviour data to develop a strict quantitative metric was not generally available across the range of component model contexts and so the adopted approach was to contextualise performance against relevant criteria to provide an indication of model acceptability for example while financial data at the individual farm level were not available regional economic production data are available for the campaspe via australian department of agriculture 2019 performance of the farm modelling was considered unacceptable if calculated crop profits exceed or comprised an unjustifiably high proportion of the agricultural output of the campaspe catchment modelled crop profits under historic climate conditions amounted to 20 54 of the campaspe agricultural activity 13 81 m of 67 26 m which stands to reason given that the campaspe region is principally a dairy farming community long term average values were also used as a qualitative measure of acceptability wherein long term behaviour of the model was in line with historic observations example given in fig 10 it must be noted here that such an approach is subject to available expert knowledge tests at this conceptual level may be the only kind of integration tests applicable given the available resources data and domain knowledge and the purpose of the model for this reason the scope of testing must be carefully targeted and in line with available resources 4 methods for the scenario modelling exploratory scenario modelling was used to identify conditions which led to beneficial outcomes the term scenario here refers to the specific set of model inputs used for a model run which in turn leads to a specific spatial and temporal evolution of system variables and final outcomes from the perspective of farmers and policy managers these scenarios represent a possible farm and policy context the scenarios are run through the model and those with beneficial outcomes are subsequently identified thus the model is used in an exploratory manner rather than to obtain precise prediction of events only factors pertaining to the farm and policy models are considered in the scenario modelling calibration was not conducted for the integrated model in its entirety instead component models were calibrated individually against relevant historic observations of crop yields dam level and observed groundwater head and feedback obtained from stakeholders in cases where quantitative data were not available e g for the recreational indicator the approach is justified as the data used for calibration encompass a wide range of conditions and the trends rather than absolute values of the climate scenarios are similar to observed historical data as explained earlier in section 3 3 the ecology model takes no inputs other than the modelled streamflow and groundwater level the total number of model inputs that are directly considered in the cim comes to 266 of which 212 factors are regarded as constants this still leaves 54 parameters that can vary between scenarios and are largely inputs for the farm models for the different zones covariance analysis was carried out to determine the number of scenarios to run it is desirable for the input values not to be correlated across the sampled scenarios as this could induce artificial correlation within the results for those scenarios i e the covariance value should be as close to zero as possible a threshold of 0 02 for off diagonal values was selected as a compromise between parameter independence and model evaluation time see appendix f latin hypercube sampling a stratified monte carlo sampling approach was used to generate each scenario in total 5625 model evaluations were performed consisting of 1875 scenario samples for each selected climate scenario apart from the 5625 scenarios above the model was initially run using best guess default values for each model parameter for all climate scenarios these are referred to as the baseline results indicator scores from these then establish a baseline against which further comparisons can be made and represent the business as usual case in which the status quo is maintained in terms of farm management and policy under changing climate conditions further scenarios are then run allowing parameter values to vary to explore the possible outcomes under a range of conditions baseline results are compared against modelled historic outcomes while results from exploratory modelling are presented as comparisons to their respective baseline scenario comparing results to a baseline allows like for like comparisons it is assumed that change in a beneficial direction see table 6 is always desired and a scenario which exhibits improvements to system state relative to the baseline scenario is considered a desirable outcome for the purpose of this analysis a desirable outcome is one in which all indicators perform comparatively better when compared against their respective baselines to be explicit avg annual profit ecology index and recreation index were all required to have scores above 1 whilst income volatility should be below 1 choice of farm and policy inputs that lead to these desirable outcomes of improved farm water and environmental conditions across the possible climate futures and policy conditions are then regarded as robust a system state in which desirable outcomes are achieved under a range of plausible conditions mcphail et al 2018 the indicators of interest are described under relevant subsections in section 3 above and are summarised in table 6 with their beneficial direction indicated once desirable scenarios are identified the contributing model inputs were ranked using a random forest feature scoring approach feature scoring identifies factors of relative import towards a given result dimensional stacking suzuki et al 2015 is then used to identify the inputs that led to the outcome of interest appendix a gives a description of terms used in referring to outcomes the above approach allows communication of the model inputs that lead to the outcomes under different scenario conditions the range of results then represent the uncertainty in achieving desirable outcomes and increases confidence that a given condition leads to a desirable change at least under the model assumptions reichert and borsuk 2005 the adopted method also avoids prescribing specific conditions to be undertaken and instead considers a range of alternate decisions that fulfil stakeholder requirements herman et al 2015 5 results and discussion overall the results indicate that further pressures will be placed on farmers and the environment without changes to adapt to uncertain climate conditions as have previous studies and reports in the murray darling basin austin et al 2018 mdba 2019 steffen et al 2018 comparisons of results against the modelled historic climate scenario are depicted in fig 11 surface water allocations are lower in the majority of scenarios which is expected here as they are typically more arid compared to the historic condition as shown in fig 5 in order to cope with this situation the area under irrigation is reduced so as to maintain the necessary ml ha volume to attain crop growth and maximum yields doing so however comes with a commensurate reduction to average annual income along with larger fluctuations from year to year depicted by the income volatility indicator in fig 11 a reduction in groundwater use can also be seen compared to the modelled historic scenario attributable to the reduction in irrigated area groundwater use under drier conditions is higher than their wetter counterparts but does not offset the lack of available surface water as would be expected ecological and recreational indicators diverge from the historic baseline results based on the climatic condition it should be noted that any decrease to the ecological indicator is undesirable given that riverine health is already considered to be highly stressed comparisons of the 5625 scenario results against the historic baseline revealed 796 with desirable outcomes however none of these were robust i e beneficial under all climate conditions with no desirable outcomes identified under dry climate conditions the lack of desirable outcomes for the dry climate scenario suggests that improved outcomes compared to historic conditions become increasingly improbable as the climate becomes drier regardless of what changes are made fig 12 one suggested scenario was the adoption of irrigation systems with higher water application efficiencies to increase water savings across the catchment although soil factors may make such a scenario unlikely see section 3 5 no beneficial outcomes were identified in such cases even in the case where all non dryland zones i e all zones except for 1 3 5 and 12 adopted improved irrigations given no robust scenarios were identified against historic results we then conduct comparisons against baseline results for specific climate conditions in other words scenarios under dry climate conditions were compared against the dry climate baseline in order to identify conditions that led to relative improvements a small number of scenarios were identified as being robust under all climate conditions 93 scenarios input parameters of most import leading to these are related to crop field and irrigation factors followed by policy factors and the maximum amount of groundwater considered these farm level factors are listed in table 5 under section 3 5 the high feature score attributed to crop field and irrigation factors is perhaps unsurprising but it does highlight the importance of a well informed farming community over estimating crop water requirements and costs reduces the irrigation area considered and poorly set up or poorly maintained irrigation infrastructure including pumps and soil health increases costs and water usage thereby impacting farm profitability fig 13 at the field level improving the availability of accurate information on soil water holding capacity has the greatest contribution to farm profitability specifically soil water retention within zones 5 10 and 9 are indicated to influence outcomes more than at other locations in the lower campaspe fig 14 at the same time targeted adoption of spray irrigation within zones 4 and 9 the zones indicated to be most amenable to spray irrigation systems in our analysis did not necessarily lead to robust outcomes further highlighting the point that simply improving irrigation systems across the catchment is not a viable adaptation strategy possible reasons for this include operational costs incurred with spray irrigation and the lower water efficiency of pipe and riser systems contributing to increased recharge or streamflow under certain conditions having the effect of improving ecological outcomes i e due to higher return flows one particular aspect of interest was the percentage of groundwater allocation which irrigators consider for use gw cap previously explained in section 3 4 2 while irrigators have historically used 60 of groundwater allocations in a bid to enhance future water security increased consideration of groundwater use improves the likelihood of desirable outcomes to be experienced under all climate conditions fig 15 increasing the volume of groundwater to be considered for use compensates for the decreased surface water availability under more arid conditions consideration of all available groundwater resources 100 may be necessary under proposed conjunctive use rulesets likely due to the reduction in accessible groundwater in wet periods enforced by the proposed rules this suggests that while the informal and disparate approach to conjunctive use may be adequate farmers who are overly cautious and restrict groundwater use may not experience the maximum possible yields and capital returns in the long term the results shown in fig 13 emphasize the importance of farm level factors towards achieving robust outcomes stakeholders have specified various programmes designed to engage with and promote farm management best practices e g dedjtr 2015a department of economic development 2017 assuming then that farms have little room for further improvement in terms of soil water holding capacity knowledge and consideration of crop properties and on farm infrastructure such as irrigation and pumping systems we can then identify which factors contribute towards robust outcomes focusing the analysis on factors external to the farming system itself the amount of allocations from the goulburn system is identified as playing a large role perhaps unsurprising given the volume of entitlements which campaspe irrigators rely on particularly in zones 8 and 10 see table 1 aside from the goulburn catchment allocations the conjunctive use policy rules in place for a given scenario gw restriction have a notable effect fig 16 in scenarios where goulburn allocations have lowered we see a concentration of robust scenarios wherein conjunctive use of water is allowed under median allocation situations conjunctive use allows robust outcomes to be achieved while maintaining groundwater use in line with historic behaviour without conjunctive use enabled however considered use of groundwater has to increase to 90 100 in order for the changes to be robust fig 17 as goulburn water availability further decreases groundwater use becomes especially important towards achieving robust outcomes robust outcomes are more likely if conjunctive use is enabled along with high levels of groundwater use fig 18 the modelling suggests that groundwater levels can be maintained above the lowest trigger level however careful consideration is required especially with regard to the effect on salinity and water quality issues aspects which the modelling presented here did not cover the results suggest that improvements to farm soils and infrastructure will be beneficial within the campaspe and additional communication training and financial incentive programmes beyond what has already been occurring may increase benefits any such programme should consider possible issues surrounding social acceptability and be cognisant of issues with previous approaches to appraising the cost benefits grafton and wheeler 2018 while increasing groundwater use is generally beneficial possible issues surrounding social acceptability of increased use and water quality particularly salinity should be fully considered the results raise the possibility of increasing groundwater allocations in the lower campaspe especially if managed aquifer recharge is adopted in the region chiew et al 1995 ticehurst and curtis 2017 5 1 model and scenario uncertainty integrated models are constructed through the interfacing of models that collectively cross disciplinary lines and their respective system boundaries intuitively uncertainty will not decrease if more models are added simply due to compound uncertainty this is the uncertainty that arises as outputs from one model are used as inputs to another with each interaction propagating some amount of error dunford et al 2015 refsgaard et al 2007 in the context of the cim the sources of uncertainty and their contributions to total model uncertainty are too great to list out individually within the confines of this paper formal analyses of individual model components and total model uncertainty including structural uncertainty with regards to model selection is the subject of another paper qualitatively however the farm model represents the largest source of compound uncertainty as all components except for climate are influenced by mechanisms internal to the farm model in other words the farm model behaves as a nexus point between models and thus the errors in the interoperated data may be cancelled out or compounded and subsequently propagated through an over estimation of streamflow may be corrected in a sense by over estimation of required crop water and under estimation of irrigation efficiency similarly the opposite may also be true such influence may occur directly e g streamflow reduced due to farm water extraction or indirectly e g ecological suitability influenced by streamflow the reader is once again referred to fig 2 which indicates the component interactions uncertainty within the models was addressed through participatory engagement processes section 3 1 and the conceptual testing process section 3 9 both of which ensured model behaviour is qualitatively plausible as judged by stakeholders and which involved changes in response to their feedback on top of this exploratory modelling was applied to hypothetical policy contexts identified by stakeholders and the range of on farm activities considered using results from the farmer survey ticehurst and curtis 2017 2016 each scenario explored was tied to three specific climate datasets which represent hypothetical shifts in aridity i e dry usual and wet conditions limiting the climate scenarios to these three was done to keep the total number of possible scenario combinations to a manageable level as model runtime was a concern an alternate approach is the use of multiple projections for each aridity scenario this would more comprehensively address scenario uncertainty with respect to climate inputs as it would allow the influence of differing degrees of dryness to wetness to be explored another source of uncertainty rarely discussed is computational infrastructure uncertainty here we define computational infrastructure uncertainty as the uncertainty that arises in model interoperation and integration and application across various computational contexts model technical uncertainty as defined in refsgaard et al 2007 is a related issue which we regard as being specific to the uncertainties that may arise from a model s implementation computational infrastructure uncertainty is distinguishable from model technical uncertainty in that models that have identical implementations may yet exhibit different behaviour when applied on different infrastructure such as operating systems see for example bhandari neupane et al 2019 platforms e g desktop vs supercomputer interoperation of data via various means e g local storages vs over a network and formats and different programming languages or due to the use of different compilers or different versions of the same compiler computational infrastructure uncertainty was addressed by applying the model across various computational infrastructure including but not limited to both windows and linux operating systems different fortran and c compilers and ensuring identical baseline results a major error was discovered through this process due to the declaration of an uninitialized variable in the fortran code which was subsequently used in a later calculation depending on the compiler the default behaviour may be to initialize the undefined variable to 0 0 and thereby will have no effect on the result or may hold junk values from its location in memory space which subsequently propagate throughout the integrated model 6 limitations and future work a difficult aspect to manage in the study was the determination of model scope the collaborative modelling undertaken encompasses several disciplinary domains from economics and finance bio physical and social aspects and computational considerations limiting the scope to a manageable size often boiled down to making pragmatic compromises here we detail some known limitations and avenues for future work climate data used in the modelling display little changes in evapotranspiration from scenario to scenario evapotranspiration is used as a reference value that informs crop water use in the model and ultimately the frequency of irrigation throughout the growing season crop loss due to extreme heat pests or other influences are also not considered changing weather events due to a changing climate will also require the growing season to be shifted earlier or later prokopy et al 2015 wang et al 2019 or timed to take advantage of forecasted rainfall however these planting harvest dates were constants in the modelling an avenue for further enhancement can be expanding the agricultural activities represented in the model dairying is a primary industry in the study area but is not explicitly represented in the model cropping was determined to be the common agricultural activity regardless of farm enterprise and so the decision was made to focus efforts towards representing farm behaviour in that context while irrigation with groundwater was found to be an important aspect towards yielding robust outcomes the model did not incorporate water quality aspects and so further in depth investigation particularly on salinity issues are required cropping enterprise profitability may reflect dairying financial performance and so beneficial model outcomes are used in the study to indicate beneficial outcomes for the catchment generally as noted by stakeholders the relationship between the enterprises is expected to be particularly poor in dry conditions as dairy farmers have the option of acquiring feedstock externally irrigators may also trade water an activity not represented in the model to cover shortfalls in water availability averaging farm water orders across a 14 day time step means that the cim does not represent high volume water orders that are released within a shorter time span consequently the implications of high volume water orders on ecological flow suitability indicator may not be adequately captured on this note the policy model currently includes environmental considerations based on legislated flow requirements but is not reactive to modelled streamflow level or groundwater head and effects on ecological indicators future work could then consider possible adaptive management processes in which water allocations and or their releases are adjusted to meet environmental considerations whilst uncertainty in the modelling is taken into account largely through the use of climate scenarios and sampling of parameter space future work is envisaged to identify the most important sources of uncertainty in the modelling in this endeavour one way forward is to use a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative approach e g refsgaard et al 2007 especially involving stakeholders and experts in helping to rank the criticality of the different sources as to their influence on model outcomes before embarking on a quantitative set of exercises nevertheless we believe the work to this point is a valuable starting point for raising awareness and discussion amongst stakeholders as to opportunities for managing water more beneficially in the catchment one important social aspect not represented in the presented study is the cultural importance of the local flora and fauna and issues of cultural flows the release of water to fulfil activities or conditions of cultural and social importance moggridge et al 2019 indeed it has been increasingly acknowledged that water entitlements for cultural flows are not yet made a consistent part of australian water management legislation policies or guidelines despite being identified as a national priority area jackson et al 2012 williams et al 2019 this limitation will be addressed in planned future work currently under discussion 7 conclusions on sustainable water management opportunities this paper presents a component based integrated environmental model developed to explore sustainable water management options within the lower campaspe sub catchment of the murray darling basin stakeholder participation was critical to the model capabilities as local stakeholders provided knowledge feedback and data to assist in conceptualising the system the participatory and model based collaborative approach yields results that reveal opportunities to consider for achieving improved socio environmental outcomes and water security relative to the modelled historic baseline improvements at the farm level were found to be a prospective contribution towards this goal as were farm water management and changes to governing policy rules specifically conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources and increased use of the latter was found to improve outcomes adoption of the most efficient irrigation systems considered spray and pipe and riser did not necessarily lead to desirable outcomes across all climate conditions it then follows that simply improving irrigation water efficiency is not a sufficient course of action

gives the dollar profit income π for the farm zone in this manner the farm costs expected yields and profit and estimated crop water requirements play a role in scheduling irrigation events the estimated total profit is necessarily an approximation profit after harvest is calculated directly from crop yield as detailed below irrigation scheduling farmers will irrigate ideally when crops require additional water determining when these irrigations occur is referred to as irrigation scheduling in this model it is assumed that farmers are monitoring soil moisture levels and have access to weather data specifically pan evapotranspiration e t 0 soil water deficit s w d is a cumulative indicator of how dry soils can become before additional water is required to be applied to avoid crop losses soil water deficit worsens by subtracting crop evapotranspiration e t c which is calculated by applying a scaling crop coefficient k c i e e t c e t 0 k c with each crop type having a corresponding k c value once s w d reaches a refill point commonly referred to as the net irrigation depth n i d an irrigation event is scheduled and s w d reduced by the effective water applied this approach is commonly applied on farm and examples can be found in publications from state governments see for example hughes 1999 qassim and ashcroft 2002 the n i d value itself is calculated by multiplying the effective root zone at a point in time d r z t with the possible readily available water r a w for the given soil type the effective root zone is the depth at which the crop gets much of its water via its roots and is dependent on soil type and crop properties baker and ahern 1989 here d r z is assumed to be 55 of root depth for the given crop type as in qassim and ashcroft 2002 where relevant information regarding root depths throughout the season and crop growth stages could not be obtained and as such acts as a constant if sufficient data were available the alternative approach would be to calculate it as 2 d r z t r d t e r d t where r d t is the root depth for the stage of growth at time t and e r d t the effective root depth coefficient for the crop type maihol et al in itier et al 1996 nominal values for these parameters were obtained from fao guidelines allen et al 1998 the net irrigation depth can then be calculated as 3 n i d t d r z t r a w r a w t a w p here t a w corresponds to the total amount of water a soil can hold and p represents the crop soil water depletion fraction as in qassim and ashcroft 2002 the values used for t a w is discussed in the next section on soils the soil water deficit at a point in time can be calculated as 4 s w d t min s w d t 1 e t c t e t i w t 0 where e t t 1 n p t i f m o n t h i s j u n e t o a u g u s t t 1 n

the irrigation water applied at the time step no water may be applied in the time step in which case this coefficient will be 0 e t c t is the sum of crop evapotranspiration e t c that occurred within the time step it should be noted here that the intention of this particular model is not to have an accurate representation of effective rainfall or water recharge drainage processes the model is as mentioned above based on the published advice for irrigators in victoria and so represents the assumed behaviour of the irrigation process irrigation occurs to refill s w d once it reaches or goes beyond n i d and these are both represented as negative values or else 0 the base volume of irrigation water i w b to be applied is taken to be equal to s w d t when it reaches this refill point this

depicted in fig 19 is repeated until the crop is harvested at the end of the growing season estimated costs for each irrigation system were corroborated by a senior irrigation specialist with ecodev maskey 2016 the simplest irrigation system is gravity which relies on as the name suggests gravity to flood an area with water pipe and riser systems are similar in that it also floods a field but instead uses a pressurized pipe system to transport water increasing costs spray is the most efficient but is also the most expensive to install and operate due to the fuel costs necessary to generate the pressure needed to move and apply water the upper limit for all irrigation systems was set to 90 which is possible for all systems depending on soil type system set up and configuration and additional work conducted to make the field more amenable for the chosen irrigation type finger and morris 2005 for example the field could be laser graded to ensure a more consistent application of gravity fed irrigation water indeed 77 of those survey respondents reported having undertaken additional improvements to gravity irrigation such as laser grading and tail water reuse from excess water reaching the bottom of the field gravity irrigation was then modelled as being 50 and 90 efficient based on this information with the base efficiency set at 50 representing the usual case table 7 soils an early iteration of the model used the dominant soil type found in the lower campaspe area sandy loam see fig 21 as a representative surrogate stakeholders indicated that this approach may not adequately represent the importance of soil type and health in agricultural enterprises due to the diversity found at the smaller zonal scales stakeholders further indicated that farmers with lighter soils on their lands may find spray irrigation more attractive as light soils are not capable of holding as much water as heavy soils the t a w value is comparatively less influencing irrigation scheduling equally true is that farmers with heavier soils may not see a benefit from a move to spray to reflect this only farm zones that were identified as having light soils were modelled to have the option of changing irrigation systems to spray irrigation to better represent the conditions which impact irrigation scheduling and choice of irrigation system it is then necessary to represent the range of soil textures within the model farm zones to achieve this published t a w value ranges for various soil types allen et al 1998 qassim and ashcroft 2002 were used in conjunction with a soil map of the campaspe catchment to create weighted zonal values see fig 20 these values were based on the proportional area of soil types found within a zone a weighted average median value was used as the nominal best guess value with the weighted minimum and maximum values indicating the possible value bounds the soil map was kindly provided by ecodev a victorian state government department pumping pumping water for irrigation typically represents the largest operational costs for a farm depi 2014a seasonal pumping costs were considered as this may vary depending on climate conditions and allocated water availability this cost can itself vary depending on the type of pump and its configuration extracting groundwater decreases the groundwater level thereby increasing pumping costs due to the greater distance and pressure required pumping systems were simplified into two categories indicating whether they are for shallow or deep bore pumping the former represents pumping from an irrigation channel or shallow aquifer with the latter used to represent groundwater pumping at a depth of 20 m or more stakeholders indicated that a mix of diesel and electric pumps are used in the study area 60 and 40 respectively electric pumping costs can range from 16 5c to 32 8c per kilowatt kw while electricity plans with a flat rate of 27c kw can also be arranged bob knowles 8 jan 2018 pers comm diesel fuel was assumed to have a cost of 1 20 per litre with a fuel volume per kw of 0 25 robinson 2002 resolving to 30c kw a weighted average of these values was used to represent the mixed 60 40 use of both diesel and electric pumps 28 5c kw the kw cost of pumping is likely to change over time but was modelled as a constant under the assumption that the cost of upgrading infrastructure is cost prohibitive within the modelled time frame installation of bores to access groundwater incur significant capital costs ranging from 18 000 to 70 000 for a shallow bore and 90 000 to 320 000 for deep bores robinson 2002 it is assumed here that such infrastructure is already in place and so no initial capital costs are considered the average annual maintenance costs are included in the modelling however and are taken to be 5 of capital costs every 5 years and 20 every 15 years minor and major maintenance respectively nominal values for these shallow and deep bore capital costs were 18 000 and 235 000 taken from robinson 2002 the number and location of groundwater bores for each farm zone are indicated in fig 22 pumping costs throughout the irrigation season is then calculated as 7 c p m l c f u e l c k w h m l read as the cost per pumped ml being equal to the cost of fuel per litre by the cost per kilowatt kw hour multiplied by the hours necessary to pump a megaliter of water the total pumping cost can then be determined simply as 8 c p u m p i w c p m l in the presented modelling c k w is calculated in advance 28 5c kw as detailed earlier however it can be calculated directly if needed and the necessary information on the pumping system is available the calculation takes the form of 9 p u m p f u e l p k w f where f 0 25 p k w h f c 102 e p d the volume of diesel fuel p u m p f u e l is based on the required energy p k w and number of litres required to produce 1 kw f 0 25 as given in robinson 2002 the amount of kilowatt energy required is dependent on the total head pressure in metres h the flow capacity of the irrigation system in use f c pump efficiency e p and derating factor d head pressure h is defined as the sum of 1 the discharge pressure head 2 the friction head of water flow i e friction loss and 3 the height between the source of water and the discharge level robinson 2002 the typical total pumping head for a given irrigation system supplied with surface water is taken from smith 2015 these values range from 10 m head pressure for gravity to 60 m for spray irrigation although the values in smith 2015 are intended for irrigators in new south wales the indicated pumping costs were within the value range suggested by a local irrigation specialist maskey 2016 for a type of flood irrigation pipe and riser 8 15 and spray irrigation system centre pivot 30 50 typical head and cost ranges are shown in table 8 head pressure is multiplied by the flow capacity of the irrigation system f c the value of which is taken from literature regarding a farm in the study area given as 138 88 litres second or 12 ml day dedjtr 2015 the literature derived values assume that the pumping system can operate at the desired head pressure and flow rate and that the pump itself is in good condition pump efficiency e p is the percent energy efficiency of the pump representing the amount of energy imparted on the water this value is multiplied by a constant of 102 to convert unit of pressure kpa into metres given in faour 2001 in robinson 2002 the derating factor d accounts for efficiency losses between the total amount of energy required and the energy required at the pump shaft the derating factor is said to be 0 75 for diesel pumps faour 2001 in robinson 2002 as pumping efficiencies may vary model evaluation was conducted with e p set to a conservative value of 0 7 the suggested value to use when the pump configuration and efficiency are unknown vellotti and kalogerinis 2013 other efficiency losses which influence total pumping head are not explicitly considered but are accounted for through the use of this conservative pump efficiency value as in vellotti and kalogerinis 2013 groundwater pumping costs may fluctuate due to the changes in height distance between water source and discharge point resulting in an increase in total pumping head such a decrease in water levels necessitates increased amounts of energy and thus fuel to pump water from the increased distance to account for decreasing water levels the depth of groundwater is added to the head values given by smith 2015 to allow consideration of the effect of fluctuating groundwater levels the time taken to pump a single ml of water h m l is then determined by dividing the number of litres in a ml by the flow rate q in litres per second this resolves to the number of seconds required to pump 1 ml dividing this by the number of seconds in an hour 3600 or 60 2 results in the hour s required to pump 1 ml 10 h m l 10 6 q 60 2 10 6 1ml crops the crops represented include three cereal crops of wheat barley and canola these are applied as a three year rotation i e cultivating wheat one year barley the next and finally canola after which the rotation is repeated an earlier version included tomato however this crop was removed as its widespread cultivation was described as unrealistic and highly improbable by stakeholders as were horticultural crops in general determining seasonal profit values for the expected revenue r and associated production costs c for each crop and irrigation type used in eq 1 are taken from various grey literature sources to determine the optimal irrigation volume throughout the growing season or the irrigated area in the case of the first time step once the growing season has

sum of any irrigation water applied i w which will be 0 for dryland crops and the crop evaporation coefficient v which represents the required rainfall before a crop will yield these are then adjusted by a crop water use efficiency index c w u e to arrive at the per hectare crop yield y the resulting value is then converted to tonnes per hectare by dividing by 1000 values for the french schultz equation were initially taken from published fao guidelines allen et al 1998 with s s m assumed to be 30 of rainfall that occurred over february to april these were subsequently calibrated against historic per farm average crop yield data for the north central region obtained from the australian bureau of agricultural and resource economics abares the north central region represents an area significantly larger than the lower campaspe sub catchment however it is the most spatially relevant dataset available calibration used the l bfgs b function minimization routine implemented in the scipy python package jones et al 2001 to reduce root square mean error rmse this process achieved results with an overall rmse of 0 68 and a long term average yield comparable to what has occurred historically 2 37 t ha compared to the historic seasonal average of 2 27 t ha for dryland wheat the parameters for irrigated crops were adjusted to return higher yields as is usual for crops under irrigation the modelled results with calibrated values for both dryland and irrigation yields were deemed to be acceptable and reasonable by stakeholders further example calibration results are shown in fig 23 the seasonal profit is calculated in the same manner as used to optimize water usage see eq 1 albeit with yield values y replaced with those calculated by the french schultz equation and the costs now representing the variable and fixed costs associated with the cropping enterprise but also the costs accrued throughout the growing season such as cost of pumping and water access fees from

8372,study region three major river basins the cheliff tafna and macta in north west algeria study focus the purpose of this work is not to test the different climate models but rather to study the sensitivity of hydrological parameters to future climate change this is achieved using the gr2m hydrological model and climate scenario data from the cnrm cm5 model new hydrological insights in terms of observed trends the monthly flows decreased significantly between 1970 and 1999 mainly due to the decrease in precipitation combined with the increase in the potential evapotranspiration pet caused by rising temperatures according to the rcps8 5 and 4 5 scenarios projections the decrease in winter discharges will continue in the future for the spring rcp8 5 forecasts a moderate increase while rcp4 5 shows a downward trend keywords algeria climate change cnrm cm5 pet flow gr2m 1 introduction the algeria territory and in particular its western part has experienced several droughts over the last century during the 1940s and 1970s to the present day meddi and hubert 2003 meddi et al 2009 taibi et al 2013 2017 2019 zeroual et al 2017 the one recorded after 1975 was characterized by its large spatial extension its intensity and its major and significant impact on water resources meddi and meddi 2007 this situation has led to a great competition between different water users resulting in enormous pressure on groundwater reserves and mobilizable surface water bekkoussa et al 2008 this implies a degradation of the resource and the accentuation of problems related to its management marine invasion pollution land erosion changes in hydrological regime etc in this case forecasting becomes an essential tool for better prevention and good resource management this situation has also been observed in the mediterranean basin with a downward trend in rainfall in morocco and tunisia since the mid 1970s knippertz et al 2003 driouech et al 2010 longobardi and villani 2010 sebbar et al 2011 raymond et al 2016 ouhamdouch et al 2016 ouhamdouch et al 2019a the climate change impact on water resources has been the subject of numerous studies around the world singla 2009 piao et al 2010 garcía ruiz et al 2011 ouhamdouch et al 2018 the objective of this work is to assess the sensitivity of hydrology to changes in climate parameters and predict the future of water resources of major algerian rivers in this new context in mediterranean basins driouech et al 2010 ouhamdouch et al 2019a showed a reduction of around 22 in mean annual flows in the moulouya morocco by 2050 moreover by 2050 seasonal flows will decrease by an estimated 26 in winter 8 in autumn 9 and 10 in spring and summer respectively sadeuk et al 2010 estimated a decrease ranging from 4 to 40 in the cheliff and mina regions algeria for all seasons and all scenarios by 2050 on the other hand the plan bleu 2010 showed that the surface flows would no longer show a period of flood or low water flow base flow but a low and constant flow in this work the study of future precipitation and temperature based on the cnrm cm5 model is used to assess future climate projections in northwest algeria a region that has experienced a significant decrease in precipitation since 1975 with a catastrophic impact on surface and groundwater resources these outputs are then used to forecast outflows at the outlet in three watersheds in northwest algeria to show the sensitivity of the region s hydrology to changes in climate factors by 2039 2069 and 2099 this study could be a decision making tool for all actors working in water management these are the actors working in the mobilization and distribution of drinking water water use the risk and pollution related to water as well as the protection of natural environments it could also constitute a database for potential studies on adaptation measures and the development of future water resource management methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 presentation of the study area the study area is located in north west algeria bounded by latitude 33 91 36 58 and longitude 2 30 3 30 covers an area of 68 532 km2 it includes three major watersheds namely the cheliff tafna and macta basins the cheliff is part of the cheliff coastal dahra region on the other hand tafna and macta belong to the oranie chott cherguie region fig 1 2 2 climate context analysis of the temporal evolution of rainfall in the study area showed a gradual decrease in rainfall from the 1970s onwards meddi and meddi 2009 this reduction in rainfall is the result of a downward trend in annual and seasonal total precipitations decrease in winter rains meddi et al 2002 in addition to the decrease in the frequency of heavy rainfall matari and douguedroit 1995 leading to an estimated annual rainfall deficit of at least 20 of the annual totals in the tafna and macta basins meddi et al 2010a 2010b others estimate it at more than 36 in mascara plains and 20 in mitidja plains meddi and meddi 2009 however this deficit is between 16 and 43 in the western region and less than 20 in the central region taibi et al 2013 the downward trend in rainfall is becoming regional studies have shown that in morocco the decline in rainfall is widespread and highlighted by a break in time series between 1976 and 1980 singla et al 2010 similarly in central tunisia a decrease in rainfall was detected between 1976 and 1989 kingumbi et al 2005 several authors have studied the evolution of temperature in north west algeria and confirmed that this warming is mainly due to an increase in the average summer temperature from the 1990s fernini haffif and berezowska azzag 2015 they estimated this increase at 0 9 c in ghriss and 1 2 c in mascara and saida el mahi et al 2014 also reported an increase in maximum annual temperatures of 2 c and extremes warming of 7 c a similar trend has been detected in neighboring countries with an increase in the average maximum temperature of 1 3 c observed in beja in tunisia chebil et al 2011 in morocco however changes in climatic factors mainly temperature confirmed the observed global warming with significant increases particularly in summer and spring sebbar et al 2012 ouhamdouch et al 2019b 2 3 data the rainfall data used in this study come from two different sources on the one hand the sierem system environmental information system on water resources and their modeling of the mixed research unit hydrosciences montpellier giving monthly spatialized rainfall on a grid of 0 5 resolution and covering the period from 1940 to 1999 boyer et al 2006 rouché et al 2010 dieulin et al 2019 in the other hand rainfall stations data from the national agency for hydraulic resources anrh have been included in the study area table 1 monthly temperature data are from the climatic research unit cru and are available on the website www cru uae ac ac uk the recovered data corresponds to raw series of temperatures from different measurement stations located in the study area table 2 observation gaps and series length vary from one station to another for this reason some series are excluded so only those series that contain fewer gaps with a period covering the last 4 decades have been taken into account the pet that will be used in the hydrological model has been estimated by the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1951 the hydrometric data come from the national hydraulic resources agency anrh this study is based on measurements from 5 stations located in the three major basins covered by the study table 3 1 station is located in the tafna basin and one 1 in the macta basin and the remaining 3 are located in the chellif basin the study of such a theme leads us to exclude all stations where the anthropogenic effect on the hydrometric regime is quite obvious and those near hydraulic structures since regulation always involves a change in the wadi behavior in addition to these two criteria there is also the availability of data under these three conditions these five stations were selected 2 4 methods 2 4 1 average rainfall the average rainfall on each watershed was calculated using the thiessen polygon method it corresponds to an arithmetic method in which each rain gauge is assigned a weight proportional to a presumed zone of influence such that a point located in this zone is closer in horizontal distance to the corresponding rain gauge than to any other rain gauge callede 1977 as a first step the zone of influence of each rain gauge was delineated using the create thiessen polygons function included in the analysis tools section of arcmap 10 5 fig 2 then the mean surface rainfall was calculated for each basin using the following formula p m o y p i s i s t p m o y average surface rainfall on the basin p i rain fell at station i s i area of influence of station i s i total surface area of the watershed 2 4 2 validation criteria the gr2m model 2 parameters monthly model of rural engineering is a two parameter α and β global rainfall runoff model its development was initiated at cemagref at the end of the 1980s with application objectives in the field of water resources and low water flows perrin et al 2003 this model has had several versions proposed successively by kabouya 1990 kabouya and michel 1991 makhlouf and michel 1994 mouelhi et al 2006 which have gradually improved the model s performance and have adopted it in different contexts the version used here is that of makhlouf and michel 1994 which seems to be the most effective for the algerian territory the gr2m model produces simulated flows at the outlet of a watershed from input data rain pet the nash criterion on flow roots was the quality criterion used in this study nash and sutcliffe 1970 this criterion compares the mean square deviation of the flow roots to the variance according to the formula below n a s h 100 1 i 1 n q 0 q c 2 i 1 n q 0 q m 2 q 0 observed flow q c simulated flow using the model q m average observed flows n observation number the method used to test the robustness of the gr2m model is the double or split sampling this technique consists in subdividing the observation period of each watershed into sub periods with calibration over a period and validation over the rest of the observations while ensuring that a start up period is reserved 2 4 3 choice of climate model outputs as part of the cordex project coordinated regional downscaling experiment for the african continent downscaling is applied to five global models ensemble hadgem2 ec earth echam6 cnrm cm5 panitz et al 2013 conducted a comparative study between the outputs of these five models adapted at the regional scale with two emission scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 the results of the comparison show that the cnrm cm5 model projects the lowest rainfall and temperature for the far horizon and the second lowest for the nearest horizon after hadgem2 this allows us to consider that the cnrm cm5 model outputs are the most optimistic in terms of projection 3 results and discussion the validation over the periods of 1976 1990 1964 1986 and 1983 1996 respectively for the haciabia chouly and sidi djillali basins table 4 gives a nash criterion of around 60 reflecting an average quality of the model to reproduce the hydrological reality characterizing these basins this quality is explained by the moderately small surface area of the present basins and a relatively short hydraulic path giving rise to a low concentration time this reduces losses due to infiltration evaporation and sampling the general dynamics of flows over the ami moussa and ouled ben aek basins are fairly well reproduced the validation gives a nash criterion of 73 6 and 75 8 reflecting a good quality of the model to simulate the flows occurring on these two rivers this situation is explained by the geographical position of these two basins located in the centre of the chellif an area better watered than the extreme west of this basin and the west of algeria the choice of calibration options focused on the optimization procedure the influence on the starting point the choice of calibration periods and validation in terms of effect the consideration of a start up period at the beginning of each period allowed to solve errors due to initialization of the input data in addition the optimization procedure indicates a stability of the gr2m s performance which shows a convergence of the model towards the same nash value for different parameter sets to improve model performance and robustness the observation period was divided into 2 3 1 3 proportions split sampling perrin 2000 and long periods were used however to reproduce the climatic contrast characterizing the study area the model was calibrated and validated over periods of dry and wet years rau et al 2019 show that the calibration procedure makes the hydrological model less sensitive to spatial and temporal fluctuations of climatic factors and compensates for errors in the input data sets considered given that hydrological models are intended primarily to forecasting on catchments and for periods for which they have been calibrated and validated the temporal transposability of hydrological model parameters in a climate change context is based on the assumption that the rain flow relation in the future will not change compared to that established on the basis of observation reports in other words the stability of the factors conditioning the hydrological response is assumed although this could be discussed and be part of another study as a result the reliability of the validation criteria must be considered with caution ardoin bardin 2004 ardoin bardin et al 2009 and one must be aware that future forecasts provide only orders of magnitude and not plausible time series 3 1 evaluation of precipitation changes projected for the future for the assessment of projected future changes in the different basins the following formula was used δ i f i r i r i 100 δ i change in precipitation or temperature projected for horizon i f i the average precipitation or temperatures for the month or season i calculated over the future period r i the monthly or seasonal average calculated over the reference period 1970 1999 the assessment of projected future changes in rainfall in north west algeria by the cnrm cm5 model under the scenario 8 5 shows that the 1 st horizon for the winter season december january february will be marked by a decrease from 13 ammi moussa basin to 29 for the ouled ben a basin e k the smallest decrease for the 2nd horizon is in the ammi moussa basin with a rate of 9 and the largest is estimated at 25 in the chouly basin similarly in the 3rd horizon the decline continues to increase and affects 50 in the haciabia basin the model forecasts an increase in spring rainfall ranging from 7 to 27 with the greatest increase observed in the ammi moussa basin with a rate of 27 by the end of the 21 st century for the seasonal rainfall in summer and autumn the model shows that the rainfall is overestimated when compared to the reference period fig 3 the future change in seasonal mean precipitation from the cnrm cm5 projection under emission scenario 4 5 forecasts a decrease in winter precipitation over all basins with a rate varying from 16 to 50 during the 1 st horizon from 21 to 37 during the 2nd one and from 32 to 42 at the end of the 21 st century spring rainfall will drop significantly ranging from 46 to 88 in all basins on the other hand summer rains are overestimated by the model which forecasts very significant increases the evolution of autumn rainfall differs from one basin to another it shows a downward trend in all basins except the sidi djillali basin where it increases slightly fig 4 3 2 evaluation of projected future temperature changes the cnrm cm5 projection according to the scenario rcp8 5 for future horizons compared to the reference period 1970 1999 gives for all the basins in north west algeria an increase in the average seasonal mean temperature for the four seasons of the year of 0 5 c for the 1 st horizon and 2 c for the 2nd horizon a warming of 3 4 c is expected at the end of 21 st century fig 5 the 4 5 scenario of the cnrm cm5 projection for future horizons compared to the 1970 1999 reference period gives for all the basins of north west algeria an increase in the seasonal mean temperature for the four seasons of the year of 1 3 c for the 1 st horizon and 2 3 c for the 2nd horizon a warming of 3 c is expected at the end of 21 century fig 6 3 3 evaluation of the projected future pet the estimated future change for the seasonal average pet based on the future temperatures projected by the cnrm cm5 model shows an average increase of 6 mm for the four seasons of the year for the 1 st horizon and an average increase of 25 mm for the 2nd one the end of the 21 st century will be marked by an increase of 35 mm fig 7 similarly as in scenario 8 5 of the cnrm cm5 projection scenario 4 5 shows an increase in seasonal average pet for all future horizons the pet for the winter season will increase slightly and stabilize during the 2nd horizon summer will experience the largest increase during the 1 st horizon that will continue to increase during the last two horizons the autumn and spring seasons are characterized by a small gradual increase from one horizon to the next fig 8 3 4 forecasting and analysis of future flows future flow forecasts are made based on future rainfall projected by cnrm cm5 with both emission scenarios 8 5 and 4 5 and pet calculated for the future using temperatures from the cnrm cm5 climate model according to the rcp8 5 scenario the difference between the seasonal averages of the reference period 1970 1999 and the different future horizons 2039 2069 and 2099 shows a decrease in average winter flows by an average of 33 for all basins during the 1 st horizon the chouly basin records the largest decrease estimated at 62 6 while the least marked decrease is in the haciabia basin the decline stabilizes during the 2nd horizon with a rate of 31 on average then it will increase at the end of the 21 st century and will reach 50 on average over all the basins with a maximum of 76 6 in the chouly basin and a minimum of 20 in the haciabia basin during spring flows will increase by 14 for the 1 st horizon by 35 for the 2nd one and a 50 increase is expected by the end of the 21 st century the haciabia basin is the most affected by this increase with a rate of 115 rivers drying for the 3rd horizon summer and autumn show significant differences of more than 200 and 70 on average the modeled hydrological reality does not correspond well to the hydrological reality observed in autumn and summer since the cnrm cm5 model overestimates the winter and autumn rains compared to the values of the reference period over which the calibration is made fig 9 according to the rcp4 5 scenario the differences between the average of the different future horizons and that of the reference period show a large decrease in winter flows for the 1 st horizon for all basins the rate of the decrease is estimated on average at 50 the maximum of which is shown in the chouly basin with 65 and a minimum of 28 is recorded in the sidi djillali basin similarly in the 2nd horizon the decrease increases and reaches an average of 52 in all basins the chouly basin will be marked by the largest increase of 76 7 and the sidi djillali basin will experience the smallest decrease with a rate of 38 4 at the end of the 21 st century the decline will get worse and reach the 60 on average in all basins an increase of 77 and 40 was recorded in the chouly and ammi moussa basins respectively the 1 st horizon of spring will be marked by a significant decrease estimated at an average of 80 although it exceeds 90 in the chouly basin and varies around 37 in the sidi djillali basin for the 2nd and 3rd horizons the decrease drops slightly but it is still considerable when compared to the average of the reference period which varies between 50 and 60 on average in all the basins fig 10 3 5 discussion the flow variation between seasons winter and spring during the reference period 1970 1999 is mainly due to the high dependence of the hydrometric regime to precipitation the latter are conditioned by a mediterranean climate characterized by its high seasonality hooke 2006 with an maximum rainfall recorded in the winter season moreover the spatial distribution of rainfall shows a significant heterogeneity with the cheliff basin receiving a rainfall varying between 400 and 800 mm and the western part macta and tafna being watered with an average varying between 200 and 400 mm this gradient is generated by the effect of altitude longitude and distance to the sea as well as relief form meddi and meddi 2007 however the variation in flows between basins for the same season is probably due to the nature of the substratum and the area that differs between basins the assessment of the flows estimated by the gr2m model calibrated and validated on all the basins concerned by the study using the precipitation from the cnrm cm5 projection under the two rcps 8 5 and 4 5 and the estimated pet for the future using the thornthwaite formula based on the temperatures from the same climate projection shows a significant decrease in winter flows with a rate of 38 and 53 respectively for the scenarios rcps 8 5 and 4 5 table 5 the spring season will be marked by a sharp decline for the 1 st horizon estimated at an average of 80 under the 4 5 scenario in contrast the 8 5 scenario forecasts a 35 increase for summer and autumn the evolution of flows is irregular from one basin to another for the same scenario including decreases in some basins and increases in others despite the rise in rainfall characterizing all the basins and the increase in pet recalling that the hydrological regime is closely linked to the rainfall regime within the study area which leads us to conclude that the projected flows for summer and autumn do not really represent the hydrological reality of the basins the gr2m model coupled with the cnrm cm5 projections rcp8 5 scenario forecasts a 33 decrease in winter flows compared to the winter average for the reference period 1970 1999 and a 14 increase in spring flows on the other hand using the rcp4 5 scenario the gr2m model estimates a decrease in flows of about 49 and 80 respectively for winter and spring in summary the forecasts using rcp8 5 scenario predict a shift in the rainy season from winter to spring with a decrease in winter flows and a slight increase in spring flows the balance sheet gives us a 19 half yearly decrease this situation has a major impact on the agricultural calendar in contrast rcp4 5 scenario preserves the temporal distribution of rainfall he estimates a decrease in winter rains and an accentuation of this decrease during spring it should be noted that future spring flows show a gradual progression from one horizon to the next with a large difference compared to the spring flow of the reference period for this purpose it is assumed that the rcp4 5 scenario of the cnrm cm5 model underestimates the spring rains in our study area the chouly basin is the most affected in both scenarios it is the smallest basin in terms of area located in the far west a region already poorly watered than the central part of algeria an average half yearly decrease for the three future horizons of about 17 and 97 respectively predicted by the rcps8 5 and 4 5 scenarios although the rainfall and temperatures recorded in haciabia are relatively similar to those observed in neighbouring watersheds flow rates at the outlet of haciabia are very low this is mainly due to the predominance of humic calcareous soils atallah et al 2016 characterized by their high permeability favoring infiltration at the expense of surface runoff and resulting in a reduction in the flow rate at the outlet the rcp8 5 scenario estimates an average half yearly increase for the three future horizons of about 32 on the other hand the rcp4 5 scenario forecasts a 43 decrease in the cheliff basin according to the rcp8 5 scenario the impact increases from east to west the ouled ben aek basin will experience a 6 decrease in addition the ammi moussa basin will not experience any decrease finally the sidi ouled djillali basin will experience a decrease of around 18 in contrast according to rcp4 5 the impact decreases from east to west the ouled ben aek basin will experience an 80 decrease furthermore the ammi moussa basin will undergo a decrease of about 64 finally the sidi ouled djillali basin will experience a decrease of about 41 according to rcp8 5 for this it can be concluded that rcp8 5 scenario maintains the spatial irregularity of precipitation since rainfall in the central part of cheliff is significant in both its eastern and southern parts on the other hand the central part of the chellif is more affected than its eastern part according to the rcp4 5 scenario a similar situation projected by several authors zeroual et al 2013 using the extreme scenario a1 predicted a decrease in flows in the algiers hidna soummam basins of about 23 and 8 respectively for winter and spring by 2050 and 45 and 28 by the end of the 21 st century similarly meddi et al 2010a 2010b showed a decrease in flows in the cheliff basin of about 40 in winter and 18 in spring according to the high scenario by 2050 driouech et al 2010 exposed the same impact on the moulouya basin in morocco with a decrease in winter flows estimated at 26 and 8 for spring flows by 2021 2050 using the cordex coordinated regional downscaling experiment projections seif ennasr et al 2016 presented a 29 and 54 reduction in dam storage capacity according to rcps4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively tramblay et al 2013 showed a 30 decrease in runoff according to rcp4 5 and 50 according to rcp8 5 in the medium term 2041 2062 in the makhazine dam basin in morocco 4 conclusion at the end of the study on the impact of climate change on flows in the three basins studied it was shown that the values of the nash parameter reflect a good quality of the model to reproduce the flows observed in the ouled ben abdelkader and ammi moussa basins with a nash of about 75 and 73 respectively and a medium quality in the haciabia chouly and sidi djillali basins with a nash of 68 and 63 respectively in order to evaluate the projected changes in precipitation and temperature using scenarios from the cnrm cm5 model running at high resolution over algeria 40 50 km a comparison of the seasonal average rainfall of each future horizon with that of the reference period was carried out the results obtained showed for the rcp8 5 scenario a decrease in winter rains of 38 on average for the 1 st horizon 2039 and 31 during the 2nd horizon 2069 for the end of the 21 st century 2099 a 40 decrease is observed in addition spring rains will increase by an average of 17 over the three future horizons on the other hand the rcp4 5 scenario forecasts a decrease in winter and spring rains of about 27 and 65 respectively temperatures will increase by an average of about 2 c for each of the horizons the assessment of the climate change impact on the haciabia sidi djillali ammi moussa ouled ben aek and chouly basins is done by means of the gr2m hydrological model using climate scenario data from the cnrm cm5 model for the future winter flows will show a clear downward trend mainly due to the decrease in rainfall and the increase in pet for the two scenarios rcps8 5 and 4 5 on the other hand spring flows will increase according to rcp8 5 and decrease according to rcp4 5 in terms of observed differences the rcp8 5 scenario forecasts a decrease in winter flows of about 33 on average in all the studied basins by 2039 31 by 2069 and 50 by the end of the 21 st century the rcp4 5 scenario predicts a decrease of about 50 60 for all three horizons in addition the decrease is estimated at 80 for spring flows according to the rcp4 5 scenario in contrast the rcp8 5 scenario forecasts a 25 increase for the same

8372,study region three major river basins the cheliff tafna and macta in north west algeria study focus the purpose of this work is not to test the different climate models but rather to study the sensitivity of hydrological parameters to future climate change this is achieved using the gr2m hydrological model and climate scenario data from the cnrm cm5 model new hydrological insights in terms of observed trends the monthly flows decreased significantly between 1970 and 1999 mainly due to the decrease in precipitation combined with the increase in the potential evapotranspiration pet caused by rising temperatures according to the rcps8 5 and 4 5 scenarios projections the decrease in winter discharges will continue in the future for the spring rcp8 5 forecasts a moderate increase while rcp4 5 shows a downward trend keywords algeria climate change cnrm cm5 pet flow gr2m 1 introduction the algeria territory and in particular its western part has experienced several droughts over the last century during the 1940s and 1970s to the present day meddi and hubert 2003 meddi et al 2009 taibi et al 2013 2017 2019 zeroual et al 2017 the one recorded after 1975 was characterized by its large spatial extension its intensity and its major and significant impact on water resources meddi and meddi 2007 this situation has led to a great competition between different water users resulting in enormous pressure on groundwater reserves and mobilizable surface water bekkoussa et al 2008 this implies a degradation of the resource and the accentuation of problems related to its management marine invasion pollution land erosion changes in hydrological regime etc in this case forecasting becomes an essential tool for better prevention and good resource management this situation has also been observed in the mediterranean basin with a downward trend in rainfall in morocco and tunisia since the mid 1970s knippertz et al 2003 driouech et al 2010 longobardi and villani 2010 sebbar et al 2011 raymond et al 2016 ouhamdouch et al 2016 ouhamdouch et al 2019a the climate change impact on water resources has been the subject of numerous studies around the world singla 2009 piao et al 2010 garcía ruiz et al 2011 ouhamdouch et al 2018 the objective of this work is to assess the sensitivity of hydrology to changes in climate parameters and predict the future of water resources of major algerian rivers in this new context in mediterranean basins driouech et al 2010 ouhamdouch et al 2019a showed a reduction of around 22 in mean annual flows in the moulouya morocco by 2050 moreover by 2050 seasonal flows will decrease by an estimated 26 in winter 8 in autumn 9 and 10 in spring and summer respectively sadeuk et al 2010 estimated a decrease ranging from 4 to 40 in the cheliff and mina regions algeria for all seasons and all scenarios by 2050 on the other hand the plan bleu 2010 showed that the surface flows would no longer show a period of flood or low water flow base flow but a low and constant flow in this work the study of future precipitation and temperature based on the cnrm cm5 model is used to assess future climate projections in northwest algeria a region that has experienced a significant decrease in precipitation since 1975 with a catastrophic impact on surface and groundwater resources these outputs are then used to forecast outflows at the outlet in three watersheds in northwest algeria to show the sensitivity of the region s hydrology to changes in climate factors by 2039 2069 and 2099 this study could be a decision making tool for all actors working in water management these are the actors working in the mobilization and distribution of drinking water water use the risk and pollution related to water as well as the protection of natural environments it could also constitute a database for potential studies on adaptation measures and the development of future water resource management methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 presentation of the study area the study area is located in north west algeria bounded by latitude 33 91 36 58 and longitude 2 30 3 30 covers an area of 68 532 km2 it includes three major watersheds namely the cheliff tafna and macta basins the cheliff is part of the cheliff coastal dahra region on the other hand tafna and macta belong to the oranie chott cherguie region fig 1 2 2 climate context analysis of the temporal evolution of rainfall in the study area showed a gradual decrease in rainfall from the 1970s onwards meddi and meddi 2009 this reduction in rainfall is the result of a downward trend in annual and seasonal total precipitations decrease in winter rains meddi et al 2002 in addition to the decrease in the frequency of heavy rainfall matari and douguedroit 1995 leading to an estimated annual rainfall deficit of at least 20 of the annual totals in the tafna and macta basins meddi et al 2010a 2010b others estimate it at more than 36 in mascara plains and 20 in mitidja plains meddi and meddi 2009 however this deficit is between 16 and 43 in the western region and less than 20 in the central region taibi et al 2013 the downward trend in rainfall is becoming regional studies have shown that in morocco the decline in rainfall is widespread and highlighted by a break in time series between 1976 and 1980 singla et al 2010 similarly in central tunisia a decrease in rainfall was detected between 1976 and 1989 kingumbi et al 2005 several authors have studied the evolution of temperature in north west algeria and confirmed that this warming is mainly due to an increase in the average summer temperature from the 1990s fernini haffif and berezowska azzag 2015 they estimated this increase at 0 9 c in ghriss and 1 2 c in mascara and saida el mahi et al 2014 also reported an increase in maximum annual temperatures of 2 c and extremes warming of 7 c a similar trend has been detected in neighboring countries with an increase in the average maximum temperature of 1 3 c observed in beja in tunisia chebil et al 2011 in morocco however changes in climatic factors mainly temperature confirmed the observed global warming with significant increases particularly in summer and spring sebbar et al 2012 ouhamdouch et al 2019b 2 3 data the rainfall data used in this study come from two different sources on the one hand the sierem system environmental information system on water resources and their modeling of the mixed research unit hydrosciences montpellier giving monthly spatialized rainfall on a grid of 0 5 resolution and covering the period from 1940 to 1999 boyer et al 2006 rouché et al 2010 dieulin et al 2019 in the other hand rainfall stations data from the national agency for hydraulic resources anrh have been included in the study area table 1 monthly temperature data are from the climatic research unit cru and are available on the website www cru uae ac ac uk the recovered data corresponds to raw series of temperatures from different measurement stations located in the study area table 2 observation gaps and series length vary from one station to another for this reason some series are excluded so only those series that contain fewer gaps with a period covering the last 4 decades have been taken into account the pet that will be used in the hydrological model has been estimated by the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1951 the hydrometric data come from the national hydraulic resources agency anrh this study is based on measurements from 5 stations located in the three major basins covered by the study table 3 1 station is located in the tafna basin and one 1 in the macta basin and the remaining 3 are located in the chellif basin the study of such a theme leads us to exclude all stations where the anthropogenic effect on the hydrometric regime is quite obvious and those near hydraulic structures since regulation always involves a change in the wadi behavior in addition to these two criteria there is also the availability of data under these three conditions these five stations were selected 2 4 methods 2 4 1 average rainfall the average rainfall on each watershed was calculated using the thiessen polygon method it corresponds to an arithmetic method in which each rain gauge is assigned a weight proportional to a presumed zone of influence such that a point located in this zone is closer in horizontal distance to the corresponding rain gauge than to any other rain gauge callede 1977 as a first step the zone of influence of each rain gauge was delineated using the create thiessen polygons function included in the analysis tools section of arcmap 10 5 fig 2 then the mean surface rainfall was calculated for each basin using the following formula p m o y p i s i s t p m o y average surface rainfall on the basin p i rain fell at station i s i area of influence of station i s i total surface area of the watershed 2 4 2 validation criteria the gr2m model 2 parameters monthly model of rural engineering is a two parameter α and β global rainfall runoff model its development was initiated at cemagref at the end of the 1980s with application objectives in the field of water resources and low water flows perrin et al 2003 this model has had several versions proposed successively by kabouya 1990 kabouya and michel 1991 makhlouf and michel 1994 mouelhi et al 2006 which have gradually improved the model s performance and have adopted it in different contexts the version used here is that of makhlouf and michel 1994 which seems to be the most effective for the algerian territory the gr2m model produces simulated flows at the outlet of a watershed from input data rain pet the nash criterion on flow roots was the quality criterion used in this study nash and sutcliffe 1970 this criterion compares the mean square deviation of the flow roots to the variance according to the formula below n a s h 100 1 i 1 n q 0 q c 2 i 1 n q 0 q m 2 q 0 observed flow q c simulated flow using the model q m average observed flows n observation number the method used to test the robustness of the gr2m model is the double or split sampling this technique consists in subdividing the observation period of each watershed into sub periods with calibration over a period and validation over the rest of the observations while ensuring that a start up period is reserved 2 4 3 choice of climate model outputs as part of the cordex project coordinated regional downscaling experiment for the african continent downscaling is applied to five global models ensemble hadgem2 ec earth echam6 cnrm cm5 panitz et al 2013 conducted a comparative study between the outputs of these five models adapted at the regional scale with two emission scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 the results of the comparison show that the cnrm cm5 model projects the lowest rainfall and temperature for the far horizon and the second lowest for the nearest horizon after hadgem2 this allows us to consider that the cnrm cm5 model outputs are the most optimistic in terms of projection 3 results and discussion the validation over the periods of 1976 1990 1964 1986 and 1983 1996 respectively for the haciabia chouly and sidi djillali basins table 4 gives a nash criterion of around 60 reflecting an average quality of the model to reproduce the hydrological reality characterizing these basins this quality is explained by the moderately small surface area of the present basins and a relatively short hydraulic path giving rise to a low concentration time this reduces losses due to infiltration evaporation and sampling the general dynamics of flows over the ami moussa and ouled ben aek basins are fairly well reproduced the validation gives a nash criterion of 73 6 and 75 8 reflecting a good quality of the model to simulate the flows occurring on these two rivers this situation is explained by the geographical position of these two basins located in the centre of the chellif an area better watered than the extreme west of this basin and the west of algeria the choice of calibration options focused on the optimization procedure the influence on the starting point the choice of calibration periods and validation in terms of effect the consideration of a start up period at the beginning of each period allowed to solve errors due to initialization of the input data in addition the optimization procedure indicates a stability of the gr2m s performance which shows a convergence of the model towards the same nash value for different parameter sets to improve model performance and robustness the observation period was divided into 2 3 1 3 proportions split sampling perrin 2000 and long periods were used however to reproduce the climatic contrast characterizing the study area the model was calibrated and validated over periods of dry and wet years rau et al 2019 show that the calibration procedure makes the hydrological model less sensitive to spatial and temporal fluctuations of climatic factors and compensates for errors in the input data sets considered given that hydrological models are intended primarily to forecasting on catchments and for periods for which they have been calibrated and validated the temporal transposability of hydrological model parameters in a climate change context is based on the assumption that the rain flow relation in the future will not change compared to that established on the basis of observation reports in other words the stability of the factors conditioning the hydrological response is assumed although this could be discussed and be part of another study as a result the reliability of the validation criteria must be considered with caution ardoin bardin 2004 ardoin bardin et al 2009 and one must be aware that future forecasts provide only orders of magnitude and not plausible time series 3 1 evaluation of precipitation changes projected for the future for the assessment of projected future changes in the different basins the following formula was used δ i f i r i r i 100 δ i change in precipitation or temperature projected for horizon i f i the average precipitation or temperatures for the month or season i calculated over the future period r i the monthly or seasonal average calculated over the reference period 1970 1999 the assessment of projected future changes in rainfall in north west algeria by the cnrm cm5 model under the scenario 8 5 shows that the 1 st horizon for the winter season december january february will be marked by a decrease from 13 ammi moussa basin to 29 for the ouled ben a basin e k the smallest decrease for the 2nd horizon is in the ammi moussa basin with a rate of 9 and the largest is estimated at 25 in the chouly basin similarly in the 3rd horizon the decline continues to increase and affects 50 in the haciabia basin the model forecasts an increase in spring rainfall ranging from 7 to 27 with the greatest increase observed in the ammi moussa basin with a rate of 27 by the end of the 21 st century for the seasonal rainfall in summer and autumn the model shows that the rainfall is overestimated when compared to the reference period fig 3 the future change in seasonal mean precipitation from the cnrm cm5 projection under emission scenario 4 5 forecasts a decrease in winter precipitation over all basins with a rate varying from 16 to 50 during the 1 st horizon from 21 to 37 during the 2nd one and from 32 to 42 at the end of the 21 st century spring rainfall will drop significantly ranging from 46 to 88 in all basins on the other hand summer rains are overestimated by the model which forecasts very significant increases the evolution of autumn rainfall differs from one basin to another it shows a downward trend in all basins except the sidi djillali basin where it increases slightly fig 4 3 2 evaluation of projected future temperature changes the cnrm cm5 projection according to the scenario rcp8 5 for future horizons compared to the reference period 1970 1999 gives for all the basins in north west algeria an increase in the average seasonal mean temperature for the four seasons of the year of 0 5 c for the 1 st horizon and 2 c for the 2nd horizon a warming of 3 4 c is expected at the end of 21 st century fig 5 the 4 5 scenario of the cnrm cm5 projection for future horizons compared to the 1970 1999 reference period gives for all the basins of north west algeria an increase in the seasonal mean temperature for the four seasons of the year of 1 3 c for the 1 st horizon and 2 3 c for the 2nd horizon a warming of 3 c is expected at the end of 21 century fig 6 3 3 evaluation of the projected future pet the estimated future change for the seasonal average pet based on the future temperatures projected by the cnrm cm5 model shows an average increase of 6 mm for the four seasons of the year for the 1 st horizon and an average increase of 25 mm for the 2nd one the end of the 21 st century will be marked by an increase of 35 mm fig 7 similarly as in scenario 8 5 of the cnrm cm5 projection scenario 4 5 shows an increase in seasonal average pet for all future horizons the pet for the winter season will increase slightly and stabilize during the 2nd horizon summer will experience the largest increase during the 1 st horizon that will continue to increase during the last two horizons the autumn and spring seasons are characterized by a small gradual increase from one horizon to the next fig 8 3 4 forecasting and analysis of future flows future flow forecasts are made based on future rainfall projected by cnrm cm5 with both emission scenarios 8 5 and 4 5 and pet calculated for the future using temperatures from the cnrm cm5 climate model according to the rcp8 5 scenario the difference between the seasonal averages of the reference period 1970 1999 and the different future horizons 2039 2069 and 2099 shows a decrease in average winter flows by an average of 33 for all basins during the 1 st horizon the chouly basin records the largest decrease estimated at 62 6 while the least marked decrease is in the haciabia basin the decline stabilizes during the 2nd horizon with a rate of 31 on average then it will increase at the end of the 21 st century and will reach 50 on average over all the basins with a maximum of 76 6 in the chouly basin and a minimum of 20 in the haciabia basin during spring flows will increase by 14 for the 1 st horizon by 35 for the 2nd one and a 50 increase is expected by the end of the 21 st century the haciabia basin is the most affected by this increase with a rate of 115 rivers drying for the 3rd horizon summer and autumn show significant differences of more than 200 and 70 on average the modeled hydrological reality does not correspond well to the hydrological reality observed in autumn and summer since the cnrm cm5 model overestimates the winter and autumn rains compared to the values of the reference period over which the calibration is made fig 9 according to the rcp4 5 scenario the differences between the average of the different future horizons and that of the reference period show a large decrease in winter flows for the 1 st horizon for all basins the rate of the decrease is estimated on average at 50 the maximum of which is shown in the chouly basin with 65 and a minimum of 28 is recorded in the sidi djillali basin similarly in the 2nd horizon the decrease increases and reaches an average of 52 in all basins the chouly basin will be marked by the largest increase of 76 7 and the sidi djillali basin will experience the smallest decrease with a rate of 38 4 at the end of the 21 st century the decline will get worse and reach the 60 on average in all basins an increase of 77 and 40 was recorded in the chouly and ammi moussa basins respectively the 1 st horizon of spring will be marked by a significant decrease estimated at an average of 80 although it exceeds 90 in the chouly basin and varies around 37 in the sidi djillali basin for the 2nd and 3rd horizons the decrease drops slightly but it is still considerable when compared to the average of the reference period which varies between 50 and 60 on average in all the basins fig 10 3 5 discussion the flow variation between seasons winter and spring during the reference period 1970 1999 is mainly due to the high dependence of the hydrometric regime to precipitation the latter are conditioned by a mediterranean climate characterized by its high seasonality hooke 2006 with an maximum rainfall recorded in the winter season moreover the spatial distribution of rainfall shows a significant heterogeneity with the cheliff basin receiving a rainfall varying between 400 and 800 mm and the western part macta and tafna being watered with an average varying between 200 and 400 mm this gradient is generated by the effect of altitude longitude and distance to the sea as well as relief form meddi and meddi 2007 however the variation in flows between basins for the same season is probably due to the nature of the substratum and the area that differs between basins the assessment of the flows estimated by the gr2m model calibrated and validated on all the basins concerned by the study using the precipitation from the cnrm cm5 projection under the two rcps 8 5 and 4 5 and the estimated pet for the future using the thornthwaite formula based on the temperatures from the same climate projection shows a significant decrease in winter flows with a rate of 38 and 53 respectively for the scenarios rcps 8 5 and 4 5 table 5 the spring season will be marked by a sharp decline for the 1 st horizon estimated at an average of 80 under the 4 5 scenario in contrast the 8 5 scenario forecasts a 35 increase for summer and autumn the evolution of flows is irregular from one basin to another for the same scenario including decreases in some basins and increases in others despite the rise in rainfall characterizing all the basins and the increase in pet recalling that the hydrological regime is closely linked to the rainfall regime within the study area which leads us to conclude that the projected flows for summer and autumn do not really represent the hydrological reality of the basins the gr2m model coupled with the cnrm cm5 projections rcp8 5 scenario forecasts a 33 decrease in winter flows compared to the winter average for the reference period 1970 1999 and a 14 increase in spring flows on the other hand using the rcp4 5 scenario the gr2m model estimates a decrease in flows of about 49 and 80 respectively for winter and spring in summary the forecasts using rcp8 5 scenario predict a shift in the rainy season from winter to spring with a decrease in winter flows and a slight increase in spring flows the balance sheet gives us a 19 half yearly decrease this situation has a major impact on the agricultural calendar in contrast rcp4 5 scenario preserves the temporal distribution of rainfall he estimates a decrease in winter rains and an accentuation of this decrease during spring it should be noted that future spring flows show a gradual progression from one horizon to the next with a large difference compared to the spring flow of the reference period for this purpose it is assumed that the rcp4 5 scenario of the cnrm cm5 model underestimates the spring rains in our study area the chouly basin is the most affected in both scenarios it is the smallest basin in terms of area located in the far west a region already poorly watered than the central part of algeria an average half yearly decrease for the three future horizons of about 17 and 97 respectively predicted by the rcps8 5 and 4 5 scenarios although the rainfall and temperatures recorded in haciabia are relatively similar to those observed in neighbouring watersheds flow rates at the outlet of haciabia are very low this is mainly due to the predominance of humic calcareous soils atallah et al 2016 characterized by their high permeability favoring infiltration at the expense of surface runoff and resulting in a reduction in the flow rate at the outlet the rcp8 5 scenario estimates an average half yearly increase for the three future horizons of about 32 on the other hand the rcp4 5 scenario forecasts a 43 decrease in the cheliff basin according to the rcp8 5 scenario the impact increases from east to west the ouled ben aek basin will experience a 6 decrease in addition the ammi moussa basin will not experience any decrease finally the sidi ouled djillali basin will experience a decrease of around 18 in contrast according to rcp4 5 the impact decreases from east to west the ouled ben aek basin will experience an 80 decrease furthermore the ammi moussa basin will undergo a decrease of about 64 finally the sidi ouled djillali basin will experience a decrease of about 41 according to rcp8 5 for this it can be concluded that rcp8 5 scenario maintains the spatial irregularity of precipitation since rainfall in the central part of cheliff is significant in both its eastern and southern parts on the other hand the central part of the chellif is more affected than its eastern part according to the rcp4 5 scenario a similar situation projected by several authors zeroual et al 2013 using the extreme scenario a1 predicted a decrease in flows in the algiers hidna soummam basins of about 23 and 8 respectively for winter and spring by 2050 and 45 and 28 by the end of the 21 st century similarly meddi et al 2010a 2010b showed a decrease in flows in the cheliff basin of about 40 in winter and 18 in spring according to the high scenario by 2050 driouech et al 2010 exposed the same impact on the moulouya basin in morocco with a decrease in winter flows estimated at 26 and 8 for spring flows by 2021 2050 using the cordex coordinated regional downscaling experiment projections seif ennasr et al 2016 presented a 29 and 54 reduction in dam storage capacity according to rcps4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively tramblay et al 2013 showed a 30 decrease in runoff according to rcp4 5 and 50 according to rcp8 5 in the medium term 2041 2062 in the makhazine dam basin in morocco 4 conclusion at the end of the study on the impact of climate change on flows in the three basins studied it was shown that the values of the nash parameter reflect a good quality of the model to reproduce the flows observed in the ouled ben abdelkader and ammi moussa basins with a nash of about 75 and 73 respectively and a medium quality in the haciabia chouly and sidi djillali basins with a nash of 68 and 63 respectively in order to evaluate the projected changes in precipitation and temperature using scenarios from the cnrm cm5 model running at high resolution over algeria 40 50 km a comparison of the seasonal average rainfall of each future horizon with that of the reference period was carried out the results obtained showed for the rcp8 5 scenario a decrease in winter rains of 38 on average for the 1 st horizon 2039 and 31 during the 2nd horizon 2069 for the end of the 21 st century 2099 a 40 decrease is observed in addition spring rains will increase by an average of 17 over the three future horizons on the other hand the rcp4 5 scenario forecasts a decrease in winter and spring rains of about 27 and 65 respectively temperatures will increase by an average of about 2 c for each of the horizons the assessment of the climate change impact on the haciabia sidi djillali ammi moussa ouled ben aek and chouly basins is done by means of the gr2m hydrological model using climate scenario data from the cnrm cm5 model for the future winter flows will show a clear downward trend mainly due to the decrease in rainfall and the increase in pet for the two scenarios rcps8 5 and 4 5 on the other hand spring flows will increase according to rcp8 5 and decrease according to rcp4 5 in terms of observed differences the rcp8 5 scenario forecasts a decrease in winter flows of about 33 on average in all the studied basins by 2039 31 by 2069 and 50 by the end of the 21 st century the rcp4 5 scenario predicts a decrease of about 50 60 for all three horizons in addition the decrease is estimated at 80 for spring flows according to the rcp4 5 scenario in contrast the rcp8 5 scenario forecasts a 25 increase for the same

region high recharge sites cover 8 of the catchment and correspond to places underlain by sandstones and fractured basaltic outcrops as well as areas covered by thick sandy soils moderate recharge occurs in 78 and low recharge in 14 of the catchment area the results from this study are useful for selecting areas for more focused studies on recharge and also form a significant decision support tool for sustainable and equitable utilization of groundwater resources within the motloutse catchment keywords analytic hierarchy process spatial attributes groundwater recharge gis motloutse catchment 1 introduction groundwater recharge is an aspect of the hydrologic cycle that is important in the water balance calculation recharge is a water resources management tool and it is important in balancing water demand and water supply for development with special attention placed on semi arid and arid regions surface water as a source of recharge in semi arid regions is limited hence groundwater forms a dependable resource to meet the water supply needs for many communities around the world jhariya et al 2016 chowdhury et al 2009 freeze and cherry 1979 the increased usage of groundwater has put pressure on the resource and continues to present a potential threat to upset the water balance for many areas the dynamics of recharge of rain water to groundwater in arid environments varies significantly in space where recharge is hampered by extreme climate of high annual temperature and low and sporadic precipitation a pivotal role of infiltrating rain water towards storage in aquifers is instead driven by a framework of geologic attributes and ground characteristics within the watershed areas the lack of conceptual understanding of such analytic geospatial frameworks makes recharge determinations insufficiently successful as indicated by numerous previous studies across the globe e g beekman and xu 2003 scanclon et al 2006 accurate spatial predictions and quantum estimates of recharge remain semi elusive to many scientists partially because the causes and controls on infiltration and recharge have remained an open ended question as a result of the lack of understanding of the factors that motivate them recent advances in digital image processing combined with multi criteria analysis of the geospatial environment have enabled scientists to better identify areas where natural recharge occurs using combinations of quasi static data such as geology topography vegetation soil characteristics etc to mention but a few carver 1991 jankowski 1995 malczewski 1999 boroushaki and malczewski 2008 spatially locating favourable ground characteristics therefore is the domain of groundwater recharge in semi arid environments and has in recent times been supported by analyses of geospatial attributes in gis aided studies as evidenced by a large number of studies from different climatic regions of the world the majority of the researches are from southwestern asia e g arulbalaji et al 2019 saha 2017 raviraj et al 2017 yeh et al 2016 pinto et al 2015 kaliraj et al 2014 machiwal et al 2011 sargaonkar et al 2011 balachandar et al 2010 chowdhury et al 2010 chowdhury et al 2009 anbazhagan et al 2005 while few have been conducted in the arabian peninsula e g al shabeeb 2015 al adamat 2012 khalaf 2010 ghayoumia et al 2005 and in africa hachem et al 2015 chenini and mammou 2010 the sets of parameters selected for the various investigations included climate slope geomorphology drainage density land use land cover geology lineament density the vadose zone characteristics soil characteristics static water level aquifer lithology and hydraulic conductivity and aquifer transitivity in different but appropriate combinations hence understanding and characterising recharge requires precise quantitative assessment of multiple parameters basing on a combination of scientific principles and modern analytic geospatial techniques malczewski and rinner 2015 in semi arid regions such as the motloutse catchment in eastern botswana recharge occurs through different processes that may include 1 focused recharge at the basin margin 2 direct recharge beneath ephemeral rivers and pans 3 aerially distributed diffuse infiltration through the unsaturated zone beekman and xu 2003 scanlon et al 2002 in the simplest terms recharge tends to concentrate in areas of topographic depressions with well drained soils and shallow rooted vegetation freeze and cherry 1979 lerner et al 2000 sophocleous 2004 but recent studies have indicated that there is more to that this study investigates the spatial distribution of recharge within motloutse watershed by integrating six influencing parameters lithology lineament density slope soil type soil thickness and drainage density using weighted overlay analysis based on analytic hierarchy process ahp technique in general hydrology in watersheds is characterised by factors such as overland runoff from the basin groundwater recharge rate that is dependent upon the amount of precipitation in excess of evapotranspiration soil infiltration capacity and bedrock permeability all these contribute towards yield of groundwater to wells to springs and to streams that drain the basin reliable recharge studies in the motloutse catchment are sparse in spite of the catchment s regional significance as a part of the greater transboundary limpopo river basin lack of reliable information on recharge is a situation typical of semi arid areas where environmental factors are known to be harsh on recharge in this research and for the first time the ahp technique was used to study recharge and its distribution for the entire motloutse watershed previous studies have concentrated on delineating recharge zones at aquifer scale using drill holes and tracer studies hence distribution of natural recharge zones and its controls are still poorly documented recharge zones to the underlying ntane sandstone aquifer of the lebung group in the western section of the study area were delineated and confirmed through drilling of boreholes in the west high recharge zones were attributed to areas of depressions such as pans and also where the ntane sandstone aquifer directly underlies thick kalahari sand cover sgab 1988 in the eastern portion of the study area potentially high recharge zones were delineated using chloride mass balance method on the outcrop of the tsheung sandstone which is an equivalent of the ntane sandstone in the west wrc 1988 selaolo et al 1994 in the current study we provide new and valuable relationships between recharge and the geospatial environment across the entire watershed we derive the relative importance of the various geospatial attributes according to their influence on groundwater recharge in the motloutse and finally rank them accordingly 1 1 groundwater recharge and the hydrologic cycle groundwater recharge is the downward flow of water reaching the water table and adding to groundwater storage freeze and cherry 1979 recharge may initiate from an adjoining groundwater system where water moves from an unconfined aquifer across a confining bed to an underlying aquifer healey 2010 groundwater recharge is one of the least understood components of hydrologic cycle because it varies widely in space and time and rates are difficult to directly measure the rate timing and location of recharge are important issues in areas of groundwater supply and contamination quantification of natural rates at which aquifer waters are replenished is vital for efficient groundwater management simmers 1990 when precipitation reaches the soil surface it may flow downslope in the form of runoff while some may infiltrate and get absorbed into the soil water that infiltrates is either absorbed by plants which later return it to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration or percolates downward below the root zone to reach the saturated zone thus adding to groundwater storage as recharge the water that recharged the groundwater reservoir may eventually be discharged as stream flow chow et al 1988 freeze and cherry 1979 1 2 the study area the motloutse watershed is located in eastern botswana as shown in fig 1 a the watershed covers an area of 1 953 km2 making approximately 4 8 of the limpopo river basin limcom 2016 the watershed is host to five wellfields and two dams fig 1 b the wellfields are paje mmashoro and a cap wellfields in the west and bobonong and talana farms wellfields in the east three of the wellfields are of national significance paje and mmashoro wellfields supply water to morupule coal fired power station talana farms wellfield at the confluence of the motloutse and limpopo rivers supplies water to talana vegetable farms and bobonong wellfield which is a part of the tuli karoo transboundary aquifer system shared by botswana south africa and zimbabwe a cap wellfield is of local interest because it supplies water to a coal mine close to sese village two dams of national significance also derive their water from the motloutse watershed letsibogo dam that supplies water to several major towns in the southern part of the country including the capital city of gaborone through a 360 km pipeline and the thune dam that supplies water to villages and towns that are proximal to the watershed smec ehes 2006 motloutse catchment is rich in mineral resources such as coal uranium and copper nickel once mining of these resources is commissioned groundwater is likely to be used to sustain the water needs of the mining activities and the understanding of the spatial distribution recharge and rates would become vital in the sustainable management of the water resources within motloutse catchment the area is covered by shrubs grassland and cultivated land limcom 2016 the mean annual temperature within motloutse catchment is 20 c the temperatures can reach 30 c during the hot summer in december and january whilst winter temperatures can drop to zero on the celsius scale the eastern side is warmer with average annual temperature of 22 c while the western portion has an annual average of 20 c annual rainfall varies spatially and temporally with the eastern part receiving annual average rainfall that ranges from 337 to 373 mm in the north annual average rainfall is between 393 and 457 mm the rainy season is between october and april and january is the wettest month receiving the highest rainfall usgs fewsnet 2017 the litho stratigraphy of the catchment area was summarised in carney et al 1994 and in smith 1984a according to table 1 the west and east of the catchment are underlain by sandstones arkoses and mudstones of the upper karoo supergroup sequence occasionally characterised by thin intra formational sandstones siltstones marls and or palaeosoils carney et al 1994 smith 1984a the sediments are capped in some places by the basalts of the stormberg lava group that form flat lying plateaus in the mid portions of the catchment are archaean age gneisses and granitoids of the limpopo belt and zimbabwe craton table 2 that occur as structurally complex metamorphic assemblages of migmatitic varieties with minor granodioritic and tonalitic orthogneisses carney et al 1994 rocks of the zimbabwe craton have been affected by different processes of shear deformation partial melting and magmatic injection 2 materials and methods 2 1 data acquisition and development of thematic layers this section discusses the data sources formats and data processing techniques applied to each parameter used for evaluating potential groundwater recharge zones the general methodology is summarised in fig 2 for which major processes include reclassification of individual layers and identification of potential recharge zones by integrating reclassified layers using weighted overlay analysis technique that is guided by ahp pairwise comparison matrix 2 1 1 aquifer lithology lithology is the physical make up of rocks and sediments and includes mineral composition grain size and grain packing freeze and cherry 1979 the lithology map of the catchment fig 3 was constructed by geo referencing digitizing merging and extracting motloutse watershed boundary from geological maps scale 1 125000 of surrounding towns of serowe machacha 1985 letlhakane selebi thomas 1970 francistown mmadinare and phikwe key 1976 bobonong paya 1996 and palapye ermanovics and skinner 1980 all obtained in hard copy format from a repository of the botswana geoscience institute bgi groundwater in the catchment occurs in crystalline basement rocks karoo strata as well as in alluvial deposits smec ehes 2006 the alluvial deposits were referred to as sand river aquifers by winker 1980 sand rivers form shallow unconfined aquifers that indirectly recharge underlying deeper aquifers sand river aquifers are riverbed deposits found at the confluence of motloutse and limpopo rivers the largest deposit covers an area of 4 km2 smec ehes 2006 recharge is mainly from upstream runoff from crystalline rock surfaces that make up the middle portion of the catchment for sand river aquifers water loss through evaporation in the river beds reduces to zero when water levels fall below one metre from the surface winker 1980 in the western and eastern portions of the catchment are the karoo aquifers the karoo aquifers have been divided into three hydrogeological response units hru 1 stormberg basalt 2 upper karoo lebung group sandstones 3 lower karoo dwyka and ecca sedimentary sequences smec ehes 2006 karoo deposits are common in southern africa and cover more than 80 of botswana smith 1984a resulting in transboundary aquifer systems in the eastern portion of the catchment karoo aquifers extend into south africa and zimbabwe the stormberg basalts possess secondary porosity induced by fractures and fissures that convey recharge to the underlying lebung group sandstones recharge to the basalt aquifer is limited and usually confined to areas of river valleys where basalt is exposed water strikes ranging from 5 to 77 m below ground level m b g l have been reported for boreholes drilled into the basalt indicating the presence of hydraulically isolated water bearing zones coupled with limited conduit fractures wsb 2007 the lebung group sediments host the ntane sandstone aquifer in the west and the equivalent tsheung sandstone aquifer in the east of the study area smith 1984a carney et al 1994 the ntane sandstone aquifer is confined in some places by the overlying stormberg basalt and becomes unconfined where the basalt has been fully eroded smec ehes 2006 the confined sections receive recharge from overlaying beds via fractures while the unconfined portions recharge directly from rain infiltration the lower karoo sediments comprise of interbedded sandstone and coal layers smith 1984a therefore recharge to the lower karoo aquifer is indirectly via the overlying aquifers and fractured portion of the mosolotshane formation mudstones regional lineaments that are post karoo cut through most of the lithologies thereby introducing secondary porosity enhancing permeability and most important hydraulically connecting the different lithologies jennings 1974 sgab 1988 the archean basement consists of granites gneisses migmatites and other metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks permeability of the rock is purely secondary with water stored in faults and fissures and in the upper weathered layers basement aquifers are principally unconfined and recharge occurs directly through fractured and weathered zones smec ehes 2006 2 1 2 slope and drainage density slope and drainage density data were extracted from the digital elevation model of motloutse watershed constructed from google earth image the geographical boundary of motloutse watershed was georeferenced into geographical projection using wgs 84 datum and displayed in decimal degrees and digitized from a jpeg image downloaded from the limpopo river awareness kit limcom 2016 the shapefile shp of the watershed boundary was converted to kml keyhole markup language format and viewed in google earth where elevation data were extracted using terrain zonum solution http www zonums com gmaps terrain php four thousand eight hundred 4800 values of

irregular network tin structure and finally converted into dem raster file meijerink 2007 data sinks and peaks were removed using the fill function of arcgis 10 2 2 software esri 2015 a sink is a group of one or more cells that have lower elevations than all the surrounding cells rusli and majid 2012 while a peak is a group of one or more cells that have higher elevations than all the surrounding cells maidment 1993 the slope map fig 4 and drainage density map fig 5 were extracted from the dem spatial analyst tool of the arcgis software slope is the angle between the tangent plane and the horizontal plane at a given point of the topographical surface maidment 1993 slope determines the amount of infiltration and runoff simmers 1990 gently sloping areas trap precipitation and permit for infiltration through the soil and ultimately recharge to the underlying aquifers the opposite is true for steeper slopes simmers 1990 the slope map of the study area in fig 4 was created using the eight node operation of the slope tool in arcgis 10 2 2 the slope tool calculates the change in elevation at a point using elevations of the surrounding eight neighbours esri 2015 a drainage network is a measure for landscape dissection by streams and can be expressed as drainage density indicating the total length of streams related to an area km km² schillaci et al 2015 drainage density map of fig 5 was produced using line density tool of spatial analyst toolbox in arcgis 10 2 2 software the line density tool calculates drainage density by dividing the length of the drainage line by the surrounding watershed area esri 2015 the blue patches on the resultant density map represent topographic lows that correspond to higher stream density and the light green patches are ridges within the catchment which are areas of lower density the red is the watershed boundary with lowest density 2 1 3 lineaments density lineaments are surficial expressions of underlying geology and structural features such as fractures or faults or joints o leary et al 1976 lineaments were extracted manually from aeromagnetic data bgi 2016 and automatically from landsat 8 oli images for july 2018 usgs 2016

topographic lineaments lineaments were extracted separately from band 8 of landsat 8 oli image and srtm dem using line module of pci geomatica software geomatica 2017 lineaments were saved as shapefile shp in utm coordinates measured in kilometres the 1998 aeromagnetic data was obtained in ascii format from the botswana geoscience institute database the survey was conducted with two base stations one in gaborone at geographical coordinated 25 890 e 24 660 s and the other in francistown at geographical coordinates 27 53e 21 19s covering an area of 47 000 km2 from a total of 293 13 survey lines were produced at 10 samples per second and altitude of 80 m the data was imported enhanced and processed using geosoft s oasis montaj version the study area was co registered to geographic coordinate system wgs 84 the data were enhanced using analytic signal and first vertical derivative techniques to reveal linear structures the data were then exported to tiff format before importing into arcgis software for digitizing the linear structures derived from aeromagnetic data landsat 8 oli image and srtm dem were imported into arcgis software to create a lineament map which was later transformed into a lineament density map of fig 6 using the line density tool of spatial analyst toolbox 2 1 4 soil type the soil type map of the study area was constructed by merging five soil map sheets 1 250 000 of francistown letlhakane palapye serowe and tuli into fig 7 the legend of which was derived from fao 1988 in de wit and nachtergaele 1990 there are eight types of soils within the study area namely from west to east arenosols calcisols cambisols leptosols lixisols luvisols regosols and vertisols fao 1985 in that sequence with the west dominated by the coarser sandy soils while the finer clay soils are common in the east 2 1 5 soil thickness soil thicknesses data for the catchment area were downloaded in geotiff tiff format from oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive centre ornl daac website https daac ornl gov soils guides global soil regolith sediment html soil thickness data were derived from the best available topography climate and geology data to depict the average thickness of the permeable layers above bedrock by landform type for the geological present the data cover earth s surface between latitudes 60 degrees north and south and longitudes 180 in east and west soil thickness map of the motloutse watershed fig 8 was generated by extracting watershed extent from spatial analyst tool of the arcgis software the average soil thicknesses range from 37 to 50 m pelletier et al 2016 2 2 reclassifying individual parameters each of the six thematic layers mentioned in section 1 were reclassified then assigned a weight according to their relative influence on groundwater recharge using analytic hierarchical process ahp technique saaty 1977 brunnelli 2015 each layer was reclassified into high moderate and low from the most highest to the lowest recharge potential based on natural breaks in the data the weight is assigned to each map layer to represent relative importance of each parameter class vis à vis recharge hachem et al 2015 yeh et al 2016 arulbalaji et al 2019 2 2 1 aquifer lithology the reclassified lithology map fig 9 was produced based on groundwater occurrence and recharge as described in previous works of carney et al 1994 smec ehes 2006 wsb 2007 geology controls recharge through the nature of rocks at the outcrops and through topography slope and nature of soils simmers 1990 freeze and cherry 1979 lebung group and stormberg basalts aquifers were assigned high recharge potential because they are coarse grained outcropping at sections and fractured and more importantly they are top most layers of the stratigraphic sequences making them unconfined therefore directly recharged by precipitation the lower sections of the palapye group and the crystalline basement rocks were assigned moderate recharge values because of their silty nature and secondary porosity development from multiple tectonic activities respectively the mudstones of the lower karoo and mahalapye migmatites were assigned low recharge value because of the confined nature of the mudstones and low permeability character of the migmatites 2 2 2 slope an increase in slope results in a decrease in infiltration rate and thus a decrease in groundwater recharge simmers 1990 low slopes are characterised by high recharge potential as posited in fig 10 the reclassified slope map recharge is highly concentrated in areas where the difference in elevations is small hence low slopes therefore high recharge potential the high recharge areas are concentrated in the west where ground is relatively flat 2 2 3 lineament density lineaments are indicators of regional and local tectonic trends as well as acting as reservoirs and conduits for oil and natural gas groundwater and mineral deposits el sawy et al 2016 the reclassified lineament density map shown as fig 11 was produced based on the fact that geological structures like lineaments induce secondary porosity and permeability to rocks freeze and cherry 1979 maidment 1993 therefore areas with high lineament density have high potential of groundwater recharge 2 2 4 soil type the importance of soil type on groundwater recharge was based on infiltration capacity the soils were regrouped according to grain size and sand clay and silt content fao isric 2003 coarse grained soils have high infiltration capabilities and are assigned high recharge potential values fitzpatrick 1986 brady and weil 2014 the reclassified soil type map of fig 12 shows the high recharge areas are characterised by arenosols lixisols and leptosols because they are coarse grained and have high sand content and little to no clay de wit and nachtergaele 1990 regosols and vertisols have predominantly high clay and are therefore assigned low recharge potentiality 2 2 5 soil thickness the soil layer above the aquifer influences the amount of water to become recharge and discharge soil thickness determines the volume of infiltrate and the time that infiltrated water takes to get to the water table brady and weil 2014 freeze and cherry 1979 thin soils and bare rocks are prone to high volume runoff thus low infiltration for recharge usda 1972 the soil thickness map of fig 8 was reclassified by assigning high recharge potential to thicker soil layers as shown in fig 13 the reclassified soil thickness map of fig 13 reveals that high recharge zones are concentrated in the west 38 50 metres with few patches of thickest soil in the centre and east 2 2 6 drainage density areas with high drainage density capture excessive runoff and are given a higher weight in relation to recharge hachem et al 2015 for this reason areas with high drainage density were assigned high recharge potential as shown in fig 14 the red patches in fig 14 reveal high recharge potential zones while the green and yellow patches show moderate and low recharge potential sites respectively high recharge potential depicts high concentration of drainage channels 2 3 analytic hierarchy process analytic hierarchy process ahp is a logical and coordinated technique for structuring information alternatives on a hierarchical framework aided by mathematical pairwise comparisons ahp pairwise matrix method is suitable in cases of separating a large number of alternatives to a series of pair wise comparisons followed by synthesizing of results it is also used as a decision making tool in cases where there is lack of adequate and good quality data das et al 2018 souissi et al 2018 brunnelli 2015 saaty 2014 the use of ahp requires scientific knowledge coupled with proven evidence riad et al 2011 esri 2015 as well as evaluation of the matrix for consistency saaty 2014 yeh et al 2016 as a result the ahp has emerged as one of the most important research topics in the field of decision analysis across various disciplines e g facilities site selection such as in waste management and in landuse allocation kaya et al 2006 wang et al 2009 ardeshir et al 2010 sabbah et al 2018 2 group dynamics in psychology saaty 1980a b maletič et al 2016 3 real estate for picking preferred locations during house hunting mohd et al 2011 4 resource mapping in mineral exploration mansouri et al 2011 to mention but a few applications similarly ahp can be applied to groundwater recharge studies particularly for the selection of potential recharge zones from competing sets of parameters in order to delineate potential recharge zones within motloutse watershed ahp technique was implemented in four phases 1 selection of factors influencing groundwater recharge zones 2 pairwise comparison matrix 3 estimating relative weights and 4 assessing matrix consistency each phase is discussed as separately below 2 3 1 selection of factors influencing groundwater recharge zones the first phase in the ahp technique involves the selection of recharge influencing factors and their attributes selection of factors enables the researcher to decompose the problem into a pyramid structure comprising of objective influencing factors and various alternatives solutions to the problem boroushaki and malczewski 2008 brunnelli 2015 saaty 1980a b the main objective aim of research makes the apex followed by factor attributes while the base of the pyramid consists of alternative solutions the aim of this research is to delineate potential recharge zones within motloutse watershed factor attributes comprise of thematic layers of aquifer lithology soil type soil thickness drainage density lineament density and slope the reclassified layers of influencing factors show potential recharge zones based on each factor in our case the relative importance of a parameter on groundwater recharge was graded based on a nine point scale as shown in table 3 a score of 1 equal importance between the two factors and 9 extreme importance of row theme compared to the column factor saaty 1980a b 2 3 2 pairwise comparison matrix a pairwise comparison matrix a m m was constructed based on the number of input factors for delineation of recharge potential zones saaty 1980a b the inputs were reclassified maps of thematic layers discussed in section 2 2 each entry of the matrix represents the influence of the row factor relative to the column factor factor influences on each other based on saaty s one to nine point scale of table 3 geology plays a vital role in the occurrence and distribution of groundwater in any terrain freeze and cherry 1979 therefore selection and weighting of factors for the construction of pcm table 4 for delineating recharge zones was based on geology and processes affecting recharge in motloutse watershed dabrala et al 2014 lithology outcrop was selected the first parameter and recorded in row1 and column 1 of the matrix because water would recharge aquifers directly based on reasons used for reclassifying parameter recharge potentiality slope was selected the second most important parameter because it affects the destiny of the water that reaches the surface of the earth lineaments density was selected third because a high density of lineaments induces porosity and permeability soil type was selected forth in the hierarchy because it determines infiltration capacity and permeability while infiltration volumes depend on soil thickness drainage density depends on other parameters under investigation so it was allocated the lowest importance the selection parameter pair as well as the assignment of pair weight was based on the interrelationship between lithology and others affect recharge slope reflects differences in elevation from weathering of rocks bridge and demicco 2008 hence lithology slope pair were assigned 5 because lithology is essential for the development of slope lithology soil type pair was assigned 7 very strong importance and lithology soil type pair 8 the intermediary between very extreme importance and extremely because soil type is weathered material of lithology while soil thickness depends on geology and slope as well as erosion and deposition drainage network depicts extent and orientation of geological structures liu et al 2015 that may be influential to infiltration and eventually recharge to groundwater storage in the absence of aquifer outcrops water reaches the lineaments in places with concave slopes thick and well drained soils that is why lithology drainage density pair was assigned 9 the value of 1 was assigned to parameters of equal importance 2 3 3 estimating relative weights ahp employs the opinions from subject matter experts and the principle of eigenvector and eigenvalue to reduce noise in the data by eliminating features that have a strong correlation between them and also help in reducing over fitting dabrala et al 2014 expert opinion and eigenvector are used to assign factor weight while principal eigenvalue is used to rank the factors carver 1991 malczewski 2006 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 2 3 3 1 expert opinion the opinions of experts may be collected from separate individuals across the project area through interviews or from a gathering of experts during group decision making sessions through group decision making only one weight is unanimously assigned to specific factor the equivalence of the eigenvector column 8 in table 5 while separate individual respondents may assign various weights to one factor the conclusive factor weight from separate individual experts is deduced by computing the geometric mean of the indivudually assigned weights saaty 2014 bailey et al 2003 group decision making eliminates uncertainties such as spatial distribution of the experts across the area of study and the likelihood that some of the experts may not return the answers to the researcher malczewski 1999 for the purpose of archiving and quality assurance experts opinions are commonly collected in the form of questionnaires surveys questionnaire surveys fall in two main classes 1 descriptive fact finding and 2 analytic explanatory oppenheim 2000 in conducting a questionnaire survey respondents can be allocated a choice of alternative answers or be requested to provide their answers usually in writing jolliffe 1986 oppenheim 2000 expert opinion has been utilized to determine factor weights for making decisions that are influenced by socio economic factors such as site suitability mapping and hazard susceptibility mapping al anbari et al 2018 al shabeeb 2015 kaya et al 2006 expert opinion survey in the form of questionnaires has been utilized to assign factor weight to thematic layers of parameters that affect groundwater occurrences in order to produce groundwater potential maps for instance manap et al 2013 and saha 2017 to date there is no record of studies that used expert opinion to assign weight to parameter influencing the location of natural recharge zones expert opinion is required for implementation of projects that have the potential to modify the natural setup of the environment or society on which the project is carried out in our case we study recharge as a natural process where the end would not likely alter the environment or cause undesirable effects to the society therefore the use of expert opinion was deemed not necessary for this study as it had been the case in similar studies elsewhere arulbalaji et al 2019 das et al 2018 pinto et al 2017 machiwal et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2009 2 3 3 2 eigenvector the eigenvector is the ordering of parameter influence on recharge by assigning the weights saaty 2003 the eigenvector was computed to show relative weights of each the parameters towards recharge brunnelli 2015 the eigenvectors column 8 were calculated by first by dividing column values by the column sum in table 4 then averaging row values saaty 1980a b 2 3 3 3 principal eigenvalue ahp uses eigenvalues to rank the importance of parameter to recharge the sum of eigenvalues called principal eigenvalue λmax is a measure of matrix deviation from consistency brunnelli 2015 according to saaty 1980a b a pairwise comparison matrix is consistent only if the principal eigenvalue λmax is greater than or equal to the number of the parameters investigated n otherwise a new matrix is required the principal eigenvalue in the last row in table 6 was obtained from the summation of products column sums in the pairwise matrix table 4 and eigen vector table 5 the principal eigenvalue of 6 27 was achieved for a 6 6 matrix was achieved and paving way for the calculation of consistency index 2 3 4 assessing matrix consistency inconsistencies in pairwise comparisons increase with increasing number of comparisons saaty 1980a b therefore ahp incorporates consistency index for assessing the evaluations made when building each of the pairwise comparison matrices involved in the process the consistency index ci is the ratio of the difference between the principal eigen value λmax and the number of factors under investigation from the n to n 1 as follows c i λ m a x n n 1 therefore consistency index ci for recharge parameters investigated by this study is ci 6 27 6 6 1 0 05 the computation of ci was followed by the calculation of the consistency ratio cr a measure of consistency of pairwise comparison matrix cr is the ratio of consistency index to the ratio index ri the values of ri for different n values are given in table 7 ahp accepts cr values between zero and 0 1 or 10 anything greater than 10 calls for revision of comparisons consistency ratio ci ri 0 05 1 24 0 0427 4 27 10 cr is less than 10 hence it is acceptable and thus weighted overlay analysis was performed in arcgis software to integrate the weighted map layers and to map the spatial distribution of recharge zones 2 4 weighted overlay analysis weighted overlay analysis is a technique for applying a common scale of values to input factors to create an integrated analysis based on pairwise comparison matrix of ahp esri 2015 each input layer was reclassified to a common ratio scale of high moderate low recharge potential the reclassified factors were weighted to determine the relative importance of each to groundwater recharge using pairwise comparison matrix of ahp the weighting values were assessed for consistency before being integrated to produce a map of spatial distribution of recharge within motlouse catchment as illustrated in section 2 4 1 2 4 1 integration of thematic layers the reclassified layers of lithology slope lineament density soil type soil thickness and drainage density and their corresponding percentage influence on recharge were integrated to produce a map of spatial distribution of groundwater recharge within motloutse catchment using weighted overlay tool of arcgis 10 2 2 software weighted overlay analysis tool reclassifies values in the input raster layers into a common evaluation scale of 1 2 3 high moderate low respectively by multiplying the cell values of each factor class by the factor weight and sums the resulting cell values together to produce a map of potential recharge zones as shown by the following equation raviraj et al 2017 esri 2015 1 p g r z a l c a l w s l c s l w d d c

the products of factor percentage influence column 9 in table 5 and the corresponding reclassified map the map shows that high recharge is mainly concentrated in the red sections the yellow portions show low recharge potential while moderately recharged areas are in green the recharge map is divided into three classes high moderate and low recharge potential zones based on the weights assigned to each parameter earlier esri 2015 3 1 results validation the map of established wellfields was overlain on the map of groundwater recharge potential to validate the effectiveness of the ahp guided technique in locating potential groundwater recharge zones it has been observed that the high recharge zones correspond to established wellfields as in fig 16 these wellfields are hosted in the sandstone and basalts the sandstones are well known for their high yielding boreholes in the country and in the southern african region smec ehes 2006 in the west of the catchment high recharge zones coincide with two of the three recharge zones of the lebung aquifer previously identified using field work and groundwater modelling for the paje wellfield the two recharge zones were identified by sgab 1988 and wsb 2007 and are 1 the top of the escarpment and serwe pan with annual recharge rate of 6 5 mm year 2 a section with a recharge rate of 2 3 mm year where the lebung sandstone directly underlies the kalahari sediments pumping tests performed in the sandstone revealed transmissivity values between 7 and 350 m2 day recharge rates decrease in areas where the lebung sandstone is confined by the basalts and the kalahari sand cover in the east an average transmissivity values of 20 m2 day has been recorded for the lebung aquifers while 0 15 to 80 m2 day was recorded for the basalt aquifer smec ehes 2006 pre pumping static groundwater levels varies from 9 m to over 100 m across the catchment a cross section of six boreholes across the catchment depicting distribution of hydraulic head in relation to topography and geology in the various zones is presented in fig 16a c high hydraulic head defines areas where there is high infiltration vis a vis hydraulic loading this is consistent with largest recharge occurring in the west where groundwater heads are highest and reducing towards the middle part with moderate heads the zones are clearly controlled by the lithology and structure where high heads correspond to areas of fractured basalts and outcropping sandstones fig 16a the east is hydraulically not connected to the middle and west of the catchment being separated by a shear zone that causes a significant drop in heads and topography fig 16c indicating non continuity 4 discussions the integration of remotely sensed data and multiple criteria analysis ahp into a gis environment to map the spatial distribution of recharge within a motloutse catchment has been proven to be both feasible and economical the results indicated that recharge is controlled by many competing factors the potential zones for groundwater recharge were delineated by reclassifying weighting and ranking six recharge influencing parameters aquifer lithology slope lineament density drainage density soil thickness and soil texture in a gis environment using weighted overlay analysis guided by ahp technique the normalized matrix table 5 revealed that lithology is the most influential parameter accounting for 60 followed by slope at 22 while soil thickness and drainage density are the least influential at 3 6 and 3 1 respectively high recharge zones correspond to outcrops of the stormberg volcanics and lebung sandstone rocks both known for their high yielding boreholes throughout southern and east africa smec ehes 2006 rocks of the lebung group are coarse grained sandstone with high porosity and permeability while the stormberg lava group owe their porosity to intense fracturing and layering in places carney et al 1994 smec ehes 2006 in places where the lebung rocks and confined by stormberg volcanics the fractures in the basalt act as pathways for water to recharge to the sandstones underneath smec ehes 2006 it was for these reasons that the outcrops of stormberg lava group and lebung sandstone group were assigned high recharge potential in fig 9 slope is the change in topography showing lithologic resistance to weathering and erosion areas with low slopes show resistance to weathering and are characteristic of the basaltic rock outcrops soil thickness and drainage density are the least influential factors because thin soils absorb less water infiltrate may be returned to the atmosphere by root uptake and the rest of the water lost through runoff while high drainage density corresponds to low permeability thus low recharge hachem et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2009 fig 15 shows areas of high recharge potential are concentrated in the east and west and cover 8 by area of the motloutse catchment these high recharge areas are characterised by most permeable lithology low slopes high drainage density and thick soil layers with high infiltration capacity corresponding to reclassified thematic layers of high recharge potentials as shown in figs 9 14 respectively ahp is a logical scientific approach as well as consistency analysis tool for making quantifiable judgments for mapping spatial distribution of recharge within the motloutse catchment and has been used for similar studies in different climate settings our results are in agreement with those found in previous studies yeh et al 2016 chowdhury et al 2009 jhariya et al 2016 liu et al 2015 pinto et al 2017 riad et al 2011 rusli and majid 2012 5 conclusions increased availability of remotely sensed data has helped in studying the natural environment without direct contact and processing of data in a gis environment allows data to be stored updated retrieved and processed for other applications gis cannot rank or weight the influence of different factors to recharge and this limitation was overcome by incorporating ahp through ahp it was possible to derive ratio scales from both discrete and continuous paired comparisons of recharge influencing parameters this paper analysed the spatial distribution of recharge within the motloutse watershed by 1 developing thematic layers for lithology slope lineament density soil type soil thickness and drainage density from different data sources 2 reclassifying and 3 weighting and ranking these spatial data according to their relative importance and 4 integrating them to produce groundwater recharge distribution map using weighted overlay analysis guided by ahp technique weighted overlay analysis is flexible and a dependable decision making tool for groundwater recharge mapping as used in many other fields involving multiple and conflicting factors lithology and slope are most influential control factors of groundwater recharge in the motloutse watershed as revealed by the current study and validated by previous studies fig 15 will serve as the basis of information to land water and environmental authorities for groundwater development potential and protection

8373,study region the motloutse watershed is located in eastern botswana study focus this study investigates the spatial distribution of recharge in the semi arid watershed using weighted overlay analysis the overuse of groundwater in the motloutse catchment to support domestic and industrial expansion has generated the need for the determination of areas where renewable storage to groundwater may occur a select of parameters known to have influence on recharge were considered for input into the analytic process and included lithology lineament density ground slope soil type soil thickness and drainage density a thematic map for each parameter was prepared reclassified into high moderate and low potential for recharge analytic hierarchy process was applied to rank the importance of each parameter relative to one another concerning groundwater recharge potential groundwater recharge sites were delineated using weighted overlay tool of arcgis software new hydrological insights for the region high recharge sites cover 8 of the catchment and correspond to places underlain by sandstones and fractured basaltic outcrops as well as areas covered by thick sandy soils moderate recharge occurs in 78 and low recharge in 14 of the catchment area the results from this study are useful for selecting areas for more focused studies on recharge and also form a significant decision support tool for sustainable and equitable utilization of groundwater resources within the motloutse catchment keywords analytic hierarchy process spatial attributes groundwater recharge gis motloutse catchment 1 introduction groundwater recharge is an aspect of the hydrologic cycle that is important in the water balance calculation recharge is a water resources management tool and it is important in balancing water demand and water supply for development with special attention placed on semi arid and arid regions surface water as a source of recharge in semi arid regions is limited hence groundwater forms a dependable resource to meet the water supply needs for many communities around the world jhariya et al 2016 chowdhury et al 2009 freeze and cherry 1979 the increased usage of groundwater has put pressure on the resource and continues to present a potential threat to upset the water balance for many areas the dynamics of recharge of rain water to groundwater in arid environments varies significantly in space where recharge is hampered by extreme climate of high annual temperature and low and sporadic precipitation a pivotal role of infiltrating rain water towards storage in aquifers is instead driven by a framework of geologic attributes and ground characteristics within the watershed areas the lack of conceptual understanding of such analytic geospatial frameworks makes recharge determinations insufficiently successful as indicated by numerous previous studies across the globe e g beekman and xu 2003 scanclon et al 2006 accurate spatial predictions and quantum estimates of recharge remain semi elusive to many scientists partially because the causes and controls on infiltration and recharge have remained an open ended question as a result of the lack of understanding of the factors that motivate them recent advances in digital image processing combined with multi criteria analysis of the geospatial environment have enabled scientists to better identify areas where natural recharge occurs using combinations of quasi static data such as geology topography vegetation soil characteristics etc to mention but a few carver 1991 jankowski 1995 malczewski 1999 boroushaki and malczewski 2008 spatially locating favourable ground characteristics therefore is the domain of groundwater recharge in semi arid environments and has in recent times been supported by analyses of geospatial attributes in gis aided studies as evidenced by a large number of studies from different climatic regions of the world the majority of the researches are from southwestern asia e g arulbalaji et al 2019 saha 2017 raviraj et al 2017 yeh et al 2016 pinto et al 2015 kaliraj et al 2014 machiwal et al 2011 sargaonkar et al 2011 balachandar et al 2010 chowdhury et al 2010 chowdhury et al 2009 anbazhagan et al 2005 while few have been conducted in the arabian peninsula e g al shabeeb 2015 al adamat 2012 khalaf 2010 ghayoumia et al 2005 and in africa hachem et al 2015 chenini and mammou 2010 the sets of parameters selected for the various investigations included climate slope geomorphology drainage density land use land cover geology lineament density the vadose zone characteristics soil characteristics static water level aquifer lithology and hydraulic conductivity and aquifer transitivity in different but appropriate combinations hence understanding and characterising recharge requires precise quantitative assessment of multiple parameters basing on a combination of scientific principles and modern analytic geospatial techniques malczewski and rinner 2015 in semi arid regions such as the motloutse catchment in eastern botswana recharge occurs through different processes that may include 1 focused recharge at the basin margin 2 direct recharge beneath ephemeral rivers and pans 3 aerially distributed diffuse infiltration through the unsaturated zone beekman and xu 2003 scanlon et al 2002 in the simplest terms recharge tends to concentrate in areas of topographic depressions with well drained soils and shallow rooted vegetation freeze and cherry 1979 lerner et al 2000 sophocleous 2004 but recent studies have indicated that there is more to that this study investigates the spatial distribution of recharge within motloutse watershed by integrating six influencing parameters lithology lineament density slope soil type soil thickness and drainage density using weighted overlay analysis based on analytic hierarchy process ahp technique in general hydrology in watersheds is characterised by factors such as overland runoff from the basin groundwater recharge rate that is dependent upon the amount of precipitation in excess of evapotranspiration soil infiltration capacity and bedrock permeability all these contribute towards yield of groundwater to wells to springs and to streams that drain the basin reliable recharge studies in the motloutse catchment are sparse in spite of the catchment s regional significance as a part of the greater transboundary limpopo river basin lack of reliable information on recharge is a situation typical of semi arid areas where environmental factors are known to be harsh on recharge in this research and for the first time the ahp technique was used to study recharge and its distribution for the entire motloutse watershed previous studies have concentrated on delineating recharge zones at aquifer scale using drill holes and tracer studies hence distribution of natural recharge zones and its controls are still poorly documented recharge zones to the underlying ntane sandstone aquifer of the lebung group in the western section of the study area were delineated and confirmed through drilling of boreholes in the west high recharge zones were attributed to areas of depressions such as pans and also where the ntane sandstone aquifer directly underlies thick kalahari sand cover sgab 1988 in the eastern portion of the study area potentially high recharge zones were delineated using chloride mass balance method on the outcrop of the tsheung sandstone which is an equivalent of the ntane sandstone in the west wrc 1988 selaolo et al 1994 in the current study we provide new and valuable relationships between recharge and the geospatial environment across the entire watershed we derive the relative importance of the various geospatial attributes according to their influence on groundwater recharge in the motloutse and finally rank them accordingly 1 1 groundwater recharge and the hydrologic cycle groundwater recharge is the downward flow of water reaching the water table and adding to groundwater storage freeze and cherry 1979 recharge may initiate from an adjoining groundwater system where water moves from an unconfined aquifer across a confining bed to an underlying aquifer healey 2010 groundwater recharge is one of the least understood components of hydrologic cycle because it varies widely in space and time and rates are difficult to directly measure the rate timing and location of recharge are important issues in areas of groundwater supply and contamination quantification of natural rates at which aquifer waters are replenished is vital for efficient groundwater management simmers 1990 when precipitation reaches the soil surface it may flow downslope in the form of runoff while some may infiltrate and get absorbed into the soil water that infiltrates is either absorbed by plants which later return it to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration or percolates downward below the root zone to reach the saturated zone thus adding to groundwater storage as recharge the water that recharged the groundwater reservoir may eventually be discharged as stream flow chow et al 1988 freeze and cherry 1979 1 2 the study area the motloutse watershed is located in eastern botswana as shown in fig 1 a the watershed covers an area of 1 953 km2 making approximately 4 8 of the limpopo river basin limcom 2016 the watershed is host to five wellfields and two dams fig 1 b the wellfields are paje mmashoro and a cap wellfields in the west and bobonong and talana farms wellfields in the east three of the wellfields are of national significance paje and mmashoro wellfields supply water to morupule coal fired power station talana farms wellfield at the confluence of the motloutse and limpopo rivers supplies water to talana vegetable farms and bobonong wellfield which is a part of the tuli karoo transboundary aquifer system shared by botswana south africa and zimbabwe a cap wellfield is of local interest because it supplies water to a coal mine close to sese village two dams of national significance also derive their water from the motloutse watershed letsibogo dam that supplies water to several major towns in the southern part of the country including the capital city of gaborone through a 360 km pipeline and the thune dam that supplies water to villages and towns that are proximal to the watershed smec ehes 2006 motloutse catchment is rich in mineral resources such as coal uranium and copper nickel once mining of these resources is commissioned groundwater is likely to be used to sustain the water needs of the mining activities and the understanding of the spatial distribution recharge and rates would become vital in the sustainable management of the water resources within motloutse catchment the area is covered by shrubs grassland and cultivated land limcom 2016 the mean annual temperature within motloutse catchment is 20 c the temperatures can reach 30 c during the hot summer in december and january whilst winter temperatures can drop to zero on the celsius scale the eastern side is warmer with average annual temperature of 22 c while the western portion has an annual average of 20 c annual rainfall varies spatially and temporally with the eastern part receiving annual average rainfall that ranges from 337 to 373 mm in the north annual average rainfall is between 393 and 457 mm the rainy season is between october and april and january is the wettest month receiving the highest rainfall usgs fewsnet 2017 the litho stratigraphy of the catchment area was summarised in carney et al 1994 and in smith 1984a according to table 1 the west and east of the catchment are underlain by sandstones arkoses and mudstones of the upper karoo supergroup sequence occasionally characterised by thin intra formational sandstones siltstones marls and or palaeosoils carney et al 1994 smith 1984a the sediments are capped in some places by the basalts of the stormberg lava group that form flat lying plateaus in the mid portions of the catchment are archaean age gneisses and granitoids of the limpopo belt and zimbabwe craton table 2 that occur as structurally complex metamorphic assemblages of migmatitic varieties with minor granodioritic and tonalitic orthogneisses carney et al 1994 rocks of the zimbabwe craton have been affected by different processes of shear deformation partial melting and magmatic injection 2 materials and methods 2 1 data acquisition and development of thematic layers this section discusses the data sources formats and data processing techniques applied to each parameter used for evaluating potential groundwater recharge zones the general methodology is summarised in fig 2 for which major processes include reclassification of individual layers and identification of potential recharge zones by integrating reclassified layers using weighted overlay analysis technique that is guided by ahp pairwise comparison matrix 2 1 1 aquifer lithology lithology is the physical make up of rocks and sediments and includes mineral composition grain size and grain packing freeze and cherry 1979 the lithology map of the catchment fig 3 was constructed by geo referencing digitizing merging and extracting motloutse watershed boundary from geological maps scale 1 125000 of surrounding towns of serowe machacha

botswana geoscience institute bgi groundwater in the catchment occurs in crystalline basement rocks karoo strata as well as in alluvial deposits smec ehes 2006 the alluvial deposits were referred to as sand river aquifers by winker 1980 sand rivers form shallow unconfined aquifers that indirectly recharge underlying deeper aquifers sand river aquifers are riverbed deposits found at the confluence of motloutse and limpopo rivers the largest deposit covers an area of 4 km2 smec ehes 2006 recharge is mainly from upstream runoff from crystalline rock surfaces that make up the middle portion of the catchment for sand river aquifers water loss through evaporation in the river beds reduces to zero when water levels fall below one metre from the surface winker 1980 in the western and eastern portions of the catchment are the karoo aquifers the karoo aquifers have been divided into three hydrogeological response units hru 1 stormberg basalt 2 upper karoo lebung group sandstones 3 lower karoo dwyka and ecca sedimentary sequences smec ehes 2006 karoo deposits are common in southern africa and cover more than 80 of botswana smith 1984a resulting in transboundary aquifer systems in the eastern portion of the catchment karoo aquifers extend into south africa and zimbabwe the stormberg basalts possess secondary porosity induced by fractures and fissures that convey recharge to the underlying lebung group sandstones recharge to the basalt aquifer is limited and usually confined to areas of river valleys where basalt is exposed water strikes ranging from 5 to 77 m below ground level m b g l have been reported for boreholes drilled into the basalt indicating the presence of hydraulically isolated water bearing zones coupled with limited conduit fractures wsb 2007 the lebung group sediments host the ntane sandstone aquifer in the west and the equivalent tsheung sandstone aquifer in the east of the study area smith 1984a carney et al 1994 the ntane sandstone aquifer is confined in some places by the overlying stormberg basalt and becomes unconfined where the basalt has been fully eroded smec ehes 2006 the confined sections receive recharge from overlaying beds via fractures while the unconfined portions recharge directly from rain infiltration the lower karoo sediments comprise of interbedded sandstone and coal layers smith 1984a therefore recharge to the lower karoo aquifer is indirectly via the overlying aquifers and fractured portion of the mosolotshane formation mudstones regional lineaments that are post karoo cut through most of the lithologies thereby introducing secondary porosity enhancing permeability and most important hydraulically connecting the different lithologies jennings 1974 sgab 1988 the archean basement consists of granites gneisses migmatites and other metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks permeability of the rock is purely secondary with water stored in faults and fissures and in the upper weathered layers basement aquifers are principally unconfined and recharge occurs directly through fractured and weathered zones smec ehes 2006 2 1 2 slope and drainage density slope and drainage density data were extracted from the digital elevation model of motloutse watershed constructed from google earth image the geographical boundary of motloutse watershed was georeferenced into geographical projection using wgs 84 datum and displayed in decimal degrees and digitized from a jpeg image downloaded from the limpopo river awareness kit limcom 2016 the shapefile shp of the watershed boundary was converted to kml keyhole markup language format and viewed in google earth where elevation data were extracted using terrain zonum solution http www zonums com gmaps terrain php four thousand eight hundred 4800 values of

irregular network tin structure and finally converted into dem raster file meijerink 2007 data sinks and peaks were removed using the fill function of arcgis 10 2 2 software esri 2015 a sink is a group of one or more cells that have lower elevations than all the surrounding cells rusli and majid 2012 while a peak is a group of one or more cells that have higher elevations than all the surrounding cells maidment 1993 the slope map fig 4 and drainage density map fig 5 were extracted from the dem spatial analyst tool of the arcgis software slope is the angle between the tangent plane and the horizontal plane at a given point of the topographical surface maidment 1993 slope determines the amount of infiltration and runoff simmers 1990 gently sloping areas trap precipitation and permit for infiltration through the soil and ultimately recharge to the underlying aquifers the opposite is true for steeper slopes simmers 1990 the slope map of the study area in fig 4 was created using the eight node operation of the slope tool in arcgis 10 2 2 the slope tool calculates the change in elevation at a point using elevations of the surrounding eight neighbours esri 2015 a drainage network is a measure for landscape dissection by streams and can be expressed as drainage density indicating the total length of streams related to an area km km² schillaci et al 2015 drainage density map of fig 5 was produced using line density tool of spatial analyst toolbox in arcgis 10 2 2 software the line density tool calculates drainage density by dividing the length of the drainage line by the surrounding watershed area esri 2015 the blue patches on the resultant density map represent topographic lows that correspond to higher stream density and the light green patches are ridges within the catchment which are areas of lower density the red is the watershed boundary with lowest density 2 1 3 lineaments density lineaments are surficial expressions of underlying geology and structural features such as fractures or faults or joints o leary et al 1976 lineaments were extracted manually from aeromagnetic data bgi 2016 and automatically from landsat 8 oli images for july 2018 usgs 2016

shapefile shp in utm coordinates measured in kilometres the 1998 aeromagnetic data was obtained in ascii format from the botswana geoscience institute database the survey was conducted with two base stations one in gaborone at geographical coordinated 25 890 e 24 660 s and the other in francistown at geographical coordinates 27 53e 21 19s covering an area of 47 000 km2 from a total of 293 13 survey lines were produced at 10 samples per second and altitude of 80 m the data was imported enhanced and processed using geosoft s oasis montaj version the study area was co registered to geographic coordinate system wgs 84 the data were enhanced using analytic signal and first vertical derivative techniques to reveal linear structures the data were then exported to tiff format before importing into arcgis software for digitizing the linear structures derived from aeromagnetic data landsat 8 oli image and srtm dem were imported into arcgis software to create a lineament map which was later transformed into a lineament density map of fig 6 using the line density tool of spatial analyst toolbox 2 1 4 soil type the soil type map of the study area was constructed by merging five soil map sheets 1 250 000 of francistown letlhakane palapye serowe and tuli into fig 7 the legend of which was derived from fao 1988 in de wit and nachtergaele 1990 there are eight types of soils within the study area namely from west to east arenosols calcisols cambisols leptosols lixisols luvisols regosols and vertisols fao 1985 in that sequence with the west dominated by the coarser sandy soils while the finer clay soils are common in the east 2 1 5 soil thickness soil thicknesses data for the catchment area were downloaded in geotiff tiff format from oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive centre ornl daac website https daac ornl gov soils guides global soil regolith sediment html soil thickness data were derived from the best available topography climate and geology data to depict the average thickness of the permeable layers above bedrock by landform type for the geological present the data cover earth s surface between latitudes 60 degrees north and south and longitudes 180 in east and west soil thickness map of the motloutse watershed fig 8 was generated by extracting watershed extent from spatial analyst tool of the arcgis software the average soil thicknesses range from 37 to 50 m pelletier et al 2016 2 2 reclassifying individual parameters each of the six thematic layers mentioned in section 1 were reclassified then assigned a weight according to their relative influence on groundwater recharge using analytic hierarchical process ahp technique saaty 1977 brunnelli 2015 each layer was reclassified into high moderate and low from the most highest to the lowest recharge potential based on natural breaks in the data the weight is assigned to each map layer to represent relative importance of each parameter class vis à vis recharge hachem et al 2015 yeh et al 2016 arulbalaji et al 2019 2 2 1 aquifer lithology the reclassified lithology map fig 9 was produced based on groundwater occurrence and recharge as described in previous works of carney et al 1994 smec ehes 2006 wsb 2007 geology controls recharge through the nature of rocks at the outcrops and through topography slope and nature of soils simmers 1990 freeze and cherry 1979 lebung group and stormberg basalts aquifers were assigned high recharge potential because they are coarse grained outcropping at sections and fractured and more importantly they are top most layers of the stratigraphic sequences making them unconfined therefore directly recharged by precipitation the lower sections of the palapye group and the crystalline basement rocks were assigned moderate recharge values because of their silty nature and secondary porosity development from multiple tectonic activities respectively the mudstones of the lower karoo and mahalapye migmatites were assigned low recharge value because of the confined nature of the mudstones and low permeability character of the migmatites 2 2 2 slope an increase in slope results in a decrease in infiltration rate and thus a decrease in groundwater recharge simmers 1990 low slopes are characterised by high recharge potential as posited in fig 10 the reclassified slope map recharge is highly concentrated in areas where the difference in elevations is small hence low slopes therefore high recharge potential the high recharge areas are concentrated in the west where ground is relatively flat 2 2 3 lineament density lineaments are indicators of regional and local tectonic trends as well as acting as reservoirs and conduits for oil and natural gas groundwater and mineral deposits el sawy et al 2016 the reclassified lineament density map shown as fig 11 was produced based on the fact that geological structures like lineaments induce secondary porosity and permeability to rocks freeze and cherry 1979 maidment 1993 therefore areas with high lineament density have high potential of groundwater recharge 2 2 4 soil type the importance of soil type on groundwater recharge was based on infiltration capacity the soils were regrouped according to grain size and sand clay and silt content fao isric 2003 coarse grained soils have high infiltration capabilities and are assigned high recharge potential values fitzpatrick 1986 brady and weil 2014 the reclassified soil type map of fig 12 shows the high recharge areas are characterised by arenosols lixisols and leptosols because they are coarse grained and have high sand content and little to no clay de wit and nachtergaele 1990 regosols and vertisols have predominantly high clay and are therefore assigned low recharge potentiality 2 2 5 soil thickness the soil layer above the aquifer influences the amount of water to become recharge and discharge soil thickness determines the volume of infiltrate and the time that infiltrated water takes to get to the water table brady and weil 2014 freeze and cherry 1979 thin soils and bare rocks are prone to high volume runoff thus low infiltration for recharge usda 1972 the soil thickness map of fig 8 was reclassified by assigning high recharge potential to thicker soil layers as shown in fig 13 the reclassified soil thickness map of fig 13 reveals that high recharge zones are concentrated in the west 38 50 metres with few patches of thickest soil in the centre and east 2 2 6 drainage density areas with high drainage density capture excessive runoff and are given a higher weight in relation to recharge hachem et al 2015 for this reason areas with high drainage density were assigned high recharge potential as shown in fig 14 the red patches in fig 14 reveal high recharge potential zones while the green and yellow patches show moderate and low recharge potential sites respectively high recharge potential depicts high concentration of drainage channels 2 3 analytic hierarchy process analytic hierarchy process ahp is a logical and coordinated technique for structuring information alternatives on a hierarchical framework aided by mathematical pairwise comparisons ahp pairwise matrix method is suitable in cases of separating a large number of alternatives to a series of pair wise comparisons followed by synthesizing of results it is also used as a decision making tool in cases where there is lack of adequate and good quality data das et al 2018 souissi et al 2018 brunnelli 2015 saaty 2014 the use of ahp requires scientific knowledge coupled with proven evidence riad et al 2011 esri 2015 as well as evaluation of the matrix for consistency saaty 2014 yeh et al 2016 as a result the ahp has emerged as one of the most important research topics in the field of decision analysis across various disciplines e g facilities site selection such as in waste management and in landuse allocation kaya et al 2006 wang et al 2009 ardeshir et al 2010 sabbah et al 2018 2 group dynamics in psychology saaty 1980a b maletič et al 2016 3 real estate for picking preferred locations during house hunting mohd et al 2011 4 resource mapping in mineral exploration mansouri et al 2011 to mention but a few applications similarly ahp can be applied to groundwater recharge studies particularly for the selection of potential recharge zones from competing sets of parameters in order to delineate potential recharge zones within motloutse watershed ahp technique was implemented in four phases 1 selection of factors influencing groundwater recharge zones 2 pairwise comparison matrix 3 estimating relative weights and 4 assessing matrix consistency each phase is discussed as separately below 2 3 1 selection of factors influencing groundwater recharge zones the first phase in the ahp technique involves the selection of recharge influencing factors and their attributes selection of factors enables the researcher to decompose the problem into a pyramid structure comprising of objective influencing factors and various alternatives solutions to the problem boroushaki and malczewski 2008 brunnelli 2015 saaty 1980a b the main objective aim of research makes the apex followed by factor attributes while the base of the pyramid consists of alternative solutions the aim of this research is to delineate potential recharge zones within motloutse watershed factor attributes comprise of thematic layers of aquifer lithology soil type soil thickness drainage density lineament density and slope the reclassified layers of influencing factors show potential recharge zones based on each factor in our case the relative importance of a parameter on groundwater recharge was graded based on a nine point scale as shown in table 3 a score of 1 equal importance between the two factors and 9 extreme importance of row theme compared to the column factor saaty 1980a b 2 3 2 pairwise comparison matrix a pairwise comparison matrix a m m was constructed based on the number of input factors for delineation of recharge potential zones saaty 1980a b the inputs were reclassified maps of thematic layers discussed in section 2 2 each entry of the matrix represents the influence of the row factor relative to the column factor factor influences on each other based on saaty s one to nine point scale of table 3 geology plays a vital role in the occurrence and distribution of groundwater in any terrain freeze and cherry 1979 therefore selection and weighting of factors for the construction of pcm table 4 for delineating recharge zones was based on geology and processes affecting recharge in motloutse watershed dabrala et al 2014 lithology outcrop was selected the first parameter and recorded in row1 and column 1 of the matrix because water would recharge aquifers directly based on reasons used for reclassifying parameter recharge potentiality slope was selected the second most important parameter because it affects the destiny of the water that reaches the surface of the earth lineaments density was selected third because a high density of lineaments induces porosity and permeability soil type was selected forth in the hierarchy because it determines infiltration capacity and permeability while infiltration volumes depend on soil thickness drainage density depends on other parameters under investigation so it was allocated the lowest importance the selection parameter pair as well as the assignment of pair weight was based on the interrelationship between lithology and others affect recharge slope reflects differences in elevation from weathering of rocks bridge and demicco 2008 hence lithology slope pair were assigned 5 because lithology is essential for the development of slope lithology soil type pair was assigned 7 very strong importance and lithology soil type pair 8 the intermediary between very extreme importance and extremely because soil type is weathered material of lithology while soil thickness depends on geology and slope as well as erosion and deposition drainage network depicts extent and orientation of geological structures liu et al 2015 that may be influential to infiltration and eventually recharge to groundwater storage in the absence of aquifer outcrops water reaches the lineaments in places with concave slopes thick and well drained soils that is why lithology drainage density pair was assigned 9 the value of 1 was assigned to parameters of equal importance 2 3 3 estimating relative weights ahp employs the opinions from subject matter experts and the principle of eigenvector and eigenvalue to reduce noise in the data by eliminating features that have a strong correlation between them and also help in reducing over fitting dabrala et al 2014 expert opinion and eigenvector are used to assign factor weight while principal eigenvalue is used to rank the factors carver 1991 malczewski 2006 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 2 3 3 1 expert opinion the opinions of experts may be collected from separate individuals across the project area through interviews or from a gathering of experts during group decision making sessions through group decision making only one weight is unanimously assigned to specific factor the equivalence of the eigenvector column 8 in table 5 while separate individual respondents may assign various weights to one factor the conclusive factor weight from separate individual experts is deduced by computing the geometric mean of the indivudually assigned weights saaty 2014 bailey et al 2003 group decision making eliminates uncertainties such as spatial distribution of the experts across the area of study and the likelihood that some of the experts may not return the answers to the researcher malczewski 1999 for the purpose of archiving and quality assurance experts opinions are commonly collected in the form of questionnaires surveys questionnaire surveys fall in two main classes 1 descriptive fact finding and 2 analytic explanatory oppenheim 2000 in conducting a questionnaire survey respondents can be allocated a choice of alternative answers or be requested to provide their answers usually in writing jolliffe 1986 oppenheim 2000 expert opinion has been utilized to determine factor weights for making decisions that are influenced by socio economic factors such as site suitability mapping and hazard susceptibility mapping al anbari et al 2018 al shabeeb 2015 kaya et al 2006 expert opinion survey in the form of questionnaires has been utilized to assign factor weight to thematic layers of parameters that affect groundwater occurrences in order to produce groundwater potential maps for instance manap et al 2013 and saha 2017 to date there is no record of studies that used expert opinion to assign weight to parameter influencing the location of natural recharge zones expert opinion is required for implementation of projects that have the potential to modify the natural setup of the environment or society on which the project is carried out in our case we study recharge as a natural process where the end would not likely alter the environment or cause undesirable effects to the society therefore the use of expert opinion was deemed not necessary for this study as it had been the case in similar studies elsewhere arulbalaji et al 2019 das et al 2018 pinto et al 2017 machiwal et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2009 2 3 3 2 eigenvector the eigenvector is the ordering of parameter influence on recharge by assigning the weights saaty 2003 the eigenvector was computed to show relative weights of each the parameters towards recharge brunnelli 2015 the eigenvectors column 8 were calculated by first by dividing column values by the column sum in table 4 then averaging row values saaty 1980a b 2 3 3 3 principal eigenvalue ahp uses eigenvalues to rank the importance of parameter to recharge the sum of eigenvalues called principal eigenvalue λmax is a measure of matrix deviation from consistency brunnelli 2015 according to saaty 1980a b a pairwise comparison matrix is consistent only if the principal eigenvalue λmax is greater than or equal to the number of the parameters investigated n otherwise a new matrix is required the principal eigenvalue in the last row in table 6 was obtained from the summation of products column sums in the pairwise matrix table 4 and eigen vector table 5 the principal eigenvalue of 6 27 was achieved for a 6 6 matrix was achieved and paving way for the calculation of consistency index 2 3 4 assessing matrix consistency inconsistencies in pairwise comparisons increase with increasing number of comparisons saaty 1980a b therefore ahp incorporates consistency index for assessing the evaluations made when building each of the pairwise comparison matrices involved in the process the consistency index ci is the ratio of the difference between the principal eigen value λmax and the number of factors under investigation from the n to n 1 as follows c i λ m a x n n 1 therefore consistency index ci for recharge parameters investigated by this study is ci 6 27 6 6 1 0 05 the computation of ci was followed by the calculation of the consistency ratio cr a measure of consistency of pairwise comparison matrix cr is the ratio of consistency index to the ratio index ri the values of ri for different n values are given in table 7 ahp accepts cr values between zero and 0 1 or 10 anything greater than 10 calls for revision of comparisons consistency ratio ci ri 0 05 1 24 0 0427 4 27 10 cr is less than 10 hence it is acceptable and thus weighted overlay analysis was performed in arcgis software to integrate the weighted map layers and to map the spatial distribution of recharge zones 2 4 weighted overlay analysis weighted overlay analysis is a technique for applying a common scale of values to input factors to create an integrated analysis based on pairwise comparison matrix of ahp esri 2015 each input layer was reclassified to a common ratio scale of high moderate low recharge potential the reclassified factors were weighted to determine the relative importance of each to groundwater recharge using pairwise comparison matrix of ahp the weighting values were assessed for consistency before being integrated to produce a map of spatial distribution of recharge within motlouse catchment as illustrated in section 2 4 1 2 4 1 integration of thematic layers the reclassified layers of lithology slope lineament density soil type soil thickness and drainage density and their corresponding percentage influence on recharge were integrated to produce a map of spatial distribution of groundwater recharge within motloutse catchment using weighted overlay tool of arcgis 10 2 2 software weighted overlay analysis tool reclassifies values in the input raster layers into a common evaluation scale of 1 2 3 high moderate low respectively by multiplying the cell values of each factor class by the factor weight and sums the resulting cell values together to produce a map of potential recharge zones as shown by the following equation raviraj et al 2017 esri 2015 1 p g r z a l c a l w s l c s l w d d c

the products of factor percentage influence column 9 in table 5 and the corresponding reclassified map the map shows that high recharge is mainly concentrated in the red sections the yellow portions show low recharge potential while moderately recharged areas are in green the recharge map is divided into three classes high moderate and low recharge potential zones based on the weights assigned to each parameter earlier esri 2015 3 1 results validation the map of established wellfields was overlain on the map of groundwater recharge potential to validate the effectiveness of the ahp guided technique in locating potential groundwater recharge zones it has been observed that the high recharge zones correspond to established wellfields as in fig 16 these wellfields are hosted in the sandstone and basalts the sandstones are well known for their high yielding boreholes in the country and in the southern african region smec ehes 2006 in the west of the catchment high recharge zones coincide with two of the three recharge zones of the lebung aquifer previously identified using field work and groundwater modelling for the paje wellfield the two recharge zones were identified by sgab 1988 and wsb 2007 and are 1 the top of the escarpment and serwe pan with annual recharge rate of 6 5 mm year 2 a section with a recharge rate of 2 3 mm year where the lebung sandstone directly underlies the kalahari sediments pumping tests performed in the sandstone revealed transmissivity values between 7 and 350 m2 day recharge rates decrease in areas where the lebung sandstone is confined by the basalts and the kalahari sand cover in the east an average transmissivity values of 20 m2 day has been recorded for the lebung aquifers while 0 15 to 80 m2 day was recorded for the basalt aquifer smec ehes 2006 pre pumping static groundwater levels varies from 9 m to over 100 m across the catchment a cross section of six boreholes across the catchment depicting distribution of hydraulic head in relation to topography and geology in the various zones is presented in fig 16a c high hydraulic head defines areas where there is high infiltration vis a vis hydraulic loading this is consistent with largest recharge occurring in the west where groundwater heads are highest and reducing towards the middle part with moderate heads the zones are clearly controlled by the lithology and structure where high heads correspond to areas of fractured basalts and outcropping sandstones fig 16a the east is hydraulically not connected to the middle and west of the catchment being separated by a shear zone that causes a significant drop in heads and topography fig 16c indicating non continuity 4 discussions the integration of remotely sensed data and multiple criteria analysis ahp into a gis environment to map the spatial distribution of recharge within a motloutse catchment has been proven to be both feasible and economical the results indicated that recharge is controlled by many competing factors the potential zones for groundwater recharge were delineated by reclassifying weighting and ranking six recharge influencing parameters aquifer lithology slope lineament density drainage density soil thickness and soil texture in a gis environment using weighted overlay analysis guided by ahp technique the normalized matrix table 5 revealed that lithology is the most influential parameter accounting for 60 followed by slope at 22 while soil thickness and drainage density are the least influential at 3 6 and 3 1 respectively high recharge zones correspond to outcrops of the stormberg volcanics and lebung sandstone rocks both known for their high yielding boreholes throughout southern and east africa smec ehes 2006 rocks of the lebung group are coarse grained sandstone with high porosity and permeability while the stormberg lava group owe their porosity to intense fracturing and layering in places carney et al 1994 smec ehes 2006 in places where the lebung rocks and confined by stormberg volcanics the fractures in the basalt act as pathways for water to recharge to the sandstones underneath smec ehes 2006 it was for these reasons that the outcrops of stormberg lava group and lebung sandstone group were assigned high recharge potential in fig 9 slope is the change in topography showing lithologic resistance to weathering and erosion areas with low slopes show resistance to weathering and are characteristic of the basaltic rock outcrops soil thickness and drainage density are the least influential factors because thin soils absorb less water infiltrate may be returned to the atmosphere by root uptake and the rest of the water lost through runoff while high drainage density corresponds to low permeability thus low recharge hachem et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2009 fig 15 shows areas of high recharge potential are concentrated in the east and west and cover 8 by area of the motloutse catchment these high recharge areas are characterised by most permeable lithology low slopes high drainage density and thick soil layers with high infiltration capacity corresponding to reclassified thematic layers of high recharge potentials as shown in figs 9 14 respectively ahp is a logical scientific approach as well as consistency analysis tool for making quantifiable judgments for mapping spatial distribution of recharge within the motloutse catchment and has been used for similar studies in different climate settings our results are in agreement with those found in previous studies yeh et al 2016 chowdhury et al 2009 jhariya et al 2016 liu et al 2015 pinto et al 2017 riad et al 2011 rusli and majid 2012 5 conclusions increased availability of remotely sensed data has helped in studying the natural environment without direct contact and processing of data in a gis environment allows data to be stored updated retrieved and processed for other applications gis cannot rank or weight the influence of different factors to recharge and this limitation was overcome by incorporating ahp through ahp it was possible to derive ratio scales from both discrete and continuous paired comparisons of recharge influencing parameters this paper analysed the spatial distribution of recharge within the motloutse watershed by 1 developing thematic layers for lithology slope lineament density soil type soil thickness and drainage density from different data sources 2 reclassifying and 3 weighting and ranking these spatial data according to their relative importance and 4 integrating them to produce groundwater recharge distribution map using weighted overlay analysis guided by ahp technique weighted overlay analysis is flexible and a dependable decision making tool for groundwater recharge mapping as used in many other fields involving multiple and conflicting factors lithology and slope are most influential control factors of groundwater recharge in the motloutse watershed as revealed by the current study and validated by previous studies fig 15 will serve as the basis of information to land water and environmental authorities for groundwater development potential and protection

8374,changes in flood regimes in canada were examined using a large scale dataset of hydrometric stations from across the country significant trends were analysed in time series of both annual maximum amax and peaks over threshold pot series of streamflow data pot series were extracted from daily flows for each watershed using a semi automated threshold selection method since flood regimes are complex by nature a multi temporal and multifaceted approach was employed to identify and properly characterize the types of changes common time periods of the recent 30 40 50 and 60 years were studied trends were investigated both in terms of flood magnitude and frequency of these time series changes were examined using different groupings of sites based on dominant hydro climatic regions drainage area size and land use changes based on hydrometric reference stations trends were examined both at local and field scale notably significant trends were identified in the atlantic central prairie and northern regions additionally reference hydrometric basin network rhbn watersheds were found to have more statistically significant trends than the non rhbn sites new hydrological insights an increased number of threshold exceeding events was observed from this analysis flow magnitudes series showed more increasing trends in the most recent time windows while there are more decreasing trends in longer time periods different types of changes were observed for different hydro climatic regions keywords floods trend nonstationary peaks over threshold 1 introduction flood regimes are expected to change due to intensification of the hydrological cycle as a result of climate change milly et al 2002 numerous recent flood events around the world lead to growing concern that flood hazard is increasing with flood events becoming more frequent and severe changes in extreme environmental events have become a very active research area during the last decade many studies around the world have focused on the concept of time dependence or nonstationarity of extreme events to explore the changes and provide evidence of statistically significant trends in extreme flow series petrow and merz 2009 o brien and burn 2014 mallakpour and villarini 2015 tan and gan 2015 burn et al 2016 hodgkins et al 2017 do et al 2017 burn and whitfield 2018 mangini et al 2018 according to koutsoyiannis 2006 a hydrologic time series is usually regarded as nonstationary if the time series has trends or shifts in its mean or variance the source of nonstationarity in hydrological records can be a natural catastrophe or periodicity forest fires el niño and or solar activities anthropogenic activity land use changes due to deforestation or urbanization or changing climate cunderlik and burn 2003 as climate change progresses and anthropogenic changes become more prominent time dependence in peak flow records may become increasingly common accounting for these temporal changes is important for many hydrological applications such as design and risk assessment of critical infrastructure burn et al 2010 rosner et al 2014 temporal trends in canadian streamflows have been examined in several studies focusing either on a specific region or watershed in canada or studying trends across the country a summary of some of the research exploring trends in canadian streamflow follows burn et al 2004 conducted a study of the trends of several hydrological variables within the liard river basin in northern canada for the time period 1960 1999 among the variables under study summer flows indicated a weak decreasing trend and a weaker decreasing trend was observed in the annual flows st george 2007 detected statistically significant increasing trends in the streamflows along the winnipeg river as did whitfield 2001 in the northern part of british columbia for the period 1952 2003 burn et al 2008 performed trend analyses on streamflow data for a collection of stations on the canadian prairies for the period 1966 2005 results of the analysis were decreasing trends in the spring flow volume and peak flow earlier occurrence of spring freshet peak date and decreasing trends in seasonal runoff volume a total of 68 stations in canada representing diverse hydrological conditions were studied by burn et al 2010 for detecting trends in extreme hydrological events for the period 1957 2006 it was concluded that peak annual flows are generally becoming smaller and earlier zhang et al 2001 reported trends for 11 hydrometric variables for canadian catchments and generally observed decreasing trends in streamflows for the period 1947 1996 burn and hag elnur 2002 and whitfield and cannon 2000 observed major regional differences and variability of streamflow trends across canada with both increases and decreases in precipitation and streamflow for the periods 1946 1999 and 1976 1995 respectively burn and whitfield 2016 examined changes in the flood regime for watersheds across canada for the period 1961 2010 they concluded that reference hydrometric watersheds catchments with pristine conditions and good quality data exhibit decreasing trends in flood magnitude while non reference hydrometric watersheds displayed increasing trends tan and gan 2015 found evidence of trends in annual maximum flow series from 145 stations across canada for the period of 1896 2013 burn and whitfield 2018 reported changes in flood regimes and shifts in dominant flood generation process in hydrometric reference stations with centennial length data in canada and northern united states for the period 1916 2015 they used peaks over threshold pot data to explore changes to the magnitude timing volume and duration of threshold exceedances reviewing the literature on trend detection highlights the complexity of flood regimes and the associated requirement for a multifaceted approach to understand the types of observed changes and their likeliness of occurrence in the future burn and whitefield 2017 one of the main methodological concerns when performing trend analyses is the definition of the flood variable mangini et al 2018 two types of flood series are used for trend analysis the annual maximum flood amax series as most commonly used in the literature and the pot approach even though amax series have been widely used this series is unable to represent the complexity in the flood regime burn and whitfield 2017 the amax series uses only the largest flow in each year this may exclude large floods if several of them occurred in a single year and could therefore result in a loss of flood related information bačová mitková and onderka 2010 in addition some very low discharges that are still the maximum value in the year might be included in the amax series bezak et al 2014 the advantages and disadvantages of using each type of series have been discussed in previous studies madsen and rosbjerg 1997 mostofi zadeh et al 2019 employing pot series allows detection of trends in both the magnitude of flood events exceeding the threshold and also the number of exceedances per year there have not been many studies investigating trends in pot series these studies are either performed at a regional scale robson 2002 petrow and merez 2009 and vormoor et al 2016 in europe or at a large scale but with a low spatial resolution database mediero et al 2015 in europe burn and whitfield 2017 and 2018 in canada investigating flood trends using both amax and pot series in a large scale high spatial resolution dataset has been done in europe mangini et al 2018 but to the best of the authors knowledge has not previously been done in canada additionally this paper assessed trends in canadian terrestrial ecozones which has not been carried out with a high spatial resolution dataset in canada the focus of this paper was to detect evidence of statistically significant flood trends for a large number of hydrometric stations across canada using both amax and pot approaches for the latter an automated threshold selection method was adopted that facilitates extracting pot series for a large dataset this research aims to detect trends in flood magnitude and frequency across canada with a multi temporal process for the record lengths of 30 to 60 years trend signals from different hydro climatic regions and catchments with different characteristics were also investigated to better understand the behavior of changes in flood series 2 methodology 2 1 flood series daily amax and daily average pot approaches were used in this study to compile flood series although the drawbacks of amax data have been previously outlined in section 1 it is a widely used flood variable and serves as a means of comparison with previous studies the pot model avoids amax drawbacks by considering flood peaks above a certain threshold level and allows capturing more information regarding the flood phenomena in comparison with amax lang et al 1999 choosing an appropriate threshold level and assuring the independence of the data series are difficulties in using the pot method bezak et al 2014 lang et al 1999 identified these difficulties as a reason that the pot model remains relatively unpopular and underemployed in practice solari and losada 2012 noted the lack of standardized methodology for threshold selection and the difficulty in automating the process as further complications of employing the pot methodology durocher et al 2018 developed a semi automated process to identify thresholds their proposed approach is particularly useful for extracting pot series for large datasets of stations the developed approach is briefly described here it is assumed that peaks above an appropriately selected threshold will follow a generalized pareto distribution with constant shape parameter also known as threshold stability for a large range of candidate threshold values the p value of the anderson darling goodness of fit test was evaluated the first threshold corresponding to a p value greater than 0 25 critical p value was considered as the first candidate that ensures that the generalized pareto distribution is a reasonable choice in some cases it was concluded that this threshold was too low thus resulting in threshold instability durocher et al 2018 proposed a second candidate threshold associated with a fixed exceedance rate the second candidate however could lead to the generalized pareto distribution as an inappropriate choice moreover this candidate often resulted in less accurate flood quantile estimates and was generally higher than the first candidate a hybrid threshold selection method was designed to choose between these two candidates the basis for the selection was the relative difference between the flood quantile estimate of the first candidate and the estimate from a threshold associated with an exceedance rate of one event per year if this difference was determined to be small less than 15 then the first candidate was selected otherwise the higher threshold was chosen mostofi zadeh et al 2019 applied this hybrid process on a large dataset to extract pot series for canadian catchments while bounding the average number of peaks per year between 1 and 5 for stations having mostly nival flood regimes the upper bound of 2 5 ppy was considered in this study the same pot dataset was examined for trend analysis in the magnitude of peaks over threshold and the number of events per year frequency the interested reader can refer to the two abovementioned studies for further details 2 2 test for statistical significance changes in hydrological time series can be evaluated using parametric or nonparametric approaches trend evaluation of hydrometric data is commonly carried out using the nonparametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 and was applied in this study to detect monotonic trends in flood magnitudes significant serial correlation in a data series can impair the robustness of trend detection wang et al 2015 given the assumption of serial independence of data by the mann kendall test önöz and bayazit 2012 the block bootstrap bbs approach önöz and bayazit 2012 is employed to mitigate this effect in the bbs approach data are resampled in blocks a large number of times to estimate the significance of the observed mann kendall test statistic from the data sample while reflecting the serial correlation present in the data set burn et al 2016 as discussed by önöz and bayazit 2012 if data are serially dependent bootstrapping is performed in blocks so that the autocorrelation in the data is replicated the block length should be chosen so that data points one block apart are approximately independent the block size depends upon the number of contiguous significant serial correlations khaliq et al 2009 khaliq et al 2009 provide a detailed description of the steps involved in implementing the bbs approach the mann kendall test is not recommended to detect trends in number of events frequency in the pot series since numerous tied values may exist and introduce difficulties in the rank correlation procedure frei and schär 2001 for this purpose the logistic regression test will be employed please refer to frei and schär 2001 for more details on logistic regression 2 3 field significance when significant trends are detected at a local scale it is necessary to assess their field significance and examine if similar results are also observed at neighbouring sites burn and hag elnur 2002 svensson et al 2006 petrow and merz 2009 burn and whitefield 2017 and 2018 in field significance analysis the objective is to assess whether the number of sites with significant local trend can be regarded as significant at a regional field scale and not by chance alone for all trend analyses a group block bootstrapping approach gbbs is employed whereby increasing and decreasing trends are assessed separately the algorithm operates by initially applying vector resampling in blocks to preserve the correlation structure of the data therefore preserving the cross correlation in the original data but neglecting temporal order burn and hag elnur 2002 renard et al 2008 burn et al 2016 this process continues until the desired record lengths are attained for all the included hydrometric datasets for each resampled streamflow record trend is assessed using the hamed and rao 1998 variance correction technique which accounts for the effects of serial correlation on the variance of the mann kendall test statistic through the use of an effective sample size by considering all significant lags of autocorrelation using the developed empirical distribution of identified trends the yue et al 2003 methodology is used to determine significance 3 data 3 1 peak flow dataset daily flow data are available for hydrometric stations across canada from the water survey of canada s hydat database provided by environment and climate change canada historical hydrometric data website https wateroffice ec gc ca mainmenu historical data index e html the initial dataset analyzed in this study consists of 894 gauging stations with unregulated flows this provides a high spatial resolution dataset with good spatial coverage of the country fig 1 shows the location of these hydrometric stations across canada following mostofi zadeh et al 2019 amax and pot series were extracted from the daily flow series available for each station fig 1 also illustrates the spatial pattern of the average number of peaks per year ppy for pot series of each site stations with pluvial hydrologic regimes that experience more rainfall based events have larger ppy and are mostly located on the east and west coasts of canada as well as some in southern ontario stations located in other parts of the country with nival primarily floods as snowmelt events or mixed hydrologic regime experience a lower number of peaks per year nival stations were identified with average ppy of less than 2 5 gauging stations have different periods of record and may contain gaps in the recorded time series fig 2 depicts the number of stations within our initial dataset with records available in each year for the period of 1900 2018 fig 2 illustrates that the number of stations having data available markedly increases starting in 1960 and this number drops after 2010 with most stations having hydrometric records from 1980 to 1990 the data availability and reliability of information contained is one of the main concerns in trend analysis petrow and merz 2009 a balance must be achieved between long flow series which will generally provide poor spatial coverage better spatial coverage may be attained with time series that are short in comparison to the duration of long term cycles related to climatic indices to address this trade off a multi temporal approach was implemented by changing the start year for trend analysis using 10 year increments four common periods of 30 40 50 and 60 years reflecting short to long data records were selected for trend analysis whereby all common time periods end in 2016 it can be seen from fig 2 that the four time windows employed take advantage of the largest amount of available data as the length of time window increases less data are available for trend analysis time series with more than 5 of the calendar year or more than five consecutive years of missing values were excluded from the dataset this resulted in 482 391 259 and 103 stations to be included in 30 40 50 and 60 year time windows respectively which are presented in figs 4 6 in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the obtained amax and pot datasets will help in identifying large scale spatial patterns of trends detected in different time periods 3 2 hydro climatic regions since flood regimes are complex by nature it is essential to employ various grouping techniques to properly understand the types of changes in the time series this study aims to determine the patterns of detected significant trends within large scale hydro climatic regions in canada the ecological stratification working group 1995 identified 15 terrestrial ecozones in canada representing large and generalized climatic geologic and physiographic characteristics engineering judgment was employed to create a modified aggregated version of the ecozones based on major similarities in climatic and physiographic characteristics of the ecozones such as climate vegetation landforms modification from the original ecozones include the combination of three arctic ecozones and three other northern latitude ecozones into one the addition of newfoundland boreal to atlantic maritime ecozone the combination of boreal plains with prairies ecozone and the combination of boreal and montane cordillera into one ecozone this aggregation resulted in six major regions northern atlantic central prairies mountains and pacific these regions reflect different hydro climatic regions across the country and are shown in fig 3 the characterization of the six hydro climatic regions is presented in fig 3 for more detail please refer to ecological stratification working group 1995 the northern region occupies the northern part of canada climate in this vast region is very cold and dry while it is somewhat milder and more humid in the southern portions of the region because of harsh climate and shallow soil cover the vegetation is sparse the atlantic region is marked by cool summers and short cold to moderately cold winters with high precipitation range because of the proximity to the atlantic ocean forests grow well in this area mean annual precipitation varies from 900 mm inland to over 1500 mm near the coast the central region has long cold winters and warm summers but is modified by maritime conditions in its coastal margins in atlantic canada this region is mostly forested the prairies region is known for long cold winters and short hot to warm summers the prairies region is characterized by relatively little topographic relief and limited forests mean annual precipitation has extreme variability in this region the mountains region is characterized by mountain ranges that contain numerous high peaks that are separated by wide valleys and lowlands this region has ranges of cold subhumid to semiarid climate it is marked by long cold winters and short warm summers mean annual precipitation is lowest in valleys within the rain shadow of the coastal ranges and increases in the interior ranges the pacific region has the warmest and wettest climate conditions in canada climate ranges from a relatively mild humid maritime at low elevations to cool and very humid at higher elevations 3 3 catchment characteristics the relationship between catchment characteristics and significant trends detected in the flood series were also explored in this study two types of characteristics were considered temporal trends in peak flows were calculated separately for three ranges of catchment drainage area sizes stations were classified based on watershed area small 200 km2 medium between 200 and 2000 km2 or large 2000 km2 trend signals from catchments with pristine and non pristine conditions were also studied stations with pristine conditions over time were obtained from the canadian reference hydrometric basin network rhbn brimley et al 1999 these reference sites are known to have good quality data and do not experience the influence of regulation diversions or land use changes burn and whitefield 2017 these stations were specifically identified to assist in the study of the impact of climate change 4 results 4 1 trend in annual maximum series the results of trend analyses in amax flood series data for periods of 30 to 60 years are depicted in fig 4 the top section of table 1 summarizes the number and percentage of sites with significant trend 5 local significance level in their amax series with results provided separately for increasing versus decreasing trend field significance evaluated at the 5 significance level is also indicated in table 1 in the shorter time periods 30 and 40 year there were more increasing than decreasing trends in the amax series however the longer periods of record identified more decreasing than increasing trends predominantly increasing trends in the 30 and 40 year periods of record indicated the possible existence of a common driver of changes in extreme events in recent years it is noteworthy that the amax series did not show trends that are field significant at the 5 level for any time period considered 4 2 trends in peaks over threshold series the results of the multi temporal trend analysis of the pot magnitude series are presented in fig 5 table 1 describes the number and percentage of sites with significant positive and negative trends in magnitudes of their pot series detected at the 5 significance level similar results were found for the magnitude of pot event as those for the amax events that being that the shorter time periods 30 and 40 year were much more likely to display increasing trends again the longer time periods 50 to 60 year showed predominantly decreasing trends since extraction of pot series provided more flood information compared to amax series more reliable conclusions could be drawn from these series by parallel comparison of these two series in each temporal period one could conclude that fewer stations in pot series have significant increasing trend while more stations exhibit decreasing trend it is again important to note that none of the trends in pot magnitude were found to be field significant the results of multi temporal trend analysis of the pot number of events frequency series are presented in fig 6 table 1 summarizes the number and percentage of sites with significant positive and negative trends in the number of events for pot series detected at the 5 significance level an increase in the frequency of above threshold events is clearly identified in table 1 the results of the 40 50 and 60 year time periods were field significant indicating that they did not occur by chance alone in the 40 and 50 year periods there was little spatial pattern relating the increasing trends however in the 60 year period the increasing trends were located in the central region and atlantic maritime region terrestrial ecozones the decreasing trends were located in the mountain and prairie regions comparison of frequency and magnitudes of pot series in table 1 reveals that a greater percentage of significant increasing trends existed in frequency time series for all temporal periods 4 3 trends in different hydro climatic regions the overall trend results for stations within the six defined hydro climatic regions are summarized in table 2 for each hydro climatic region in a fixed period of time the frequency of events generally had the highest percentage of increasing trends in the 30 year time window stations in the prairies region exhibited the largest percentage of increasing trends in the magnitude time series both amax and pot in comparison with other hydro climatic regions stations in the atlantic region displayed the largest percentage 16 1 of stations of increasing trend in the pot frequencies detected trends for these three groups were determined to be field significant stations in the northern region followed by the atlantic region displayed the greatest percentage of identified stations with significant trend in the 40 year time period however only those for the northern region were found to be field significant decreasing trends in the northern region s pot magnitude series and increasing trends in pot frequency series within the 40 year period were identified as field significant decreasing trends in the northern region may be the result of decreases in snowpack park et al 2013 resulting in less pronounced freshet events in these nival dominated watersheds increases in the frequency of above threshold events in the 40 and 50 year periods of record may indicate a transition from a nival to pluvio nival regime increasing trends in the magnitude of events in the more recent 30 year time period in the prairie region indicate that these nival dominated watersheds are experiencing more pronounced spring freshet events lastly the increase in the frequency of events in the atlantic region are the likely result of more frequent intense precipitation events in the 50 year time window the northern region exhibited the largest percentage of decreasing trends in amax and the largest percentage of increasing trends in the frequency of events however this result is based on a single site this trend reversal from the 40 to 50 year time period is not unusual given that the 50 year period is less indicative of recent change field significant increasing trends in the frequency of pot events were identified in the 50 and 60 year time periods for the central region which were not identified in the more recent 30 and 40 year periods there is therefore evidence to suggest that the frequency of recent peak events is higher than in the past however the ppy has stabilized more recently statistically field significant increasing trends were identified in the pot frequency data for the atlantic region for the 30 and 60 year periods which demonstrates that the ppy in the area have increased in the long and short term field significant trends in the 60 year period for the central region were identified in the magnitude of pot events decreasing and frequency of these events increasing significant trends were not identified in the more recent central region time periods again suggesting that these events were indeed higher in recent years but these larger events have stabilized the central and pacific regions had field significant decreasing trends in the magnitude of pot events similar trends were not observed in the shorter periods of record suggesting that the magnitude of peak event was higher in more recent years lastly field significant decreasing trends in the frequency of threshold exceedances were identified in the 60 year time period for the prairies region again these results were not present in the shorter time periods revealing that the region likely experienced less ppy than in the past but the frequency of events has more recently stabilized 4 4 variations in trends with catchment characteristics table 3 presents the trend results for amax and pot magnitudes and frequencies series based on identified rhbn and non rhbn sites in a multi temporal pattern rhbn sites exhibited both increasing and decreasing significant trends with a larger percentage of sites exhibiting increasing trends in the most recent time window field significant increasing trends were identified in the rhbn sites in both the amax and pot 30 year time period due to the stable land use in the rhbn these results are indicative of climate driven changes which is resulting in increased magnitude of peak events other notable increasing field significant trends were identified in the frequency of pots of non rhbn sites this is could be the result of land use changes that alter the hydrologic regime this result was not identified in the more recent 30 year time period indicating land use change may have stabilized in recent years an alternative explanation could be due to the confounding effects of climate change and land use changes ultimately resulting in no identifiable trend signals table 4 provides the trend results for studied time series based on catchment size classification for the 60 year time window decreasing trends in amax and pot magnitudes were exclusively observed with medium sized watersheds with trends in pot magnitudes being field significant for the 60 year period frequency time series increasing trends were the only detected trends in small and medium sized drainage areas with the latter being field significant no noteworthy patterns are observed from this classification the general lack of patterns in trend results as a function of watershed size implies that the trends are not greatly affected by different flood generating processes suggesting that the observed changes are mostly climate driven 5 discussion the trend results presented in this paper illustrate the advantages of using pot series rather than or in addition to amax series for providing a better understanding of the nature of changes in flood events the use of pot dataset allows for the examination of the frequency of flood events along with traditional flood magnitude measures floods are by nature complex especially in a large geographic area such as canada with several different flood generating processes thus pot datasets are required to properly assess the possible changes in floods over time changes were observed in the trend signals from a given station and for a given flood series in different time periods therefore it is important to employ a multi temporal approach to be able to capture all relevant trend behaviour for the catchment under study through the use of flood variables derived from a pot dataset it was demonstrated that a large percentage of increasing trends in the number of events were identified however those found for the 30 year time period were not field significant the trend results based on the multi temporal period of record indicated generally more increasing trends rather than decreasing trends in flood frequencies the multi temporal trend analysis revealed that a larger number of increasing trends were generally detected in shorter time periods in all three types of flood series i e amax magnitude pot magnitude and pot frequency positive trend signal weakens and negative trend signal gets stronger as the length of the time period increases the longest time series of amax and pot magnitudes only exhibited decreasing trends but these trends are not field significant differences were observed in the results when catchments were classified by the hydro climatic regions the atlantic region was found to have significant increasing trends in the frequency of events over various time periods but no significant changes in the magnitude of events were found there is evidence to suggest that the central region has experienced an increase in the frequency events over a longer time period but this trend is not found in shorter time periods the prairie region has seen increases in the magnitude of events in recent years and an overall decrease in peak events within the 60 year period of record there is evidence to suggest that the northern region has experienced decreasing trends in the magnitude of peak events however increasing trends in the frequency of these events are noted there is little evidence of trends in the mountain and pacific regions although the pacific region did see a decrease in the magnitude of pot events in the 60 year time period changes were also observed depending on whether or not a station is part of the reference hydrometric network rhbn site the contrast between rhbn and non rhbn stations is particularly noticeable for the 30 year time window rhbn stations generally have proportionally more significant increasing trends detected and more of these results are field significant when catchments were classified based on watershed size no noteworthy patterns in the trend results were observed comparing results from a diverse collection of trend studies is a challenge due to different study locations and flood variables that are investigated however these comparisons are valuable and will nonetheless be carried out the results of the amax trends in recent years are not in agreeance with burn et al 2004 however the results of the two studies are more aligned in the 50 year time period the discrepancy in the two assessments could be due to the shorter period of record available to burn et al 2004 which ended in the late 1990s the results of the amax analysis in the more recent 30 year time period for the mountain and central regions were consistent with the results of st george 2007 however there is a significant discrepancy in the period of record and methodology whereby st george 2007 used a period of record from 1924 to 2003 and used trend free prewhitening for trend detection yue et al 2002 a technique that was later shown to produce high type i error rates önöz and bayazit 2012 whitfield 2001 found decreasing trends in discharge in the fall and winter for the 1976 1995 time period which is in agreement with the results of the present study for the longer periods of record the results of burn et al 2010 and zhang et al 2001 are in agreeance with the results herein for amax series for the longer periods of record 50 and 60 year lengths whereby all studies detected decreasing trends burn et al 2010 employed a period of record from 1957 to 2006 while zhang et al 2001 studied the 1947 1996 time period although these studies used a less recent period of record decreasing trends are nonetheless detected burn and whitfield 2016 identified increasing and decreasing trends in amax time series of rhbn watersheds the present study is in agreement which has found that rhbn sites are more likely to have field significant increasing trends gan and tan 2015 concluded that non pristine drainage basins non rhbn or those that have experienced significant land use changes were likely to show more temporal trends in amax data than pristine basins a direct comparison between those results and those presented herein is a challenge due to differences in methodology without the consideration of field significance the results in the present paper and those of tan and gan 2015 are similar however after the consideration of field significance herein significant trends are only found in the rhbn sites for the amax and pot 30 year series comparison of the results from this research revealed agreements with some of the conclusions from other earlier research examining flood changes previous work e g petrow and merz 2009 burn et al 2010 mediero et al 2015 vormoor et al 2016 burn and whitfield 2018 reported both increases and decreases for flood magnitude measures studies that have examined pot data generally reported an increase in the frequency of peak over threshold events petrow and merx 2009 mediero et al 2015 vormoor et al 2016 burn and whitfield 2018 these outcomes are consistent with the analysis presented in this paper the temporal patterns in flood variables identified herein have been observed in other studies as well mediero et al 2015 grouped european hydrometric stations into five geographic regions and studied trends in a multi temporal approach the period of record tested was within the 1900 1999 period where the trends in pot magnitude were predominantly decreasing the authors provided a trend analysis of the frequency of pot events that also results in predominantly decreasing trends the present study found more decreasing trend than increasing in the pot magnitude data for 50 and 60 year periods of record however the trends in frequency were predominantly all increasing for all included time periods this difference in trend direction is likely a result of the more recent data included herein merz et al 2016 examined the temporal clustering of flood occurrences peaks over threshold and identified flood rich and flood poor periods for catchments in germany the authors found that less temporal clustering was observed with increasing threshold and time scale in comparison to significant temporal clustering noticed for low thresholds and time scales burn and whitfield 2018 conducted a multi temporal analysis on centennial length streamflow and examined the trends that would be inferred if only shorter records were available they reported that analysing trends in different time periods resulted in identifying sites for which both significant increasing and decreasing trends were observed they identified this non constant behaviour of flood variables as an indicator of the existence of flood rich and flood poor periods similar results were found herein whereby trend reversal in the varying periods of record signify inflection points in the data more increasing trends were identified in the shorter periods of record 30 and 40 year whereas more decreasing trends were found in the longer periods of record this indicates that the longer periods include time with more flood rich periods where peak events were at their lowest 30 40 years ago 6 conclusions flood changes in a large and spatially diverse dataset of hydrometric stations distributed across canada were examined using both amax and pot series the results from the multi temporal approach conducted in this research reveal the importance of the selected time period of flow series for implementing trend and change analysis the trends in flood variables point to increases in frequency of flood events and increasing trends in flood magnitude for the most recent time periods while more decreasing trends are observed in longer time periods for flood magnitudes the present paper identified significant increasing trends in flood magnitude variables for the recent time periods 30 and 40 years as well as decreasing trends for longer time periods 60 year the observed increasing trends in flood variables in more recent years along with the decreasing trends in longer periods of record indicate that flood magnitudes were larger in the past and were at a low point between 30 and 40 years ago it additionally suggests that peak events were highest between 50 and 60 year ago but there is evidence that trends in magnitude are increasing these changes that are occurring in flood events in canada in recent years may be expected to persist into the future as a result of the impacts of land use or climate changes the results of this analysis allow the reader to garner an understanding of the different processes that affect flooding i e land use changes or climate change through the analysis of rhbn and non rhbn analyses furthermore trend patterns found in different hydro climatic regions highlight changes in areas with different flood generating mechanisms differences were noted from the trend study of rhbn hydrometric stations for which the impact of land use changes are minimal and other catchments rhbn sites exhibited more changes than non rhbn sites in flood variables for both the shortest and longest time periods this emphasizes the importance of climate change effects on flood variables strong patterns in trend signals were not observed when the catchments were classified by size notably significant trends were found in the atlantic central prairie and northern terrestrial ecozones thus potentially indicating historic and more recent changes to the hydrologic regime in these areas the observed changes in flood magnitude and frequency in canadian catchments and the complexity of these changes stresses that a comprehensive understanding of these changes is necessary this is particularly of concern when performing flood frequency analysis for flood protection

8374,changes in flood regimes in canada were examined using a large scale dataset of hydrometric stations from across the country significant trends were analysed in time series of both annual maximum amax and peaks over threshold pot series of streamflow data pot series were extracted from daily flows for each watershed using a semi automated threshold selection method since flood regimes are complex by nature a multi temporal and multifaceted approach was employed to identify and properly characterize the types of changes common time periods of the recent 30 40 50 and 60 years were studied trends were investigated both in terms of flood magnitude and frequency of these time series changes were examined using different groupings of sites based on dominant hydro climatic regions drainage area size and land use changes based on hydrometric reference stations trends were examined both at local and field scale notably significant trends were identified in the atlantic central prairie and northern regions additionally reference hydrometric basin network rhbn watersheds were found to have more statistically significant trends than the non rhbn sites new hydrological insights an increased number of threshold exceeding events was observed from this analysis flow magnitudes series showed more increasing trends in the most recent time windows while there are more decreasing trends in longer time periods different types of changes were observed for different hydro climatic regions keywords floods trend nonstationary peaks over threshold 1 introduction flood regimes are expected to change due to intensification of the hydrological cycle as a result of climate change milly et al 2002 numerous recent flood events around the world lead to growing concern that flood hazard is increasing with flood events becoming more frequent and severe changes in extreme environmental events have become a very active research area during the last decade many studies around the world have focused on the concept of time dependence or nonstationarity of extreme events to explore the changes and provide evidence of statistically significant trends in extreme flow series petrow and merz 2009 o brien and burn 2014 mallakpour and villarini 2015 tan and gan 2015 burn et al 2016 hodgkins et al 2017 do et al 2017 burn and whitfield 2018 mangini et al 2018 according to koutsoyiannis 2006 a hydrologic time series is usually regarded as nonstationary if the time series has trends or shifts in its mean or variance the source of nonstationarity in hydrological records can be a natural catastrophe or periodicity forest fires el niño and or solar activities anthropogenic activity land use changes due to deforestation or urbanization or changing climate cunderlik and burn 2003 as climate change progresses and anthropogenic changes become more prominent time dependence in peak flow records may become increasingly common accounting for these temporal changes is important for many hydrological applications such as design and risk assessment of critical infrastructure burn et al 2010 rosner et al 2014 temporal trends in canadian streamflows have been examined in several studies focusing either on a specific region or watershed in canada or studying trends across the country a summary of some of the research exploring trends in canadian streamflow follows burn et al 2004 conducted a study of the trends of several hydrological variables within the liard river basin in northern canada for the time period 1960 1999 among the variables under study summer flows indicated a weak decreasing trend and a weaker decreasing trend was observed in the annual flows st george 2007 detected statistically significant increasing trends in the streamflows along the winnipeg river as did whitfield 2001 in the northern part of british columbia for the period 1952 2003 burn et al 2008 performed trend analyses on streamflow data for a collection of stations on the canadian prairies for the period 1966 2005 results of the analysis were decreasing trends in the spring flow volume and peak flow earlier occurrence of spring freshet peak date and decreasing trends in seasonal runoff volume a total of 68 stations in canada representing diverse hydrological conditions were studied by burn et al 2010 for detecting trends in extreme hydrological events for the period 1957 2006 it was concluded that peak annual flows are generally becoming smaller and earlier zhang et al 2001 reported trends for 11 hydrometric variables for canadian catchments and generally observed decreasing trends in streamflows for the period 1947 1996 burn and hag elnur 2002 and whitfield and cannon 2000 observed major regional differences and variability of streamflow trends across canada with both increases and decreases in precipitation and streamflow for the periods 1946 1999 and 1976 1995 respectively burn and whitfield 2016 examined changes in the flood regime for watersheds across canada for the period 1961 2010 they concluded that reference hydrometric watersheds catchments with pristine conditions and good quality data exhibit decreasing trends in flood magnitude while non reference hydrometric watersheds displayed increasing trends tan and gan 2015 found evidence of trends in annual maximum flow series from 145 stations across canada for the period of 1896 2013 burn and whitfield 2018 reported changes in flood regimes and shifts in dominant flood generation process in hydrometric reference stations with centennial length data in canada and northern united states for the period 1916 2015 they used peaks over threshold pot data to explore changes to the magnitude timing volume and duration of threshold exceedances reviewing the literature on trend detection highlights the complexity of flood regimes and the associated requirement for a multifaceted approach to understand the types of observed changes and their likeliness of occurrence in the future burn and whitefield 2017 one of the main methodological concerns when performing trend analyses is the definition of the flood variable mangini et al 2018 two types of flood series are used for trend analysis the annual maximum flood amax series as most commonly used in the literature and the pot approach even though amax series have been widely used this series is unable to represent the complexity in the flood regime burn and whitfield 2017 the amax series uses only the largest flow in each year this may exclude large floods if several of them occurred in a single year and could therefore result in a loss of flood related information bačová mitková and onderka 2010 in addition some very low discharges that are still the maximum value in the year might be included in the amax series bezak et al 2014 the advantages and disadvantages of using each type of series have been discussed in previous studies madsen and rosbjerg 1997 mostofi zadeh et al 2019 employing pot series allows detection of trends in both the magnitude of flood events exceeding the threshold and also the number of exceedances per year there have not been many studies investigating trends in pot series these studies are either performed at a regional scale robson 2002 petrow and merez 2009 and vormoor et al 2016 in europe or at a large scale but with a low spatial resolution database mediero et al 2015 in europe burn and whitfield 2017 and 2018 in canada investigating flood trends using both amax and pot series in a large scale high spatial resolution dataset has been done in europe mangini et al 2018 but to the best of the authors knowledge has not previously been done in canada additionally this paper assessed trends in canadian terrestrial ecozones which has not been carried out with a high spatial resolution dataset in canada the focus of this paper was to detect evidence of statistically significant flood trends for a large number of hydrometric stations across canada using both amax and pot approaches for the latter an automated threshold selection method was adopted that facilitates extracting pot series for a large dataset this research aims to detect trends in flood magnitude and frequency across canada with a multi temporal process for the record lengths of 30 to 60 years trend signals from different hydro climatic regions and catchments with different characteristics were also investigated to better understand the behavior of changes in flood series 2 methodology 2 1 flood series daily amax and daily average pot approaches were used in this study to compile flood series although the drawbacks of amax data have been previously outlined in section 1 it is a widely used flood variable and serves as a means of comparison with previous studies the pot model avoids amax drawbacks by considering flood peaks above a certain threshold level and allows capturing more information regarding the flood phenomena in comparison with amax lang et al 1999 choosing an appropriate threshold level and assuring the independence of the data series are difficulties in using the pot method bezak et al 2014 lang et al 1999 identified these difficulties as a reason that the pot model remains relatively unpopular and underemployed in practice solari and losada 2012 noted the lack of standardized methodology for threshold selection and the difficulty in automating the process as further complications of employing the pot methodology durocher et al 2018 developed a semi automated process to identify thresholds their proposed approach is particularly useful for extracting pot series for large datasets of stations the developed approach is briefly described here it is assumed that peaks above an appropriately selected threshold will follow a generalized pareto distribution with constant shape parameter also known as threshold stability for a large range of candidate threshold values the p value of the anderson darling goodness of fit test was evaluated the first threshold corresponding to a p value greater than 0 25 critical p value was considered as the first candidate that ensures that the generalized pareto distribution is a reasonable choice in some cases it was concluded that this threshold was too low thus resulting in threshold instability durocher et al 2018 proposed a second candidate threshold associated with a fixed exceedance rate the second candidate however could lead to the generalized pareto distribution as an inappropriate choice moreover this candidate often resulted in less accurate flood quantile estimates and was generally higher than the first candidate a hybrid threshold selection method was designed to choose between these two candidates the basis for the selection was the relative difference between the flood quantile estimate of the first candidate and the estimate from a threshold associated with an exceedance rate of one event per year if this difference was determined to be small less than 15 then the first candidate was selected otherwise the higher threshold was chosen mostofi zadeh et al 2019 applied this hybrid process on a large dataset to extract pot series for canadian catchments while bounding the average number of peaks per year between 1 and 5 for stations having mostly nival flood regimes the upper bound of 2 5 ppy was considered in this study the same pot dataset was examined for trend analysis in the magnitude of peaks over threshold and the number of events per year frequency the interested reader can refer to the two abovementioned studies for further details 2 2 test for statistical significance changes in hydrological time series can be evaluated using parametric or nonparametric approaches trend evaluation of hydrometric data is commonly carried out using the nonparametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 and was applied in this study to detect monotonic trends in flood magnitudes significant serial correlation in a data series can impair the robustness of trend detection wang et al 2015 given the assumption of serial independence of data by the mann kendall test önöz and bayazit 2012 the block bootstrap bbs approach önöz and bayazit 2012 is employed to mitigate this effect in the bbs approach data are resampled in blocks a large number of times to estimate the significance of the observed mann kendall test statistic from the data sample while reflecting the serial correlation present in the data set burn et al 2016 as discussed by önöz and bayazit 2012 if data are serially dependent bootstrapping is performed in blocks so that the autocorrelation in the data is replicated the block length should be chosen so that data points one block apart are approximately independent the block size depends upon the number of contiguous significant serial correlations khaliq et al 2009 khaliq et al 2009 provide a detailed description of the steps involved in implementing the bbs approach the mann kendall test is not recommended to detect trends in number of events frequency in the pot series since numerous tied values may exist and introduce difficulties in the rank correlation procedure frei and schär 2001 for this purpose the logistic regression test will be employed please refer to frei and schär 2001 for more details on logistic regression 2 3 field significance when significant trends are detected at a local scale it is necessary to assess their field significance and examine if similar results are also observed at neighbouring sites burn and hag elnur 2002 svensson et al 2006 petrow and merz 2009 burn and whitefield 2017 and 2018 in field significance analysis the objective is to assess whether the number of sites with significant local trend can be regarded as significant at a regional field scale and not by chance alone for all trend analyses a group block bootstrapping approach gbbs is employed whereby increasing and decreasing trends are assessed separately the algorithm operates by initially applying vector resampling in blocks to preserve the correlation structure of the data therefore preserving the cross correlation in the original data but neglecting temporal order burn and hag elnur 2002 renard et al 2008 burn et al 2016 this process continues until the desired record lengths are attained for all the included hydrometric datasets for each resampled streamflow record trend is assessed using the hamed and rao 1998 variance correction technique which accounts for the effects of serial correlation on the variance of the mann kendall test statistic through the use of an effective sample size by considering all significant lags of autocorrelation using the developed empirical distribution of identified trends the yue et al 2003 methodology is used to determine significance 3 data 3 1 peak flow dataset daily flow data are available for hydrometric stations across canada from the water survey of canada s hydat database provided by environment and climate change canada historical hydrometric data website https wateroffice ec gc ca mainmenu historical data index e html the initial dataset analyzed in this study consists of 894 gauging stations with unregulated flows this provides a high spatial resolution dataset with good spatial coverage of the country fig 1 shows the location of these hydrometric stations across canada following mostofi zadeh et al 2019 amax and pot series were extracted from the daily flow series available for each station fig 1 also illustrates the spatial pattern of the average number of peaks per year ppy for pot series of each site stations with pluvial hydrologic regimes that experience more rainfall based events have larger ppy and are mostly located on the east and west coasts of canada as well as some in southern ontario stations located in other parts of the country with nival primarily floods as snowmelt events or mixed hydrologic regime experience a lower number of peaks per year nival stations were identified with average ppy of less than 2 5 gauging stations have different periods of record and may contain gaps in the recorded time series fig 2 depicts the number of stations within our initial dataset with records available in each year for the period of 1900 2018 fig 2 illustrates that the number of stations having data available markedly increases starting in 1960 and this number drops after 2010 with most stations having hydrometric records from 1980 to 1990 the data availability and reliability of information contained is one of the main concerns in trend analysis petrow and merz 2009 a balance must be achieved between long flow series which will generally provide poor spatial coverage better spatial coverage may be attained with time series that are short in comparison to the duration of long term cycles related to climatic indices to address this trade off a multi temporal approach was implemented by changing the start year for trend analysis using 10 year increments four common periods of 30 40 50 and 60 years reflecting short to long data records were selected for trend analysis whereby all common time periods end in 2016 it can be seen from fig 2 that the four time windows employed take advantage of the largest amount of available data as the length of time window increases less data are available for trend analysis time series with more than 5 of the calendar year or more than five consecutive years of missing values were excluded from the dataset this resulted in 482 391 259 and 103 stations to be included in 30 40 50 and 60 year time windows respectively which are presented in figs 4 6 in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the obtained amax and pot datasets will help in identifying large scale spatial patterns of trends detected in different time periods 3 2 hydro climatic regions since flood regimes are complex by nature it is essential to employ various grouping techniques to properly understand the types of changes in the time series this study aims to determine the patterns of detected significant trends within large scale hydro climatic regions in canada the ecological stratification working group 1995 identified 15 terrestrial ecozones in canada representing large and generalized climatic geologic and physiographic characteristics engineering judgment was employed to create a modified aggregated version of the ecozones based on major similarities in climatic and physiographic characteristics of the ecozones such as climate vegetation landforms modification from the original ecozones include the combination of three arctic ecozones and three other northern latitude ecozones into one the addition of newfoundland boreal to atlantic maritime ecozone the combination of boreal plains with prairies ecozone and the combination of boreal and montane cordillera into one ecozone this aggregation resulted in six major regions northern atlantic central prairies mountains and pacific these regions reflect different hydro climatic regions across the country and are shown in fig 3 the characterization of the six hydro climatic regions is presented in fig 3 for more detail please refer to ecological stratification working group 1995 the northern region occupies the northern part of canada climate in this vast region is very cold and dry while it is somewhat milder and more humid in the southern portions of the region because of harsh climate and shallow soil cover the vegetation is sparse the atlantic region is marked by cool summers and short cold to moderately cold winters with high precipitation range because of the proximity to the atlantic ocean forests grow well in this area mean annual precipitation varies from 900 mm inland to over 1500 mm near the coast the central region has long cold winters and warm summers but is modified by maritime conditions in its coastal margins in atlantic canada this region is mostly forested the prairies region is known for long cold winters and short hot to warm summers the prairies region is characterized by relatively little topographic relief and limited forests mean annual precipitation has extreme variability in this region the mountains region is characterized by mountain ranges that contain numerous high peaks that are separated by wide valleys and lowlands this region has ranges of cold subhumid to semiarid climate it is marked by long cold winters and short warm summers mean annual precipitation is lowest in valleys within the rain shadow of the coastal ranges and increases in the interior ranges the pacific region has the warmest and wettest climate conditions in canada climate ranges from a relatively mild humid maritime at low elevations to cool and very humid at higher elevations 3 3 catchment characteristics the relationship between catchment characteristics and significant trends detected in the flood series were also explored in this study two types of characteristics were considered temporal trends in peak flows were calculated separately for three ranges of catchment drainage area sizes stations were classified based on watershed area small 200 km2 medium between 200 and 2000 km2 or large 2000 km2 trend signals from catchments with pristine and non pristine conditions were also studied stations with pristine conditions over time were obtained from the canadian reference hydrometric basin network rhbn brimley et al 1999 these reference sites are known to have good quality data and do not experience the influence of regulation diversions or land use changes burn and whitefield 2017 these stations were specifically identified to assist in the study of the impact of climate change 4 results 4 1 trend in annual maximum series the results of trend analyses in amax flood series data for periods of 30 to 60 years are depicted in fig 4 the top section of table 1 summarizes the number and percentage of sites with significant trend 5 local significance level in their amax series with results provided separately for increasing versus decreasing trend field significance evaluated at the 5 significance level is also indicated in table 1 in the shorter time periods 30 and 40 year there were more increasing than decreasing trends in the amax series however the longer periods of record identified more decreasing than increasing trends predominantly increasing trends in the 30 and 40 year periods of record indicated the possible existence of a common driver of changes in extreme events in recent years it is noteworthy that the amax series did not show trends that are field significant at the 5 level for any time period considered 4 2 trends in peaks over threshold series the results of the multi temporal trend analysis of the pot magnitude series are presented in fig 5 table 1 describes the number and percentage of sites with significant positive and negative trends in magnitudes of their pot series detected at the 5 significance level similar results were found for the magnitude of pot event as those for the amax events that being that the shorter time periods 30 and 40 year were much more likely to display increasing trends again the longer time periods 50 to 60 year showed predominantly decreasing trends since extraction of pot series provided more flood information compared to amax series more reliable conclusions could be drawn from these series by parallel comparison of these two series in each temporal period one could conclude that fewer stations in pot series have significant increasing trend while more stations exhibit decreasing trend it is again important to note that none of the trends in pot magnitude were found to be field significant the results of multi temporal trend analysis of the pot number of events frequency series are presented in fig 6 table 1 summarizes the number and percentage of sites with significant positive and negative trends in the number of events for pot series detected at the 5 significance level an increase in the frequency of above threshold events is clearly identified in table 1 the results of the 40 50 and 60 year time periods were field significant indicating that they did not occur by chance alone in the 40 and 50 year periods there was little spatial pattern relating the increasing trends however in the 60 year period the increasing trends were located in the central region and atlantic maritime region terrestrial ecozones the decreasing trends were located in the mountain and prairie regions comparison of frequency and magnitudes of pot series in table 1 reveals that a greater percentage of significant increasing trends existed in frequency time series for all temporal periods 4 3 trends in different hydro climatic regions the overall trend results for stations within the six defined hydro climatic regions are summarized in table 2 for each hydro climatic region in a fixed period of time the frequency of events generally had the highest percentage of increasing trends in the 30 year time window stations in the prairies region exhibited the largest percentage of increasing trends in the magnitude time series both amax and pot in comparison with other hydro climatic regions stations in the atlantic region displayed the largest percentage 16 1 of stations of increasing trend in the pot frequencies detected trends for these three groups were determined to be field significant stations in the northern region followed by the atlantic region displayed the greatest percentage of identified stations with significant trend in the 40 year time period however only those for the northern region were found to be field significant decreasing trends in the northern region s pot magnitude series and increasing trends in pot frequency series within the 40 year period were identified as field significant decreasing trends in the northern region may be the result of decreases in snowpack park et al 2013 resulting in less pronounced freshet events in these nival dominated watersheds increases in the frequency of above threshold events in the 40 and 50 year periods of record may indicate a transition from a nival to pluvio nival regime increasing trends in the magnitude of events in the more recent 30 year time period in the prairie region indicate that these nival dominated watersheds are experiencing more pronounced spring freshet events lastly the increase in the frequency of events in the atlantic region are the likely result of more frequent intense precipitation events in the 50 year time window the northern region exhibited the largest percentage of decreasing trends in amax and the largest percentage of increasing trends in the frequency of events however this result is based on a single site this trend reversal from the 40 to 50 year time period is not unusual given that the 50 year period is less indicative of recent change field significant increasing trends in the frequency of pot events were identified in the 50 and 60 year time periods for the central region which were not identified in the more recent 30 and 40 year periods there is therefore evidence to suggest that the frequency of recent peak events is higher than in the past however the ppy has stabilized more recently statistically field significant increasing trends were identified in the pot frequency data for the atlantic region for the 30 and 60 year periods which demonstrates that the ppy in the area have increased in the long and short term field significant trends in the 60 year period for the central region were identified in the magnitude of pot events decreasing and frequency of these events increasing significant trends were not identified in the more recent central region time periods again suggesting that these events were indeed higher in recent years but these larger events have stabilized the central and pacific regions had field significant decreasing trends in the magnitude of pot events similar trends were not observed in the shorter periods of record suggesting that the magnitude of peak event was higher in more recent years lastly field significant decreasing trends in the frequency of threshold exceedances were identified in the 60 year time period for the prairies region again these results were not present in the shorter time periods revealing that the region likely experienced less ppy than in the past but the frequency of events has more recently stabilized 4 4 variations in trends with catchment characteristics table 3 presents the trend results for amax and pot magnitudes and frequencies series based on identified rhbn and non rhbn sites in a multi temporal pattern rhbn sites exhibited both increasing and decreasing significant trends with a larger percentage of sites exhibiting increasing trends in the most recent time window field significant increasing trends were identified in the rhbn sites in both the amax and pot 30 year time period due to the stable land use in the rhbn these results are indicative of climate driven changes which is resulting in increased magnitude of peak events other notable increasing field significant trends were identified in the frequency of pots of non rhbn sites this is could be the result of land use changes that alter the hydrologic regime this result was not identified in the more recent 30 year time period indicating land use change may have stabilized in recent years an alternative explanation could be due to the confounding effects of climate change and land use changes ultimately resulting in no identifiable trend signals table 4 provides the trend results for studied time series based on catchment size classification for the 60 year time window decreasing trends in amax and pot magnitudes were exclusively observed with medium sized watersheds with trends in pot magnitudes being field significant for the 60 year period frequency time series increasing trends were the only detected trends in small and medium sized drainage areas with the latter being field significant no noteworthy patterns are observed from this classification the general lack of patterns in trend results as a function of watershed size implies that the trends are not greatly affected by different flood generating processes suggesting that the observed changes are mostly climate driven 5 discussion the trend results presented in this paper illustrate the advantages of using pot series rather than or in addition to amax series for providing a better understanding of the nature of changes in flood events the use of pot dataset allows for the examination of the frequency of flood events along with traditional flood magnitude measures floods are by nature complex especially in a large geographic area such as canada with several different flood generating processes thus pot datasets are required to properly assess the possible changes in floods over time changes were observed in the trend signals from a given station and for a given flood series in different time periods therefore it is important to employ a multi temporal approach to be able to capture all relevant trend behaviour for the catchment under study through the use of flood variables derived from a pot dataset it was demonstrated that a large percentage of increasing trends in the number of events were identified however those found for the 30 year time period were not field significant the trend results based on the multi temporal period of record indicated generally more increasing trends rather than decreasing trends in flood frequencies the multi temporal trend analysis revealed that a larger number of increasing trends were generally detected in shorter time periods in all three types of flood series i e amax magnitude pot magnitude and pot frequency positive trend signal weakens and negative trend signal gets stronger as the length of the time period increases the longest time series of amax and pot magnitudes only exhibited decreasing trends but these trends are not field significant differences were observed in the results when catchments were classified by the hydro climatic regions the atlantic region was found to have significant increasing trends in the frequency of events over various time periods but no significant changes in the magnitude of events were found there is evidence to suggest that the central region has experienced an increase in the frequency events over a longer time period but this trend is not found in shorter time periods the prairie region has seen increases in the magnitude of events in recent years and an overall decrease in peak events within the 60 year period of record there is evidence to suggest that the northern region has experienced decreasing trends in the magnitude of peak events however increasing trends in the frequency of these events are noted there is little evidence of trends in the mountain and pacific regions although the pacific region did see a decrease in the magnitude of pot events in the 60 year time period changes were also observed depending on whether or not a station is part of the reference hydrometric network rhbn site the contrast between rhbn and non rhbn stations is particularly noticeable for the 30 year time window rhbn stations generally have proportionally more significant increasing trends detected and more of these results are field significant when catchments were classified based on watershed size no noteworthy patterns in the trend results were observed comparing results from a diverse collection of trend studies is a challenge due to different study locations and flood variables that are investigated however these comparisons are valuable and will nonetheless be carried out the results of the amax trends in recent years are not in agreeance with burn et al 2004 however the results of the two studies are more aligned in the 50 year time period the discrepancy in the two assessments could be due to the shorter period of record available to burn et al 2004 which ended in the late 1990s the results of the amax analysis in the more recent 30 year time period for the mountain and central regions were consistent with the results of st george 2007 however there is a significant discrepancy in the period of record and methodology whereby st george 2007 used a period of record from 1924 to 2003 and used trend free prewhitening for trend detection yue et al 2002 a technique that was later shown to produce high type i error rates önöz and bayazit 2012 whitfield 2001 found decreasing trends in discharge in the fall and winter for the 1976 1995 time period which is in agreement with the results of the present study for the longer periods of record the results of burn et al 2010 and zhang et al 2001 are in agreeance with the results herein for amax series for the longer periods of record 50 and 60 year lengths whereby all studies detected decreasing trends burn et al 2010 employed a period of record from 1957 to 2006 while zhang et al 2001 studied the 1947 1996 time period although these studies used a less recent period of record decreasing trends are nonetheless detected burn and whitfield 2016 identified increasing and decreasing trends in amax time series of rhbn watersheds the present study is in agreement which has found that rhbn sites are more likely to have field significant increasing trends gan and tan 2015 concluded that non pristine drainage basins non rhbn or those that have experienced significant land use changes were likely to show more temporal trends in amax data than pristine basins a direct comparison between those results and those presented herein is a challenge due to differences in methodology without the consideration of field significance the results in the present paper and those of tan and gan 2015 are similar however after the consideration of field significance herein significant trends are only found in the rhbn sites for the amax and pot 30 year series comparison of the results from this research revealed agreements with some of the conclusions from other earlier research examining flood changes previous work e g petrow and merz 2009 burn et al 2010 mediero et al 2015 vormoor et al 2016 burn and whitfield 2018 reported both increases and decreases for flood magnitude measures studies that have examined pot data generally reported an increase in the frequency of peak over threshold events petrow and merx 2009 mediero et al 2015 vormoor et al 2016 burn and whitfield 2018 these outcomes are consistent with the analysis presented in this paper the temporal patterns in flood variables identified herein have been observed in other studies as well mediero et al 2015 grouped european hydrometric stations into five geographic regions and studied trends in a multi temporal approach the period of record tested was within the 1900 1999 period where the trends in pot magnitude were predominantly decreasing the authors provided a trend analysis of the frequency of pot events that also results in predominantly decreasing trends the present study found more decreasing trend than increasing in the pot magnitude data for 50 and 60 year periods of record however the trends in frequency were predominantly all increasing for all included time periods this difference in trend direction is likely a result of the more recent data included herein merz et al 2016 examined the temporal clustering of flood occurrences peaks over threshold and identified flood rich and flood poor periods for catchments in germany the authors found that less temporal clustering was observed with increasing threshold and time scale in comparison to significant temporal clustering noticed for low thresholds and time scales burn and whitfield 2018 conducted a multi temporal analysis on centennial length streamflow and examined the trends that would be inferred if only shorter records were available they reported that analysing trends in different time periods resulted in identifying sites for which both significant increasing and decreasing trends were observed they identified this non constant behaviour of flood variables as an indicator of the existence of flood rich and flood poor periods similar results were found herein whereby trend reversal in the varying periods of record signify inflection points in the data more increasing trends were identified in the shorter periods of record 30 and 40 year whereas more decreasing trends were found in the longer periods of record this indicates that the longer periods include time with more flood rich periods where peak events were at their lowest 30 40 years ago 6 conclusions flood changes in a large and spatially diverse dataset of hydrometric stations distributed across canada were examined using both amax and pot series the results from the multi temporal approach conducted in this research reveal the importance of the selected time period of flow series for implementing trend and change analysis the trends in flood variables point to increases in frequency of flood events and increasing trends in flood magnitude for the most recent time periods while more decreasing trends are observed in longer time periods for flood magnitudes the present paper identified significant increasing trends in flood magnitude variables for the recent time periods 30 and 40 years as well as decreasing trends for longer time periods 60 year the observed increasing trends in flood variables in more recent years along with the decreasing trends in longer periods of record indicate that flood magnitudes were larger in the past and were at a low point between 30 and 40 years ago it additionally suggests that peak events were highest between 50 and 60 year ago but there is evidence that trends in magnitude are increasing these changes that are occurring in flood events in canada in recent years may be expected to persist into the future as a result of the impacts of land use or climate changes the results of this analysis allow the reader to garner an understanding of the different processes that affect flooding i e land use changes or climate change through the analysis of rhbn and non rhbn analyses furthermore trend patterns found in different hydro climatic regions highlight changes in areas with different flood generating mechanisms differences were noted from the trend study of rhbn hydrometric stations for which the impact of land use changes are minimal and other catchments rhbn sites exhibited more changes than non rhbn sites in flood variables for both the shortest and longest time periods this emphasizes the importance of climate change effects on flood variables strong patterns in trend signals were not observed when the catchments were classified by size notably significant trends were found in the atlantic central prairie and northern terrestrial ecozones thus potentially indicating historic and more recent changes to the hydrologic regime in these areas the observed changes in flood magnitude and frequency in canadian catchments and the complexity of these changes stresses that a comprehensive understanding of these changes is necessary this is particularly of concern when performing flood frequency analysis for flood protection
