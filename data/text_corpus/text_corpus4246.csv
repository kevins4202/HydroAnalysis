21230,to estimate the performance of ships in waves there have been studies on propeller performance in various operating environments in previous studies it was confirmed that propeller open water performance is diminished by ventilation when the propeller operates near the free surface however most of these studies were focused on the change in the advance ratio at the same immersion depth and the effect of varying the immersion depth with the same advance ratio in this study the propeller open water performance due to the variation of immersion depth in waves was calculated using computational fluid dynamics and the pow characteristics due to immersion depth in calm water were compared with the pow characteristics in waves as a result it was concluded that the tendency of propeller performance by variation of immersion depth due to wave elevation is similar to the tendency of propeller performance due to a change of immersion depth in calm water also the effect of water particle velocity due to the wave phase is similar to the variation of propeller performance due to the changing of advance ratio in calm water keywords propeller open water performance immersion depth waves cfd 1 introduction as the eedi energy efficiency design index regulations are tightened the co2 emissions of vessels may be reduced most vessels have been made larger and slower to comply with the regulations according to this tendency the engine also tends to be smaller thus newly constructed vessels would require a more detailed estimation of propulsion performance than before in waves vessels exhibit different motion than those that operate in still water in addition the inflow on the propeller plane can change on account of the complex hull motion and the propeller immersion depth can vary by wave phase the variation in immersion depth can cause a decrease in the propeller performance through the interaction between the propeller and free surface therefore this interaction has been examined to derive an accurate estimate of the propulsion performance koushan et al 2009 conducted a propeller open water test according to the immersion depth in waves they showed that the propeller performance can change under various conditions propeller open water performance decreased by varying the immersion depth and wave conditions and the time series of the thrust and torque varied according to wave phase to investigate the causes of the degradation in the propeller with immersion depth a study on the phenomenon of air ventilation caused by the interaction between the free surface and propeller has been conducted kozlowska et al 2009 observed the interaction between the propeller and free surface by applying the bollard condition to the propeller rotating speed and changing the immersion depth the process of air ventilation and its effect on propellers were studied and the loss of thrust and torque was expressed in terms of the number of revolutions and depth since that study a more detailed examination regarding the effect of air ventilation on propellers has been performed califano and steen 2011a b numerically analyzed the effect of air ventilation on propellers that are rotated near the free surface the distribution of pressure on the propeller surface and the loading distribution in the chord direction after the action of air ventilation were studied califano and steen 2011a b and kozlowska et al 2011 simulated the shape of air ventilation by tracking the behavior of one blade rotated near the free surface in addition the variation in propeller performance as a function of immersion depth was studied more deeply by expressing the change in thrust and torque from air ventilation according to the phase of one blade in a related domestic study paik et al 2017 studied various advance ratios near the free surface and confirmed that the reduction in the thrust and torque are also different if the advance ratio is changed later lee and paik 2018 analyzed the change in thrust and torque from the air ventilation of the propeller under the bollard condition and they proposed a method to estimate the thrust and torque in various environments under the bollard condition various studies have been carried out on the propeller performance in waves previous studies have considered the effect of air ventilation on reduced propeller performance under different environments however most studies have focused on varying the immersion depth under the bollard condition or changing the advanced ratio at the same immersion depth there are several previous studies that have investigated the effects of waves on propeller performance as described above in this study the effect of propeller immersion depth and waves on the propeller open water performance was studied using numerical simulation in addition the advance ratio was varied to investigate the effect of propeller performance on the interaction between the free surface and waves 2 model propeller and numerical method 2 1 propeller specification for this study the propeller named kp458 is used which the propeller for the kvlcc2 vessel designed by the kriso korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering the specifications of kp458 used for numerical simulation and model test are shown in table 1 and the shape is shown in fig 1 2 2 simulation model and method in this study star ccm was used for numerical simulation star ccm is commercial software used to analyze complex fluid flows it supports dynamical flexibility of the grid and reproduces grids that are difficult for the user to express so that the problem can be analyzed more easily for this study the continuity equation and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation were chosen to solve the complex unsteady incompressible turbulent flow this software is based on the finite volume method convection terms and diffusion terms are discretized using a second order upstream method and a second order central difference method to analyze the performance of the propeller equations describing three dimensional implicit unsteady and incompressible flow are considered these governing equations are the rans equations and are described in eqs 1 and 2 1 d d t ω ρ d ω s ρ u i n i d s 0 2 d d t ω ρ u i d ω s ρ u i u j n j d s s τ i j n j p n i d s ω ρ b i d ω in these equations u i x i p t ρ and μ are the velocity spatial coordinate pressure time density and viscosity of the fluid respectively the s s t k ω which is the most commonly considered model for turbulent flow analysis such as that of the propeller wake is used to model the turbulence this model combines the k ω model with the k ε model and the johnson king model depending on the characteristics of the flow field in the s s t k ω treatment the k ω model is used near the wall and is possible to use without the wall function apart from this area the k ε model is used in addition in the dominant part of the back pressure gradient the shear stress transport effect of the johnson king model is considered 3 verification of propeller open water simulation the propeller open water performance in still water was simulated to obtain the reliability of propeller open water simulation with the variation in immersion depth in waves these results were compared with the nmri national maritime research institute model test results published in simman 2008 and the experimental results obtained from the iutt inha university towing tank model test the propeller open water test from nmri assumed a propeller diameter of 0 0896 m λ 110 04 and an immersion depth ratio h d is 2 0 the reynolds number r e c 0 7 v a 2 0 7 π n d 2 ν was taken to be 2 07 10 5 iutt experiments and computational fluid dynamics cfd calculations were carried out with a 0 1 m diameter model propeller rotated at 32 55 rps and a reynolds number of 1 93 10 5 these results were compared with the experimental data of nmri the model test was conducted at the same immersion depth ratio h d of 2 0 as that of the nmri experiment and the numerical simulation was simulated under fully submerged conditions the time interval applied to the numerical simulation corresponds to a propeller rotation angle of 2 and the grid system around the propeller is shown in fig 2 in this grid system a 3 5 million mesh was used in the total computational domain and 2 6 million mesh was used in rotational region the numerical simulation results in this condition were compared with the experimental results of iutt and nmri as shown in fig 3 table 2 compares the numerical simulation results with the nmri and iutt experimental data iutt experimental results are relatively higher than nmri model test results tendency is similar based on the model test results the grid system of this simulation and the numerical method for the simulation appear to have enough reliability therefore all of the following numerical simulations were performed based on this grid system 4 propeller open water simulation due to immersion depth each different phase was formed using the eulerian multiphase to simulate propeller open water performance according to immersion depth the free surface was simulated by a flat wave in the volume of fluid vof to analyze the interaction between the propeller and free surface the grid system on the free surface and the wake area were reinforced in this grid system a 6 0 million mesh was used in the total computational domain and the final grid system was presented in fig 4 the rotation domain of the propeller was made by the overset mesh in which h refers to the distance from the hub center to the free surface and d is the propeller diameter to verify the modified numerical simulation and grid system the simulation results at h d 2 0 are compared with the result of fully submerged propeller open water simulation results these results are shown in fig 5 from the comparison between with and without free surface the numerical simulation result at h d 2 0 shows a difference of 2 3 on average in thrust and 1 8 on average in torque a comparison between the results of the simulation with free surface and experimental results of nmri shows a difference of 0 5 on average in thrust and 2 7 on average in torque the results of the propeller open water simulation with free surface compared to the model test exhibits a smaller difference than that without the free surface it is concluded that the numerical method of the eulerian multiphase and the volume of fluid have sufficient reliability the propeller open water simulation according to immersion depth was considered for h d 2 0 1 0 0 75 0 5 and 0 25 with advance ratios of j 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 these results are shown in fig 6 to visually confirm the correlation between the free surface and propeller according to immersion depth the state of the free surface in the cross section is shown in figs 7 and 8 examining the variation of the free surface it can be confirmed that air ventilation occurs more when the distance between the free surface and propeller become closer at the same advance ratio in addition the air ventilation decreases when the advance ratio increases at the same immersion depth from the above results the propeller performance could change with immersion depth and advance ratio therefore to investigate the variation of the propeller performance according to the immersion depth at each advance ratio the thrust and torque are plotted varying the immersion depth at each advance ratio as shown in fig 9 the variation in propeller performance with immersion depth for each advance ratio is shown to have a constant tendency 5 propeller open water simulation in waves a wave height of 0 02 m and a wavelength of 1 0 m h r 0 2 h λ 0 02 are assumed for the propeller open water simulation in regular waves the regular waves were generated by the stokes fifth order wave in the vof the shape of the free surface grid system is modified to simulate waves a total of 80 grids in wavelength and 20 grids in wave height were applied for wave simulation in this grid system a 7 7 million mesh was used in the total computational domain and the final mesh shape is shown in fig 10 for numerical simulation an advance ratio of j 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 at h d 0 5 and an immersion depth of h d 0 75 0 5 and 0 25 at j 0 5 were considered to verify the reliability of the numerical simulation results they were compared with the iutt model test results the model tests were performed at h d 0 75 0 5 and 0 25 for j 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 the results of the model test are based on the mean value of the entire time series and the average of the thrust from crest to trough was used in the numerical simulation results model test and numerical simulation results are compared in fig 11 the differences between the numerical simulation results and iutt experimental results are 1 9 on average in thrust and 4 54 on average in torque therefore it could be concluded that the numerical simulation has enough reliability in this study to analyze the thrust variation due to waves thrust variations at h d 0 5 for each advance ratio are shown by the time series in fig 12 in which the green line is the wave phase adjusted on the propeller plane by the same time series in the following figures t t w means physics time per encounter wave period although the tendency is not clear at j 0 1 because the interaction between the propeller and free surface is very complex the tendency of the thrust is similar to that of the wave phase at j 0 3 the variation of the thrust in waves is very similar to that of the wave phase in time series however at j 0 5 the phase of the thrust variation in waves does not coincide with the wave phase at crest finally the tendency of thrust and wave phase is reversed at j 0 7 from the above results it could be seen that there is an additional factor in the change of thrust in waves besides the change in the relative immersion depth depending on the wave phase it is found that the tendency of the thrust variation of each advance ratio is different for the same immersion depth in waves thus the water particle velocity in waves was used to determine the cause of this behavior to consider the effect of water particle velocity in waves on the propeller plane the non dimensionalized inflow velocity which was affected by the water particle velocity in waves at j 0 5 for h d 0 75 0 5 and 0 25 is shown in fig 13 for j 0 5 the inflow velocity due to water particle velocity in waves is increased by 4 5 at the crest and decreased by 4 at the trough it could be concluded that the relative inflow velocity could change due to the water particle velocity in waves depending on the wave phase and immersion depth the variation in inflow velocity induces a change in the relative advance ratio from the above results it could be concluded that the propeller thrust in waves is simultaneously influenced by the variations in the immersion depth and water particle velocity in waves depending on the wave phase to verify this phenomenon the advance ratio was fixed under the same wave condition and the immersion depth was changed the variation of thrust is compared as shown in fig 14 for the analysis of the thrust for h d 0 75 0 5 and 0 25 at j 0 5 in waves the tendency of the thrust according to immersion depth at j 0 5 in calm water is simplified with a schematic drawing in fig 14 in the variation of the thrust due to immersion depth in calm water the thrust at the vicinity of h d 0 75 is just a little affected by the change in the immersion depth the change in the immersion depth due to wave phase is not significant at h d 0 75 when the wave phase is located in the crest the relative advance ratio is increased by an increase in the inflow velocity due to water particle velocity in waves thus the thrust is decreased owing to the increase in the relative advance ratio on the other hand when the wave phase is located in trough the inflow velocity decreased with water particle velocity in waves and the thrust increased owing to the decrease in the relative advance ratio near h d 0 5 although the variation of thrust is hardly affected by an increase in the immersion depth decreasing the immersion depth has a significant effect on thrust when the wave phase is located in the crest the increase in thrust which is affected by a relative increase in the immersion depth due to wave phase and the decrease in thrust which is affected by a relative increase in the inflow velocity due to the increase in water particle velocity in waves is offset in addition when the wave phase is located in the trough the decrease in thrust which is affected by a relative decrease in the immersion depth is dominant because the decrease in thrust is higher than the increase of thrust by a relative decrease in the immersion depth due to the decrease in the advance ratio thus the thrust is decreased as shown in fig 14 in the vicinity of h d 0 25 both the increase in the immersion depth and the decrease in the immersion depth are dominant therefore at h d 0 25 the varying of thrust is moved to the same tendency with the varying of the wave phase in addition the relative inflow velocity is different between the crest and trough in waves thus the variation in the inflow velocity is higher when the wave phase is located in the crest the variation in the thrust caused by the change in the immersion depth in the crest is relatively smaller than that in the trough 6 conclusion in this study propeller open water characteristics based on immersion depth and waves were investigated by numerical simulation numerical simulation was based on the rans equation and the volume of fluid vof was used to make the free surface the propeller used for numerical simulation is the kp458 propeller which is the target propeller of kvlcc2 reliability was verified by comparison with the experimental results obtained from iutt and the experimental results of nmri published in simman 2008 numerical analysis was carried out at the advance ratio j 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 according to the immersion depth h d 2 0 1 0 0 75 0 5 and 0 25 the variation of propeller open water performance based on immersion depth was compared with the correlation between the propeller performance and free surface as the immersion depth ratio decreases at the same advance ratio the interaction with the free surface increases while the interaction with the free surface decreases with increase in the advance ratio at the same immersion depth to analyze the propeller open water performance in waves the conditions of j 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 at h d 0 5 and h d 0 75 0 5 0 25 at j 0 5 were tested wave conditions are 0 02 m in wave height and 1 0 m in wavelength h r 0 2 h λ 0 02 in this study propeller open water performance in waves is analyzed considering the change in propeller performance with immersion depth and the variation of inflow velocity due to waves in this study it was concluded that the variation of immersion depth and inflow velocity are simultaneous influences on the propeller in addition the inflow velocity due to water particle velocity in waves and change in immersion depth depends on the wave phase waves cause the change in relative immersion depth compared with calm water the propeller has a similar tendency with the variation of immersion depth in calm water to when the immersion depth is changed by waves water particles in waves have a velocity independent of the inflow and it could induce change in the inflow velocity the variation of the inflow velocity could affect the advance speed of the propeller in this study it was concluded that the variation of immersion depth due to wave elevation and the change in inflow velocity due to water particle velocity in waves independently affect the propeller performance in waves credit authorship contribution statement myeong jin eom conceptualization writing original draft investigation

performance in waves the conditions of j 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 at h d 0 5 and h d 0 75 0 5 0 25 at j 0 5 were tested wave conditions are 0 02 m in wave height and 1 0 m in wavelength h r 0 2 h λ 0 02 in this study propeller open water performance in waves is analyzed considering the change in propeller performance with immersion depth and the variation of inflow velocity due to waves in this study it was concluded that the variation of immersion depth and inflow velocity are simultaneous influences on the propeller in addition the inflow velocity due to water particle velocity in waves and change in immersion depth depends on the wave phase waves cause the change in relative immersion depth compared with calm water the propeller has a similar tendency with the variation of immersion depth in calm water to when the immersion depth is changed by waves water particles in waves have a velocity independent of the inflow and it could induce change in the inflow velocity the variation of the inflow velocity could affect the advance speed of the propeller in this study it was concluded that the variation of immersion depth due to wave elevation and the change in inflow velocity due to water particle velocity in waves independently affect the propeller performance in waves credit authorship contribution statement myeong jin eom conceptualization writing original draft investigation

21231,in recent years harbour security protection has received extensive attention for the moving invasion target interception problem in the underwater environment with ocean current a new interception algorithm with multiple autonomous underwater vehicles multi auv called prediction planning interception ppi method is proposed in this paper first the interception position is determined quickly and simply through the movement tracking of target and then the intercept path of each auv in the environment is planned by the artificial potential field method when the target is intercepted by any auv it is considered a successful interception the auv can rapidly intercept the moving target whose trajectory is dynamically changing along relatively short path in the changeable and complicated underwater environment by ppi method the simulation results show that the interception efficiency of the prediction planning interception method is greatly improved compared with the traditional tracking interception method under different conditions keywords multi auv moving target interception prediction planning interception artificial potential field tracking interception 1 introduction harbour security casalino et al 2009 simetti et al 2010b is the premise to ensure the normal operation of harbour which is conducive to the construction of maritime power so far some achievements have been made in water or air security protection for harbour in today s non war conflicts due to the needs of their own interests some countries have infiltrated into each other s harbour area especially for military harbour to carry out military reconnaissance and data acquisition it increasingly aroused national maritime security concerns especially for underwater security protection for harbour for guaranteeing the security of the underwater area against possible threats it needs to intercept them fast when the sensor detects intruders auv has become an important tool for harbour security protection because of its high degree of autonomy and maneuverability however single auv cannot intercept target fast due to its limited energy for solving this defect multi auv sun et al 2018 cao et al 2015 2018 collaborative interception technology emerges at present there are few researches on the use of underwater vehicles for harbour security protection especially multi auv in the changeable and complicated underwater environment it is still an open problem that has not been solved to make multi auv successfully intercept moving target and this paper will try to solve this problem since the military security involved there are few reports about multi auv underwater interception it can learn from the interception methods in torpedo missile and other fields target interception method based on fuzzy logic li et al 2004 pei et al 2018 is one of the common approaches in li et al 2004 it uses the fuzzy sliding mode control scheme to realize tracking interception behavior but it is well known that the fuzzy control method has some disadvantages such as fuzzy control rules have to be built by tracing the fuzzy control relations of system if the motion performance of target is dynamically changing fuzzy control rules which are built beforehand may become improper the guidance law zhu et al 2016 zhou and liang 2012 huang et al 2018 2019 is also a common interception method it always uses the navigation and guidance theory and takes the distance of the robot and the target as optimization goal and applies the optimal control method to design guidance rate in zhu et al 2016 it uses the integrated guidance law to control rotary unmanned aerial vehicle uav to intercept target in huang et al 2018 it used an extended differential geometric guidance law edggl to intercept the high speed maneuvering target in huang et al 2019 it proposed a profile tracking based adaptive guidance law to solve the terminal guidance problem of a missile intercepting a maneuvering target the guidance law is generally used for terminal guidance and is not suitable for interception problem of multi auv there are interception methods worth referring in the field of the unmanned aerial vehicles uav and unmanned surface vehicles usv kim 2019 introduced a three dimensional controller to make the team of robots capture the uav with variable velocity simetti et al 2010a used a team of unmanned surface vehicles to intercept the detected menaces by the monte carlo algorithm and the gradient descent method on the condition of maximizing the minimum interception distance and minimizing the maximum interception time however these methods are not suitable for the changeable and complicated underwater environment traditional tracking interception method abed al rahman et al 2019 ni et al 2017 wu 2019 is an interception approach which suits for the interception problem of multi auv the auv cannot only avoid obstacles but also intercept moving target quickly with this method however the interception efficiency of this method needs to be improved in this paper a new intruder interception method with multi auv called prediction planning interception ppi method is proposed the ppi method allows the intercept path to be re planned whenever a change in the target trajectory is detected the interception problem with multi auv can solve efficiently by ppi method the innovation points of this paper mainly include the following three aspects 1 a novel intruder interception method is designed with multi auv regardless of homogeneous or inhomogeneous called prediction planning interception ppi method to the best of our knowledge it is the first time to explicitly conduct the underwater interception problem with multi auv for harbour protection 2 when the velocity of each auv in the environment is greater than the speed of moving target the interception efficiency of the prediction planning interception method is greatly improved compared with the traditional tracking interception approach 3 when the velocity of each auv in the environment is equal to the speed of moving target it is possible that none of auvs can intercept moving target by tracking interception method so that the interception problem of multi auv will never be solved but the interception assignment of multi auv can well be completed by the prediction planning interception method under the same condition this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the basic model of multi auv intercepting moving target section 3 introduces the proposed ppi algorithm simulation results are presented in section 4 finally the conclusion is given in section 5 2 modeling of underwater environment 2 1 overview of multi auv intercepting problem the multi auv interception system is an important tool for harbour underwater security protection the multi auv intercept target moving along a constant speed mainly refers to that multiple auvs form a team to complete interception task through a certain cooperative strategy in the underwater environment with static obstacles and ocean current multi auv interception can efficiently improve interception efficiency compared with single auv and reduce loss of energy it believes that the interception task is completed when the euclidean distance between any auv in the environment and moving target is less than or equal to a certain threshold the moving target interception with multi auv needs to solve two problems firstly each auv in the environment should predict the intercept point according to the movement trajectory of the target and itself motion attributes secondly each auv should avoid obstacles and generate an intercept path fig 1 a shows the schematic diagram of multi auv cooperatively intercept moving target under the harbour one thing that needs to mention is that this paper mainly discusses the multi auv single target interception problem while for the multi auv multi target interception problem it includes two parts first it determines a better task allocation scheme for the multi auv system to make sure that the system is efficient second it intercepts each moving target at the same time through an interception algorithm the multi auv multi target interception problem after task allocation is essentially the multi auv single target interception problem in order to focus on the interception topic only one target interception problem is discussed 2 2 modeling of underwater environment the underwater environment is a three dimensional space auv is allowed to move with six degrees of freedom in theory in most cases when the auv is navigating underwater its motion control is usually decoupled to the horizontal plane and the vertical plane except for recycling and lifting auv usually works in the same horizontal plane so the modeling of underwater environment can be simplified appropriately and expressed by two dimensional environment map model fig 1 b gives the simulation diagram of multi auv target interception under the harbour it is assumed that there are multiple auvs and a target in the 2 d working environment with some static obstacles and full of ocean current establish a cartesian coordinate system which takes the upper left corner of 2 d working field as the origin it denotes the coordinates of the moving target and the nth auv at time i as g i g i x g i y g i and r i n r i n x r i n y r i n let d g i r i n denote the euclidean distance between two coordinates g i and r i n the speed of auv and moving target are denoted as v r m s and v g m s respectively and they are both constant the trajectory of moving target is unknown to auv and is allowed to change dynamically assume that auv has detected moving target through sonar data the current position of the nth auv and moving target are regarded as their starting points which are denoted by r 0 n and g 0 respectively 3 the proposed ppi algorithm tracking interception method zhu et al 2019 gan et al 2020 is a common interception strategy which suits for multi auv fig 2 a shows its schematic it views the real time position of moving target as the navigational sub goal in general it is passive and ineffective to make auv simply track the moving target if auv knows the movement trajectory of target through the sonar data it could forecast the intercept point and plan path to this point directly then encounter the moving target efficiently this is the original intention of the ppi method where fig 2 b shows schematic of the ppi strategy the ppi strategy treats the predicted intercept point as the navigational sub goal the ppi algorithm includes two parts firstly it is predicting intercept point zhu et al 2013 secondly it is planning path priyadarshi biplab et al 2019 from auv to the possible intercept point the main idea of this method is that auv forecasts the intercept point according to the speed of itself and moving target the linear trajectory of moving target after the unit sampling time t second it assumes that auv and moving target move with linear trajectory during the process of predicting intercept point the possible intercept point is regarded as the navigational sub goal of auv the intercept path from auv to the navigational sub goal is planned by the artificial potential field method the auv continuously monitors moving target while it is moving along an intercept path once the movement trajectory of target is found to change auv will re predict the intercept point and re plan intercept path the interception process will be repeated until any auv in the environment intercept moving target fig 3 shows the flowchart of ppi method 3 1 predicting the intercept point it assumes that auv can obtain state information of moving target through sonar data at time i the current positions of the nth auv and moving target are regarded as r i n r i n x r i n y r i n and g i g i x g i y g i respectively after the unit sampling time t second the current coordinates of moving target and the nth auv are regarded as g i t g i t x g i t y g i t and r i t n r i t n x r i t n y r i t n the auv can approximate the linear trajectory of moving target by using the two coordinates g i and g i t eq 1 gives the corresponding linear trajectory 1 y y g i t y g i x g i t x g i x y g i y g i t x g i t x g i x g i y g i k i x b i in the process of predicating the intercept point suppose that auv moves along the straight line i e obstacles in the environment are negligible suppose the intercept point coordinate corresponding to the nth auv is c n c x c n y c n fig 4 shows the sketch map of corresponding intercept position of multi auv take auv1 as an example to briefly analyze the intercept point prediction idea if the auv1 and moving target are to meet at c 1 c x c 1 y c 1 the auv1 and moving target should take the same time to reach this point since the same time which the auv1 and moving target spend on arriving at c 1 c x c 1 y c 1 eq 2 with the intercept point c 1 as unknown parameter can be obtained in the same way equations for calculating the intercept points c 2 and c 3 can be obtained and are expressed as eqs 3 and 4 2 x g i t x c 1 2 y g i t y c 1 2 v g x r i 1 x c 1 2 y r i 1 y c 1 2 v r 3 x g i t x c 2 2 y g i t y c 2 2 v g x r i 2 x c 2 2 y r i 2 y c 2 2 v r 4 x g i t x c 3 2 y g i t y c 3 2 v g x r i 3 x c 3 2 y r i 3 y c 3 2 v r the quadratic equation of one variable 5 of the unknown number x c 1 obtains by combining equation 1 with eq 2 similarly the quadratic equations of one variable of unknown quantities x c 2 and x c 3 can also be obtained and are expressed as eqs 6 and 7 suppose that coefficients in the quadratic equation of one variable constructed by the nth auv corresponding to the intercept point are represented by a n b n and c n their values are expressed in eqs 8 10 5 a 1 x c 1 2 b 1 x c 1 c 1 0 6 a 2 x c 2 2 b 2 x c 2 c 2 0 7 a 3 x c 3 2 b 3 x c 3 c 3 0 8 a n 1 k i 2 v g 2 1 k i 2 v r 2 9 b n 2 k i b i y g i 2 x g i v g 2 2 k i b i y r i n 2 x r i n v r 2 10 c n x g i 2 b i y g i 2 v g 2 x r i n 2 b i y r i n 2 v r 2 for any auv it is easy to prove that b n 2 4 a n c n 0 so the quadratic equation of one variable has two roots it should give up the root that deviates from movement orientation of target once it gets x c n y c n is computed by eq 1 3 2 planning the intercept path of the auv the artificial potential field method priyadarshi biplab et al 2019 luo et al 2015 solari et al 2016 is adopted to plan the intercept path from auv to the possible intercept point the artificial potential field method is a simple and practical path planning algorithm which is a gradient descent method essentially compared with other path planning algorithms the artificial potential field method has the advantages of small computation amount fast operation speed strong real time obstacle avoidance and smooth and feasible path is finally obtained because of its fast operating speed and real time obstacle avoidance the interception task can be completed more quickly in the process of planning the intercept path of auv the surrounding environment is abstracted into a kind of artificial potential field the potential field generated by obstacles is called the repulsion potential field where it is not zero only within the certain range of obstacles and the rest of position is zero in the ppi method the predicting intercept point generates the gravitational potential field which fills the whole environment and the potential field value is the global minimum the potential field at any point in the space is superposition of the gravitational potential field and the repulsion potential field fig 5 shows the multi auv force analysis diagram at i time in the ppi method gravitational potential field point of the nth auv is the nth intercept point calculated by the previous step the repulsive force is generated by the nth obstacle is f r e p n i the gravitation and the repulsive force on the nth auv are f a t t n i and f r e p n i eq 11 and 12 give the total potential field and corresponding resultant force of the nth auv among them f a t t n i f r e p n i and f n i respectively represent the gravitation the repulsive force and resultant force of the nth auv u a t t n i u r e p n i and u n i represent the corresponding gravitational potential field repulsive potential field and total potential field in the process of planning intercept path auv determines next position by searching for the fastest decreasing direction of potential field since the potential field generated by predicting intercept point is global minimum multi auv move towards their own intercept point 11 u n i u a t t n i u r e p n i 12 f n i u n i u a t t n i u r e p n i f a t t n i f r e p n i the main defect of the artificial potential field method is the local extremum problem mabrouk and mcinnes 2008 rostami et al 2019 when auv is located in the local extremum area it cannot continue to move forward because it cannot search the direction of the falling potential field but this paper sets the changeable environment auv just waits for the unit sampling time to change position of moving target when it occurs the local extremum and the problem can be solved automatically 4 simulation results and analysis for guaranteeing security under the harbour when a multi auv system detects a hostile target through sonar sensors its main task is to intercept the target effectively to ensure successful interception of the moving target in the changeable and complicated underwater environment the speed of each auv should not be less than that of the moving target otherwise the interception will never occur in the process of simulation it uses the traditional tracking interception method to compare with the proposed ppi method the essential difference between ppi algorithm and the tracking interception method is that the gravitational potential field point is not same in the process of planning intercept path the traditional tracking interception method does not require prediction of intercept point and views the real time position of moving target as the gravitational potential field point and planning the intercept path is carried out the ppi method predicts the intercept point before planning the intercept path of auv and the intercept point is regarded as the gravitational potential field point then auv is planned intercept path since the ppi method makes a rough prediction of intercept point first the intercept point will not change if the trajectory of moving target remains unchanged in the process of planning intercept path of the auv however the real time position of moving target change frequently hence the ppi method has a higher interception efficiency than the tracking interception algorithm in theory simulations are conducted on the matlab platform to verify the effectiveness of algorithm the harbour environment is simplified auv and moving target are both regarded as particles the green trajectory represents the motion trajectory of target the red the blue and other colors trajectories represent the intercept path of multiple auvs in the working field the black objects represent obstacles the light blue arrow with both size and direction represents the ocean current 4 1 moving target interception for multi auv when the velocity of auv is greater than the speed of moving target in the 2 d ocean current environment with four auvs the ocean current is a constant current with a velocity of 0 5 m s and the direction of 180 the speed of moving target is 1 m s all four auvs have same velocity 1 2 m s and moving target is located in 5 12 originally without changing the above conditions four different scenarios are simulated by changing the initial positions of the four auvs table 1 shows the initial position of multi auv under four different scenarios fig 6 gives the simulation diagram of scenario 1 the original position of auv1 is 1 1 and its trajectory is yellow auv2 is located in 38 10 originally and its trajectory is blue the original position of auv3 is 0 40 and its trajectory is red auv4 is located in 35 33 originally and its trajectory is magenta as can be seen from fig 6 a the four auvs take the real time position of the moving target as the gravitational potential field point to plan their intercept paths respectively and finally auv4 intercepts moving target first by tracking interception method as can be seen from fig 6 b the four auvs calculate the possible intercept points respectively and consider them as the gravitational potential field points to plan their intercept paths they walk along the intercept paths while continuously monitoring the moving target the intercept points are re predicted and the intercept paths are re planned when the trajectory of the moving target changes finally auv2 intercepts the moving target first by the proposed ppi method in the actual underwater environment the existence of ocean current will have a certain impact on the interception results it affects the moving direction of the auv makes the intercept path longer and the intercept time slower for scenarios 1 by the proposed ppi method the intercept path is 19 2 meters and the intercept time is 16 seconds in the absence of ocean current and 20 4 meters and 17 seconds in the presence of ocean current the interception task can be accomplished effectively despite that the ocean current has some effect on the interception results table 2 shows the simulation results under the four different scenarios the interception problem of multi auv will be solved no matter using the tracking interception method or the proposed ppi algorithm when the velocity of the auv is greater than the speed of moving target as can be seen from table 2 the auv s intercept time and intercept path length using the proposed ppi method are lower than that the tracking interception method in the four different scenarios hence the interception efficiency of the proposed ppi algorithm is greatly improved compared with the tracking interception method 4 2 moving target interception for multi auv when the velocity of auv is equal to the speed of moving target in the 2 d ocean current environment with three auvs the ocean current is a constant current with a velocity of 0 3 m s and the direction of 90 the speed of moving target and all three auvs are 1 m s and moving target is located in 10 20 originally without changing the above conditions three different scenarios are simulated by changing the initial positions of the three auvs table 3 shows the initial position of multi auv under three different scenarios fig 7 gives the simulation diagram of scenario 1 the original position of auv1 is 1 1 and its trajectory is yellow auv2 is located in 38 10 originally and its trajectory is blue the original position of auv3 is 0 30 and its trajectory is red as can be seen from fig 7 a the interception assignment of multi auv is not completed eternally however fig 7 b shows that the interception task is completed efficiently by the proposed ppi method in the same environment and auv2 intercepts the moving target first table 4 gives the simulation results under the three different scenarios as can be seen from table 4 the tracking interception algorithm cannot accomplish the interception assignment in the three different scenarios however the proposed ppi method completes the interception task well 4 3 the moving target interception for inhomogeneous multi auv in 2 d underwater environment with ocean current in the real underwater environment auvs have different speeds and it is called inhomogeneous multi auv it assumes that the working field is the 2 d ocean current environment with three auvs the speed of auv1 is 1 m s its original position is 38 10 and its trajectory is blue auv2 is located in 0 40 originally its velocity is 1 2 m s and its trajectory is red the original position of auv3 is 35 33 its speed is 1 2 m s and its trajectory is magenta in the working field full of the constant ocean current with a velocity of 0 5 m s and the direction of 180 the speed of moving target is 1 m s and its original position is located in 10 15 fig 8 shows that the interception assignment can be completed well no matter using the tracking interception method or the proposed ppi method as can be seen from figs 8 and 9 either way the auv3 intercepts moving target first but the intercept time and path length of different method are not same the auv s intercept path length using the proposed ppi method saves six meters and the intercept time saves five seconds compared with the tracking interception method the effectiveness of the proposed ppi method is proved again 5 conclusion this paper mainly studies the interception problem of multiple auvs in the 2 d underwater environment with ocean current and the ppi method is proposed in the process of planning the intercept path of auv the gravitational potential field points selected by the tracking interception method and the ppi algorithm are different so the interception efficiency of the proposed ppi method is better than the tracking interception algorithm in theory simulation results verify this idea from three different cases when the velocity of auv is greater than the speed of moving target simulation results show that the interception efficiency of the proposed ppi method is dramatically improved than that of the tracking interception algorithm when the velocity of auv is equal to the speed of moving target it occurs the situation that any auv in the environment never intercepts moving target by the tracking interception method however the proposed ppi method solves this problem well finally in the underwater environment with inhomogeneous multi auv simulation results show that effectiveness of the ppi method again the future work will concentrate on extending the multi auv interception problem to three dimension underwater environment and continue to study the effectiveness of the ppi approach the main difficulty may be the prediction of intercept point in the later research and the method of predicting the intercept point used in this paper is not suitable for three dimension space it may use optimization algorithms to solve this problem but still needs further research to confirm credit authorship contribution statement

secondly it is planning path priyadarshi biplab et al 2019 from auv to the possible intercept point the main idea of this method is that auv forecasts the intercept point according to the speed of itself and moving target the linear trajectory of moving target after the unit sampling time t second it assumes that auv and moving target move with linear trajectory during the process of predicting intercept point the possible intercept point is regarded as the navigational sub goal of auv the intercept path from auv to the navigational sub goal is planned by the artificial potential field method the auv continuously monitors moving target while it is moving along an intercept path once the movement trajectory of target is found to change auv will re predict the intercept point and re plan intercept path the interception process will be repeated until any auv in the environment intercept moving target fig 3 shows the flowchart of ppi method 3 1 predicting the intercept point it assumes that auv can obtain state information of moving target through sonar data at time i the current positions of the nth auv and moving target are regarded as r i n r i n x r i n y r i n and g i g i x g i y g i respectively after the unit sampling time t second the current coordinates of moving target and the nth auv are regarded as g i t g i t x g i t y g i t and r i t n r i t n x r i t n y r i t n the auv can approximate the linear trajectory of moving target by using the two coordinates g i and g i t eq 1 gives the corresponding linear trajectory 1 y y g i t y g i x g i t x g i x y g i y g i t x g i t x g i x g i y g i k i x b i in the process of predicating the intercept point suppose that auv moves along the straight line i e obstacles in the environment are negligible suppose the intercept point coordinate corresponding to the nth auv is c n c x c n y c n fig 4 shows the sketch map of corresponding intercept position of multi auv take auv1 as an example to briefly analyze the intercept point prediction idea if the auv1 and moving target are to meet at c 1 c x c 1 y c 1 the auv1 and moving target should take the same time to reach this point since the same time which the auv1 and moving target spend on arriving at c 1 c x c 1 y c 1 eq 2 with the intercept point c 1 as unknown parameter can be obtained in the same way equations for calculating the intercept points c 2 and c 3 can be obtained and are expressed as eqs 3 and 4 2 x g i t x c 1 2 y g i t y c 1 2 v g x r i 1 x c 1 2 y r i 1 y c 1 2 v r 3 x g i t x c 2 2 y g i t y c 2 2 v g x r i 2 x c 2 2 y r i 2 y c 2 2 v r 4 x g i t x c 3 2 y g i t y c 3 2 v g x r i 3 x c 3 2 y r i 3 y c 3 2 v r the quadratic equation of one variable 5 of the unknown number x c 1 obtains by combining equation 1 with eq 2 similarly the quadratic equations of one variable of unknown quantities x c 2 and x c 3 can also be obtained and are expressed as eqs 6 and 7 suppose that coefficients in the quadratic equation of one variable constructed by the nth auv corresponding to the intercept point are represented by a n b n and c n their values are expressed in eqs 8 10 5 a 1 x c 1 2 b 1 x c 1 c 1 0 6 a 2 x c 2 2 b 2 x c 2 c 2 0 7

any auv it is easy to prove that b n 2 4 a n c n 0 so the quadratic equation of one variable has two roots it should give up the root that deviates from movement orientation of target once it gets x c n y c n is computed by eq 1 3 2 planning the intercept path of the auv the artificial potential field method priyadarshi biplab et al 2019 luo et al 2015 solari et al 2016 is adopted to plan the intercept path from auv to the possible intercept point the artificial potential field method is a simple and practical path planning algorithm which is a gradient descent method essentially compared with other path planning algorithms the artificial potential field method has the advantages of small computation amount fast operation speed strong real time obstacle avoidance and smooth and feasible path is finally obtained because of its fast operating speed and real time obstacle avoidance the interception task can be completed more quickly in the process of planning the intercept path of auv the surrounding environment is abstracted into a kind of artificial potential field the potential field generated by obstacles is called the repulsion potential field where it is not zero only within the certain range of obstacles and the rest of position is zero in the ppi method the predicting intercept point generates the gravitational potential field which fills the whole environment and the potential field value is the global minimum the potential field at any point in the space is superposition of the gravitational potential field and the repulsion potential field fig 5 shows the multi auv force analysis diagram at i time in the ppi method gravitational potential field point of the nth auv is the nth intercept point calculated by the previous step the repulsive force is generated by the nth obstacle is f r e p n i the gravitation and the repulsive force on the nth auv are f a t t n i and f r e p n i eq 11 and 12 give the total potential field and corresponding resultant force of the nth auv among them f a t t n i f r e p n i and f n i respectively represent the gravitation the repulsive force and resultant force of the nth auv u a t t n i u r e p n i and u n i represent the corresponding gravitational potential field repulsive potential field and total potential field in the process of planning intercept path auv determines next position by searching for the fastest decreasing direction of potential field since the potential field generated by predicting intercept point is global minimum multi auv move towards their own intercept point 11 u n i u a t t n i u r e p n i 12 f n i u n i u a t t n i u r e p n i f a t t n i f r e p n i the main defect of the artificial potential field method is the local extremum problem mabrouk and mcinnes 2008 rostami et al 2019 when auv is located in the local extremum area it cannot continue to move forward because it cannot search the direction of the falling potential field but this paper sets the changeable environment auv just waits for the unit sampling time to change position of moving target when it occurs the local extremum and the problem can be solved automatically 4 simulation results and analysis for guaranteeing security under the harbour when a multi auv system detects a hostile target through sonar sensors its main task is to intercept the target effectively to ensure successful interception of the moving target in the changeable and complicated underwater environment the speed of each auv should not be less than that of the moving target otherwise the interception will never occur in the process of simulation it uses the traditional tracking interception method to compare with the proposed ppi method the essential difference between ppi algorithm and the tracking interception method is that the gravitational potential field point is not same in the process of planning intercept path the traditional tracking interception method does not require prediction of intercept point and views the real time position of moving target as the gravitational potential field point and planning the intercept path is carried out the ppi method predicts the intercept point before planning the intercept path of auv and the intercept point is regarded as the gravitational potential field point then auv is planned intercept path since the ppi method makes a rough prediction of intercept point first the intercept point will not change if the trajectory of moving target remains unchanged in the process of planning intercept path of the auv however the real time position of moving target change frequently hence the ppi method has a higher interception efficiency than the tracking interception algorithm in theory simulations are conducted on the matlab platform to verify the effectiveness of algorithm the harbour environment is simplified auv and moving target are both regarded as particles the green trajectory represents the motion trajectory of target the red the blue and other colors trajectories represent the intercept path of multiple auvs in the working field the black objects represent obstacles the light blue arrow with both size and direction represents the ocean current 4 1 moving target interception for multi auv when the velocity of auv is greater than the speed of moving target in the 2 d ocean current environment with four auvs the ocean current is a constant current with a velocity of 0 5 m s and the direction of 180 the speed of moving target is 1 m s all four auvs have same velocity 1 2 m s and moving target is located in 5 12 originally without changing the above conditions four different scenarios are simulated by changing the initial positions of the four auvs table 1 shows the initial position of multi auv under four different scenarios fig 6 gives the simulation diagram of scenario 1 the original position of auv1 is 1 1 and its trajectory is yellow auv2 is located in 38 10 originally and its trajectory is blue the original position of auv3 is 0 40 and its trajectory is red auv4 is located in 35 33 originally and its trajectory is magenta as can be seen from fig 6 a the four auvs take the real time position of the moving target as the gravitational potential field point to plan their intercept paths respectively and finally auv4 intercepts moving target first by tracking interception method as can be seen from fig 6 b the four auvs calculate the possible intercept points respectively and consider them as the gravitational potential field points to plan their intercept paths they walk along the intercept paths while continuously monitoring the moving target the intercept points are re predicted and the intercept paths are re planned when the trajectory of the moving target changes finally auv2 intercepts the moving target first by the proposed ppi method in the actual underwater environment the existence of ocean current will have a certain impact on the interception results it affects the moving direction of the auv makes the intercept path longer and the intercept time slower for scenarios 1 by the proposed ppi method the intercept path is 19 2 meters and the intercept time is 16 seconds in the absence of ocean current and 20 4 meters and 17 seconds in the presence of ocean current the interception task can be accomplished effectively despite that the ocean current has some effect on the interception results table 2 shows the simulation results under the four different scenarios the interception problem of multi auv will be solved no matter using the tracking interception method or the proposed ppi algorithm when the velocity of the auv is greater than the speed of moving target as can be seen from table 2 the auv s intercept time and intercept path length using the proposed ppi method are lower than that the tracking interception method in the four different scenarios hence the interception efficiency of the proposed ppi algorithm is greatly improved compared with the tracking interception method 4 2 moving target interception for multi auv when the velocity of auv is equal to the speed of moving target in the 2 d ocean current environment with three auvs the ocean current is a constant current with a velocity of 0 3 m s and the direction of 90 the speed of moving target and all three auvs are 1 m s and moving target is located in 10 20 originally without changing the above conditions three different scenarios are simulated by changing the initial positions of the three auvs table 3 shows the initial position of multi auv under three different scenarios fig 7 gives the simulation diagram of scenario 1 the original position of auv1 is 1 1 and its trajectory is yellow auv2 is located in 38 10 originally and its trajectory is blue the original position of auv3 is 0 30 and its trajectory is red as can be seen from fig 7 a the interception assignment of multi auv is not completed eternally however fig 7 b shows that the interception task is completed efficiently by the proposed ppi method in the same environment and auv2 intercepts the moving target first table 4 gives the simulation results under the three different scenarios as can be seen from table 4 the tracking interception algorithm cannot accomplish the interception assignment in the three different scenarios however the proposed ppi method completes the interception task well 4 3 the moving target interception for inhomogeneous multi auv in 2 d underwater environment with ocean current in the real underwater environment auvs have different speeds and it is called inhomogeneous multi auv it assumes that the working field is the 2 d ocean current environment with three auvs the speed of auv1 is 1 m s its original position is 38 10 and its trajectory is blue auv2 is located in 0 40 originally its velocity is 1 2 m s and its trajectory is red the original position of auv3 is 35 33 its speed is 1 2 m s and its trajectory is magenta in the working field full of the constant ocean current with a velocity of 0 5 m s and the direction of 180 the speed of moving target is 1 m s and its original position is located in 10 15 fig 8 shows that the interception assignment can be completed well no matter using the tracking interception method or the proposed ppi method as can be seen from figs 8 and 9 either way the auv3 intercepts moving target first but the intercept time and path length of different method are not same the auv s intercept path length using the proposed ppi method saves six meters and the intercept time saves five seconds compared with the tracking interception method the effectiveness of the proposed ppi method is proved again 5 conclusion this paper mainly studies the interception problem of multiple auvs in the 2 d underwater environment with ocean current and the ppi method is proposed in the process of planning the intercept path of auv the gravitational potential field points selected by the tracking interception method and the ppi algorithm are different so the interception efficiency of the proposed ppi method is better than the tracking interception algorithm in theory simulation results verify this idea from three different cases when the velocity of auv is greater than the speed of moving target simulation results show that the interception efficiency of the proposed ppi method is dramatically improved than that of the tracking interception algorithm when the velocity of auv is equal to the speed of moving target it occurs the situation that any auv in the environment never intercepts moving target by the tracking interception method however the proposed ppi method solves this problem well finally in the underwater environment with inhomogeneous multi auv simulation results show that effectiveness of the ppi method again the future work will concentrate on extending the multi auv interception problem to three dimension underwater environment and continue to study the effectiveness of the ppi approach the main difficulty may be the prediction of intercept point in the later research and the method of predicting the intercept point used in this paper is not suitable for three dimension space it may use optimization algorithms to solve this problem but still needs further research to confirm credit authorship contribution statement

21232,when fluid flows through the underwater vehicles flow separation occurs and the flow separation generates eddy currents which in turn induce the pulsating pressure on the surfaces of underwater vehicles generating noise and making the underwater vehicle easy to expose we conducted research on this phenomenon taking cone column shell as the research object and based on the large eddy simulation les theory additionally the calculation results of each parameter such as grid scale of the structural surface grid structure and height of the first layer grid with different values were compared with the experimental values to determine the model simulation parameter values with the highest calculation accuracy furthermore the systematic numerical prediction method of pulsating pressure was supposed by the combination of numerical and experimental methods moreover accuracy of the prediction method was verified by experiments the prediction method provides a generally good reference basis and a simple tool for engineering applications keywords cone column shell pulsation pressure large eddy simulation method combination of numerical and experiment 1 introduction underwater vehicles play an increasingly important role in the development of marine resources as an important performance indicator the acoustic characteristics of underwater vehicles have gradually attracted attention from scholars in general underwater vehicle noise is mainly composed of mechanical noise propeller noise and hydrodynamic noise among them hydrodynamic noise of underwater vehicles mainly includes flow noise and flow induced vibration noise the former refers to the noise generated by turbulent pulsation pressure and the latter refers to the vibration radiation noise generated by pulsating pressure on the wall surface to excite elastic structure of the object surface blake 1986 although the hydrodynamic noise accounts for a small proportion of the total noise of underwater vehicles it cannot be considered that this underwater noise is meaningless because the compressibility of water is very small a small sound power can generate a large sound pressure in water and it will rise faster as the speed increases in the study of underwater vehicle noise hydrodynamic noise has gradually become a part that cannot be ignored zhang et al 2014 and fluctuating pressure is an important load for flow induced structural noise as mentioned earlier the separation of fluid flow is the source of pulsation pressure and hydrodynamic noise is mainly generated in boundary layer of turbulent flow boundary layer separation refers to the separation of fluid around an object causing fluid closest to surface of the object to flow in opposite or different directions and most often resulting in turbulence xu k yue p et al xu et al 2020 applied the boundary element method to determine the characteristics of the distributed flow around the airfoil group they performed direct numerical simulations to study turbulent dynamics of the separation bubble in downward curved channels the increase of backpressure gradient in boundary layer is the main reason for flow separation in boundary layer mehmood and usman 2018 jiang xue lian et al mollicone et al 2018 found that flow separation occurred in the boundary layer through experiments the time evolution of the velocity field and the vorticity field indicates that the vortices are generated and separated due to the flow separation the analysis results of hardial singh et al singh and arora 2019 show that promoting effect of swirling flow on pressure recovery can reach a certain swirling angle and then decrease it also helps to suppress flow separation the main difference between turbulence and laminar flow is the pulsation of velocity and pressure which causes the generation and radiation of flow noise flow velocity at each spatial position in the laminar flow is kept steady and its change is smooth and continuous while the flow velocity of each spatial point in the turbulent flow changes irregularly and pulsatingly since the motion of turbulence is pulsating it is difficult to study the physical quantity of such pulsations however from the perspective of the long term flow process the changes of pulsations also have certain regularities alciatore 1979 boundary layer theory in the field of fluid mechanics focuses on velocity distribution and frictional resistance of the boundary layer rather than pulsation characteristics of turbulence the turbulence pulsation of pressure is an interdisciplinary problem of fluid mechanics and acoustics how to accurately predict the pressure pulsation and hydrodynamic noise calculation caused by the turbulent boundary layer has not only practical application value but also has important theoretical significance in recent years a lot of research has been carried out internationally on the pulsating pressure of turbulent walls in order to simulate the noise caused by the flow and to develop a noise reduction strategy a more comprehensive understanding of the physical relationship between wall pressure and turbulence is required kim

chen et al 2018 developed a hybrid analysis numerical method to study the vibration characteristics of finite cylindrical shells with internal structures such as plates and other complex structures wang qingshan wang et al 2016 studied the internal vibration of the free surface of the ring and fan shaped plates and developed an improved fourier ritz method to study orthogonal circles with general boundary conditions the turbulent boundary layer pressure fluctuation is a time space distributed random pressure field unlike other random excitations the boundary pressure fluctuation has a convection characteristic due to these characteristics the theoretical analysis of the turbulent boundary layer pressure fluctuations and the response of the excitation structure vibration are difficult the wavenumber frequency spectrum analysis method developed since the 1970s opens up new avenues for solving this problem choi h and moin p choi and moin 1990 used a direct numerical simulation of the turbulent channel flow to obtain a three dimensional frequency wavenumber spectrum of wall pressure fluctuations based on the spalar allmaras sa turbulence model mahmoudnejad n and

tunnel proved the accuracy of the simulation results to reveal the noise generation mechanism from these flows using the scaled sail hull with part of a submarine body from the above research we can find that people mainly use theoretical methods or experimental methods to study the mechanism of the pulsating pressure field caused by the turbulent velocity field pulsation and there is no systematic calculation method in our study the prediction method of pulsating pressure will be proposed by numerical calculation combined with model test using the simplified cone column shell model was studied by predicting the acoustic performance of the underwater vehicle in advance during the design process it has a forward looking effect to reduce the flow induced noise of the underwater vehicle and improve its concealment and find the acoustic problems in the structural design of the underwater vehicle in advance it plays a multiplier role in the acoustic design of underwater vehicles simultaneously measuring the pulsating pressure of the cone column shell structure through experiments can provide reference value for the research of pulsating pressure characteristics of the flow induced structure 2 calculation model and test model due to the difficulty in obtaining detailed information on tail of a submarine which is in service this study will use simplified cone column shell model as research object carry out numerical calculations and model tests and explore the prediction method of pulsating pressure by comparing the two the numerical calculation model is modeled according to a test model in a 1 1 ratio with a total length of 950 0 mm and a maximum radius of 100 0 mm the head is hemispherical with a radius of 100 0 mm the length of de flow section is 200 0 mm and the tail is a hemisphere with a radius of 50 0 mm tis study did not consider effects of different roughnesses because the experiments and calculations were carried out in accordance with ittc standards and the experiment model had the standard roughness the numerical calculation model is shown in fig 1 in model test 6 pressure sensors are installed on surface of the model corresponding to pressure sensors in the model test the same 6 points are selected as pressure measurement points on surface of the model in numerical calculation the experiment setup is the same as the test investigation of miao et al 2020 the details of the test setup are also described in miao et al 2020 installation positions of pressure sensors are shown in fig 2 and distance units are all in millimeters the calculation conditions in this paper are completely consistent with the test conditions in miao et al 2020 the relative position and the boundary conditions of the cone column shell and fluid domain in numerical calculation in star ccm are shown in fig 3 3 turbulence model 3 1 selection of turbulence model in the current numerical simulation method of turbulent flow the direct numerical simulation dns method is theoretically a realistic simulation of the flow but it is generally difficult to adopt because it requires too much computational hardware the reynolds average numerical simulation rans method can provide the average value of the flow but it cannot provide us with the flow pulsation information the large eddy simulation les method can better capture the pulsating pressure at each measurement point than the rans bose and park 2018 meng et al 2008 in eddy viscous turbulence model the k ε model can better simulate fully developed turbulent flows away from the wall while the k ω model is more widely applied to boundary layer problems under various pressure gradients in order to combine the advantages of the two models menter f r proposed the k ω sst turbulence model malge and pawar 2015 this model has high calculation accuracy for the fluid solid separation of the wall and has higher accuracy and credibility than the standard k ω model in a wide range of flow fields in this paper the les method and the rans method were compared to verify that conclusion and choose the best turbulence model which uses the industry recommended k ω sst turbulence model the discrete fluid domain uses 4 84 million structured grids the surface of the cone column shell is dispersed by a grid of 2 0 mm scale and the grid around the flow field is dispersed by a grid of 4 0 mm scale in star ccm the calculated speed is 4 62 m s and the time step is taken to be consistent with the test sampling step which is 3 90625 10 5 seconds the les method and the rans method were used to calculate the pressure changes on the 6 measuring points of the model comparisons of the calculation results for the two turbulence models are shown in fig 4 δ p in the figure is the difference between the pressure at the point where the speed is 4 62 m s and the point at which the speed is 0 m s from comparisons of the above time domain results it can be seen that two equation model such as the k ω sst is quite weak for the capture of pressure changes on the surface of the cone column shell and pressure on the surface of the cone column shell is basically unchanged that is the two equation turbulence model cannot capture high frequency pulsating pressure on the surface of the cone column shell at all however the les method can better capture the pulsating pressure at each measurement point therefore in the study of the pulsating pressure on the surface of cone column shells the turbulence model of numerical simulation of flow field can adopt the les method 3 2 large eddy simulation theory and the governing equation flow field of the model is numerically calculated by les and turbulent fluctuation pressure is extracted from simulation in the theory of les turbulent vortices are divided into two parts large scale vortex and small scale vortex the large scale vortex dominates the turbulent flow and energy transport while the small scale vortex is mainly responsible for the dissipation of turbulent energy effect in addition turbulence also includes the mutual momentum and energy exchange of collision and fusion between the two vortices more specifically a filter function is established in the method which can filter out the small scale vortex the large scale vortex represents the average flow of turbulence which can be described by navier stokes equation n s the sub grid stress terms are added to the n s equation to show the effect of the small scale vortex on the flow field the les theory divides the turbulent flow into large scale and small scale vortices by spatial filtering 1 φ φ φ where φ is a transient flow variable φ is a large scale vortex obtained by filtering and φ is an unsolvable sub grid variable the first step in the les is to decompose the flow variables into large scale vortices and small scale vortices through filtering operation the spatial filtering process can be expressed as follows 2 φ x d φ x g x x δ d x g x x δ represents the filter function and needs to meet 3 φ x d φ x g x x δ d x where d represents the calculation area of the flow field x and x are respectively vectors before and after filtering and δ is filter bandwidth typical filter functions are box filter and guass filter the continuity equation filtered the incompressible ns equation by the filtering operation and can be written as 4 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 5 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j μ 2 u j x j 2 p x i τ i j x j where i j 1 2 3 ρ is the density of the fluid μ is dynamic viscosity coefficient of the fluid u i represents the filtered average velocity component associated with x i p represents the filtered average pressure τ i j u i u j u i u j is a sub grid scale reynolds stress τ i j can be decomposed by vortex adhesive sub grid model and the most widely used smagorinsky eddy viscosity model smagorinsky 1963 can be expressed as follows 6 τ i j 1 3 δ i j τ 33 2 μ t s i j ρ where δ i j is the kronecker function and μ t is the sub grid scale dynamic eddy viscosity coefficient 8 μ t ρ c s l 2 2 s i j s i j c s is a dimensionless constant l is the filter width l v 1 3 v is the volume of a grid cell to be calculated s i j is the reynolds scale strain tensor s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i and then the sub grid model is transformed into 9 τ i j 1 3 δ i j τ k k 2 c s l 2 2 s i j s i j s i j finally the n s equation is closed the flow of the les is fully realized and the n s equation is changed after replacing τ i j 10 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j 2 μ μ t ρ s i j x j x i p 1 3 δ i j u 3 u 3 based on the above equations complete flow field information can be solved for subsequent hydrodynamic noise calculations 4 simulation parameters of the model 4 1 frequency band of forecast numerical calculation of the pulsating pressure of the cone column shell is undoubtedly required to be carried out in time domain and calculated by pseudo steady state both in numerical calculations and in model tests a large amount of data will be obtained and more data will be generated when these data are transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain the advantage of a large amount of data is that there are sufficient research objects but the disadvantage is that it is easy to cover up issues that are of primary concern in the research therefore it is necessary to determine the frequency segment that is of interest to the project research to focus on the research focus and then find core problems to obtain correct conclusions before carrying out the numerical calculation of the system the first third mode natural frequencies and corresponding vibration modes can be obtained by modal analysis in abaqus of the cone column shell structure used in this paper as shown in table 1 and fig 5 where m n represent the axial wave number and the circumferential wave number respectively we can see from the modal analysis results that the low order wet mode of the cone column shell is mainly concentrated in the frequency range of 0 2000 hz and the amplitude of pulsating pressure will decrease as the frequency increases continuously so the pulsating pressure induced flow noise will mainly appear in the low frequency band taking this factor into account the frequency segment of interest is taken as 0 3000 hz in the study 4 2 grid scale of the structural surface surface mesh of geometry model is crucial for calculation of its flow load in numerical calculations for cone column shells the scale of surface mesh needs to be studied therefore we first compare the effect of different surface meshes on accuracy of the calculation in this paper the simulation value is compared with the experimental value if the error is too large the grid is encrypted and recalculated to reduce the calculation error the boundary layer has a great influence on calculation accuracy so this paper mainly encrypts the boundary layer grid the residuals gradually becoming smaller by iteratively calculates this method has little effect on the number of grids but can greatly improve the calculation accuracy according to the main dimensions of the cone cylinder shell structure and the maximum number of grids that the computer can withstand surface of the cone column shell was divided into grids of s 0 5 mm 1 0 mm 2 0 mm and 4 0 mm in star ccm when surface of the cone column shell is divided by a grid of s 0 5 mm which is the maximum number of grids that the computer we used can withstand surface meshing of the cone column shell at various grid scales is shown in fig 10 in this paper the sound pressure level at the pressure measurement points of the surface of the cone column shell on different surface mesh scales is calculated and these measurement point are mentioned in the previous article the calculation speed is v 1 26 m s turbulence model is les target frequency band is 0 3000 hz and height of the first layer mesh node on the surface of the shell is y 0 1 mm through the comparison of sound pressure level calculated values and experimental values of each measuring point of the cone column shell on different surface grid scales the optimal scale suitable for calculation of surface pressure of cone column shells is selected the comparison results are as fig 7 as can be seen from the comparison in the figure the calculation results have the same trend as the test data which can reflect the change of amplitude with frequency comparing the calculation results with different surface meshes it can be found that when surface of the cone column shell is divided by s 2 0 mm mesh the difference between the calculated results and the experimental values is the smallest when surface grid scale of the cone column shell is s 0 5 mm and s 1 0 mm the amplitude of the calculation result is small and it is difficult to reflect the sensitivity of the amplitude to the frequency which is different from the actual physical condition when the surface mesh scale is s 4 0 mm the predicted value of the pulsating pressure on surface of the cone column shell is too large therefore for the object studied in this paper surface grid scale of the cone column shell in the numerical calculation can take s 2 0 mm the percentage of surface grid scale in total length of cone column shell is a 6 a s l 2 950 0 2 4 3 grid structure after determining the surface mesh scale of the cone column shell the influence of the mesh division method is studied for the case where the surface mesh size is s 2 0 mm which is the best calculation accuracy that is to study the influence of two grid structures structured grid and unstructured grid on calculation results because one cube should be cut into two non cubes at lowest in star ccm when cutting a cube into non cubes the grid number for the unstructured grid is at least twice that of structured grid in the condition of the same parameters the calculation speed is v 1 26 m s turbulence model is les target frequency band is 0 3000 hz and height of the first layer mesh node on the surface of the shell is y 0 1 mm the comparison between the calculation results and the test data in the two cases is shown in fig 8 in the figure s 2 0mmuns means that surface of the cone column shell adopts a grid of 2 0 mm and the fluid domain adopts the unstructured grid the s 2 0 mm means that surface of the cone column shell adopts a grid of 2 0 mm and the fluid domain adopts the structured grid as can be seen from the comparison of the above figure the surface scale of the navigation body is 2 0 mm but when the grid form of the discrete fluid domain is different there is a obviously difference between the calculation results in the unstructured grid discrete fluid domain there is a large deviation between the calculated results and the experimental values however with the structured grid discrete fluid domain the calculated results agree well with the experimental values therefore for the calculation of the pulsating pressure on the surface of cone column shells it is recommended to use a structured grid discrete fluid domain 4 4 height of the first layer grid height of the first layer of mesh nodes on the surface of the cone column shell has a significant influence on the calculation of the surface pressure gradient moreover there is no unified suggestion for this parameter in the current research of cfd therefore for different research objects the height of the first layer of grid nodes has different optimal value ranges an unsuitable first layer of grid node height will affect the fluid load under circumstances of the study and first layer of grid node height is more important for the calculation of surface pulsation pressure therefore it is necessary to further study the height of the first layer of grid nodes on surface of the cone column shell the calculation speed is v 1 26 m s turbulence model is les target frequency band is 0 3000 hz and discrete fluid domain is a structured grid three different first layer grid node heights were used in the study y 1 0 mm 0 1 mm and 0 001 mm respectively in star ccm the calculation results in three different cases and experimental results are compared as shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the comparison results in the figure that when height of the first layer mesh node is y 1 0 mm there is a significant gap between the calculation result and the experimental result the reason may be that excessive normal distance leads to inaccuracy in calculation of the pressure gradient when height of the first layer mesh node is y 0 1 mm the error between the calculation result and the test data is significantly reduced compared with the case of y 1 0 mm it is shown that reducing height of the first layer of mesh nodes can more accurately capture pressure changes near the wall surface and effectively improve calculation accuracy continue to reduce height of the first layer of grid nodes in the fluid domain when the distance is y 0 001 mm the accuracy of calculation results is not further improved on the contrary the accuracy of the numerical calculation results is lower than y 0 1 mm and the trend of the results is inconsistent with the trend of the experimental data and there is an oscillation phenomenon the above situation shows that reducing height of the first layer of grid nodes is helpful for improving the calculation accuracy however height of the first layer of grid nodes in the fluid domain is not always inversely proportional to the accuracy of the calculation result but there is a reasonable value in the research of

21232,when fluid flows through the underwater vehicles flow separation occurs and the flow separation generates eddy currents which in turn induce the pulsating pressure on the surfaces of underwater vehicles generating noise and making the underwater vehicle easy to expose we conducted research on this phenomenon taking cone column shell as the research object and based on the large eddy simulation les theory additionally the calculation results of each parameter such as grid scale of the structural surface grid structure and height of the first layer grid with different values were compared with the experimental values to determine the model simulation parameter values with the highest calculation accuracy furthermore the systematic numerical prediction method of pulsating pressure was supposed by the combination of numerical and experimental methods moreover accuracy of the prediction method was verified by experiments the prediction method provides a generally good reference basis and a simple tool for engineering applications keywords cone column shell pulsation pressure large eddy simulation method combination of numerical and experiment 1 introduction underwater vehicles play an increasingly important role in the development of marine resources as an important performance indicator the acoustic characteristics of underwater vehicles have gradually attracted attention from scholars in general underwater vehicle noise is mainly composed of mechanical noise propeller noise and hydrodynamic noise among them hydrodynamic noise of underwater vehicles mainly includes flow noise and flow induced vibration noise the former refers to the noise generated by turbulent pulsation pressure and the latter refers to the vibration radiation noise generated by pulsating pressure on the wall surface to excite elastic structure of the object surface blake 1986 although the hydrodynamic noise accounts for a small proportion of the total noise of underwater vehicles it cannot be considered that this underwater noise is meaningless because the compressibility of water is very small a small sound power can generate a large sound pressure in water and it will rise faster as the speed increases in the study of underwater vehicle noise hydrodynamic noise has gradually become a part that cannot be ignored zhang et al 2014 and fluctuating pressure is an important load for flow induced structural noise as mentioned earlier the separation of fluid flow is the source of pulsation pressure and hydrodynamic noise is mainly generated in boundary layer of turbulent flow boundary layer separation refers to the separation of fluid around an object causing fluid closest to surface of the object to flow in opposite or different directions and most often resulting in turbulence xu k yue p et al xu et al 2020 applied the boundary element method to determine the characteristics of the distributed flow around the airfoil group they performed direct numerical simulations to study turbulent dynamics of the separation bubble in downward curved channels the increase of backpressure gradient in boundary layer is the main reason for flow separation in boundary layer mehmood and usman 2018 jiang xue lian et al mollicone et al 2018 found that flow separation occurred in the boundary layer through experiments the time evolution of the velocity field and the vorticity field indicates that the vortices are generated and separated due to the flow separation the analysis results of hardial singh et al singh and arora 2019 show that promoting effect of swirling flow on pressure recovery can reach a certain swirling angle and then decrease it also helps to suppress flow separation the main difference between turbulence and laminar flow is the pulsation of velocity and pressure which causes the generation and radiation of flow noise flow velocity at each spatial position in the laminar flow is kept steady and its change is smooth and continuous while the flow velocity of each spatial point in the turbulent flow changes irregularly and pulsatingly since the motion of turbulence is pulsating it is difficult to study the physical quantity of such pulsations however from the perspective of the long term flow process the changes of pulsations also have certain regularities alciatore 1979 boundary layer theory in the field of fluid mechanics focuses on velocity distribution and frictional resistance of the boundary layer rather than pulsation characteristics of turbulence the turbulence pulsation of pressure is an interdisciplinary problem of fluid mechanics and acoustics how to accurately predict the pressure pulsation and hydrodynamic noise calculation caused by the turbulent boundary layer has not only practical application value but also has important theoretical significance in recent years a lot of research has been carried out internationally on the pulsating pressure of turbulent walls in order to simulate the noise caused by the flow and to develop a noise reduction strategy a more comprehensive understanding of the physical relationship between wall pressure and turbulence is required kim j choi j and sung h j kim et al 2002 obtained the relationship between wall pressure fluctuation and flow vorticity in the turbulent boundary layer by direct numerical simulation hu n reiche n and ewert r hu et al 2017 used a synthetic random turbulence generated by the fast random particle grid method to numerically simulate the turbulent boundary layer at zero pressure gradient to determine fluctuating pressure a poisson equation is solved with an unsteadyright hand side source term derived from the synthetic turbulence realisation kim j and sung h j kim and sung 2006 studied the effects

extrapolation to improve accuracy of simulation li et al 2019 2020 proposed a jacobi ritz method for dynamic analysis of composite laminated flat shells under arbitrary boundary conditions chen meixia chen et al 2018 developed a hybrid analysis numerical method to study the vibration characteristics of finite cylindrical shells with internal structures such as plates and other complex structures wang qingshan wang et al 2016 studied the internal vibration of the free surface of the ring and fan shaped plates and developed an improved fourier ritz method to study orthogonal circles with general boundary conditions the turbulent boundary layer pressure fluctuation is a time space distributed random pressure field unlike other random excitations the boundary pressure fluctuation has a convection characteristic due to these characteristics the theoretical analysis of the turbulent boundary layer pressure fluctuations and the response of the excitation structure vibration are difficult the wavenumber frequency spectrum analysis method developed since the 1970s opens up new avenues for solving this problem choi h and moin p choi and moin 1990 used a direct numerical simulation of the turbulent channel flow to obtain a three dimensional frequency wavenumber spectrum of wall pressure fluctuations based on the spalar allmaras sa turbulence model mahmoudnejad n and hoffmann k a mahmoudnejad and hoffmann 2012 used the separation eddy simulation method to estimate wall pressure fluctuations and compared them with several single point wall pressure spectrum empirical models des results in the low frequency region are higher compared to the empirical results camussi r and marco a d camussi and marco 2015 used the forcing function knowledge related to the pressure wave spectrum of the boundary layer to model and predict the acoustic vibration of the structure under the relevant pulse dynamics and obtained the influence of the supersonic turbulent

tunnel proved the accuracy of the simulation results to reveal the noise generation mechanism from these flows using the scaled sail hull with part of a submarine body from the above research we can find that people mainly use theoretical methods or experimental methods to study the mechanism of the pulsating pressure field caused by the turbulent velocity field pulsation and there is no systematic calculation method in our study the prediction method of pulsating pressure will be proposed by numerical calculation combined with model test using the simplified cone column shell model was studied by predicting the acoustic performance of the underwater vehicle in advance during the design process it has a forward looking effect to reduce the flow induced noise of the underwater vehicle and improve its concealment and find the acoustic problems in the structural design of the underwater vehicle in advance it plays a multiplier role in the acoustic design of underwater vehicles simultaneously measuring the pulsating pressure of the cone column shell structure through experiments can provide reference value for the research of pulsating pressure characteristics of the flow induced structure 2 calculation model and test model due to the difficulty in obtaining detailed information on tail of a submarine which is in service this study will use simplified cone column shell model as research object carry out numerical calculations and model tests and explore the prediction method of pulsating pressure by comparing the two the numerical calculation model is modeled according to a test model in a 1 1 ratio with a total length of 950 0 mm and a maximum radius of 100 0 mm the head is hemispherical with a radius of 100 0 mm the length of de flow section is 200 0 mm and the tail is a hemisphere with a radius of 50 0 mm tis study did not consider effects of different roughnesses because the experiments and calculations were carried out in accordance with ittc standards and the experiment model had the standard roughness the numerical calculation model is shown in fig 1 in model test 6 pressure sensors are installed on surface of the model corresponding to pressure sensors in the model test the same 6 points are selected as pressure measurement points on surface of the model in numerical calculation the experiment setup is the same as the test investigation of miao et al 2020 the details of the test setup are also described in miao et al 2020 installation positions of pressure sensors are shown in fig 2 and distance units are all in millimeters the calculation conditions in this paper are completely consistent with the test conditions in miao et al 2020 the relative position and the boundary conditions of the cone column shell and fluid domain in numerical calculation in star ccm are shown in fig 3 3 turbulence model 3 1 selection of turbulence model in the current numerical simulation method of turbulent flow the direct numerical simulation dns method is theoretically a realistic simulation of the flow but it is generally difficult to adopt because it requires too much computational hardware the reynolds average numerical simulation rans method can provide the average value of the flow but it cannot provide us with the flow pulsation information the large eddy simulation les method can better capture the pulsating pressure at each measurement point than the rans bose and park 2018 meng et al 2008 in eddy viscous turbulence model the k ε model can better simulate fully developed turbulent flows away from the wall while the k ω model is more widely applied to boundary layer problems under various pressure gradients in order to combine the advantages of the two models menter f r proposed the k ω sst turbulence model malge and pawar 2015 this model has high calculation accuracy for the fluid solid separation of the wall and has higher accuracy and credibility than the standard k ω model in a wide range of flow fields in this paper the les method and the rans method were compared to verify that conclusion and choose the best turbulence model which uses the industry recommended k ω sst turbulence model the discrete fluid domain uses 4 84 million structured grids the surface of the cone column shell is dispersed by a grid of 2 0 mm scale and the grid around the flow field is dispersed by a grid of 4 0 mm scale in star ccm the calculated speed is 4 62 m s and the time step is taken to be consistent with the test sampling step which is 3 90625 10 5 seconds the les method and the rans method were used to calculate the pressure changes on the 6 measuring points of the model comparisons of the calculation results for the two turbulence models are shown in fig 4 δ p in the figure is the difference between the pressure at the point where the speed is 4 62 m s and the point at which the speed is 0 m s from comparisons of the above time domain results it can be seen that two equation model such as the k ω sst is quite weak for the capture of pressure changes on the surface of the cone column shell and pressure on the surface of the cone column shell is basically unchanged that is the two equation turbulence model cannot capture high frequency pulsating pressure on the surface of the cone column shell at all however the les method can better capture the pulsating pressure at each measurement point therefore in the study of the pulsating pressure on the surface of cone column shells the turbulence model of numerical simulation of flow field can adopt the les method 3 2 large eddy simulation theory and the governing equation flow field of the model is numerically calculated by les and turbulent fluctuation pressure is extracted from simulation in the theory of les turbulent vortices are divided into two parts large scale vortex and small scale vortex the large scale vortex dominates the turbulent flow and energy transport while the small scale vortex is mainly responsible for the dissipation of turbulent energy effect in addition turbulence also includes the mutual momentum and energy exchange of collision and fusion between the two vortices more specifically a filter function is established in the method which can filter out the small scale vortex the large scale vortex represents the average flow of turbulence which can be described by navier stokes equation n s the sub grid stress terms are added to the n s equation to show the effect of the small scale vortex on the flow field the les theory divides the turbulent flow into large scale and small scale vortices by spatial filtering 1 φ φ φ where φ is a transient flow variable φ is a large scale vortex obtained by filtering and φ is an unsolvable sub grid variable the first step in the les is to decompose the flow variables into large scale vortices and small scale vortices through filtering operation the spatial filtering process can be expressed as follows 2 φ x d φ x g x x δ d x g x x δ represents the filter function and needs to meet 3 φ x d φ x g x x δ d x where d represents the calculation area of the flow field x and x are respectively vectors before and after filtering and δ is filter bandwidth typical filter functions are box filter and guass filter the continuity equation filtered the incompressible ns equation by the filtering operation and can be written as 4 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 5 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j μ 2 u j x j 2 p x i τ i j x j where i j 1 2 3 ρ is the density of the fluid μ is dynamic viscosity coefficient of the fluid u i represents the filtered average velocity component associated with x i p represents the filtered average pressure τ i j u i u j u i u j is a sub grid scale reynolds stress τ i j can be decomposed by vortex adhesive sub grid model and the most widely used smagorinsky eddy viscosity model smagorinsky 1963 can be expressed as follows 6 τ i j 1 3 δ i j τ 33 2 μ t s i j ρ where δ i j is the kronecker function and μ t is the sub grid scale dynamic eddy viscosity coefficient 8 μ t ρ c s l 2 2 s i j s i j c s is a dimensionless constant l is the filter width l v 1 3 v is the volume of a grid cell to be calculated s i j is the reynolds scale strain tensor s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i and then the sub grid model is transformed into 9 τ i j 1 3 δ i j τ k k 2 c s l 2 2 s i j s i j s i j finally the n s equation is closed the flow of the les is fully realized and the n s equation is changed after replacing τ i j 10 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j 2 μ μ t ρ s i j x j x i p 1 3 δ i j u 3 u 3 based on the above equations complete flow field information can be solved for subsequent hydrodynamic noise calculations 4 simulation parameters of the model 4 1 frequency band of forecast numerical calculation of the pulsating pressure of the cone column shell is undoubtedly required to be carried out in time domain and calculated by pseudo steady state both in numerical calculations and in model tests a large amount of data will be obtained and more data will be generated when these data are transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain the advantage of a large amount of data is that there are sufficient research objects but the disadvantage is that it is easy to cover up issues that are of primary concern in the research therefore it is necessary to determine the frequency segment that is of interest to the project research to focus on the research focus and then find core problems to obtain correct conclusions before carrying out the numerical calculation of the system the first third mode natural frequencies and corresponding vibration modes can be obtained by modal analysis in abaqus of the cone column shell structure used in this paper as shown in table 1 and fig 5 where m n represent the axial wave number and the circumferential wave number respectively we can see from the modal analysis results that the low order wet mode of the cone column shell is mainly concentrated in the frequency range of 0 2000 hz and the amplitude of pulsating pressure will decrease as the frequency increases continuously so the pulsating pressure induced flow noise will mainly appear in the low frequency band taking this factor into account the frequency segment of interest is taken as 0 3000 hz in the study 4 2 grid scale of the structural surface surface mesh of geometry model is crucial for calculation of its flow load in numerical calculations for cone column shells the scale of surface mesh needs to be studied therefore we first compare the effect of different surface meshes on accuracy of the calculation in this paper the simulation value is compared with the experimental value if the error is too large the grid is encrypted and recalculated to reduce the calculation error the boundary layer has a great influence on calculation accuracy so this paper mainly encrypts the boundary layer grid the residuals gradually becoming smaller by iteratively calculates this method has little effect on the number of grids but can greatly improve the calculation accuracy according to the main dimensions of the cone cylinder shell structure and the maximum number of grids that the computer can withstand surface of the cone column shell was divided into grids of s 0 5 mm 1 0 mm 2 0 mm and 4 0 mm in star ccm when surface of the cone column shell is divided by a grid of s 0 5 mm which is the maximum number of grids that the computer we used can withstand surface meshing of the cone column shell at various grid scales is shown in fig 10 in this paper the sound pressure level at the pressure measurement points of the surface of the cone column shell on different surface mesh scales is calculated and these measurement point are mentioned in the previous article the calculation speed is v 1 26 m s turbulence model is les target frequency band is 0 3000 hz and height of the first layer mesh node on the surface of the shell is y 0 1 mm through the comparison of sound pressure level calculated values and experimental values of each measuring point of the cone column shell on different surface grid scales the optimal scale suitable for calculation of surface pressure of cone column shells is selected the comparison results are as fig 7 as can be seen from the comparison in the figure the calculation results have the same trend as the test data which can reflect the change of amplitude with frequency comparing the calculation results with different surface meshes it can be found that when surface of the cone column shell is divided by s 2 0 mm mesh the difference between the calculated results and the experimental values is the smallest when surface grid scale of the cone column shell is s 0 5 mm and s 1 0 mm the amplitude of the calculation

characteristics of the flow field around the tfp and tap breakwaters are markedly different the results of this study provide necessary theoretical guidance for engineering applications of permeable plate type breakwaters keywords permeable plate breakwater transmission coefficient reflection coefficient wave force flow field 1 introduction due to disadvantages such as high engineering costs difficult construction processes and the obstructed free exchange of water bodies the traditional gravity breakwater no longer meets the structural and functional requirements of modern ports li et al 2011 castellino et al 2018 kundapura et al 2019 the permeable plate breakwater a new type of structure for breakwaters has the advantages of a low requirement for foundation conditions excellent capacity for the free exchange of water ecological and environmental protection and a simple structure and thus has been favored by many experts and scholars guo et al 2011 cheng et al 2016 the study of permeable plate breakwaters began in the middle of last century mainly as discussion of their wave attenuation performance and flow field characteristics zhang et al 2013 carmigniani et al 2019 he et al 2019 in view of the influence of tidal changes the application of the single layer plate breakwater is limited in areas with a large tidal range more recently double layer and multilayer plate breakwaters have attracted extensive attention and research liu et al 2014 fang et al 2017 2018 gu et al 2017 the wave attenuation effect of the double layer breakwater is better than that of single layer breakwater liu et al 2014 he et al 2018 the half plate wide perforations on the upwave side of the breakwater can enhance the wave attenuation effect chen and zhang 2011 perforations at the proper locations of plate type breakwaters could help reduce the wave transmission coefficient and wave pressure martinelli et al 2018 zang et al 2018 the results of this research can provide a theoretical reference for studying other permeable plate type breakwaters remarkable achievements have been made in the field of permeable plate type breakwaters gayen and mondal 2016 since the successful development and application of the semicircular breakwater in japan in the early 1990s considerable research has been done on the esthetic semicircular breakwater showing that an arc design could improve structural stability and mechanical performance budime et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 inspired by the semicircular breakwater considering the advantages of the plate type breakwater wang et al 2016 developed an arc plate breakwater consisting of arc plates with various curvatures the research results show that the transmission coefficient of the arc plate breakwater increases with the relative wave height and the period of the incident wave and the wave attenuation effect at the still water level and slightly above the still water level exceeds that of the plate type breakwater wang et al 2016 li et al 2020 when the relative width is 0 2 the transmission coefficient can be kept below 0 5 wang et al 2016 li et al 2019 when the ratio of the submergence depth to the wave height is 0 05 the wave attenuation effect of an arc plate breakwater is approximately 50 higher than that of a plate type breakwater wang et al 2019 most research on permeable arc plate breakwaters has focused on either the wave attenuation performance or the structural mechanical behavior the tap breakwater as a new type of structure shows good wave dissipation performance under certain conditions wang et al 2019 as is known to all the stability and safety of the breakwater are quite important however previous studies mostly focused on its wave attenuation characteristics and few discussions were carried out on its wave pressure wave force and wave surface deformation wang et al 2016 because the two arc plates near the water surface can dissipate most of the incident wave energy wang et al 2016 so the tap and tfp breakwaters are chosen in this manuscript based on this the paper intends to perform a more systematic physical model test to quantitatively compare the hydrodynamic characteristics of the tfp and tap breakwaters in terms of wave attenuation performance wave pressure wave force and wave surface deformation to provide a theoretical reference for engineering applications 2 physical model test 2 1 experimental setup the tests were conducted in the large wave flume of the port channel and coast engineering experimental center at ludong university the flume is 60 0 m in length 2 0 m in width and 1 8 m in height with a maximum working water depth of 1 5 m a piston type wavemaker driven by a servomotor is installed in front of the flume with a 2 0 m wide piston that can simulate wave heights from 0 05 m to 0 6 m regular and irregular waves with periods of 0 5 5 0 s can be generated this test device features active wave absorption gravel average gravel particle size 100 150 mm was placed at the end of the tank to eliminate wall end reflection the slope of the gravel beach was 1 5 with a length of 6 8 m and height of 1 3 m the physical tank was divided into two small tanks one with a width of 0 8 m and the other with a width of 1 2 m the experimental study was carried out in a small 0 8 m wide tank the wave height and wave pressure on the preamble breakwater were measured using ds30 multipoint acquisition systems with a sampling resolution of 50 hz the test of the wave attenuation characteristics of the permeable plate type breakwaters was based on goda s two point method goda and suzuki 1976 the 1 and 2 wave height recorders spaced 0 74 m apart were installed on the wave facing side of the model to calculate the wave reflection coefficient the 2 wave gauge was 4 46 m from the front end of the open breakwater the 3 and 4 wave height recorders spaced 0 74 m apart were deployed on the back wave side of the model to calculate the wave transmission coefficient the 3 wave gauge was 4 46 m from the back end of the open breakwater the layout of the flume test is shown in fig 1 using the permeable tap breakwater model as an example the test model includes a tfp breakwater fig 2 a and b tap breakwater fig 2c and d the tap breakwater model has an arc height of r 0 05 m for the tap and tfp breakwaters the plate width w in the wave facing direction and plate length l 2 in the flume width direction were 0 45 m and 0 79 m respectively fig 2b and d the plate thickness was 0 01 m the perforations on the four corners of the permeable breakwater model were used to weld four threaded rods at the bottom of the flume to ensure the stability of the permeable breakwater model during the test threaded rods were used as fasteners so that the position of the flat plate or arc plate could be adjusted by rotating the nuts allowing for the submergence depth and the plate spacing of the permeable breakwater to be adjusted during the test fig 2a and c the spacing between the two adjacent pressure sensors was 0 052 m and 0 055 m for the tfp and tap breakwaters respectively fig 2b and d on the upper and lower surfaces of the upper and lower plates in the tfp and tap breakwaters 24 pressure sensors with a diameter of 0 02 m were arranged at equal intervals along both sides of the centerline of the plate the layout of the pressure sensors is shown in fig 3 these pressure sensors were positioned as follows those numbered 1 to 6 monitored the pressure on the lower surface of the upper plate those numbered 7 to 12 monitored the pressure on the upper surface of the upper plate those numbered 13 to 18 monitored the pressure on the lower surface of the lower plate and those numbered 19 to 24 monitored the pressure on the upper surface of the lower plate the distance between the pressure sensor and the centerline of the plate was 0 02 m 2 2 test parameters regular waves were used in the test in the adopted actual sea area the water depth was 15 m the wave heights are 1 50 m and 2 50 m the wave periods are 6 s 7 s 8 s 9 s and 10 s if the model scale is 1 25 the water depth d is 0 60 m and the wave periods t are 1 2 s 1 4 s 1 6 s 1 8 s and 2 0 s respectively and the wave heights h are 0 06 m and 0 10 m for various submergence depths the relative relationships between the upper and lower plates and the still water level are shown in fig 4 the submergence depths h were 0 03 m indicating that the tangent line of the vertex of the upper arc plate or the upper surface of the upper plate is 0 03 m above the still water level 0 m indicating that the tangent line of the vertex of the upper arc plate or the upper surface of the upper plate is located at the still water level and 0 03 m indicating that the tangent line of the vertex of the upper arc plate or the upper surface of the upper plate is 0 03 m below the still water level the plate spacing s was 0 05 m 0 07 m and 0 09 m the detailed parameters of the test are shown in table 1 one hundred test groups were designed with various combinations of wave height period submergence depth and plate spacing table 2 to minimize the test error three tests were performed for each test group and the final test results are based on the average value of the three test results 3 results in this section the differences in the hydrodynamic characteristics of the tfp breakwater and the tap breakwater are discussed in terms of the wave surface elevation transmission coefficient reflection coefficient wave pressure wave force and flow field characteristics 3 1 wave elevation fig 5 shows the changes in wave elevation on the back wave side monitored by the 3 and 4 wave gauges for wave height h 0 06 m wave period t 1 8 s and relative submergence depths h d 0 05 0 and 0 05 the results show that when the tfp and tap breakwaters are in the emerged state h d 0 05 and at the still water level h d 0 the wave elevations on the back wave side of the tap breakwater are smaller than those of the tfp breakwater fig 5a and b in the emerged state the wave elevations monitored by the 3 and 4 wave gauges of the tap breakwater are 10 1 and 5 0 smaller than those of the tfp breakwater respectively fig 5a at the still water level the wave elevations from the 3 and 4 wave gauges of the tap breakwater are 3 8 and 7 6 smaller than those of the tfp breakwater respectively fig 5b in the submerged state h d 0 05 the wave elevation from the 3 and 4 wave gauges of the tap breakwater are 2 6 and 4 7 larger than those of the tfp breakwater respectively fig 5c the possible reasons of the above phenomenon are as follows in the emerged state the height below the still water level for the tap breakwater is higher than that for the tfp breakwater so the tap breakwater has a stronger blocking effect on waves and less transmitted waves than the tfp breakwater however in the submerged state the tap breakwater is farther away from the still water level than the tfp breakwater and its blocking effect on waves is weakened so the transmitted waves of the tap breakwater are larger than the tfp breakwater with different submergence depths the relative relationships between the tap and tfp breakwaters and the still water level can be referred to fig 4 there are some differences in the characteristics of the time histories of wave elevations on the back wave side of the tfp and tap breakwaters in the emerged state h d 0 05 the wave elevations for the tap breakwater are smoother than that for the tfp breakwater at the still water level h d 0 the fluctuation at the crest for the tap breakwater is more pronounced than that for the tfp breakwater in the submerged state h d 0 05 the fluctuation at the crest from the 3 wave gauge for the tfp breakwater is more remarkable than that for the tap breakwater the fluctuations of the wave elevation from the 4 wave gauge for the tfp and tap breakwaters were both significant 3 2 transmission coefficient fig 6 compares the wave transmission coefficient between the permeable tfp and tap breakwaters for d 0 60 m relative wave height h d 0 10 and 0 17 relative plate spacing s d 0 08 0 12 and 0 15 and relative submergence depths h d 0 05 0 and 0 05 the results show that under various submergence conditions the wave transmission coefficients of these two permeable plate type breakwaters are significantly different when the permeable breakwaters are in the emerged state h d 0 05 fig 6a and b and are located at the still water level h d 0 fig 6c and d under more than 80 of working conditions the wave transmission coefficient of the permeable tap breakwater is lower than that of the permeable tfp breakwater with this phenomenon being more obvious in the emerged state h d 0 05 fig 6a b c and d the wave transmission coefficients of the tap breakwater are reduced by a maximum of 34 5 and 25 compared with those of the tfp breakwater in the emerged state and at the still water level respectively fig 6a b c and d in the submerged state h d 0 05 the wave transmission coefficient of the permeable tfp breakwater is a maximum of 24 3 less than that of the permeable tap breakwater fig 6e and f the above phenomenon occurs because when in the emerged state h d 0 05 and at the still water level h d 0 the tfp breakwater causes waves to undergo shallow water deformation and breaks by disrupting the vertical motion of the water particles thereby dissipating wave energy by contrast the tap breakwater can disrupt both the transverse and vertical motions of water particles resulting in a shallow water effect on the waves which in turn results in more intense wave breaking and more significant wave energy dissipation according to the energy conservation principle and combined with the reflected waves it can be seen that the tap breakwater with greater energy consumption has smaller transmission waves in the emerged state h d 0 05 under the condition of different relative plate spacing the wave transmission coefficient of the permeable tap breakwater is lower than that of the permeable tfp breakwater when the relative plate spacing s d 0 08 the maximum percentage reduction in the wave transmission coefficient is 34 5 which appears at the condition of h d 0 10 and w l 0 17 fig 6a and b when the relative plate spacing s d 0 12 and 0 15 the maximum percentage reductions of the wave transmission coefficient were 30 and 25 respectively the greatest changes occurred at the condition of h d 0 10 and w l 0 21 fig 6g and h and h d 0 10 and w l 0 17 fig 6i and j 3 3 reflection coefficient fig 7 presents a comparison of the wave reflection coefficient of the tfp and tap breakwaters for d 0 60 m relative wave height h d 0 10 and 0 17 relative plate spacing s d 0 08 0 12 and 0 15 and relative submergence depths h d 0 05 0 and 0 05 the results show that under various submergence conditions the wave transmission coefficient of these two permeable plate type breakwaters increases in a fluctuating tendency with the increase in the relative plate width fig 7a f under the three submergence conditions the wave reflection coefficient of the permeable tfp breakwater is greater than that of the permeable tap breakwater and there is a stronger wave reflection effect within the scope of this test the wave reflection coefficient of the permeable tfp breakwater showed an approximate maximum increase of 66 7 compared with the permeable tap breakwater fig 7a f in the emerged state h d 0 05 under more than 90 of working conditions the wave reflection coefficient of the permeable tap breakwater is significantly less than that of the permeable tfp breakwater at the different relative plate spacing when the relative plate spacing s d 0 08 the maximum percentage reduction in the wave reflection coefficient is 47 6 which appears at the condition of h d 0 17 and w l 0 10 fig 7a and b when the relative plate spacing was s d 0 12 and 0 15 the maximum percentage reductions of the wave reflection coefficient were 46 3 and 41 0 respectively the largest differences occurred at the conditions of h d 0 17 and w l 0 21 fig 7g and h and h d 0 10 and w l 0 12 fig 7i and j 3 4 wave pressure fig 8 depicts envelope diagrams of the wave pressure at various surface locations of the permeable tfp and tap breakwaters for wave period t 1 2 s wave height h 0 10 m plate spacing s 0 05 m and relative submergence depths h d 0 05 0 and 0 05 the horizontal coordinate is the ratio of the horizontal distance between the pressure measuring points and the wave facing edge of the plate or arc plate over the plate width the results show that under various submergence conditions the differences in wave pressure distribution of the upper and lower surfaces between the tfp and tap breakwater is significant when the plate surface of the permeable plate type breakwater is 0 04 m below the still water level this surface of the tfp breakwater is subjected to positive and negative wave pressures that are both higher than those on the corresponding surface of the permeable tap breakwater under the same working conditions fig 8a b and c that is for the permeable plate breakwater the lower surface of the lower plate in the emerged state h d 0 05 and at the still water level h d 0 the lower surface of the upper plate in the submerged state h d 0 05 and the upper and lower surfaces of the lower plate in the submerged state h d 0 05 are all subjected to wave pressures that are higher than those for the tap breakwater by 2 20 at the lower surface of the lower plate in the emerged state to 44 4 at the lower surface of the lower plate at the still water level fig 8a b and c except for the upper surface of the upper plate under 81 9 of working conditions the positive pressures on the lower surface of the upper plate and on the upper surface of the lower plate of the permeable tfp breakwater in the emerged state and at the still water level and the positive pressures on the upper surface of the upper plate of the permeable tfp breakwater in the submerged state are higher than those on the permeable tap breakwater by 7 4 at the upper surface of the upper plate at the still water level to 62 4 at the upper surface of the lower plate at the still water level whereas the negative pressures on the permeable tfp breakwater are lower than those on the permeable tap breakwater fig 8b and c in the emerged state the positive and negative wave pressures on the upper surface of the upper plate of the permeable tfp breakwater are both lower than those on the permeable tap breakwater by 29 9 83 4 at the upper surface of the upper plate fig 8a the effect of the submergence depth on wave pressures on various plate surfaces is significant the reason may be that when the submergence is deep the process of waves climbing along the arc plate is not significant and the direct impact on the arc plate is weakened so it experiences a wave pressure that is lower than that of the plate breakwater as the submergence depth decreases the waves directly impact the arc and climb up along the arc resulting in a higher wave pressure than that acting on the plate type breakwater 3 5 wave force based on the instantaneous wave pressure at different measuring points on the upper and lower surfaces of the permeable plate type breakwater the wave force acting on the area impacted by the wave pressure represented by each measuring point was calculated the wave force was projected in the horizontal and vertical directions and synchronous integration was performed along the horizontal and vertical directions thus the instantaneous horizontal wave force and vertical wave force on the upper and lower plates of the permeable plate breakwater were calculated fig 9 shows the variations in the vertical and horizontal wave forces on the upper and lower plates with the relative plate width for tfp and tap breakwaters with wave height h 0 10 m plate spacing s 0 05 m and relative submergence depths h d 0 05 0 and 0 05 in this figure the horizontal coordinates represent the relative plate width w l and the vertical coordinates represent the wave force f the positive and negative wave forces on the permeable breakwater are indicated by and respectively for the horizontal wave force the wave movement direction is defined as positive for the vertical wave force the upward direction is positive the results show that under various submergence conditions the difference in the vertical wave force f y on the upper plate between the two permeable plate type breakwaters is significant fig 9a b and c in the emerged state the positive vertical wave force on the upper plate of the permeable tap breakwater is lower than that of the permeable tfp breakwater by 26 5 61 7 and the negative vertical wave force on the permeable tap breakwater is greater than that acting on the permeable tfp breakwater fig 9a at the still water level and in the submerged state the positive and negative vertical wave forces acting on the upper plate of the permeable tap breakwater are both smaller than those of the permeable tfp breakwater by up to 66 1 fig 9b and c under various submergence conditions more than 90 of working conditions the positive and negative vertical wave forces acting on the lower plate of the permeable tap breakwater are both less than those of the permeable tfp breakwater by up to 74 5 fig 9a b and c the main reason is that the submergence depth of the lower plate is relatively large and the submergence depth of each end of the arc plate is even larger the direct impact of the waves is weakened thus the wave force on the lower plate of the tap breakwater is smaller than that on the tfp breakwater the horizontal wave forces f x on the upper and lower plates of the permeable tfp breakwater are both zero for the permeable tap breakwater the horizontal wave force is smaller than the vertical wave force by an order of magnitude fig 9a b and c by applying the above method the horizontal and vertical wave forces on the tfp and tap breakwaters were obtained fig 10 shows the variations in the wave force for the tfp and tap breakwaters with respect to the relative plate width for wave height h 0 10 m plate spacing s 0 05 m and relative submergence depths h d 0 05 0 and 0 05 the results show that under various submergence conditions the vertical wave force f y on the permeable tap breakwater is lower than that on the permeable tfp breakwater the difference in the negative vertical wave forces between the two types is even more significant with a maximum difference of 40 2 fig 10a b and c the horizontal wave force on the permeable tfp breakwater is 0 for the permeable tap breakwater the horizontal wave force f x is significantly lower than the vertical wave force f y and the positive and negative wave forces follow an approximately symmetrical distribution fig 10a b and c 3 6 water surface deformation fig 11 presents the instantaneous change in the deformation of the water surface when t 1 4t 1 2t 3 4t and t around the tfp and tap breakwater respectively for water depth d 0 60 m wave period t 1 4 s relative wave height h d 0 17 and relative submergence depth h d 0 05 when t 1 7t the wave starts to move towards the plate type breakwater and the water level on the wave facing side of the breakwater is significantly higher than that on the back wave side there is almost no water on the upper surface of the upper plate of the tfp breakwater fig 11a and the submerged height of wave facing side of the tap breakwater increases fig 11b when t 3 7t the water volume between the two plates of the tfp breakwater increases significantly fig 11c the wave climbs up to the top of the tap breakwater and the space between the two plates of the tap breakwater is almost full of water fig 11d when t 5 7t the water level on the back wave side of the breakwater is significantly higher than that on the wave facing side and the waves break between the two plates for the tfp and tap breakwaters fig 11e and f when t t the waves have passed through the plate type breakwaters and the water level falls fig 11g and h 4 discussion in the emerged state the wave pressures on the upper surface of the upper plate of the tap breakwater are significantly higher than that of the tfp breakwater fig 8a for the lower surface of the upper plate and the upper and lower surfaces of the lower plate the wave pressures of the tap breakwater are lower than that of the tfp breakwater fig 8a at this point the transmission coefficient of the tap breakwater is lower than that of the tfp breakwater fig 6a and b indicating that the tap breakwater can consume more energy through wave breaking caused by the waves climbing the surface of the plate in the emerged state at the still water level the transmission coefficient reflection coefficient and vertical wave force of the tap breakwater are lower than those of the tfp breakwater fig 6a 6b 6c 6d 7a 7b 7c 7d 9a and 9b therefore the tap breakwater is recommended for engineering applications in addition the arc plate structure has the advantage of a more beautiful appearance than the flat plate structure in the submerged state the transmission coefficient of the tfp breakwater is 24 3 lower than that of the tap breakwater but the vertical wave forces on the tfp breakwater is 40 2 larger than that of the tap breakwater fig 6e 6f and 9c to sum up in practical engineering applications it is recommended that the tap breakwater be used in areas with small tidal ranges and the tfp breakwater be used in areas with large tidal ranges the present experimental study is focused on a more systematic quantitative comparison of the hydrodynamic characteristics of tfp and tap breakwaters relevant previous studies have shown that a perforated structure can improve wave dissipation performance and reduce the wave force on the structure thus the wave attenuation performance wave pressure wave force and flow field characteristics of the porous arc plate breakwater should be studied further the study of the flow field is crucial to understanding the wave dissipation mechanism so the variation and distribution of the flow field should be explored with experimental results by using flow field visualization techniques such as piv or other methods moreover considering the randomness of ocean waves the effects of irregular waves on plate breakwaters should be examined in further studies 5 conclusion the hydrodynamic characteristics of a tfp breakwater and a tap breakwater were systematically investigated using physical model tests within the scope of these tests the following major conclusions are drawn 1 under various submergence conditions the two plate type breakwaters show significantly different wave elevations when the breakwaters are in the emerged state and at the still water level the wave elevation of back wave side of the tap breakwater is lower than that of the tfp breakwater and the wave transmission coefficient of the tap breakwater is smaller than that of the tfp breakwater the opposite pattern is observed when the breakwaters are in the submerged state 2 in the emerged state and at the still water level the tap breakwater has a smaller wave transmission coefficient than the tfp breakwater under various submergence conditions the wave reflection coefficients of the tfp breakwater are all larger than those of the tap breakwater 3 under various submergence conditions the difference in the wave pressure distribution of the upper and lower surfaces of various plate layers of the two plate type breakwaters is significant the surface locations of the various layers of plates relative to the still water level significantly influence the wave pressure on this surface when the plate surface of the plate type breakwater is 0 04 m below the still water level the positive and negative wave pressures on the plate surface are both higher than those on the corresponding surfaces of the tfp breakwater under the same working conditions 4 except in the emerged state in which the negative vertical wave force on the upper plate of the tap breakwater is larger than that of the tfp breakwater the vertical wave forces on the tap breakwater are smaller than those on the tfp breakwater the horizontal wave forces on each plate layer of the tap breakwater are larger than those on the tfp breakwater 5 the width of the arc plate should be appropriately increased to examine the hydrodynamic characteristics of the tap breakwater with a longer relative plate width range in future research the porous arc plate should be adopted to reduce the transmission coefficient and wave force of the tap breakwater credit author statement xueyan li conceptualization methodology writing original

could improve structural stability and mechanical performance budime et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 inspired by the semicircular breakwater considering the advantages of the plate type breakwater wang et al 2016 developed an arc plate breakwater consisting of arc plates with various curvatures the research results show that the transmission coefficient of the arc plate breakwater increases with the relative wave height and the period of the incident wave and the wave attenuation effect at the still water level and slightly above the still water level exceeds that of the plate type breakwater wang et al 2016 li et al 2020 when the relative width is 0 2 the transmission coefficient can be kept below 0 5 wang et al 2016 li et al 2019 when the ratio of the submergence depth to the wave height is 0 05 the wave attenuation effect of an arc plate breakwater is approximately 50 higher than that of a plate type breakwater wang et al 2019 most research on permeable arc plate breakwaters has focused on either the wave attenuation performance or the structural mechanical behavior the tap breakwater as a new type of structure shows good wave dissipation performance under certain conditions wang et al 2019 as is known to all the stability and safety of the breakwater are quite important however previous studies mostly focused on its wave attenuation characteristics and few discussions were carried out on its wave pressure wave force and wave surface deformation wang et al 2016 because the two arc plates near the water surface can dissipate most of the incident wave energy wang et al 2016 so the tap and tfp breakwaters are chosen in this manuscript based on this the paper intends to perform a more systematic physical model test to quantitatively compare the hydrodynamic characteristics of the tfp and tap breakwaters in terms of wave attenuation performance wave pressure wave force and wave surface deformation to provide a theoretical reference for engineering applications 2 physical model test 2 1 experimental setup the tests were conducted in the large wave flume of the port channel and coast engineering experimental center at ludong university the flume is 60 0 m in length 2 0 m in width and 1 8 m in height with a maximum working water depth of 1 5 m a piston type wavemaker driven by a servomotor is installed in front of the flume with a 2 0 m wide piston that can simulate wave heights from 0 05 m to 0 6 m regular and irregular waves with periods of 0 5 5 0 s can be generated this test device features active wave absorption gravel average gravel particle size 100 150 mm was placed at the end of the tank to eliminate wall end reflection the slope of the gravel beach was 1 5 with a length of 6 8 m and height of 1 3 m the physical tank was divided into two small tanks one with a width of 0 8 m and the other with a width of 1 2 m the experimental study was carried out in a small 0 8 m wide tank the wave height and wave pressure on the preamble breakwater were measured using ds30 multipoint acquisition systems with a sampling resolution of 50 hz the test of the wave attenuation characteristics of the permeable plate type breakwaters was based on goda s two point method goda and suzuki 1976 the 1 and 2 wave height recorders spaced 0 74 m apart were installed on the wave facing side of the model to calculate the wave reflection coefficient the 2 wave gauge was 4 46 m from the front end of the open breakwater the 3 and 4 wave height recorders spaced 0 74 m apart were deployed on the back wave side of the model to calculate the wave transmission coefficient the 3 wave gauge was 4 46 m from the back end of the open breakwater the layout of the flume test is shown in fig 1 using the permeable tap breakwater model as an example the test model includes a tfp breakwater fig 2 a and b tap breakwater fig 2c and d the tap breakwater model has an arc height of r 0 05 m for the tap and tfp breakwaters the plate width w in the wave facing direction and plate length l 2 in the flume width direction were 0 45 m and 0 79 m respectively fig 2b and d the plate thickness was 0 01 m the perforations on the four corners of the permeable breakwater model were used to weld four threaded rods at the bottom of the flume to ensure the stability of the permeable breakwater model during the test threaded rods were used as fasteners so that the position of the flat plate or arc plate could be adjusted by rotating the nuts allowing for the submergence depth and the plate spacing of the permeable breakwater to be adjusted during the test fig 2a and c the spacing between the two adjacent pressure sensors was 0 052 m and 0 055 m for the tfp and tap breakwaters respectively fig 2b and d on the upper and lower surfaces of the upper and lower plates in the tfp and tap breakwaters 24 pressure sensors with a diameter of 0 02 m were arranged at equal intervals along both sides of the centerline of the plate the layout of the pressure sensors is shown in fig 3 these pressure sensors were positioned as follows those numbered 1 to 6 monitored the pressure on the lower surface of the upper plate those numbered 7 to 12 monitored the pressure on the upper surface of the upper plate those numbered 13 to 18 monitored the pressure on the lower surface of the lower plate and those numbered 19 to 24 monitored the pressure on the upper surface of the lower plate the distance between the pressure sensor and the centerline of the plate was 0 02 m 2 2 test parameters regular waves were used in the test in the adopted actual sea area the water depth was 15 m the wave heights are 1 50 m and 2 50 m the wave periods are 6 s 7 s 8 s 9 s and 10 s if the model scale is 1 25 the water depth d is 0 60 m and the wave periods t are 1 2 s 1 4 s 1 6 s 1 8 s and 2 0 s respectively and the wave heights h are 0 06 m and 0 10 m for various submergence depths the relative relationships between the upper and lower plates and the still water level are shown in fig 4 the submergence depths h were 0 03 m indicating that the tangent line of the vertex of the upper arc plate or the upper surface of the upper plate is 0 03 m above the still water level 0 m indicating that the tangent line of the vertex of the upper arc plate or the upper surface of the upper plate is located at the still water level and 0 03 m indicating that the tangent line of the vertex of the upper arc plate or the upper surface of the upper plate is 0 03 m below the still water level the plate spacing s was 0 05 m 0 07 m and 0 09 m the detailed parameters of the test are shown in table 1 one hundred test groups were designed with various combinations of wave height period submergence depth and plate spacing table 2 to minimize the test error three tests were performed for each test group and the final test results are based on the average value of the three test results 3 results in this section the differences in the hydrodynamic characteristics of the tfp breakwater and the tap breakwater are discussed in terms of the wave surface elevation transmission coefficient reflection coefficient wave pressure wave force and flow field characteristics 3 1 wave elevation fig 5 shows the changes in wave elevation on the back wave side monitored by the 3 and 4 wave gauges for wave height h 0 06 m wave period t 1 8 s and relative submergence depths h d 0 05 0 and 0 05 the results show that when the tfp and tap breakwaters are in the emerged state h d 0 05 and at the still water level h d 0 the wave elevations on the back wave side of the tap breakwater are smaller than those of the tfp breakwater fig 5a and b in the emerged state the wave elevations monitored by the 3 and 4 wave gauges of the tap breakwater are 10 1 and 5 0 smaller than those of the tfp breakwater respectively fig 5a at the still water level the wave elevations from the 3 and 4 wave gauges of the tap breakwater are 3 8 and 7 6 smaller than those of the tfp breakwater respectively fig 5b in the submerged state h d 0 05 the wave elevation from the 3 and 4 wave gauges of the tap breakwater are 2 6 and 4 7 larger than those of the tfp breakwater respectively fig 5c the possible reasons of the above phenomenon are as follows in the emerged state the height below the still water level for the tap breakwater is higher than that for the tfp breakwater so the tap breakwater has a stronger blocking effect on waves and less transmitted waves than the tfp breakwater however in the submerged state the tap breakwater is farther away from the still water level than the tfp breakwater and its blocking effect on waves is weakened so the transmitted waves of the tap breakwater are larger than the tfp breakwater with different submergence depths the relative relationships between the tap and tfp breakwaters and the still water level can be referred to fig 4 there are some differences in the characteristics of the time histories of wave elevations on the back wave side of the tfp and tap breakwaters in the emerged state h d 0 05 the wave elevations for the tap breakwater are smoother than that for the tfp breakwater at the still water level h d 0 the fluctuation at the crest for the tap breakwater is more pronounced than that for the tfp breakwater in the submerged state h d 0 05 the fluctuation at the crest from the 3 wave gauge for the tfp breakwater is more remarkable than that for the tap breakwater the fluctuations of the wave elevation from the 4 wave gauge for the tfp and tap breakwaters were both significant 3 2 transmission coefficient fig 6 compares the wave transmission coefficient between the permeable tfp and tap breakwaters for d 0 60 m relative wave height h d 0 10 and 0 17 relative plate spacing s d 0 08 0 12 and 0 15 and relative submergence depths h d 0 05 0 and 0 05 the results show that under various submergence conditions the wave transmission coefficients of these two permeable plate type breakwaters are significantly different when the permeable breakwaters are in the emerged state h d 0 05 fig 6a and b and are located at the still water level h d 0 fig 6c and d under more than 80 of working conditions the wave transmission coefficient of the permeable tap breakwater is lower than that of the permeable tfp breakwater with this phenomenon being more obvious in the emerged state h d 0 05 fig 6a b c and d the wave transmission coefficients of the tap breakwater are reduced by a maximum of 34 5 and 25 compared with those of the tfp breakwater in the emerged state and at the still water level respectively fig 6a b c and d in the submerged state h d 0 05 the wave transmission coefficient of the permeable tfp breakwater is a maximum of 24 3 less than that of the permeable tap breakwater fig 6e and f the above phenomenon occurs because when in the emerged state h d 0 05 and at the still water level h d 0 the tfp breakwater causes waves to undergo shallow water deformation and breaks by disrupting the vertical motion of the water particles thereby dissipating wave energy by contrast the tap breakwater can disrupt both the transverse and vertical motions of water particles resulting in a shallow water effect on the waves which in turn results in more intense wave breaking and more significant wave energy dissipation according to the energy conservation principle and combined with the reflected waves it can be seen that the tap breakwater with greater energy consumption has smaller transmission waves in the emerged state h d 0 05 under the condition of different relative plate spacing the wave transmission coefficient of the permeable tap breakwater is lower than that of the permeable tfp breakwater when the relative plate spacing s d 0 08 the maximum percentage reduction in the wave transmission coefficient is 34 5 which appears at the condition of h d 0 10 and w l 0 17 fig 6a and b when the relative plate spacing s d 0 12 and 0 15 the maximum percentage reductions of the wave transmission coefficient were 30 and 25 respectively the greatest changes occurred at the condition of h d 0 10 and w l 0 21 fig 6g and h and h d 0 10 and w l 0 17 fig 6i and j 3 3 reflection coefficient fig 7 presents a comparison of the wave reflection coefficient of the tfp and tap breakwaters for d 0 60 m relative wave height h d 0 10 and 0 17 relative plate spacing s d 0 08 0 12 and 0 15 and relative submergence depths h d 0 05 0 and 0 05 the results show that under various submergence conditions the wave transmission coefficient of these two permeable plate type breakwaters increases in a fluctuating tendency with the increase in the relative plate width fig 7a f under the three submergence conditions the wave reflection coefficient of the permeable tfp breakwater is greater than that of the permeable tap breakwater and there is a stronger wave reflection effect within the scope of this test the wave reflection coefficient of the permeable tfp breakwater showed an approximate maximum increase of 66 7 compared with the permeable tap breakwater fig 7a f in the emerged state h d 0 05 under more than 90 of working conditions the wave reflection coefficient of the permeable tap breakwater is significantly less than that of the permeable tfp breakwater at the different relative plate spacing when the relative plate spacing s d 0 08 the maximum percentage reduction in the wave reflection coefficient is 47 6 which appears at the condition of h d 0 17 and w l 0 10 fig 7a and b when the relative plate spacing was s d 0 12 and 0 15 the maximum percentage reductions of the wave reflection coefficient were 46 3 and 41 0 respectively the largest differences occurred at the conditions of h d 0 17 and w l 0 21 fig 7g and h and h d 0 10 and w l 0 12 fig 7i and j 3 4 wave pressure fig 8 depicts envelope diagrams of the wave pressure at various surface locations of the permeable tfp and tap breakwaters for wave period t 1 2 s wave height h 0 10 m plate spacing s 0 05 m and relative submergence depths h d 0 05 0 and 0 05 the horizontal coordinate is the ratio of the horizontal distance between the pressure measuring points and the wave facing edge of the plate or arc plate over the plate width the results show that under various submergence conditions the differences in wave pressure distribution of the upper and lower surfaces between the tfp and tap breakwater is significant when the plate surface of the permeable plate type breakwater is 0 04 m below the still water level this surface of the tfp breakwater is subjected to positive and negative wave pressures that are both higher than those on the corresponding surface of the permeable tap breakwater under the same working conditions fig 8a b and c that is for the permeable plate breakwater the lower surface of the lower plate in the emerged state h d 0 05 and at the still water level h d 0 the lower surface of the upper plate in the submerged state h d 0 05 and the upper and lower surfaces of the lower plate in the submerged state h d 0 05 are all subjected to wave pressures that are higher than those for the tap breakwater by 2 20 at the lower surface of the lower plate in the emerged state to 44 4 at the lower surface of the lower plate at the still water level fig 8a b and c except for the upper surface of the upper plate under 81 9 of working conditions the positive pressures on the lower surface of the upper plate and on the upper surface of the lower plate of the permeable tfp breakwater in the emerged state and at the still water level and the positive pressures on the upper surface of the upper plate of the permeable tfp breakwater in the submerged state are higher than those on the permeable tap breakwater by 7 4 at the upper surface of the upper plate at the still water level to 62 4 at the upper surface of the lower plate at the still water level whereas the negative pressures on the permeable tfp breakwater are lower than those on the permeable tap breakwater fig 8b and c in the emerged state the positive and negative wave pressures on the upper surface of the upper plate of the permeable tfp breakwater are both lower than those on the permeable tap breakwater by 29 9 83 4 at the upper surface of the upper plate fig 8a the effect of the submergence depth on wave pressures on various plate surfaces is significant the reason may be that when the submergence is deep the process of waves climbing along the arc plate is not significant and the direct impact on the arc plate is weakened so it experiences a wave pressure that is lower than that of the plate breakwater as the submergence depth decreases the waves directly impact the arc and climb up along the arc resulting in a higher wave pressure than that acting on the plate type breakwater 3 5 wave force based on the instantaneous wave pressure at different measuring points on the upper and lower surfaces of the permeable plate type breakwater the wave force acting on the area impacted by the wave pressure represented by each measuring point was calculated the wave force was projected in the horizontal and vertical directions and synchronous integration was performed along the horizontal and vertical directions thus the instantaneous horizontal wave force and vertical wave force on the upper and lower plates of the permeable plate breakwater were calculated fig 9 shows the variations in the vertical and horizontal wave forces on the upper and lower plates with the relative plate width for tfp and tap breakwaters with wave height h 0 10 m plate spacing s 0 05 m and relative submergence depths h d 0 05 0 and 0 05 in this figure the horizontal coordinates represent the relative plate width w l and the vertical coordinates represent the wave force f the positive and negative wave forces on the permeable breakwater are indicated by and respectively for the horizontal wave force the wave movement direction is defined as positive for the vertical wave force the upward direction is positive the results show that under various submergence conditions the difference in the vertical wave force f y on the upper plate between the two permeable plate type breakwaters is significant fig 9a b and c in the emerged state the positive vertical wave force on the upper plate of the permeable tap breakwater is lower than that of the permeable tfp breakwater by 26 5 61 7 and the negative vertical wave force on the permeable tap breakwater is greater than that acting on the permeable tfp breakwater fig 9a at the still water level and in the submerged state the positive and negative vertical wave forces acting on the upper plate of the permeable tap breakwater are both smaller than those of the permeable tfp breakwater by up to 66 1 fig 9b and c under various submergence conditions more than 90 of working conditions the positive and negative vertical wave forces acting on the lower plate of the permeable tap breakwater are both less than those of the permeable tfp breakwater by up to 74 5 fig 9a b and c the main reason is that the submergence depth of the lower plate is relatively large and the submergence depth of each end of the arc plate is even larger the direct impact of the waves is weakened thus the wave force on the lower plate of the tap breakwater is smaller than that on the tfp breakwater the horizontal wave forces f x on the upper and lower plates of the permeable tfp breakwater are both zero for the permeable tap breakwater the horizontal wave force is smaller than the vertical wave force by an order of magnitude fig 9a b and c by applying the above method the horizontal and vertical wave forces on the tfp and tap breakwaters were obtained fig 10 shows the variations in the wave force for the tfp and tap breakwaters with respect to the relative plate width for wave height h 0 10 m plate spacing s 0 05 m and relative submergence depths h d 0 05 0 and 0 05 the results show that under various submergence conditions the vertical wave force f y on the permeable tap breakwater is lower than that on the permeable tfp breakwater the difference in the negative vertical wave forces between the two types is even more significant with a maximum difference of 40 2 fig 10a b and c the horizontal wave force on the permeable tfp breakwater is 0 for the permeable tap breakwater the horizontal wave force f x is significantly lower than the vertical wave force f y and the positive and negative wave forces follow an approximately symmetrical distribution fig 10a b and c 3 6 water surface deformation fig 11 presents the instantaneous change in the deformation of the water surface when t 1 4t 1 2t 3 4t and t around the tfp and tap breakwater respectively for water depth d 0 60 m wave period t 1 4 s relative wave height h d 0 17 and relative submergence depth h d 0 05 when t 1 7t the wave starts to move towards the plate type breakwater and the water level on the wave facing side of the breakwater is significantly higher than that on the back wave side there is almost no water on the upper surface of the upper plate of the tfp breakwater fig 11a and the submerged height of wave facing side of the tap breakwater increases fig 11b when t 3 7t the water volume between the two plates of the tfp breakwater increases significantly fig 11c the wave climbs up to the top of the tap breakwater and the space between the two plates of the tap breakwater is almost full of water fig 11d when t 5 7t the water level on the back wave side of the breakwater is significantly higher than that on the wave facing side and the waves break between the two plates for the tfp and tap breakwaters fig 11e and f when t t the waves have passed through the plate type breakwaters and the water level falls fig 11g and h 4 discussion in the emerged state the wave pressures on the upper surface of the upper plate of the tap breakwater are significantly higher than that of the tfp breakwater fig 8a for the lower surface of the upper plate and the upper and lower surfaces of the lower plate the wave pressures of the tap breakwater are lower than that of the tfp breakwater fig 8a at this point the transmission coefficient of the tap breakwater is lower than that of the tfp breakwater fig 6a and b indicating that the tap breakwater can consume more energy through wave breaking caused by the waves climbing the surface of the plate in the emerged state at the still water level the transmission coefficient reflection coefficient and vertical wave force of the tap breakwater are lower than those of the tfp breakwater fig 6a 6b 6c 6d 7a 7b 7c 7d 9a and 9b therefore the tap breakwater is recommended for engineering applications in addition the arc plate structure has the advantage of a more beautiful appearance than the flat plate structure in the submerged state the transmission coefficient of the tfp breakwater is 24 3 lower than that of the tap breakwater but the vertical wave forces on the tfp breakwater is 40 2 larger than that of the tap breakwater fig 6e 6f and 9c to sum up in practical engineering applications it is recommended that the tap breakwater be used in areas with small tidal ranges and the tfp breakwater be used in areas with large tidal ranges the present experimental study is focused on a more systematic quantitative comparison of the hydrodynamic characteristics of tfp and tap breakwaters relevant previous studies have shown that a perforated structure can improve wave dissipation performance and reduce the wave force on the structure thus the wave attenuation performance wave pressure wave force and flow field characteristics of the porous arc plate breakwater should be studied further the study of the flow field is crucial to understanding the wave dissipation mechanism so the variation and distribution of the flow field should be explored with experimental results by using flow field visualization techniques such as piv or other methods moreover considering the randomness of ocean waves the effects of irregular waves on plate breakwaters should be examined in further studies 5 conclusion the hydrodynamic characteristics of a tfp breakwater and a tap breakwater were systematically investigated using physical model tests within the scope of these tests the following major conclusions are drawn 1 under various submergence conditions the two plate type breakwaters show significantly different wave elevations when the breakwaters are in the emerged state and at the still water level the wave elevation of back wave side of the tap breakwater is lower than that of the tfp breakwater and the wave transmission coefficient of the tap breakwater is smaller than that of the tfp breakwater the opposite pattern is observed when the breakwaters are in the submerged state 2 in the emerged state and at the still water level the tap breakwater has a smaller wave transmission coefficient than the tfp breakwater under various submergence conditions the wave reflection coefficients of the tfp breakwater are all larger than those of the tap breakwater 3 under various submergence conditions the difference in the wave pressure distribution of the upper and lower surfaces of various plate layers of the two plate type breakwaters is significant the surface locations of the various layers of plates relative to the still water level significantly influence the wave pressure on this surface when the plate surface of the plate type breakwater is 0 04 m below the still water level the positive and negative wave pressures on the plate surface are both higher than those on the corresponding surfaces of the tfp breakwater under the same working conditions 4 except in the emerged state in which the negative vertical wave force on the upper plate of the tap breakwater is larger than that of the tfp breakwater the vertical wave forces on the tap breakwater are smaller than those on the tfp breakwater the horizontal wave forces on each plate layer of the tap breakwater are larger than those on the tfp breakwater 5 the width of the arc plate should be appropriately increased to examine the hydrodynamic characteristics of the tap breakwater with a longer relative plate width range in future research the porous arc plate should be adopted to reduce the transmission coefficient and wave force of the tap breakwater credit author statement xueyan li conceptualization methodology writing original

21234,the characteristics of cavity evolution and surface load in water entry by a constrained posture cylinder at different angles of attack are experimentally investigated high speed photography is used to capture flow behaviors and a measurement system is established to measure the pressure on the surface of the cylinder and its acceleration during the process of water entry the experimental results show that when the cylinder enters the water at a certain angle of attack the cavity shows an obvious asymmetry comparison of angles of attack shows that the cavity evolution and load characteristics during the water entry process are closely related to the angle of attack of the cylinder increasing the angle of attack can short the period if cavity pinch off but prolong the time of surface seal meanwhile the peak value of impact pressure shows a gradual downward trend with the increased angle of attack and the relationship between the duration of high load and the angle of attack is approximately linear moreover the characteristics of the flow field play an important role in the surface load of the cylinder an obvious and short lived negative relative pressure will appear on the surface of the model inside the cavity at the initial stage of water entry the part of cylinder that is not affected by the cavity and directly interacts with water has a continuous positive pressure trend in addition in can be found that there is a significant pressure fluctuation when the cavity separation line passes over the surface keywords water entry angle of attack cavity evolution load characteristics 1 introduction the problem of water entry is typically encountered in ocean engineering and it has a wide range of military and civilian applications such as in air dropped torpedoes rocket booster recovery aircraft landing on water surfaces and hull slamming due to waves water entry is a multiphase flow process with transient and nonlinear flow due to the sudden change in medium at the moment of impact a great impact load appears on the part that contacts the water which may cause deformation and damage and lead to a failure of internal components resulting in serious adverse effects the problem of cavity evolution and the load characteristics of water entry has received widespread attention from researchers the theoretical study of water entry began in the 1920s von karman 1929 put forward the concept of additional mass extrapolated from the law of conservation of momentum and thus obtained a theoretical method of solving the impact load of a two dimensional wedge during water entry on this basis wagner 1932 addressed pressure distribution on the surface of the wedge which laid a foundation for later theoretical research however wagner s model did not consider air cushion effects verhagen 1967 incorporated the phenomenon of air cushion combined with the air compressibility and presented a model of pressure prediction lee et al 1997 drawing on the principle of the conservation of energy studied cavity evolution and established a dynamic model of the cavity in relation to a projectile in high speed water entry duez et al 2007 proposed a relationship between the critical speed of the formation of the water entry cavity and the contact angle with the surface the critical speed changes little with the contact angle for angles less than 90 xu et al 2008 analyzed the oblique water entry of an asymmetrical wedge based on the complex velocity potential using the boundary element method in particular it was encouraging to observe the sharp variation and negative pressure near the tip of the wedge ding et al 2015 using the rayleigh besant equation established the cavity dynamic model to accurately obtain the characteristics of the radial expansion of the cavity due to imperfections in the theoretical approach experimental research on the water entry problem developed only gradually since the beginning of the 20th century study of water entry has been conducted using high speed photography worthington and cole 1897 used this means to capture the typical characteristics of the vertical water entry of spheres such as cavity splash and surface seal and this led to further developments in the understanding of the phenomenon due to the sphere s radial symmetry it offers certain advantages for research in mechanics so early work on water entry centered on spheres bell 1924 showed the effects of surface tension viscosity and surface layers on the impact of a solid sphere on a fluid surface gilberg and anderson 1948 conducted experimental study on the water entry of a sphere under different types of environmental pressure and their results showed that environmental pressure could affect the characteristics of splash and cavity evolution in water entry may and woodhull 1948 and may 1951 1952 carried out a series of experiments with spheres having different parameters and analyzed the influence of initial conditions on the cavity and resistance coefficient richardson 1948 conducted a series of studies on the vertical and inclined water entry of a rotating body he analyzed the hydrodynamic characteristics of the entry and discussed the bounce phenomenon during entry greenhow 1987 studied the two dimensional entry of wedges of various angles into initially calm water based on theoretical approaches excellent results of free surface displacements and pressure distributions on the wetted wedge surface were obtained aristoff et al 2008 2009 carried out a series of experiments on the water entry of hydrophobic spheres particular attention was paid to the shape of the resulting air cavity in the low bond numbers truscott and techet 2009 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of the water entry of a spinning sphere at low froude numbers and described the phenomenon of splash seal and cavity pinch off hurd et al 2017 focused on the characteristics of the water entry of deformable elastomeric spheres and found that the cavity behavior of deformable spheres clearly differs from those of rigid spheres sun et al 2019a 2019b carried out a series of experiments on sphere entry into a viscous liquid floating on water and studied cavity dynamics and splash crown behaviors under the influence of a viscous liquid li et al 2020 studied the water entry of a spinning sphere by combining experiments and numerical calculations they also provided a detailed analysis of the effects of spin rate on the flow evolution of a fluid and its dynamic characteristics in practical engineering the cylinder has a broad range of applications so the focus of investigators gradually turned to the more practical are of studying the water entry of cylinders truscott et al 2014 conducted a series of experiments on high speed water entry and their results showed that trajectory stability was severely affected by the angle of water entry wei et al 2015 carried out a series of experiments on the water entry of circular cylinders in the low froude numbers and the cavity and hydrodynamic characteristics were analyzed in detail chen et al 2019 focused on the stability of the trajectory of high speed water entry projectiles and showed that projectiles with a flat nose type exhibited perfect trajectory stability and maximum peak pressure guo et al 2020 conducted an experiment on the high speed water entry of a projectile with a container constraint and produced analyses of the evolution of the cavity and changes in drag coefficient under the container constraint xia et al 2019 2020 studied the impact of cavities and motion behaviors in water entry using the motion of a cylinder with multiple degrees of freedom with different initial velocities and angles of inclination as a deeper understanding of the water entry problem developed impact load became the research focus the relationship between pressure and the cavity can be obtained by combining measurement results and test images abelson 1970 measured the pressure inside the cavity during the water entry of vertical and inclined projectiles and showed that the initial angle and nose shape of the projectile significantly affect internal cavity pressure van nuffel et al 2013 2014 investigated the parameters that affect pressure recordings during water impact the sampling rate sensor position temperature surface conditions and other parameters all affect pressures measurements it was also found that wagner s theory can estimate the impact pressure on a horizontal rigid cylinder

advantages of fluid structure coupling method zhang et al 2019 sun et al 2020 used the fluid structure interaction method to analyze the structural response and load characteristics of high speed water entry of a cylinder and explained the structural damage caused by the impact load using pressure sensors treichler and kiger 2020 studied the internal pressure characteristics of the supercavitation of projectiles in water the entry cavity they showed that the size of the water tank significantly affected the dynamic characteristics of the cavity although extensive research has been carried out on the cavity evolution and impact load of water entry angle of attack as a variable parameter for the water entry of a cylinder is an important topic of in depth study meanwhile the inherent relationship between the load of the water entry structure and the flow field is of great significance for the study of the design of ships and marine structures here we experimentally investigate the water entry of a constrained posture cylinder with different angles of attack extracting test images and pressure curves from sensors distributed on the surface of the cylinder we investigate the relationship between cavity and surface load the relationship among angle of attack cavity and load is explored by changing the angle of attack section 2 presents the experimental setup and the experimental conditions section 3 gives the experimental results and analyzes the characteristics of the cavity splash and pressure under different angles of attack the conclusions are presented in section 4 2 experimental setup fig 1 presents the schematic for our experimental system and the attitudes of the cylinder during the test the upstream side of the cylinder is the first and fourth quadrant in the coordinate system and the downstream side is the second and third quadrant the entire system is divisible into four parts release gear electromagnet sliding rail and release switch lighting device high speed camera and measurement system the water tank is 1400 740 800 mm length width height and the water is 600 mm deep before each test the electromagnet is electrified to fix the model connection device in place when the release switch is turned off the falls and begins water entry here the high speed camera begins to collect the images and the measurement system records the pressure and acceleration of the entire process a phantom v12 1 high speed camera is used with a frame rate of 3000 fps and an image resolution of 1280 800 pixel the measurement system consists of three pressure sensors installed inside the cylinder one external acceleration sensor and an instrument for data acquisition fig 2 shows the internal layout of the cylinder which is divided into three parts to facilitate sensor installation p1 is placed at the center of the head of the cylinder and the distances from p2 and p3 to the bottom of the cylinder are 0 38 d and 1 3 d respectively in order to verify the reliability of the test equipment fig 3 a shows the velocity curve during the water entry process for repeated test conditions it can be seen that the velocity has a good consistency and the maximum relative error is less than 2 5 moreover fig 3 b and c show the surface pressure curves of p2 and the images obtained based on three repetitive experiments for the 15 angle of attack respectively these results indicate that the experiment has good repeatability the experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 the initial velocity of water entry is extracted from the curves shown in fig 3 the attack angle of the cylinder is set using the angle adjuster and calibrated by the digital angle ruler to ensure that the angle of attack is consistent during the repeatability test each condition of the angle of attack is repeated at least three times to ensure measurement accuracy 3 results and discussion 3 1 cavity evolution and load characteristics of the cylinder under a fixed angle of attack to address cavity evolution and the surface load characteristics of cylinder water entry in relation to angle of attack we provide detailed analyses of the conditions with an attack angle of α 20 and a velocity of v 0 2 99 m s fig 4 presents a sequence of images that depict the cavity evolution with the given condition the first moment of contact between the cylinder and the free surface is defined as time zero t 0 ms as the cylinder continues to fall the water entry passes into the stage of flow formation at t 3 ms as a result of the entry transfer caused by the impact of the cylinder on free surface the surrounding fluid acquires kinetic energy and begins to flow at the same time the cylinder bottom squeezes the discharged water resulting in a lateral splash the phase of flow formation is of very short duration and varies for different angles of attack the open cavity stage occurs at t 10 ms as the water is pushed around the air follows the entrainment of the cylinder forming an obvious cavity and splash at the same time it is seen that the cavity in the downstream part is wholly connected with the atmosphere while the cavity in the upstream part intersects with the cylinder and forms a semi closed cavity due to asymmetry an apparent splash crown and lateral jet are also observed due to extrusion as time passes the cavity downstream continues to expand and the upstream cavity adheres to the surface of the cylinder with a clear cavity separation line gradually appearing because the air is constantly and quickly sucked into the cavity the pressure inside the cavity is lower than the atmosphere so the splash crown gradually shrinks inward in the middle of the water entry the top of the splash crown begins to collapse t 35 45 ms due to the reduced the pressure difference between the interior of the cavity and the pressure of the atmosphere and the water the wall of the stretched cavity upstream contracts inward and finally causes a deep pinch off of the cavity in the same way the surface seal gradually occurs after the collapse of the splash crown observation of the splash crown shows that the outer edge of the crown contracts toward the center before the surface seal fig 5 presents this phenomenon and provides further analysis of the entire process f and f represent the outward and inward force of the splash crown respectively h c is the distance from the contour of the splash crown to the free surface and l s is the relative distance from the contour to the right vertex it is well known that an inward force always occurs before the surface seal due to the difference in internal and external pressure however the outward force caused by the energy exchange due to the impact of the water is far greater than the inward force the opposite is true at the top of the splash crown there the inward force is slightly greater than the outward force and this results in a trend in the movement of this position opposite to that of the whole crown as time passes the energy that is transferred due to the impact is gradually reduced and the gap between the two forces narrows such that the trend of outward expansion turns to an inward contraction it is also seen that the top of the crown moves upward as it contracts fig 5 b connects the contour of the top of the splash crown marked by the red line in fig 5 a into a curved surface which more intuitively reflects the law of the splash crown it can be clearly seen that the evolution trend of the inward shrinkage and upward development of the splashes in time and space our analyses show that the imbalance between the outward and inward forces leads to a particular phenomenon at the top of the splash crown that is closely related to changes in force difference to explore the characteristics of the surface load of a constrained posture cylinder with a certain angle of attack we collect pressure signals at three points within this condition first fig 6 shows the curve of pressure versus time at p1 the overall change trend of the curve is the same as that of the typical water entry conditions and all exhibit a rapid reduction to a lower stable value after the peak value is reached when t 0 ms the cylinder contacts the free surface for the first time and due to the angle of attack p1 is still a certain distance from the surface of the water so the pressure at p1 is approximately equal to the current ambient pressure the pressure reaches a peak value at t 2 ms and p1 impacts the free surface when t 15 ms the cylinder passes through water impact the interaction between p1 and the water changes from impact to continuous contact under the action of water resistance and water pressure and the pressure at p1 is continuously and stably higher than atmospheric pressure thus we can judge the mechanism of the peak water entry pressure in relation to the angle of attack and the time of peak pressure occurs at the same velocity for both the vertical and inclined conditions the pressure curve for p2 and images of four characteristic moments are given in fig 7 the entire pressure curve increases rapidly attains peak pressure at a relatively slow speed and finally decreases to approximately ambient pressure there is noticeable pressure fluctuation during the second increase no obvious pressure variation appears during t 0 4 ms indicating that the impact has no influence on p2 the pressure rises rapidly due to contact with the free surface t 4 ms the cylinder wall forms a 70 angle with the surface of the water so the force of the impact has a small component on the wall and the pressure is mainly generated by contact with the water at the same time the upstream cavity has no noticeable effect on p2 as the water pressure increases the pressure at p2 also gradually increases meanwhile we can see that the pressure sharply decreases during 6 6 8 ms the surface pressure is affected by the cavity splash around the cylinder and presents fluctuation characteristics the upstream cavity separation line just passes the sensor surface during this period and the pressure reaches its peak value after that as the cavity covers the head of the cylinder including p2 the pressure drops to the range of the environmental pressure the curves shown in figs 6 and 7 show different trends indicating that the impact load and surface load for cylinder water entry at a given angle of attack are significantly different finally pressure of p3 is shown in fig 8 because p3 is far from the bottom of the cylinder the pressure curve shows no visible change when t 11 6 ms a positive pressure trend is seen the images show that p3 comes into contact the water attached to the wall due to the splash so pressure increases during this period similarly when p3 is in contact with the surface of the water the pressure increases accordingly interestingly it is can been seen that the pressure evolution of p3 presents negative values after 12 ms during the water entry process of cylinder the air around the cylinder is driven to flow and form cavitation splash cavity seal around the cylinder prevents entrained air flowing into the cavity thus causing the measured pressure to be lower than the ambient atmospheric pressure 3 2 influence of angle of attack on cavity evolution and splash in this section the evolution of the cavity and the characteristics of the splash in the process of cylinder water entry with angles of attack 10 15 20 25 and 30 are analyzed first we analyze the entire process of water entry fig 9 shows a sequence of images of cavity evolution in different conditions because the cylinder s rotation is constrained the rotating moment caused by water resistance is not taken into consideration the impact of the angle of attack is mainly reflected in the lateral splash the height of the splash crown and the surface seal as well as in the area of the cavity cavity separation line and other phenomena the impact of the lateral splash can be seen in a comparison to the image for t 10 ms under conditions of a higher angle of attack the horizontal component of the impact force is larger and more energy is transferred to the water hence the distance of lateral splash increases with increases in angle of attack given the same entry velocity increases in the horizontal component represent decreases in the vertical component such that when t 13 ms the 10 angle of attack has the highest splash crown height which decreases with increases in attack angle furthermore because horizontal energy affects the contraction seal of the splash crown the surface seal occurs much later for higher attack angles analyses of the cavity show that the appearance time of upstream cavity separation line decreases with increases in the attack angle also indicating that the greater the attack angle the smaller the area of influence of upstream cavity on the cylinder surface an upstream cavity in the 10 attack angle completely surrounds the cylinder t 56 ms so it can be concluded that the time of cavity pinch off is the latest and the earlier the cavity separation the shorter the time to cavity pinch off in order to address the evolution features of cavity splash we extract the cavity profiles based on image enhancement and edge detection operators method fig 10 gives comparative analyses in relation to different moments and different angles of attack represented by different line types and colors respectively l and d respectively represent the vertical distance between the contour and the free surface and the horizontal distance between the contour and the reference point of splash fig 10 a takes time as the horizontal axis for convenience different reference points are selected for the splash crown and the cavity the contrast of the contour of the splash crown indicates that with the increase of the angle of attack the angle α l between the left wall of the crown and the free surface increases the right wall moves toward to the middle and the absolute value of the slope of the right wall gradually increases from a comparison of the contour of the cavity the change rule for the right wall of the cavity is the same as that for the splash crown as the attack angle increases the area of the cavity decreases at the same moment fig 10 b takes the attack angle as the horizontal axis unlike vertical and inclined water entry the wall of the upstream cavity shows a trend toward inward contraction and the larger the angle of attack the more obvious this trend is with increases in time the left wall of the splash crown expands outward and the top contour of the crown is related to the angle between the initial crown wall and the free surface the influence of the angle of attack on the surface seal can be further analyzed analyses of the cavity and splash evolution and comparison of the extracted contours lead to a certain understanding of the impact of different angles of attack on the entire process of water entry next we conduct an in depth study of specific parameters of the cavity and splash fig 11 presents images of the moment when the crown begins to close t s under different conditions and a scatter diagram for t s here t s increases with increases in the angle of attack in an approximately linear fashion we select several characteristic quantities for comparative analyses first the ratio of the height of the splash crown h s to the length of cylinder l is selected to describe the dimensionless height h of the crown the schematic diagram for the method of h s selection and the scatter diagram for the changes in h over time in different conditions are shown in fig 12 h increases approximately linearly with time combined with the above analyses of t s it is clear that the time of collapse at the top of splash crown increases with the increase in attack angle at a 10 angle of attack there is no visible top for the splash crown at about 13 ms but in the 30 condition the top persists until about 52 ms at the same time the contact area between the small attack angle condition and the free surface is larger than for the large attack angle condition so the energy exchange is greater for the small attack angle that is the faster h increases the more the slope decreases with increases in the angle of attack analyzing the parameters of the splash crown shows that in the range of angle of attack selected in the experiment the start time of the inward contraction of the crown increases approximately linearly with the angle of attack accordingly the time of crown collapse is the earliest for 10 and the growth rate of the splash crown increases with increases in the attack angle the ratio of the distance from the left end of the cavity to the left end of the cylinder d c to the diameter of the cylinder d is selected as to represent the dimensionless width of the cavity w fig 13 gives a schematic diagram of w and the scatter diagram in different conditions the overall trend shows that cavity width w increases over time but the growth rate decreases only gradually the initial value for w occurs later than the small angle of attack due to the late occurrence of the open cavity stage in the high angle of the attack condition and the high attack angle condition is accompanied by greater horizontal component force in this case the growth rate of w at the initial water entry is faster because the crown closing time is the earliest at 10 completed in 50 ms and the inward contraction force significantly inhibits the development of the cavity the width curve for the cavity in this condition exhibits a different trend than that of other conditions after 45 ms the influence area of the cavity on the cylinder wall differs in relation to the differently asymmetric characteristics of the cavity at different angles of attack to study the influence area of the cavity we assign the cavity influence coefficient c w to the ratio of the length of upstream cavity wrapped cylinder l c to the cylinder length l fig 14 shows the schematic diagram and scatter diagram for c w a trend of first increasing to a stable range and then decreasing is seen the cavity on the upstream side at 10 completely envelops the cylinder so c w reaches its maximum value of 1 at 48 ms it is also seen from a comparison of the curves that increases in the attack angle significantly reduce the cavity s area of influence on the cylinder and the time to reach its maximum value is delayed in addition the speed of decrease for c w gradually increases next we extract the moment when the upstream cavity influence coefficient reaches its maximum value t m under different angles of attack conditions fig 15 shows images of the cavity at tm and a scatter diagram of t m and c w max respectively both obviously decrease with increased angle of attack the curve in fig 15 b shows the curve after second order polynomial fitting and it demonstrates that c w max and t m present similar trends 3 3 influence of angle of attack on the impact and surface load this section investigates the influence of different angles of attack on the impact and surface pressures of the cylinder first we study the head of the cylinder that bears the largest load during water entry and the p1 pressure curve for different conditions is extracted in fig 16 at the same time to obtain more accurate results and to verify the repeatability of the measurements the maximum and average values for impact pressure in the three groups of tests at each angle of attack are also shown in fig 16 a comparison of the pressure curves for different conditions shows that the influence of angle of attack on p1 pressure is reflected in the peak value and the time that the peak value appears because of the large vertical distance between p1 and the free surface at a high angle of attack the peak value for p1 appears later at the same speed of water entry fig 16 b indicates more intuitively that the peak value for impact load at p1 shows an obvious decrease for increases in attack angle compared to the difference between the average value of the peak pressure of adjacent attack angle it can be seen that the difference shows a trend of approximate gradient change the research consensus is that both speed and angle of water entry affect the duration of high load so we will take 70 of the peak pressure of the impact load in each condition as the standard value and define the duration of high load δt as the time when the pressure value is above the standard value fig 17 a shows a schematic diagram of the extraction of the high load duration the average value of δt in fig 17 b shows that the duration of the high load increases with increases in the attack angle at the same time linear fitting shows an approximately linear relationship between δt and α the above analyses of the impact load and the duration of high load at the center of the bottom of the cylinder at different attack angles show the peak value of the impact pressure decreases in a gradient fashion with increases in attack angle by comparing the duration of high load during water entry we find that the relationship between the duration of high load and angle of attack is approximately linear to evaluate the reliability of the results it is necessary to compare the test results with existing research the function to be compared is the maximum pressure coefficient estimated with the following expression 1 1 c p max p max 0 5 ρ w v 0 2 where v 0 is the impact velocity obtained from the acceleration integral and p max is the peak value of the pressure curve fig 18 compares the maximum pressure coefficients with the wagner 1932 model and the experimental results produced by barjasteh et al 2016 a good agreement is found with barjasteh et al 2016 and the wagner 1932 model for attack angles greater than 15 this matches the law obtained by barjasteh et al 2016 largely due to the assumptions of wagner s model due to the assumptions of the model air drag and the buffer effect are not considered in the simple wagner model thus this theory overestimates the maximum pressure coefficient for small angles of attack to explore changes in surface load as a cylinder enters water with an angle of attack we extract the measurement results for the p2 pressure sensor under different conditions and choose the images at the moment t 7 ms when the pressure for each condition has obvious differences the curves and images of the cavity at that moment are shown in fig 19 we find that pressure variations in p2 are different from those of p1 which indicates an obviously different tendency for different angles of attack mainly reflected in differences in pressure value and time domain at t 7 ms pressure at p2 is less than atmospheric pressure for a 10 attack angle and the relative pressure is negative this image shows that p2 is in the interior of the cavity and the cavity is connected with the air due to the sudden expansion of the cavity less air flows in so the pressure in the cavity is less than the atmosphere and the absolute value of the relative pressure at p2 is at its peak due to the continuous inflow of air the pressure difference is reduced and the absolute value of the pressure at p2 becomes less than its value at the beginning of cavity development for the 15 condition the pressure is slightly greater than atmospheric pressure although the upstream cavity wraps around the cylinder head there is no visible cavity on the right side the pressure at the 20 angle of attack passes the peak value and begins to show a downward trend it is clear that the upstream cavity separation line is just at the upper end of p2 although p2 shows positive pressure at a 25 angle of attack a downward trend nevertheless appears the cavity separation line nears the lower side of p2 at that moment at the same moment at 30 the pressure is close to its peak value and there is a trend toward continuous increase p2 is entirely in contact with water and is not affected by the cavity in fig 20 we see that changes in surface load are different from those in impact load by selecting specific times and performing individual analyses of different conditions we obtain a preliminary understanding of the reasons for changes in surface load we select three surface load curves for detailed description to further explain the change law for pressure at p2 in relation to different angles of attack three representative conditions are that indicate the relationship between cavity and load and the results for negative values positive values and pressure fluctuations are analyzed first the pressure curve for p2 for 10 is given separately in fig 20 and experimental images of four typical moments are given on the right side in that figure when t 2 3 ms no obvious cavity appears because the cylinder has just passed water impact a certain distance remains between p2 and free surface but because the impact with water causes violent flow field movement a small pressure fluctuation results at t 2 9 ms a cavity is generated at the head of cylinder and p2 is in the interior of the cavity because air is entrained into the cavity in water entry due to pressure differences the internal pressure of the cavity is less than atmospheric pressure thus the pressure at p2 is significantly less than atmospheric pressure as upstream cavity expands p2 has negative pressure but because of the continuous entry of air the pressure difference decreases and the absolute value of the pressure is small at a 10 angle of attack the pressure change in p2 leads to a surface load of the cylinder that is less than atmospheric pressure at water entry because of the generation and development of the cavity the continuous inflow of air causes the interior of the cavity to reach negative pressure fig 21 b presents this phenomenon in a schematic diagram it should be noted that the shadow area in the figure is an approximate area of negative pressure which is only used to explain the pressure change near p2 fig 21 presents the pressure curve of p2 for a 25 angle of attack and corresponding images of typical moments no obvious law governs the pressure change the reasons for the pressure change are analyzed in combination with the cavity images below at t 3 ms the cavity appears on the upstream side and p2 remains some distance from the free surface meaning that the pressure here is near to atmospheric pressure the first peak of the curve appears at t 5 ms the image indicates that p2 impacts the water surface and the principle that generates load is similar to that of the center of the bottom surface because an instantaneous increase in the cavity volume leads to suction the pressure shows a short term decreasing trend during t 10 11 ms the pressure has obvious fluctuations observation of the change in cavity indicates that the upstream cavity separation line sweeps the sensor surface of p2 therefore the fluctuation of the pressure curve is due to the sweeping of the separation line fig 22 b gives a schematic diagram to explain this when t 15 ms the upstream cavity covers the surface of the cylinder including p2 the pressure change inside the cavity is analyzed above the theory still applies and pressure shows a decreasing trend at this moment fig 22 a shows the pressure curve for p2 and the cavity images at characteristic moments for the 30 angle of attack for t 3 ms p2 does not contact the water surface and there is no obvious cavity the flow field in contact with the p2 sensor is mainly air so pressure remains approximately equal to ambient pressure at t 5 ms the upstream cavity still does not affect the p2 sensor but p2 is in contact with the free surface so its pressure is about to reach the peak value we know that the maximum value of the cavity influence coefficient is 0 06 at the upstream side of 30 angle of attack which means that the cavity generated upstream does not pass through the sensor surface during water entry therefore p2 is in direct contact with the water so the relative pressure is positive and there is no noticeable pressure fluctuation analyses of p2 pressure change for α 30 show why surface load presents a stable positive value during water entry at different angles of attack fig 22 b presents a schematic diagram to help explain this phenomenon when p2 is in direct contact water pressure acts on the surface of the sensor resulting in positive relative pressure at the location if there is no cavity effect the pressure curve does not fluctuate significantly similarly the shaded area in the figure is also a schematic area to show the pressure change near p2 in this condition 4 conclusions we experimentally study the evolution of the cavity and splash and the load characteristics of water entry with initial conditions of different angles of attack the main conclusions of the present study are as follows 1 the characteristics of the flow field play an important role in the surface load of the cylinder the cavities evolution over time shows obvious unsteady characteristics and is characterized as cavity formation development separation collapse and necking etc meanwhile the internal and external pressure environment and mechanical properties dominate the evolution of the cavity the pressure on the head of the cylinder shows a clear peak but the pressure load on the shoulder of the cylinder is reduced and shows more complex pulsation characteristics 2 cavity evolution during the water entry process is closely related to the angle of attack of the cylinder larger angles of attack shorten the time of cavity pinch off but extend the time of surface seal the time that the splash crown begins to shrink inward shows an approximately linear relationship to the angle of attack the growth rate of the splash crown decreases with increases in attack angle and the change law of the cavity width has the opposite tendency the influence coefficient of the upstream cavity decreases as the attack angle increases and the peak value of the coefficient and the moment of reaching the peak value show the same change law 3 the angle of attack of the cylinder has a significant effect on the load characteristics of water entry the peak value of impact pressure shows a downward trend in the test conditions and the moment of the peak value appear is delayed moreover it is found that the relationship between the duration of high load and the angle of attack has a linear increase for the surface load of the cylinder entrained air at an initial stage of water entry process causes the relative pressure of the surface inside the cavity is momentarily negative when the cavity separation line passes the model surface the surface has undergone drastic changes in the flow field and a pressure fluctuation appears the part in contact with the water shows significant positive pressure due to the pressure of water credit authorship

21234,the characteristics of cavity evolution and surface load in water entry by a constrained posture cylinder at different angles of attack are experimentally investigated high speed photography is used to capture flow behaviors and a measurement system is established to measure the pressure on the surface of the cylinder and its acceleration during the process of water entry the experimental results show that when the cylinder enters the water at a certain angle of attack the cavity shows an obvious asymmetry comparison of angles of attack shows that the cavity evolution and load characteristics during the water entry process are closely related to the angle of attack of the cylinder increasing the angle of attack can short the period if cavity pinch off but prolong the time of surface seal meanwhile the peak value of impact pressure shows a gradual downward trend with the increased angle of attack and the relationship between the duration of high load and the angle of attack is approximately linear moreover the characteristics of the flow field play an important role in the surface load of the cylinder an obvious and short lived negative relative pressure will appear on the surface of the model inside the cavity at the initial stage of water entry the part of cylinder that is not affected by the cavity and directly interacts with water has a continuous positive pressure trend in addition in can be found that there is a significant pressure fluctuation when the cavity separation line passes over the surface keywords water entry angle of attack cavity evolution load characteristics 1 introduction the problem of water entry is typically encountered in ocean engineering and it has a wide range of military and civilian applications such as in air dropped torpedoes rocket booster recovery aircraft landing on water surfaces and hull slamming due to waves water entry is a multiphase flow process with transient and nonlinear flow due to the sudden change in medium at the moment of impact a great impact load appears on the part that contacts the water which may cause deformation and damage and lead to a failure of internal components resulting in serious adverse effects the problem of cavity evolution and the load characteristics of water entry has received widespread attention from researchers the theoretical study of water entry began in the 1920s von karman 1929 put forward the concept of additional mass extrapolated from the law of conservation of momentum and thus obtained a theoretical method of solving the impact load of a two dimensional wedge during water entry on this basis wagner 1932 addressed pressure distribution on the surface of the wedge which laid a foundation for later theoretical research however wagner s model did not consider air cushion effects verhagen 1967 incorporated the phenomenon of air cushion combined with the air compressibility and presented a model of pressure prediction lee et al 1997 drawing on the principle of the conservation of energy studied cavity evolution and established a dynamic model of the cavity in relation to a projectile in high speed water entry duez et al 2007 proposed a relationship between the critical speed of the formation of the water entry cavity and the contact angle with the surface the critical speed changes little with the contact angle for angles less than 90 xu et al 2008 analyzed the oblique water entry of an asymmetrical wedge based on the complex velocity potential using the boundary element method in particular it was encouraging to observe the sharp variation and negative pressure near the tip of the wedge ding et al 2015 using the rayleigh besant equation established the cavity dynamic model to accurately obtain the characteristics of the radial expansion of the cavity due to imperfections in the theoretical approach experimental research on the water entry problem developed only gradually since the beginning of the 20th century study of water entry has been conducted using high speed photography worthington and cole 1897 used this means to capture the typical characteristics of the vertical water entry of spheres such as cavity splash and surface seal and this led to further developments in the understanding of the phenomenon due to the sphere s radial symmetry it offers certain advantages for research in mechanics so early work on water entry centered on spheres bell 1924 showed the effects of surface tension viscosity and surface layers on the impact of a solid sphere on a fluid surface gilberg and anderson 1948 conducted experimental study on the water entry of a sphere under different types of environmental pressure and their results showed that environmental pressure could affect the characteristics of splash and cavity evolution in water entry may and woodhull 1948 and may 1951 1952 carried out a series of experiments with spheres having different parameters and analyzed the influence of initial conditions on the cavity and resistance coefficient richardson 1948 conducted a series of studies on the vertical and inclined water entry of a rotating body he analyzed the hydrodynamic characteristics of the entry and discussed the bounce phenomenon during entry greenhow 1987 studied the two dimensional entry of wedges of various angles into initially calm water based on theoretical approaches excellent results of free surface displacements and pressure distributions on the wetted wedge surface were obtained aristoff et al 2008 2009 carried out a series of experiments on the water entry of hydrophobic spheres particular attention was paid to the shape of the resulting air cavity in the low bond numbers truscott and techet 2009 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of the water entry of a spinning sphere at low froude numbers and described the phenomenon of splash seal and cavity pinch off hurd et al 2017 focused on the characteristics of the water entry of deformable elastomeric spheres and found that the cavity behavior of deformable spheres clearly differs from those of rigid spheres sun et al 2019a 2019b carried out a series of experiments on sphere entry into a viscous liquid floating on water and studied cavity dynamics and splash crown behaviors under the influence of a viscous liquid li et al 2020 studied the water entry of a spinning sphere by combining experiments and numerical calculations they also provided a detailed analysis of the effects of spin rate on the flow evolution of a fluid and its dynamic characteristics in practical engineering the cylinder has a broad range of applications so the focus of investigators gradually turned to the more practical are of studying the water entry of cylinders truscott et al 2014 conducted a series of experiments on high speed water entry and their results showed that trajectory stability was severely affected by the angle of water entry wei et al 2015 carried out a series of

advantages of fluid structure coupling method zhang et al 2019 sun et al 2020 used the fluid structure interaction method to analyze the structural response and load characteristics of high speed water entry of a cylinder and explained the structural damage caused by the impact load using pressure sensors treichler and kiger 2020 studied the internal pressure characteristics of the supercavitation of projectiles in water the entry cavity they showed that the size of the water tank significantly affected the dynamic characteristics of the cavity although extensive research has been carried out on the cavity evolution and impact load of water entry angle of attack as a variable parameter for the water entry of a cylinder is an important topic of in depth study meanwhile the inherent relationship between the load of the water entry structure and the flow field is of great significance for the study of the design of ships and marine structures here we experimentally investigate the water entry of a constrained posture cylinder with different angles of attack extracting test images and pressure curves from sensors distributed on the surface of the cylinder we investigate the relationship between cavity and surface load the relationship among angle of attack cavity and load is explored by changing the angle of attack section 2 presents the experimental setup and the experimental conditions section 3 gives the experimental results and analyzes the characteristics of the cavity splash and pressure under different angles of attack the conclusions are presented in section 4 2 experimental setup fig 1 presents the schematic for our experimental system and the attitudes of the cylinder during the test the upstream side of the cylinder is the first and fourth quadrant in the coordinate system and the downstream side is the second and third quadrant the entire system is divisible into four parts release gear electromagnet sliding rail and release switch lighting device high speed camera and measurement system the water tank is 1400 740 800 mm length width height and the water is 600 mm deep before each test the electromagnet is electrified to fix the model connection device in place when the release switch is turned off the falls and begins water entry here the high speed camera begins to collect the images and the measurement system records the pressure and acceleration of the entire process a phantom v12 1 high speed camera is used with a frame rate of 3000 fps and an image resolution of 1280 800 pixel the measurement system consists of three pressure sensors installed inside the cylinder one external acceleration sensor and an instrument for data acquisition fig 2 shows the internal layout of the cylinder which is divided into three parts to facilitate sensor installation p1 is placed at the center of the head of the cylinder and the distances from p2 and p3 to the bottom of the cylinder are 0 38 d and 1 3 d respectively in order to verify the reliability of the test equipment fig 3 a shows the velocity curve during the water entry process for repeated test conditions it can be seen that the velocity has a good consistency and the maximum relative error is less than 2 5 moreover fig 3 b and c show the surface pressure curves of p2 and the images obtained based on three repetitive experiments for the 15 angle of attack respectively these results indicate that the experiment has good repeatability the experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 the initial velocity of water entry is extracted from the curves shown in fig 3 the attack angle of the cylinder is set using the angle adjuster and calibrated by the digital angle ruler to ensure that the angle of attack is consistent during the repeatability test each condition of the angle of attack is repeated at least three times to ensure measurement accuracy 3 results and discussion 3 1 cavity evolution and load characteristics of the cylinder under a fixed angle of attack to address cavity evolution and the surface load characteristics of cylinder water entry in relation to angle of attack we provide detailed analyses of the conditions with an attack angle of α 20 and a velocity of v 0 2 99 m s fig 4 presents a sequence of images that depict the cavity evolution with the given condition the first moment of contact between the cylinder and the free surface is defined as time zero t 0 ms as the cylinder continues to fall the water entry passes into the stage of flow formation at t 3 ms as a result of the entry transfer caused by the impact of the cylinder on free surface the surrounding fluid acquires kinetic energy and begins to flow at the same time the cylinder bottom squeezes the discharged water resulting in a lateral splash the phase of flow formation is of very short duration and varies for different angles of attack the open cavity stage occurs at t 10 ms as the water is pushed around the air follows the entrainment of the cylinder forming an obvious cavity and splash at the same time it is seen that the cavity in the downstream part is wholly connected with the atmosphere while the cavity in the upstream part intersects with the cylinder and forms a semi closed cavity due to asymmetry an apparent splash crown and lateral jet are also observed due to extrusion as time passes the cavity downstream continues to expand and the upstream cavity adheres to the surface of the cylinder with a clear cavity separation line gradually appearing because the air is constantly and quickly sucked into the cavity the pressure inside the cavity is lower than the atmosphere so the splash crown gradually shrinks inward in the middle of the water entry the top of the splash crown begins to collapse t 35 45 ms due to the reduced the pressure difference between the interior of the cavity and the pressure of the atmosphere and the water the wall of the stretched cavity upstream contracts inward and finally causes a deep pinch off of the cavity in the same way the surface seal gradually occurs after the collapse of the splash crown observation of the splash crown shows that the outer edge of the crown contracts toward the center before the surface seal fig 5 presents this phenomenon and provides further analysis of the entire process f and f represent the outward and inward force of the splash crown respectively h c is the distance from the contour of the splash crown to the free surface and l s is the relative distance from the contour to the right vertex it is well known that an inward force always occurs before the surface seal due to the difference in internal and external pressure however the outward force caused by the energy exchange due to the impact of the water is far greater than the inward force the opposite is true at the top of the splash crown there the inward force is slightly greater than the outward force and this results in a trend in the movement of this position opposite to that of the whole crown as time passes the energy that is transferred due to the impact is gradually reduced and the gap between the two forces narrows such that the trend of outward expansion turns to an inward contraction it is also seen that the top of the crown moves upward as it contracts fig 5 b connects the contour of the top of the splash crown marked by the red line in fig 5 a into a curved surface which more intuitively reflects the law of the splash crown it can be clearly seen that the evolution trend of the inward shrinkage and upward development of the splashes in time and space our analyses show that the imbalance between the outward and inward forces leads to a particular phenomenon at the top of the splash crown that is closely related to changes in force difference to explore the characteristics of the surface load of a constrained posture cylinder with a certain angle of attack we collect pressure signals at three points within this condition first fig 6 shows the curve of pressure versus time at p1 the overall change trend of the curve is the same as that of the typical water entry conditions and all exhibit a rapid reduction to a lower stable value after the peak value is reached when t 0 ms the cylinder contacts the free surface for the first time and due to the angle of attack p1 is still a certain distance from the surface of the water so the pressure at p1 is approximately equal to the current ambient pressure the pressure reaches a peak value at t 2 ms and p1 impacts the free surface when t 15 ms the cylinder passes through water impact the interaction between p1 and the water changes from impact to continuous contact under the action of water resistance and water pressure and the pressure at p1 is continuously and stably higher than atmospheric pressure thus we can judge the mechanism of the peak water entry pressure in relation to the angle of attack and the time of peak pressure occurs at the same velocity for both the vertical and inclined conditions the pressure curve for p2 and images of four characteristic moments are given in fig 7 the entire pressure curve increases rapidly attains peak pressure at a relatively slow speed and finally decreases to approximately ambient pressure there is noticeable pressure fluctuation during the second increase no obvious pressure variation appears during t 0 4 ms indicating that the impact has no influence on p2 the pressure rises rapidly due to contact with the free surface t 4 ms the cylinder wall forms a 70 angle with the surface of the water so the force of the impact has a small component on the wall and the pressure is mainly generated by contact with the water at the same time the upstream cavity has no noticeable effect on p2 as the water pressure increases the pressure at p2 also gradually increases meanwhile we can see that the pressure sharply decreases during 6 6 8 ms the surface pressure is affected by the cavity splash around the cylinder and presents fluctuation characteristics the upstream cavity separation line just passes the sensor surface during this period and the pressure reaches its peak value after that as the cavity covers the head of the cylinder including p2 the pressure drops to the range of the environmental pressure the curves shown in figs 6 and 7 show different trends indicating that the impact load and surface load for cylinder water entry at a given angle of attack are significantly different finally pressure of p3 is shown in fig 8 because p3 is far from the bottom of the cylinder the pressure curve shows no visible change when t 11 6 ms a positive pressure trend is seen the images show that p3 comes into contact the water attached to the wall due to the splash so pressure increases during this period similarly when p3 is in contact with the surface of the water the pressure increases accordingly interestingly it is can been seen that the pressure evolution of p3 presents negative values after 12 ms during the water entry process of cylinder the air around the cylinder is driven to flow and form cavitation splash cavity seal around the cylinder prevents entrained air flowing into the cavity thus causing the measured pressure to be lower than the ambient atmospheric pressure 3 2 influence of angle of attack on cavity evolution and splash in this section the evolution of the cavity and the characteristics of the splash in the process of cylinder water entry with angles of attack 10 15 20 25 and 30 are analyzed first we analyze the entire process of water entry fig 9 shows a sequence of images of cavity evolution in different conditions because the cylinder s rotation is constrained the rotating moment caused by water resistance is not taken into consideration the impact of the angle of attack is mainly reflected in the lateral splash the height of the splash crown and the surface seal as well as in the area of the cavity cavity separation line and other phenomena the impact of the lateral splash can be seen in a comparison to the image for t 10 ms under conditions of a higher angle of attack the horizontal component of the impact force is larger and more energy is transferred to the water hence the distance of lateral splash increases with increases in angle of attack given the same entry velocity increases in the horizontal component represent decreases in the vertical component such that when t 13 ms the 10 angle of attack has the highest splash crown height which decreases with increases in attack angle furthermore because horizontal energy affects the contraction seal of the splash crown the surface seal occurs much later for higher attack angles analyses of the cavity show that the appearance time of upstream cavity separation line decreases with increases in the attack angle also indicating that the greater the attack angle the smaller the area of influence of upstream cavity on the cylinder surface an upstream cavity in the 10 attack angle completely surrounds the cylinder t 56 ms so it can be concluded that the time of cavity pinch off is the latest and the earlier the cavity separation the shorter the time to cavity pinch off in order to address the evolution features of cavity splash we extract the cavity profiles based on image enhancement and edge detection operators method fig 10 gives comparative analyses in relation to different moments and different angles of attack represented by different line types and colors respectively l and d respectively represent the vertical distance between the contour and the free surface and the horizontal distance between the contour and the reference point of splash fig 10 a takes time as the horizontal axis for convenience different reference points are selected for the splash crown and the cavity the contrast of the contour of the splash crown indicates that with the increase of the angle of attack the angle α l between the left wall of the crown and the free surface increases the right wall moves toward to the middle and the absolute value of the slope of the right wall gradually increases from a comparison of the contour of the cavity the change rule for the right wall of the cavity is the same as that for the splash crown as the attack angle increases the area of the cavity decreases at the same moment fig 10 b takes the attack angle as the horizontal axis unlike vertical and inclined water entry the wall of the upstream cavity shows a trend toward inward contraction and the larger the angle of attack the more obvious this trend is with increases in time the left wall of the splash crown expands outward and the top contour of the crown is related to the angle between the initial crown wall and the free surface the influence of the angle of attack on the surface seal can be further analyzed analyses of the cavity and splash evolution and comparison of the extracted contours lead to a certain understanding of the impact of different angles of attack on the entire process of water entry next we conduct an in depth study of specific parameters of the cavity and splash fig 11 presents images of the moment when the crown begins to close t s under different conditions and a scatter diagram for t s here t s increases with increases in the angle of attack in an approximately linear fashion we select several characteristic quantities for comparative analyses first the ratio of the height of the splash crown h s to the length of cylinder l is selected to describe the dimensionless height h of the crown the schematic diagram for the method of h s selection and the scatter diagram for the changes in h over time in different conditions are shown in fig 12 h increases approximately linearly with time combined with the above analyses of t s it is clear that the time of collapse at the top of splash crown increases with the increase in attack angle at a 10 angle of attack there is no visible top for the splash crown at about 13 ms but in the 30 condition the top persists until about 52 ms at the same time the contact area between the small attack angle condition and the free surface is larger than for the large attack angle condition so the energy exchange is greater for the small attack angle that is the faster h increases the more the slope decreases with increases in the angle of attack analyzing the parameters of the splash crown shows that in the range of angle of attack selected in the experiment the start time of the inward contraction of the crown increases approximately linearly with the angle of attack accordingly the time of crown collapse is the earliest for 10 and the growth rate of the splash crown increases with increases in the attack angle the ratio of the distance from the left end of the cavity to the left end of the cylinder d c to the diameter of the cylinder d is selected as to represent the dimensionless width of the cavity w fig 13 gives a schematic diagram of w and the scatter diagram in different conditions the overall trend shows that cavity width w increases over time but the growth rate decreases only gradually the initial value for w occurs later than the small angle of attack due to the late occurrence of the open cavity stage in the high angle of the attack condition and the high attack angle condition is accompanied by greater horizontal component force in this case the growth rate of w at the initial water entry is faster because the crown closing time is the earliest at 10 completed in 50 ms and the inward contraction force significantly inhibits the development of the cavity the width curve for the cavity in this condition exhibits a different trend than that of other conditions after 45 ms the influence area of the cavity on the cylinder wall differs in relation to the differently asymmetric characteristics of the cavity at different angles of attack to study the influence area of the cavity we assign the cavity influence coefficient c w to the ratio of the length of upstream cavity wrapped cylinder l c to the cylinder length l fig 14 shows the schematic diagram and scatter diagram for c w a trend of first increasing to a stable range and then decreasing is seen the cavity on the upstream side at 10 completely envelops the cylinder so c w reaches its maximum value of 1 at 48 ms it is also seen from a comparison of the curves that increases in the attack angle significantly reduce the cavity s area of influence on the cylinder and the time to reach its maximum value is delayed in addition the speed of decrease for c w gradually increases next we extract the moment when the upstream cavity influence coefficient reaches its maximum value t m under different angles of attack conditions fig 15 shows images of the cavity at tm and a scatter diagram of t m and c w max respectively both obviously decrease with increased angle of attack the curve in fig 15 b shows the curve after second order polynomial fitting and it demonstrates that c w max and t m present similar trends 3 3 influence of angle of attack on the impact and surface load this section investigates the influence of different angles of attack on the impact and surface pressures of the cylinder first we study the head of the cylinder that bears the largest load during water entry and the p1 pressure curve for different conditions is extracted in fig 16 at the same time to obtain more accurate results and to verify the repeatability of the measurements the maximum and average values for impact pressure in the three groups of tests at each angle of attack are also shown in fig 16 a comparison of the pressure curves for different conditions shows that the influence of angle of attack on p1 pressure is reflected in the peak value and the time that the peak value appears because of the large vertical distance between p1 and the free surface at a high angle of attack the peak value for p1 appears later at the same speed of water entry fig 16 b indicates more intuitively that the peak value for impact load at p1 shows an obvious decrease for increases in attack angle compared to the difference between the average value of the peak pressure of adjacent attack angle it can be seen that the difference shows a trend of approximate gradient change the research consensus is that both speed and angle of water entry affect the duration of high load so we will take 70 of the peak pressure of the impact load in each condition as the standard value and define the duration of high load δt as the time when the pressure value is above the standard value fig 17 a shows a schematic diagram of the extraction of the high load duration the average value of δt in fig 17 b shows that the duration of the high load increases with increases in the attack angle at the same time linear fitting shows an approximately linear relationship between δt and α the above analyses of the impact load and the duration of high load at the center of the bottom of the cylinder at different attack angles show the peak value of the impact pressure decreases in a gradient fashion with increases in attack angle by comparing the duration of high load during water entry we find that the relationship between the duration of high load and angle of attack is approximately linear to evaluate the reliability of the results it is necessary to compare the test results with existing research the function to be compared is the maximum pressure coefficient estimated with the following expression 1 1 c p max p max 0 5 ρ w v 0 2 where v 0 is the impact velocity obtained from the acceleration integral and p max is the peak value of the pressure curve fig 18 compares the maximum pressure coefficients with the wagner 1932 model and the experimental results produced by barjasteh et al 2016 a good agreement is found with barjasteh et al 2016 and the wagner 1932 model for attack angles greater than 15 this matches the law obtained by barjasteh et al 2016 largely due to the assumptions of wagner s model due to the assumptions of the model air drag and the buffer effect are not considered in the simple wagner model thus this theory overestimates the maximum pressure coefficient for small angles of attack to explore changes in surface load as a cylinder enters water with an angle of attack we extract the measurement results for the p2 pressure sensor under different conditions and choose the images at the moment t 7 ms when the pressure for each condition has obvious differences the curves and images of the cavity at that moment are shown in fig 19 we find that pressure variations in p2 are different from those of p1 which indicates an obviously different tendency for different angles of attack mainly reflected in differences in pressure value and time domain at t 7 ms pressure at p2 is less than atmospheric pressure for a 10 attack angle and the relative pressure is negative this image shows that p2 is in the interior of the cavity and the cavity is connected with the air due to the sudden expansion of the cavity less air flows in so the pressure in the cavity is less than the atmosphere and the absolute value of the relative pressure at p2 is at its peak due to the continuous inflow of air the pressure difference is reduced and the absolute value of the pressure at p2 becomes less than its value at the beginning of cavity development for the 15 condition the pressure is slightly greater than atmospheric pressure although the upstream cavity wraps around the cylinder head there is no visible cavity on the right side the pressure at the 20 angle of attack passes the peak value and begins to show a downward trend it is clear that the upstream cavity separation line is just at the upper end of p2 although p2 shows positive pressure at a 25 angle of attack a downward trend nevertheless appears the cavity separation line nears the lower side of p2 at that moment at the same moment at 30 the pressure is close to its peak value and there is a trend toward continuous increase p2 is entirely in contact with water and is not affected by the cavity in fig 20 we see that changes in surface load are different from those in impact load by selecting specific times and performing individual analyses of different conditions we obtain a preliminary understanding of the reasons for changes in surface load we select three surface load curves for detailed description to further explain the change law for pressure at p2 in relation to different angles of attack three representative conditions are that indicate the relationship between cavity and load and the results for negative values positive values and pressure fluctuations are analyzed first the pressure curve for p2 for 10 is given separately in fig 20 and experimental images of four typical moments are given on the right side in that figure when t 2 3 ms no obvious cavity appears because the cylinder has just passed water impact a certain distance remains between p2 and free surface but because the impact with water causes violent flow field movement a small pressure fluctuation results at t 2 9 ms a cavity is generated at the head of cylinder and p2 is in the interior of the cavity because air is entrained into the cavity in water entry due to pressure differences the internal pressure of the cavity is less than atmospheric pressure thus the pressure at p2 is significantly less than atmospheric pressure as upstream cavity expands p2 has negative pressure but because of the continuous entry of air the pressure difference decreases and the absolute value of the pressure is small at a 10 angle of attack the pressure change in p2 leads to a surface load of the cylinder that is less than atmospheric pressure at water entry because of the generation and development of the cavity the continuous inflow of air causes the interior of the cavity to reach negative pressure fig 21 b presents this phenomenon in a schematic diagram it should be noted that the shadow area in the figure is an approximate area of negative pressure which is only used to explain the pressure change near p2 fig 21 presents the pressure curve of p2 for a 25 angle of attack and corresponding images of typical moments no obvious law governs the pressure change the reasons for the pressure change are analyzed in combination with the cavity images below at t 3 ms the cavity appears on the upstream side and p2 remains some distance from the free surface meaning that the pressure here is near to atmospheric pressure the first peak of the curve appears at t 5 ms the image indicates that p2 impacts the water surface and the principle that generates load is similar to that of the center of the bottom surface because an instantaneous increase in the cavity volume leads to suction the pressure shows a short term decreasing trend during t 10 11 ms the pressure has obvious fluctuations observation of the change in cavity indicates that the upstream cavity separation line sweeps the sensor surface of p2 therefore the fluctuation of the pressure curve is due to the sweeping of the separation line fig 22 b gives a schematic diagram to explain this when t 15 ms the upstream cavity covers the surface of the cylinder including p2 the pressure change inside the cavity is analyzed above the theory still applies and pressure shows a decreasing trend at this moment fig 22 a shows the pressure curve for p2 and the cavity images at characteristic moments for the 30 angle of attack for t 3 ms p2 does not contact the water surface and there is no obvious cavity the flow field in contact with the p2 sensor is mainly air so pressure remains approximately equal to ambient pressure at t 5 ms the upstream cavity still does not affect the p2 sensor but p2 is in contact with the free surface so its pressure is about to reach the peak value we know that the maximum value of the cavity influence coefficient is 0 06 at the upstream side of 30 angle of attack which means that the cavity generated upstream does not pass through the sensor surface during water entry therefore p2 is in direct contact with the water so the relative pressure is positive and there is no noticeable pressure fluctuation analyses of p2 pressure change for α 30 show why surface load presents a stable positive value during water entry at different angles of attack fig 22 b presents a schematic diagram to help explain this phenomenon when p2 is in direct contact water pressure acts on the surface of the sensor resulting in positive relative pressure at the location if there is no cavity effect the pressure curve does not fluctuate significantly similarly the shaded area in the figure is also a schematic area to show the pressure change near p2 in this condition 4 conclusions we experimentally study the evolution of the cavity and splash and the load characteristics of water entry with initial conditions of different angles of attack the main conclusions of the present study are as follows 1 the characteristics of the flow field play an important role in the surface load of the cylinder the cavities evolution over time shows obvious unsteady characteristics and is characterized as cavity formation development separation collapse and necking etc meanwhile the internal and external pressure environment and mechanical properties dominate the evolution of the cavity the pressure on the head of the cylinder shows a clear peak but the pressure load on the shoulder of the cylinder is reduced and shows more complex pulsation characteristics 2 cavity evolution during the water entry process is closely related to the angle of attack of the cylinder larger angles of attack shorten the time of cavity pinch off but extend the time of surface seal the time that the splash crown begins to shrink inward shows an approximately linear relationship to the angle of attack the growth rate of the splash crown decreases with increases in attack angle and the change law of the cavity width has the opposite tendency the influence coefficient of the upstream cavity decreases as the attack angle increases and the peak value of the coefficient and the moment of reaching the peak value show the same change law 3 the angle of attack of the cylinder has a significant effect on the load characteristics of water entry the peak value of impact pressure shows a downward trend in the test conditions and the moment of the peak value appear is delayed moreover it is found that the relationship between the duration of high load and the angle of attack has a linear increase for the surface load of the cylinder entrained air at an initial stage of water entry process causes the relative pressure of the surface inside the cavity is momentarily negative when the cavity separation line passes the model surface the surface has undergone drastic changes in the flow field and a pressure fluctuation appears the part in contact with the water shows significant positive pressure due to the pressure of water credit authorship
