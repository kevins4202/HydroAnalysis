8040,with a wide variety of natural and potential anthropogenic inputs the athabasca river ar has been the focus of recent attention in addition to natural inputs of trace elements tes from tributaries industrial activities such as mining and upgrading of bitumen have been viewed as additional potentially important anthropogenic sources but evidence is limited to quantify the spatiotemporal variations of te concentrations and their forms water samples were gathered along a 125 km stretch of the river from upstream to downstream of the industrial region and at three points across the river along five transects perpendicular to the flow the samples were collected in the autumn of 2017 and the spring of 2018 using novel metal free sampling methods the concentrations of total i e acid extractable and dissolved i e 0 45 µm tes were measured to compare with water quality guidelines and their size based distribution amongst major colloidal forms was determined to better assess their biological significance the results quantify spatiotemporal variation in total and dissolved concentrations of tes along and across the ar in both seasons the majority of tes occurred in the particulate fraction none of the tes were significantly enriched in the particulate fraction relative to crustal abundance the average concentrations of tes were below the ccme surface water

the longest river 1538 km in alberta and a major river in canada newton 2019 this river has been the center of much recent scientific and media attention due to serious concerns about water quality throughout the watershed wrona et al 2000 and worries regarding possible impacts on ecological and human health kelly et al 2009 2010 the ar has been exposed to a growing number of environmental

sands development in downstream surficial bottom sediments of the athabasca river wiklund et al 2014 given the contradictory results published to date the extent of potential contributions of tes to the ar from industrial activities requires additional scrutiny despite the focus on industrial contributions to water quality in the ar natural inputs of tes to the river must be duly considered along with their physical and chemical forms recent investigations have shown that almost all of the pb in snow of the region is in the particulate fraction javed et al 2017 this is true also of the majority of tes in the ar javed et al 2020 including v and ni which are the two most abundant trace metals in bitumen bicalho et al 2017 in consequence concentrations of tes in the dissolved fraction i e 0 45 µm are extremely low shotyk et al 2017 donner et al 2017 2018 other investigations highlight the important contributions of tributaries to the main stem of the ar tondu 2017 as well as the predominance of colloidal forms of some elements cuss et al 2018 2020b further complicating any source assessment the hydrology of the ar watershed is impacted by climate change shrestha et al 2017

gue et al 2015 sun et al 2017 cuss et al 2018 in many previous reports the concentrations of tes in the ar and snow samples have been considered evidence of industrial influence on te concentrations

cuss et al 2020a considering the immense variety of potential anthropogenic and natural inputs to the ar concentration measurements alone are not sufficient to understand the significance of tes to assess the sources of tes and their ecological significance factors such as their form speciation and size distribution should also be taken into account donner et al 2017 2018 javed et al 2017 shotyk et al 2017 cuss et al 2018 the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of tes in natural waters depend on their chemical speciation and their forms worms et al 2006 cuss et al 2018 some tes especially the transition metals form stable organic and inorganic complexes and may occur partly or predominantly in these forms gaillardet et al 2014 predicting the partitioning of tes into different phases is challenging because it depends on many factors such as ph ionic strength temperature dom concentration and quality and salinity buffle 1992 gaillardet et al 2014 cuss et al 2020a the particulate dissolved colloidal and truly dissolved fractions are commonly defined as 0 45 µm 0 45 µm 1 nm or 1 kda to 0 45 µm and 1 kda 1 nm respectively among these the truly dissolved fraction has the greatest potential to directly affect aquatic life gélabert et al 2007 to accurately measure the distribution of tes amongst the mentioned major colloidal forms reliable and precise methods are needed cuss et al 2017 asymmetric flow field flow fractionation af4 is able to separate a wide variety of macromolecules and colloids wahlund and giddings 1987 fraunhofer and winter 2004 cuss et al 2017 coupling af4 with the smallest membrane pore size 300 da to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms enables measurement of the size based distribution of dissolved tes among colloidal forms beckett et al 1991 cuss et al 2017 to better understand the relevance of tes for water quality in the ar our primary objectives were to 1 quantify spatiotemporal variation in the concentrations of tes total dissolved and dissolved colloidal forms along the ar we targeted a 125 km stretch of the ar that starts at fort mcmurray descending past bitumen mining and upgrading operations travelling downstream to the firebag river 2 quantify the same variations but across the ar for this purpose surface and middle water layers were sampled at five transects 2 transects upstream t1 and t2 one midstream t3 and two downstream of industry t4 and t5 at the east middle and west side of the river 3 provide a thorough assessment of background te concentrations and forms as a backdrop to enable the meaningful evaluation of potential industrial contributions this requires due consideration of both seasonal and spatial variations from upstream to downstream across the river and assessment of contributions from tributaries 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area water samples were gathered from five cross river transects along a 125 km stretch of the ar from fort mcmurray downstream past bitumen mining and upgrading operations to the firebag river samples were collected in autumn 2017 when tributary and groundwater inputs are most important and in spring 2018 when meltwater exerts more influence to account for spatial variation across the river samples were collected at six points for each transect t1 t5 from the surface and middle of the water column at each of three locations across the river east middle and west fig 1 these five transects were chosen to account for tributary inputs between t1 and t2 potential inputs from industry in front of tailings ponds and bitumen upgrading facilities at t3 and groundwater influences downstream of industry between t4 and t5 fig 1 2 2 ultraclean sampling and analysis conditions a specialized metal free depth sampler was designed and constructed for collecting water samples fig 2 at each site samples were collected in two 125 ml polypropylene pp bottles and one 125 ml teflon fep thermo fisher scientific waltham massachusetts cat 02 924 15 a all bottles were cleaned in a metal free class 100 clean air cabinet in the swamp laboratory the pp bottles were soaked in a soap bath overnight after being rinsed they were soaked in a 5 hcl acid bath overnight then they were soaked in 10 hno3 acid baths for seven days followed by heating to 60 80 c for 6 8 h on a hot plate all bottles were then rinsed three times each first using astm type ii and then type i water 15 1 and 18 2 mω cm respectively milli q water milliporesigma burlington massachusetts usa these bottles were dedicated to total and dissolved tes with one of them containing the unfiltered water samples to determine total tes dissolved particulate and the other for the dissolved fraction the teflon fep bottles were rinsed with milli q water mqw for determination of the colloidal size distribution in the dissolved fraction the fep bottles were used to minimize the adsorptive losses to container walls for the non acidified samples that were analyzed for te distributions among colloidal forms the fep bottles were also rinsed with filtered river water before gathering the samples to distinguish between the dissolved and particulate fractions samples were immediately filtered in the field using syringe filters with 0 45 µm hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes with 0 45 µm pore size milliporesigma thermo fisher scientific waltham massachusetts cat slcr025ns to avoid filter clogging 4 5 filters were used for each 125 ml of dissolved sample filters and syringes were precleaned in the lab by passing 10 ml of 2 double distilled hno3 through the filter and rinsing with mqw in the field to avoid adsorptive losses to filter surfaces we pre conditioned the filters with water samples all water samples were kept in a cooler with ice packs and transferred to storage at 4 c until analysis all sampling equipment was pre cleaned using multi stage acid cleaning and packed under ultraclean conditions for shipment to and use in the field shotyk et al 2017 cuss et al 2020b to minimize the risk of contamination all measurements were conducted in the ultraclean metal free swamp laboratory facility at the university of alberta based on their common ecological functions sources and behavior tes were classified as belonging to one of the following groups goldschmidt 1937 tes of environmental concern as cd pb sb and tl shotyk et al 2017 micronutrients cu zn shotyk et al 2019 tes that are enriched in bitumen mo ni re v bicalho et al 2017 lithophile and siderophile elements which are expected to be found predominantly in colloidal forms al co cr fe mn cuss et al 2020a and actinides th u total and dissolved concentrations of these tes were determined using icp ms normalization to th a conservative lithophile element was performed to assess whether the tes are likely associated with recalcitrant mineral forms of materials from the upper continental crust ucc since this ratio is more or less constant therein e g 1 6 for pb th rudnick and gao 2014 to detect the contribution of tributaries and better assess the transport bioaccessibility and reactivity of dissolved tes their distribution amongst truly dissolved primarily organic and primarily inorganic colloids were measured using asymmetric flow field flow fractionation af4 coupled to icp ms cuss et al 2017 2018 the distribution of tes amongst colloidal forms has been used as a fingerprint to identify tributary sources along this stretch of the ar cuss et al 2018 the af4 was equipped with a polyethersulfone pes separation membrane with the smallest available pore size 300 da to minimize the loss of small colloids and organic trace element complexes through the membrane the af4 postnova analytics salt lake city utah u s a was coupled to both a uv visible spectrophotometer uv agilent technologies g4212 dad santa clara california u s a and icp ms icap qc thermo fisher scientific waltham massachusetts u s a to measure the size based distribution of dissolved tes among mainly ionic species and small molecules organic colloids and larger inorganic colloids beckett et al 1991 cuss et al 2017 for the af4 flow program the crossflow and the injection rates were set to 2 1 and 0 2 ml min 1 respectively focusing for 6 min the crossflow was then set constant for 23 mins for elution followed by a linear decrease to zero over 1 min to elute the remaining large particles elution continued for an additional 20 min during all of these steps the channel flow rate was kept at 0 7 ml min 1 the af4 was coupled to icp ms with he collision gas 5 0 ml min 1 operating in kinetic energy discrimination ked mode the complete af4 flow program and the icp ms method parameters are described in detail elsewhere cuss et al 2018 the distribution of tes amongst dissolved colloidal species as determined using baseline level peak resolution with statistical fractogram deconvolution are shown in fig s1 as shown each of these dissolved fractions are associated with a specific retention time and corresponding molar mass the mainly ionic and small species fraction normally pass through the membrane and some elute at 455 s with a molar mass at peak maximum mp 0 3 kda this peak also contains the void peak consisting of unretained and improperly focused material the mainly ionic species are calculated as the dissolved concentration minus the te associated with colloids in the dom and primarily inorganic peaks the dom associated fraction with retention time tr of 550 s and mp 1 kda co elutes with the organic matter the remaining fractions are the small fe associated fraction mp 15 kda tr 900 s and the large fe associated fraction mp 20 7 kda tr 1800 s which elutes after the crossflow is turned off since this fraction consists of large molecules it moves through the channel very slowly cuss et al 2018 a broad range of other water quality parameters were also measured including ph ec doc and major ions table s1 the recovery of matrix matched standard reference materials srms at various concentrations were monitored throughout analyses to ensure the quality of icp ms results the af4 channel was similarly calibrated for molar mass before and after every ten samples using a combination of polystyrene sulfonate size standards and bromophenol blue cuss et al 2017 2 3 statistical analyses and trend detection data are expressed as mean values 95 confidence and throughout the text the term significant and meaningful are exclusively used to refer to statistical significance at this confidence level considering the challenges with standard statistical approaches for outlier detection and for complex data involving mixing from multiple sources generally five methods were used to assess outliers in the total and dissolved datasets including histogram grubbs test or esd the extreme studentized deviate gesd test the generalized extreme studentized deviate the median absolute deviations and the mean absolute deviations mad these methods were implemented using matlab r2017 and spss table s3 histograms clearly indicated the presence of bimodal distributions across the river as would be expected from the inputs of tributaries groundwaters and industry considering both bimodality and the relevant assumptions of all of these methods table s3 outliers were identified and removed bimodal distributions are normally an indication of heterogeneous samples different populations or samples with high variability and could suggest that the observations may come from two or more distributions murphy 1964 wang 2017 to test the significance of apparent differences the data were subjected to one sided t test for normal data or wilcoxon signed rank test for non normally distributed data after the transformations and multivariate analysis of variance manova with the significance level of p 0 05 using analytical software spss statistics version 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa the results of these two analyses were then compared to each other and manova was chosen as the optimal approach because there was more than one explanatory factor sthle and wold 1990 table s4 in our investigation the location upstream midstream and downstream and the sides west middle east were our fixed factors independent variables and the concentrations of trace elements were dependent variables relationships between total te concentrations and th were evaluated using spearman s correlation coefficients to distinguish the potential sources of tes and their level of enrichment downstream of industry compared to upstream principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis were also used to investigate associations between sample sites and te concentrations and the influence of tributaries on the ar mathworks matlab r2017a 3 results the distribution of tes among particulate dissolved and colloidal forms is summarized in table 1 total and dissolved concentrations of tes in the main stem of the river upstream mid stream and downstream and in the tributaries in spring and fall are summarized in tables 2 to 5 3 1 total concentrations over the 125 km stretch of the river that was investigated the average total concentration of every te was greater in spring compared to fall table 1 in autumn the concentrations of al as co cu fe mn ni pb th tl and v were more abundant p 0 05 downstream compared to upstream table 2 in spring however except for mo re and zn the concentrations of almost all elements were more abundant upstream concentrations of mo and zn were greater at midstream locations compared to those upstream rhenium was the only element that increased significantly from upstream to downstream of industry in this season in autumn total concentrations of mn being representative of the behavior of most of the investigated elements increased significantly from t1 to t4 on the east side of the river followed by a decrease from t4 to t5 on the same side fig 3 most of the elements al as cd co cu fe pb th tl u and v followed the same pattern as mn from t3 to t5 table 2 on the east side fe also increased significantly from t1 to t2 while u decreased on the same side on the west side of the river mn was the only element that decreased from t4 to t5 in the middle of the river the total concentration of v followed the same trend as on the east side from t3 to t5 moreover al and re increased in the middle of the river from t3 to t4 generally total concentrations of co fe mn pb re th and tl were more abundant downstream of industry compared to upstream in the middle of the river table 2 variations in the rest of the elements were not notable in the middle east or the west side of the river from upstream to downstream in spring high flow rates prevented the safe collection of water samples at t1 samples were thus gathered from t2 upstream to t5 downstream on the east side of the river total concentrations of al as cd co fe pb re th tl and v increased significantly p 0 05 from t2 to t3 from t3 to t4 all of the elements except for cr mo and sb decreased significantly on this side the same trends were also observed in the middle of the river from t2 to t4 fig 4 among all of these elements re was the only element which increased significantly in the middle of the ar from t4 to t5 fig 4 generally all of the investigated elements either significantly decreased with as as an example shown in fig 4 or did not significantly change e g re also shown in fig 4 from upstream to downstream at different sides the vast majority of tes with statistically significant p 0 05 spatial variations along the ar were found mainly in the particulate fraction ranging from 55 ni to 99 7 al in autumn and 55 6 sb to 99 8 al in spring fig 5 after normalizing to th concentration none of the tes were significantly p 0 05 enriched downstream compared to upstream fig s2 and table s12 3 2 dissolved concentrations in autumn when averaged across the river the concentrations of as co cu ni pb re and v increased significantly p 0 05 from upstream to downstream table 4 among the elements dissolved concentrations of ni mo and u were more abundant downstream compared to midstream in spring cross river average concentrations of al as cd co cu mo ni sb th tl u v and zn were significantly p 0 05 more abundant upstream of industry compared to downstream in contrast mn and re increased significantly p 0 05 from upstream to downstream in autumn mo ni re sb and u were more abundant on the west side of the river in spring the same was true for al cd co cu mo re sb and u iron was more abundant on the east side of the river in both seasons in autumn fe and mn increased significantly p 0 05 on the east side of the river between t1 and t2 where tributaries like the horse river and the clearwater river enter the ar on the same side the concentrations of cd cu mo ni and u also decreased at this location consistent with lower concentrations in the clearwater river across the river some elements e g re on the west side or v on the east side increased while fe and mn decreased on the east side of the river from t3 to t4 manganese and re were more abundant on the east side of t5 compared to t4 the concentration of fe and re are shown in fig 6 in spring as cu mo sb and v decreased significantly p 0 05 from t2 to t3 while co fe and mn increased on the east side of the river on the west side of these transects al and re increased while v decreased significantly p 0 05 from t3 to t4 midstream to downstream re increased on the west side this element increased on all sides of the river between t4 and t5 fig 7 3 3 dissolved colloidal fractions inorganic dom mainly ionic and small in both autumn and spring fe and pb were mainly present in inorganic colloidal forms in autumn cu and ni were mainly in organic colloidal forms as was cu in spring the mainly ionic truly dissolved forms were dominant 50 for the rest of the tes in both seasons table 1 in autumn the proportion of inorganic colloidal forms of almost all tes increased slightly from upstream to downstream except for al cr mo and zn however only mn and pb increased significantly p 0 05 spatial variations across the transects were not significant p 0 05 in these two seasons concentrations of primarily organic te forms did not vary significantly along the river except for fe which increased significantly p 0 05 from upstream to midstream across the river in both autumn and spring no spatial variation in the concentrations of tes was observed along the river however the primarily organic colloidal fractions of fe and co were more abundant p 0 05 upstream compared to downstream in this fraction cu ni and zn were more abundant p 0 05 in the midstream compared to both upstream and downstream table s2 in the ionic fraction in autumn spatial variations were not significant p 0 05 along the river in spring however the concentrations of ionic as co and v were more abundant p 0 05 upstream compared to downstream table s2 3 4 impact of tributaries principal component and spearman correlation analyses were applied to the dissolved and total concentrations of tes in fall and spring to investigate their multivariate relationships and detect different sources in autumn pcs explained 87 of total variations of both dissolved 4 pcs and total 3pcs fractions in spring 3 pcs explained 80 and 92 of the total variations of dissolved 3pcs and total fractions 3pcs respectively for each of these pcs variable loadings with absolute values lower than 30 of the maximum loading were not considered during the interpretation cuss et al 2018 3 4 1 total concentrations of trace elements autumn in autumn the first principal component pc1 explained 62 of total variation with positive loadings on al as cd co cr cu fe mo ni pb sb th tl u v zn and positive scores on the tar river and the unnamed river north of the pierre river table s5 this pc revealed variation in the overall concentration of tes with the exception of mo re and sb the spearman correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant positive association among th and these elements table s6 the average scores of pc1 increased from 0 43 in upstream to 2 3 in downstream of the river with the largest change from upstream to midstream from 0 4 to 1 6 and specifically on the west side of the river from 0 1 to 2 65 the maximum score for pc1 occurred on the east side of t4 downstream and the small river north of the pierre river and then the tar river the second principal component pc2 with 17 of variation had positive loadings on as fe mn mo ni re and u the scores were positive for most tributaries except for the steepbank river mckay river and the clearwater river the highest positive loadings were observed for re 0 45 mn 0 42 u 0 4 with the highest scores for the stream north of the pierre river pierre river and tar river the negative loadings on pc2 were on al cr pb and th which were positively correlated with each other p 0 01 these loadings increased from the east side to the west side except in the middle and decreased from upstream to downstream this component seems to indicate clay and other mineral based influences of the tributaries with negative scores the steepbank river mckay river and the clearwater river from upstream to downstream the concentration of all of these elements are higher in the clearwater river compared to the ar upstream which apparently shows the influence of this tributary on the ar the third principal component pc3 explained 8 of the total variation with positive loadings on as co fe and mn and the highest scores on the east side of t3 0 7 the highest loadings were observed for fe and mn and the highest scores were found for the clearwater river and the tar river this component had negative loadings on cd mo ni re sb zn and negative scores on the ells pierre mckay muskeg steepbank rivers and the river north of the pierre river scores on pc3 tended to increase from upstream to downstream and from the west to the east sides of the ar spring in spring the first principal component pc1 explained 77 of the total variation with positive loadings on all tes except re and a positive score on the horse river it was related to overall concentration of tes the average scores of pc1 increased from 2 42 5 20 from upstream to midstream and decreased to 0 38 in downstream on the athabasca river with the largest change from midstream to downstream in the middle and on the west side of the river the maximum score for pc1 is reported for the west side of t3 midstream and the horse river the second component pc2 with 9 of variation had positive loadings on mn mo re and u with positive scores on the horse river pierre river beaver creek and the tar river the results for pca and the spearman correlation correlation coefficients for tes and their probability of no correlation are shown in tables s5 and s6 for total fractions 3 5 dissolved concentrations of trace elements autumn in autumn the first principal component pc1 explained 47 of total variation and with positive loadings on all of the elements except for mn and cr and positive scores on the horse river tar river pierre river and the river north of the pierre river this pc was probably related to overall dissolved concentration of all of these tes the maximum score 1 98 was reported for the west side of t4 downstream the unnamed river north of the pierre river 15 6 and the horse river 2 7 the second component pc2 with 23 of variation had positive loadings on co cr mn ni re and u and positive scores on all of the tributaries except for the horse river and the clearwater river a positive correlation among the co and cr mn ni and re was also confirmed by the spearman correlation analysis table s7 s8 the maximum positive loading was observed for mn 0 42 and the highest score was on tar river 7 5 the negative loadings of pc2 were on al cd cu pb th and v and the negative scores were on the horse river 2 15 and the clearwater river 0 28 except for al the rest of these elements were positively correlated p 0 05 with each other table s4 since the scores of this component did not indicate a notable change from t3 to t4 on the west side dust or other industrial inputs could not be significant sources of these elements therefore tributaries and groundwater inputs are most likely the predominant sources of the mentioned tes into the river the third component pc3 explained 11 of the total variation and had positive loadings on al as fe and th with the highest scores on the east side of t2 0 82 and negative loadings on cu cd sb and u the most negative scores were on ells river tar river and pierre river compared to the other elements with positive loadings the scores for fe 0 57 and th 0 45 were found considerably higher as was also observed for the horse river indeed the steepbank river the clearwater river and horse river had the highest positive loadings given the relative concentrations of tes in these tributaries compared to the mainstem and the fact that the highest score for the ar samples was found for the site on the east side of t2 20 km downstream of the clearwater and horse river inputs this pc is likely an indicator of inputs from these tributaries notably all of the other upstream samples also had negative scores on pc3 whereas most of the downstream sample scores were between these two extremes the spearman correlation analysis indicated that fe was significantly and negatively correlated with cd cu mo sb u and zn additionally there was a significant positive correlation of as with fe and th table s8 spring in spring the first principal component pc1 explained 32 of the total variation with positive loadings on all of the elements except for fe mn and re and positive scores on the horse river pierre river tar river and the beaver creek it was related to the overall concentration of tes these three elements fe mn and re while seeming to behave independently from the other elements also reflect overall dissolved loadings of tes as these are the primary elements associated with the dominant natural sources i e tributaries and groundwaters table s7 the average scores of pc1 decreased from 2 12 in upstream to 1 53 in downstream on the athabasca river with the largest change from midstream to downstream from 1 71 to 1 53 and specifically on the west side of the midstream t3 table s7 pc2 with 29 of variation had positive loadings on mn mo ni re sb tl and u and positive scores on the ells river pierre river tar river and the beaver creek the higher concentrations of these elements in the mentioned tributaries all located on the west side of river along t3 to t5 compared to the mainstem at t3 indicate the influence of these tributaries on the ar negative scores of this component were on all tributaries except for these three mentioned tributaries with negative loadings on al cr fe pb th v and zn which again shows the influence of tributaries on the ar the third component pc3 with 19 of the total variation had positive loadings on as co cr fe mn ni re and all of the tributaries with the highest score amounts for co and the pierre river and the tar river this pc had the highest score on tributaries 2 25 compared to upstream 0 85 midstream 0 8 and downstream 0 92 with the scores decreasing from 0 4 on the east side of t2 upstream to 0 55 on the same side of t3 midstream tributaries could be distinguished as sources of these tes ar table s7 in particular the clearwater river which has a major influence on the athabasca river and a score of 0 54 in this component is a good example of this phenomenon 4 discussion industrial activities related to open pit bitumen mining and upgrading have been criticized as important sources of tes to the ar and its tributaries timoney 2007 kelly et al 2010 schindler 2013 guéguen et al 2016 in this study spatiotemporal variation in the total and dissolved concentrations of 18 tes in the main stem of the ar and their distributions amongst major dissolved colloidal forms were studied to determine whether downstream values were significantly higher than those upstream and to investigate how seasonal variations change the concentrations of tes 4 1 downstream trends are opposite in autumn and spring 4 1 1 autumn in regard to total concentrations al as co cu fe mn ni pb th tl and v were more abundant downstream table 2 the concentrations of all of these elements increased significantly from t3 to t4 and on the east side except for as fe and mn which constantly increased from upstream to downstream t1 to t5 this spatial variation could result from the influence of natural inputs from tributaries the mainstem of the ar is greatly affected by the clearwater river and the horse river which have relatively high flow rates and high concentrations of fe mn and other tes compared to upstream on the ar site t1 and to other tributaries tables 2 and 3 tondu 2017 cuss et al 2018 2020b other tributaries such as mclean creek the steepbank river and the muskeg river also enter the mainstem on the east side of the ar the pca analysis also indicated contributions from tributaries table s6 in the dissolved fraction as co cu ni pb re and v were more abundant downstream table 4 dissolved concentrations of cu co ni increased from the east side of the ar from t2 to t4 but their changes from t1 to t2 were not notable moreover their concentrations were lower in the clearwater river and the horse river than the mainstem of the ar likewise the average dissolved concentration of v was 3 8 µg l 1 at t1 the lower v concentration in the clearwater river 0 2 µg l 1 indicates that there are other sources of this element upstream of the river that are more important than tributaries dissolved re increased from t3 to t4 on the west side and t4 to t5 on the east side possibly due to industrial operations or inputs from tributaries and saline groundwater shotyk et al 2017 chloride also exhibited an approximate two fold increase in concentration downstream probably due to the saline groundwater seepage into the river gibson et al 2011 gue et al 2015 jasechko et al 2012 shotyk et al 2017 however significantly higher concentrations of chloride were observed only on the west side of the river inputs of saline groundwater into the ar 134 68 l s 1 gue et al 2018 inputs from artesian saline springs at midstream and anthropogenic inputs such as treated water tondu 2017 or leakage from oil sands operations squires et al 2010 dube and wilson 2013 lima and wrona 2019 have been suspected as probable sources for these increases but the fact is that the most significant increase in chloride concentration was observed from upstream to midstream which is likely a result of the mixing of inputs from tributaries such as the clearwater river which contains ten times as much chloride as upstream of the athabasca river fig s3 and provides 179 tonne cl day noton and saffran 1995 tondu 2017 cuss et al 2020b on the other hand in terms of the spatial variation across transects dissolved re decreased on the west side but increased on the east side between t4 and t5 apparently re does not follow the changes in cl which comes from groundwater at t4 to t5 therefore cl cannot be a reliable tracer to justify the higher concentration of re downstream t4 t5 of the river the same results were obtained earlier cuss et al 2020a unfortunately at this stage it remains unclear to which degree the re increase can be attributed to natural or anthropogenic inputs however the apparent disconnect between major chloride and re concentration increases between t4 and t5 and t3 and t4 respectively suggests that re is not a major constituent of saline groundwaters that contribute to the ar in this area fig 6 and s3 regarding dissolved colloids the concentration of primarily inorganic fe was more abundant p 0 05 downstream as the pca and correlation analysis for the dissolved fraction also showed this could be due to the contribution of the tributaries such as the horse river and clearwater river which are located on the east side of the river with much higher concentrations of primarily inorganic fe colloids 345 and 180 µg l 1 in the horse river and clearwater river compared to 46 µg l 1 at t1 a similar conclusion was also reached by tondu 2017 cuss et al 2018 and cuss et al 2020b moreover the roughly constant cl dissolved fe ratios in the clearwater river and along the ar from upstream to a4 suggest that there is no other major source of dissolved fe or cl and that dissolved fe behaves conservatively in this region of the river fig s3 concentrations of primarily inorganic mn and pb colloids also increased p 0 05 from upstream to downstream table s2 based on pca of the dissolved and total concentrations these two elements were negatively correlated pc2 in tables s5 and s7 and mn did not make a significant contribution to concentration based pc1 for the pca of either dissolved or total concentrations contrary to mn according to the pca results and relative concentrations dissolved mn was higher downstream largely due to the contribution of tributaries interestingly the concentration of dissolved pb was lower in the clearwater river 24 ng l 1 compared to the ar upstream in the horse river dissolved pb was only slightly higher than its concentration in the mainstem of the ar 61 compared to 29 ng l 1 the relative flow rate of this river however was much lower that the flow rate in the mainstem of the ar 15 compared to 300 m3 s 1 given that the primarily inorganic pb increased from 20 to 25 ng l 1 and also the total concentration increased by 250 ng l 1 from upstream to downstream suggest the contributions from other sources such as dusts or some exchange between the particulate and dissolved phases along the river table 2 and s2 both fe and mn are associated with more stable mineral structures such as oxides oxyhydroxides and goethite therefore they have limited bioavailability and bioaccessibility kostka et al 1999 ehlers and luthy 2003 semple et al 2004 reeder et al 2006 2020a total pb in water is a physical weathering indicator in the dissolved phase the free ion pb2 dominates under acidic conditions and hydroxide complexes and probably the carbonate and sulfate ion pairs under alkaline conditions hem 1985 considering the range of the water ph in the ar 7 2 8 4 in fall and spring respectively this element is expected to be associated with stable particles or organic matter or with the inorganic component of the dissolved fraction table 1 javed et al 2017 we also found that in this season cu and ni were mainly in the primarily organic 50 forms both of these elements are essential elements to animals and plants with limited mobility and solubility in aquatic systems however these tes are known to be strongly bound by dom and can be adsorbed to inorganic colloidal carriers such as clays and oxyhydroxides scholz and kahlert 2015 cuss et al 2020a 4 1 2 spring in the total fraction except for re almost all of the other elements decreased significantly from upstream to downstream mostly on the east side of the river from t3 to t4 it should also be mentioned that for most of the elements the total concentrations increased from upstream to midstream and then decreased from midstream to downstream the influence of the tributaries with unique dom and colloidal ferric hydroxide feoohs inputs located among these transects was also observed in our pca results through adsorption or settling these inputs from the tributaries can decrease the concentration of tes and change their behavior mcknight and bencala 1990 moreover in this season inputs are dominantly soils and sediments that have been carried into the stream by meltwaters and carried by suspension due to the river s high flow rates considering the higher flow rates upstream of the ar in this season 1170 m3 s 1 compared to autumn 610 m3 s 1 eccc 2020 less sedimentation is expected downstream of industry cuss et al 2020a higher concentrations of the elements either upstream or midstream suggests that tributary inputs and natural processes such as physical weathering and erosion are the primary sources of metals in the ar similar to autumn in spring the majority of the investigated elements were found mainly in the particulate fraction 50 given the predominance of the particulate fraction for most elements bioaccessibility is expected to be limited shilla et al 2008 similar to spatial changes in the total concentration of tes along the river and with the same explanation for these variations the dissolved concentrations of almost all of the elements decreased from upstream to downstream and specifically from t3 to t4 in contrast dissolved concentrations of mn and re were more abundant p 0 05 downstream the results of pca indicated the contribution of tributaries as the primary source of higher concentrations of these elements in the mainstem of the river within the dissolved component cu and ni in the primarily inorganic fraction al co cu fe ni v and zn in primarily organic forms and as co and v in the mainly ionic form were significantly more abundant either upstream or midstream compared to downstream in spring fe and pb were mainly in the primarily inorganic form and cu was dominantly in the primarily organic fraction in agreement with their expected speciation given the river water ph the rest of the tes were primarily found in mainly ionic and small forms table 1 4 2 surface water quality guidelines swqg the average concentration of the investigated tes were compared to the alberta surface water quality guidelines swqg for the protection of aquatic life as outlined in the environmental quality guidelines for alberta surface waters alberta environment and sustainable development 2018 and to the canadian environmental quality guidelines set by the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme regardless of the apparent spatiotemporal variations in concentrations and their sources it should be noted that the average concentration of all investigated tes in the ar were lower than the available guidelines in both seasons given the strong affinity of dissolved al to react with inorganic and organic suspended solids both of which are naturally high in alberta rivers tondu 2017 alberta environment and sustainable development 2018 the provincial swqg applies to the dissolved form of this metal the federal ccme guideline however applies to total al and is calculated using an equation which considers ph hardness and the doc concentration ccme 2018 according to the latest reports long term water quality guideline for dissolved mn is in a range between 240 and 270 µg l 1 ccme 2019 based on the hardness of the ar which typically changes between 80 and 180 mg caco3 l 1 cuss et al 2020a moreover in drinking water dw the maximum acceptable total concentration of 120 µg l 1 has been defined for

water with a hardness 180 mg l the swqg for total pb is 7 0 µg l 1 tondu 2017 ccme 2018 there is no alberta or canada swqgs for total or dissolved th however based on former studies the expected dissolved concentration range expected is from 0 01 to 1 µg l 1 in freshwater ph values generally 5 8 langmuir and herman 1980 rhenium is one of the extremely rare platinum group elements pge with an abundance of 0 2 μg kg 1 in the upper continental crust rudnick and gao 2014 there was no guideline for re ccme 2018 however its dissolved concentration in the ar was comparable to the global average river water which is reported as 2 1 ng l 1 miller et al 2011 molybdenum as a mobile element is one of the trace metals enriched in bitumen bicalho et al 2017 the guideline value for mo is 73 µg l 1 for the protection of aquatic life ccme 2018 there is no ccme guideline for v and so we used federal environmental quality guideline of 120 µg l 1 total v feqg 1999 cobalt cu and ni are essential elements to animals co cu ni and plants cu and ni with limited solubility and moderate mobility in aquatic systems the ccme guideline values for these elements are defined as 2 5 7 and 25 µg l 1 as total concentrations respectively ccme 2018 the concentration of all of these three elements depend on water hardness as caco3 in aquatic systems the permissible concentrations of total as and u are defined as 5 and 15 µg l 1 ccme 1999 2018 the guideline for total concentrations of tl is 0 8 µg l 1 and that for cd ranges from 0 021 to 0 082 µg l 1 unfortunately there is no water quality guideline for the protection of aquatic life for total or dissolved concentrations of cr however a maximum acceptable concentration mac of 50 µg l 1 has been established for total chromium in drinking water pawlisz et al 1997 the average concentration of these tes in the athabasca river did not exceed any of these surface water quality guidelines table 1 5 summary and conclusions the goals of this study were to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in te concentrations in the athabasca river to resolve spatial differences samples were collected from upstream to downstream of industry at three points and two depths along five cross river transects to assess temporal changes samples were gathered in fall 2017 and spring 2018 the spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations of total dissolved and dissolved colloidal forms of al as cd co cr cu fe mn mo ni pb re sb tl th u v and zn were determined 1 in autumn total concentrations of al as co cu fe mn ni pb th tl and v were significantly more abundant downstream of industry compared to upstream with the exception of as and cu these elements occurred predominantly in the particulate fraction i e 0 45 µm normalization to thorium showed that no tes were enriched in the particulate fraction relative to crustal abundance in the dissolved fraction 0 45 µm concentrations of as co cu ni pb re and v were also significantly more abundant downstream of industry within the dissolved fraction fe and pb were found mainly as inorganic colloids while the other tes occurred mainly in the mainly ionic truly dissolved fraction i

from upstream to downstream with the exception of fe and pb which were mainly present as inorganic colloids and cu which was mainly found in organic colloids the 1 kda fraction was the dominant dissolved form for all tes in this season primarily inorganic forms of cu and ni were more abundant p 0 05 in the midstream compared to both upstream and downstream moreover the concentrations of ionic as co and v were more abundant p 0 05 upstream or midstream compared to downstream 3 the average concentrations of the investigated tes were below the available provincial and federal surface water quality guidelines moreover only 15 28 of most elements of environmental concern e g pb were present in primarily ionic and small forms which are the most bioavailable arsenic is exceptional in this regard in that 95 of as was found in the truly dissolved fraction in both seasons 4 the pca analysis indicated that tributaries contribute meaningful amounts of total and dissolved tes in the past obtaining high quality te data to assess water quality in the ar has been one of the challenges associated with investigations in this region the cutting edge sampling and analysis methods that have been used in this research eliminated this shortcoming and hopefully understanding of natural inputs has been improved for engineers and scientists knowledge of the sources of tes and the impact of their sizes including colloidal forms on aquatic life is critical considering the bioavailability bioaccessibility and forms of tes in this complex aquatic system will help determine whether these tes pose a risk to aquatic life moreover these findings are important when planning future industrial activities such as the release to the river of treated water from tailings ponds to appropriately

8040,with a wide variety of natural and potential anthropogenic inputs the athabasca river ar has been the focus of recent attention in addition to natural inputs of trace elements tes from tributaries industrial activities such as mining and upgrading of bitumen have been viewed as additional potentially important anthropogenic sources but evidence is limited to quantify the spatiotemporal variations of te concentrations and their forms water samples were gathered along a 125 km stretch of the river from upstream to downstream of the industrial region and at three points across the river along five transects perpendicular to the flow the samples were collected in the autumn of 2017 and the spring of 2018 using novel metal free sampling methods the concentrations of total i e acid extractable and dissolved i e 0 45 µm tes were measured to compare with water quality guidelines and their size based distribution amongst major colloidal forms was determined to better assess their biological significance the results quantify spatiotemporal variation in total and dissolved concentrations of tes along and across the ar in both seasons the majority of tes occurred in the particulate fraction none of the tes were significantly enriched in the particulate fraction relative to crustal abundance the average concentrations of tes were below the ccme surface water

amongst dissolved colloidal species as determined using baseline level peak resolution with statistical fractogram deconvolution are shown in fig s1 as shown each of these dissolved fractions are associated with a specific retention time and corresponding molar mass the mainly ionic and small species fraction normally pass through the membrane and some elute at 455 s with a molar mass at peak maximum mp 0 3 kda this peak also contains the void peak consisting of unretained and improperly focused material the mainly ionic species are calculated as the dissolved concentration minus the te associated with colloids in the dom and primarily inorganic peaks the dom associated fraction with retention time tr of 550 s and mp 1 kda co elutes with the organic matter the remaining fractions are the small fe associated fraction mp 15 kda tr 900 s and the large fe associated fraction mp 20 7 kda tr 1800 s which elutes after the crossflow is turned off since this fraction consists of large molecules it moves through the channel very slowly cuss et al 2018 a broad range of other water quality parameters were also measured including ph ec doc and major ions table s1 the recovery of matrix matched standard reference materials srms at various concentrations were monitored throughout analyses to ensure the quality of icp ms results the af4 channel was similarly calibrated for molar mass

mean values 95 confidence and throughout the text the term significant and meaningful are exclusively used to refer to statistical significance at this confidence level considering the challenges with standard statistical approaches for outlier detection and for complex data involving mixing from multiple sources generally five methods were used to assess outliers in the total and dissolved datasets including histogram grubbs test or esd the extreme studentized deviate gesd test the generalized extreme studentized deviate the median absolute deviations and the mean absolute deviations mad these methods were implemented using matlab r2017 and spss table s3 histograms clearly indicated the presence of bimodal distributions across the river as would be expected from the inputs of tributaries groundwaters and industry considering both bimodality and the relevant assumptions of all of these methods table s3 outliers were identified and removed bimodal distributions are normally an indication of heterogeneous samples different populations or samples with high variability and could suggest that the observations may come from two or more distributions murphy 1964 wang 2017 to test the significance of apparent differences the data were subjected to one sided t test for normal data or wilcoxon signed rank test for non normally distributed data after the transformations and multivariate analysis of variance manova with the significance level of p 0 05 using analytical software spss statistics version 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa the results of these two analyses were then compared to each other and manova was chosen as the optimal approach because there was more than one explanatory factor sthle and wold 1990 table s4 in our investigation the location upstream midstream and downstream and the sides west middle east were our fixed factors independent variables and the concentrations of trace elements were dependent variables relationships between total te concentrations and th were evaluated using spearman s correlation coefficients to distinguish the potential sources of tes and their level of enrichment downstream of industry compared to upstream principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis were also used to investigate associations between sample sites and te concentrations and the influence of tributaries on the ar mathworks

the behavior of most of the investigated elements increased significantly from t1 to t4 on the east side of the river followed by a decrease from t4 to t5 on the same side fig 3 most of the elements al as cd co cu fe pb th tl u and v followed the same pattern as mn from t3 to t5 table 2 on the east side fe also increased significantly from t1 to t2 while u decreased on the same side on the west side of the river mn was the only element that decreased from t4 to t5 in the middle of the river the total concentration of v followed the same trend as on the east side from t3 to t5 moreover al and re increased in the middle of the river from t3 to t4 generally total concentrations of co fe mn pb re th and tl were more abundant downstream of industry compared to upstream in the middle of the river table 2 variations in the rest of the elements were not notable in the middle east or the west side of the river from upstream to downstream in spring high flow rates prevented the safe collection of water samples at t1 samples were thus gathered from t2 upstream to t5 downstream on the east side of the river total concentrations of al as cd co fe pb re th tl and v increased significantly p 0 05 from t2 to t3 from t3 to t4 all of the elements except for cr mo and sb decreased significantly on this side the same trends were also observed in the middle of the river from t2 to t4 fig 4 among all of these elements re was the only element which increased significantly in the middle of the ar from t4 to t5 fig 4 generally all of the investigated elements either significantly decreased with as as an example shown in fig 4 or did not significantly change e g re also shown in fig 4 from upstream to downstream at different sides the vast majority of tes with statistically significant p 0 05 spatial variations along the ar were found mainly in the particulate fraction ranging from 55 ni to 99 7 al in autumn and 55 6 sb to 99 8 al in spring fig 5 after normalizing to th concentration none of the tes were significantly p 0 05 enriched downstream compared to upstream fig s2 and table s12 3 2 dissolved concentrations in autumn when averaged across the river the concentrations of as co cu ni pb re and v increased significantly p 0 05 from upstream to downstream table 4 among the elements dissolved concentrations of ni mo and u were more abundant downstream compared to midstream in spring cross river average concentrations of al as cd co cu mo ni sb th tl u v and zn were significantly p 0 05 more abundant upstream of industry compared to downstream in contrast mn and re increased significantly p 0 05 from upstream to downstream in autumn mo ni re sb and u were more abundant on the west side of the river in spring the same was true for al cd co cu mo re sb and u iron was more abundant on the east side of the river in both seasons in autumn fe and mn increased significantly p 0 05 on the east side of the river between t1 and t2 where tributaries like the horse river and the clearwater river enter the ar on the same side the concentrations of cd cu mo ni and u also decreased at this location consistent with lower concentrations in the clearwater river across the river some elements e g re on the west side or v on the east side increased while fe and mn decreased on the east side of the river from t3 to t4 manganese and re were more abundant on the east side of t5 compared to t4 the concentration of fe and re are shown in fig 6 in spring as cu mo sb and v decreased significantly p 0 05 from t2 to t3 while co fe and mn increased on the east side of the river on the west side of these transects al and re increased while v decreased significantly p 0 05 from t3 to t4 midstream to downstream re increased on the west side this element increased on all sides of the river between t4 and t5 fig 7 3 3 dissolved colloidal fractions inorganic dom mainly ionic and small in both autumn and spring fe and pb were mainly present in inorganic colloidal forms in autumn cu and ni were mainly in organic colloidal forms as was cu in spring the mainly ionic truly dissolved forms were dominant 50 for the rest of the tes in both seasons table 1 in autumn the proportion of inorganic colloidal forms of almost all tes increased slightly from upstream to downstream except for al cr mo and zn however only mn and pb increased significantly p 0 05 spatial variations across the transects were not significant p 0 05 in these two seasons concentrations of primarily organic te forms did not vary significantly along the river except for fe which increased significantly p 0 05 from upstream to midstream across the river in both autumn and spring no spatial variation in the concentrations of tes was observed along the river however the primarily organic colloidal fractions of fe and co were more abundant p 0 05 upstream compared to downstream in this fraction cu ni and zn were more abundant p 0 05 in the midstream compared to both upstream and downstream table s2 in the ionic fraction in autumn spatial variations were not significant p 0 05 along the river in spring however the concentrations of ionic as co and v were more abundant p 0 05 upstream compared to downstream table s2 3 4 impact of tributaries principal component and spearman correlation analyses were applied to the dissolved and total concentrations of tes in fall and spring to investigate their multivariate relationships and detect different sources in autumn pcs explained 87 of total variations of both dissolved 4 pcs and total 3pcs fractions in spring 3 pcs explained 80 and 92 of the total variations of dissolved 3pcs and total fractions 3pcs respectively for each of these pcs variable loadings with absolute values lower than 30 of the maximum loading were not considered during the interpretation cuss et al 2018 3 4 1 total concentrations of trace elements autumn in autumn the first principal component pc1 explained 62 of total variation with positive loadings on al as cd co cr cu fe mo ni pb sb th tl u v zn and positive scores on the tar river and the unnamed river north of the pierre river table s5 this pc revealed variation in the overall concentration of tes with the exception of mo re and sb the spearman correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant positive association among th and these elements table s6 the average scores of pc1 increased from 0 43 in upstream to 2 3 in downstream of the river with the largest change from upstream to midstream from 0 4 to 1 6 and specifically on the west side of the river from 0 1 to 2 65 the maximum score for pc1 occurred on the east side of t4 downstream and the small river north of the pierre river and then the tar river the second principal component pc2 with 17 of variation had positive loadings on as fe mn mo ni re and u the scores were positive for most tributaries except for the steepbank river mckay river and the clearwater river the highest positive loadings were observed for re 0 45 mn 0 42 u 0 4 with the highest scores for the stream north of the pierre river pierre river and tar river the negative loadings on pc2 were on al cr pb and th which were positively correlated with each other p 0 01 these loadings increased from the east side to the west side except in the middle and decreased from upstream to downstream this component seems to indicate clay and other mineral based influences of the tributaries with negative scores the steepbank river mckay river and the clearwater river from upstream to downstream the concentration of all of these elements are higher in the clearwater river compared to the ar upstream which apparently shows the influence of this tributary on the ar the third principal component pc3 explained 8 of the total variation with positive loadings on as co fe and mn and the highest scores on the east side of t3 0 7 the highest loadings were observed for fe and mn and the highest scores were found for the clearwater river and the tar river this component had negative loadings on cd mo ni re sb zn and negative scores on the ells pierre mckay muskeg steepbank rivers and the river north of the pierre river scores on pc3 tended to increase from upstream to downstream and from the west to the east sides of the ar spring in spring the first principal component pc1 explained 77 of the total variation with positive loadings on all tes except re and a positive score on the horse river it was related to overall concentration of tes the average scores of pc1 increased from 2 42 5 20 from upstream to midstream and decreased to 0 38 in downstream on the athabasca river with the largest change from midstream to downstream in the middle and on the west side of the river the maximum score for pc1 is reported for the west side of t3 midstream and the horse river the second component pc2 with 9 of variation had positive loadings on mn mo re and u with positive scores on the horse river pierre river beaver creek and the tar river the results for pca and the spearman correlation correlation coefficients for tes and their probability of no correlation are shown in tables s5 and s6 for total fractions 3 5 dissolved concentrations of trace elements autumn in autumn the first principal component pc1 explained 47 of total variation and with positive loadings on all of the elements except for mn and cr and positive scores on the horse river tar river pierre river and the river north of the pierre river this pc was probably related to overall dissolved concentration of all of these tes the maximum score 1 98 was reported for the west side of t4 downstream the unnamed river north of the pierre river 15 6 and the horse river 2 7 the second component pc2 with 23 of variation had positive loadings on co cr mn ni re and u and positive scores on all of the tributaries except for the horse river and the clearwater river a positive correlation among the co and cr mn ni and re was also confirmed by the spearman correlation analysis table s7 s8 the maximum positive loading was observed for mn 0 42 and the highest score was on tar river 7 5 the negative loadings of pc2 were on al cd cu pb th and v and the negative scores were on the horse river 2 15 and the clearwater river 0 28 except for al the rest of these elements were positively correlated p 0 05 with each other table s4 since the scores of this component did not indicate a notable change from t3 to t4 on the west side dust or other industrial inputs could not be significant sources of these elements therefore tributaries and groundwater inputs are most likely the predominant sources of the mentioned tes into the river the third component pc3 explained 11 of the total variation and had positive loadings on al as fe and th with the highest scores on the east side of t2 0 82 and negative loadings on cu cd sb and u the most negative scores were on ells river tar river and pierre river compared to the other elements with positive loadings the scores for fe 0 57 and th 0 45 were found considerably higher as was also observed for the horse river indeed the steepbank river the clearwater river and horse river had the highest positive loadings given the relative concentrations of tes in these tributaries compared to the mainstem and the fact that the highest score for the ar samples was found for the site on the east side of t2 20 km downstream of the clearwater and horse river inputs this pc is likely an indicator of inputs from these tributaries notably all of the other upstream samples also had negative scores on pc3 whereas most of the downstream sample scores were between these two extremes the spearman correlation analysis indicated that fe was significantly and negatively correlated with cd cu mo sb u and zn additionally there was a significant positive correlation of as with fe and th table s8 spring in spring the first principal component pc1 explained 32 of the total variation with positive loadings on all of the elements except for fe mn and re and positive scores on the horse river pierre river tar river and the beaver creek it was related to the overall concentration of tes these three elements fe mn and re while seeming to behave independently from the other elements also reflect overall dissolved loadings of tes as these are the primary elements associated with the dominant natural sources i e tributaries and groundwaters table s7 the average scores of pc1 decreased from 2 12 in upstream to 1 53 in downstream on the athabasca river with the largest change from midstream to downstream from 1 71 to 1 53 and specifically on the west side of the midstream t3 table s7 pc2 with 29 of variation had positive loadings on mn mo ni re sb tl and u and positive scores on the ells river pierre river tar river and the beaver creek the higher concentrations of these elements in the mentioned tributaries all located on the west side of river along t3 to t5 compared to the mainstem at t3 indicate the influence of these tributaries on the ar negative scores of this component were on all tributaries except for these three mentioned tributaries with negative loadings on al cr fe pb th v and zn which again shows the influence of tributaries on the ar the third component pc3 with 19 of the total variation had positive loadings on as co cr fe mn ni re and all of the tributaries with the highest score amounts for co and the pierre river and the tar river this pc had the highest score on tributaries 2 25 compared to upstream 0 85 midstream 0 8 and downstream 0 92 with the scores decreasing from 0 4 on the east side of t2 upstream to 0 55 on the same side of t3 midstream tributaries could be distinguished as sources of these tes ar table s7 in particular the clearwater river which has a major influence on the athabasca river and a score of 0 54 in this component is a good example of this phenomenon 4 discussion industrial activities related to open pit bitumen mining and upgrading have been criticized as important sources of tes to the ar and its tributaries timoney 2007 kelly et al 2010 schindler 2013 guéguen et al 2016 in this study spatiotemporal variation in the total and dissolved concentrations of 18 tes in the main stem of the ar and their distributions amongst major dissolved colloidal forms were studied to determine whether downstream values were significantly higher than those upstream and to investigate how seasonal variations change the concentrations of tes 4 1 downstream trends are opposite in autumn and spring 4 1 1 autumn in regard to total concentrations al as co cu fe mn ni pb th tl and v were more abundant downstream table 2 the concentrations of all of these elements increased significantly from t3 to t4 and on the east side except for as fe and mn which constantly increased from upstream to downstream t1 to t5 this spatial variation could result from the influence of natural inputs from tributaries the mainstem of the ar is greatly affected by the clearwater river and the horse river which have relatively high flow rates and high concentrations of fe mn and other tes compared to upstream on the ar site t1 and to other tributaries tables 2 and 3 tondu 2017 cuss et al 2018 2020b other tributaries such as mclean creek the steepbank river and the muskeg river also enter the mainstem on the east side of the ar the pca analysis also indicated contributions from tributaries table s6 in the dissolved fraction as co cu ni pb re and v were more abundant downstream table 4 dissolved concentrations of cu co ni increased from the east side of the ar from t2 to t4 but their changes from t1 to t2 were not notable moreover their concentrations were lower in the clearwater river and the horse river than the mainstem of the ar likewise the average dissolved concentration of v was 3 8 µg l 1 at t1 the lower v concentration in the clearwater river 0 2 µg l 1 indicates that there are other sources of this element upstream of the river that are more important than tributaries dissolved re increased from t3 to t4 on the west side and t4 to t5 on the east side possibly due to industrial operations or inputs from tributaries and saline groundwater shotyk et al 2017 chloride also exhibited an approximate two fold increase in concentration downstream probably due to the saline groundwater seepage into the river gibson et al 2011 gue et al 2015 jasechko et al 2012 shotyk et al 2017 however significantly higher concentrations of chloride were observed only on the west side of the river inputs of saline groundwater into the ar 134 68 l s 1 gue et al 2018 inputs from artesian saline springs at midstream and anthropogenic inputs such as treated water tondu 2017 or leakage from oil sands operations squires et al 2010 dube and wilson 2013 lima and wrona 2019 have been suspected as probable sources for these increases but the fact is that the most significant increase in chloride concentration was observed from upstream to midstream which is likely a result of the mixing of inputs from tributaries such as the clearwater river which contains ten times as much chloride as upstream of the athabasca river fig s3 and provides 179 tonne cl day noton and saffran 1995 tondu 2017 cuss et al 2020b on the other hand in terms of the spatial variation across transects dissolved re decreased on the west side but increased on the east side between t4 and t5 apparently re does not follow the changes in cl which comes from groundwater at t4 to t5 therefore cl cannot be a reliable tracer to justify the higher concentration of re downstream t4 t5 of the river the same results were obtained earlier cuss et al 2020a unfortunately at this stage it remains unclear to which degree the re increase can be attributed to natural or anthropogenic inputs however the apparent disconnect between major chloride and re concentration increases between t4 and t5 and t3 and t4 respectively suggests that re is not a major constituent of saline groundwaters that contribute to the ar in this area fig 6 and s3 regarding dissolved colloids the concentration of primarily inorganic fe was more abundant p 0 05 downstream as the pca and correlation analysis for the dissolved fraction also showed this could be due to the contribution of the tributaries such as the horse river and clearwater river which are located on the east side of the river with much higher concentrations of primarily inorganic fe colloids 345 and 180 µg l 1 in the horse river and clearwater river compared to 46 µg l 1 at t1 a similar conclusion was also reached by tondu 2017 cuss et al 2018 and cuss et al 2020b moreover the roughly constant cl dissolved fe ratios in the clearwater river and along the ar from upstream to a4 suggest that there is no other major source of dissolved fe or cl and that dissolved fe behaves conservatively in this region of the river fig s3 concentrations of primarily inorganic mn and pb colloids also increased p 0 05 from upstream to downstream table s2 based on pca of the dissolved and total concentrations these two elements were negatively correlated pc2 in tables s5 and s7 and mn did not make a significant contribution to concentration based pc1 for the pca of either dissolved or total concentrations contrary to mn according to the pca results and relative concentrations dissolved mn was higher downstream largely due to the contribution of tributaries interestingly the concentration of dissolved pb was lower in the clearwater river 24 ng l 1 compared to the ar upstream in the horse river dissolved pb was only slightly higher than its concentration in the mainstem of the ar 61 compared to 29 ng l 1 the relative flow rate of this river however was much lower that the flow rate in the mainstem of the ar 15 compared to 300 m3 s 1 given that the primarily inorganic pb increased from 20 to 25 ng l 1 and also the total concentration increased by 250 ng l 1 from upstream to downstream suggest the contributions from other sources such as dusts or some exchange between the particulate and dissolved phases along the river table 2 and s2 both fe and mn are associated with more stable mineral structures such as oxides oxyhydroxides and goethite therefore they have limited bioavailability and bioaccessibility kostka et al 1999 ehlers and luthy 2003 semple et al 2004 reeder et al 2006 2020a total pb in water is a physical weathering indicator in the dissolved phase the free ion pb2 dominates under acidic conditions and hydroxide complexes and probably the carbonate and sulfate ion pairs under alkaline conditions hem 1985 considering the range of the water ph in the ar 7 2 8 4 in fall and spring respectively this element is expected to be associated with stable particles or organic matter or with the inorganic component of the dissolved fraction table 1 javed et al 2017 we also found that in this season cu and ni were mainly in the primarily organic 50 forms both of these elements are essential elements to animals and plants with limited mobility and solubility in aquatic systems however these tes are known to be strongly bound by dom and can be adsorbed to inorganic colloidal carriers such as clays and oxyhydroxides scholz and kahlert 2015 cuss et al 2020a 4 1 2 spring in the total fraction except for re almost all of the other elements decreased significantly from upstream to downstream mostly on the east side of the river from t3 to t4 it should also be mentioned that for most of the elements the total concentrations increased from upstream to midstream and then decreased from midstream to downstream the influence of the tributaries with unique dom and colloidal ferric hydroxide feoohs inputs located among these transects was also observed in our pca results through adsorption or settling these inputs from the tributaries can decrease the concentration of tes and change their behavior mcknight and bencala 1990 moreover in this season inputs are dominantly soils and sediments that have been carried into the stream by meltwaters and carried by suspension due to the river s high flow rates considering the higher flow rates upstream of the ar in this season 1170 m3 s 1 compared to autumn 610 m3 s 1 eccc 2020 less sedimentation is expected downstream of industry cuss et al 2020a higher concentrations of the elements either upstream or midstream suggests that tributary inputs and natural processes such as physical weathering and erosion are the primary sources of metals in the ar similar to autumn in spring the majority of the investigated elements were found mainly in the particulate fraction 50 given the predominance of the particulate fraction for most elements bioaccessibility is expected to be limited shilla et al 2008 similar to spatial changes in the total concentration of tes along the river and with the same explanation for these variations the dissolved concentrations of almost all of the elements decreased from upstream to downstream and specifically from t3 to t4 in contrast dissolved concentrations of mn and re were more abundant p 0 05 downstream the results of pca indicated the contribution of tributaries as the primary source of higher concentrations of these elements in the mainstem of the river within the dissolved component cu and ni in the primarily inorganic fraction al co cu fe ni v and zn in primarily organic forms and as co and v in the mainly ionic form were significantly more abundant either upstream or midstream compared to downstream in spring fe and pb were mainly in the primarily inorganic form and cu was dominantly in the primarily organic fraction in agreement with their expected speciation given the river water ph the rest of the tes were primarily found in mainly ionic and small forms table 1 4 2 surface water quality guidelines swqg the average concentration of the investigated tes were compared to the alberta surface water quality guidelines swqg for the protection of aquatic life as outlined in the environmental quality guidelines for alberta surface waters alberta environment and sustainable development 2018 and to the canadian environmental quality guidelines set by the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme regardless of the apparent spatiotemporal variations in concentrations and their sources it should be noted that the average concentration of all investigated tes in the ar were lower than the available guidelines in both seasons given the strong affinity of dissolved al to react with inorganic and organic suspended solids both of which are naturally high in alberta rivers tondu 2017 alberta environment and sustainable development 2018 the provincial swqg applies to the dissolved form of this metal the federal ccme guideline however applies to total al and is calculated using an equation which considers ph hardness and the doc concentration ccme 2018 according to the latest reports long term water quality guideline for dissolved mn is in a range between 240 and 270 µg l 1 ccme 2019 based on the hardness of the ar which typically changes between 80 and 180 mg caco3 l 1 cuss et al 2020a moreover in drinking water dw the maximum acceptable total concentration of 120 µg l 1 has been defined for mn health canada 2019 for dissolved fe the swqg is 300 µg l 1 tondu 2017 ccme 2018 the alberta swqg for total lead is dependent on hardness alberta environment and sustainable development 2018 for water with a hardness 180 mg l the swqg for total pb is 7 0 µg l 1 tondu 2017 ccme 2018 there is no alberta or canada swqgs for total or dissolved th however based on former studies the expected dissolved concentration range expected is from 0 01 to 1 µg l 1 in freshwater ph values generally 5 8 langmuir and herman 1980 rhenium is one of the extremely rare platinum group elements pge with an abundance of 0 2 μg kg 1 in the upper continental crust rudnick and gao 2014 there was no guideline for re ccme 2018 however its dissolved concentration in the ar was comparable to the global average river water which is reported as 2 1 ng l 1 miller et al 2011 molybdenum as a mobile element is one of the trace metals enriched in bitumen bicalho et al 2017 the guideline value for mo is 73 µg l 1 for the protection of aquatic life ccme 2018 there is no ccme guideline for v and so we used federal environmental quality guideline of 120 µg l 1 total v feqg 1999 cobalt cu and ni are essential elements to animals co cu ni and plants cu and ni with limited solubility and moderate mobility in aquatic systems the ccme guideline values for these elements are defined as 2 5 7 and 25 µg l 1 as total concentrations respectively ccme 2018 the concentration of all of these three elements depend on water hardness as caco3 in aquatic systems the permissible concentrations of total as and u are defined as 5 and 15 µg l 1 ccme 1999 2018 the guideline for total concentrations of tl is 0 8 µg l 1 and that for cd ranges from 0 021 to 0 082 µg l 1 unfortunately there is no water quality guideline for the protection of aquatic life for total or dissolved concentrations of cr however a maximum acceptable concentration mac of 50 µg l 1 has been established for total chromium in drinking water pawlisz et al 1997 the average concentration of these tes in the athabasca river did not exceed any of these surface water quality guidelines table 1 5 summary and conclusions the goals of this study were to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in te concentrations in the athabasca river to resolve spatial differences samples were collected from upstream to downstream of industry at three points and two depths along five cross river transects to assess temporal changes samples were gathered in fall 2017 and spring 2018 the spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations of total dissolved and dissolved colloidal forms of al as cd co cr cu fe mn mo ni pb re sb tl th u v and zn were determined 1 in autumn total concentrations of al as co cu fe mn ni pb th tl and v were significantly more abundant downstream of industry compared to upstream with the exception of as and cu these elements occurred predominantly in the particulate fraction i e 0 45 µm normalization to thorium showed that no tes were enriched in the particulate fraction relative to crustal abundance in the dissolved fraction 0 45 µm concentrations of as co cu ni pb re and v were also significantly more abundant downstream of industry within the dissolved fraction fe and pb were found mainly as inorganic colloids while the other tes occurred mainly in the mainly ionic truly dissolved fraction i e ca 1 kda in this season the proportion of inorganic colloidal forms of mn and pb increased significantly from upstream to downstream moreover the concentration of primarily organic fe was more abundant p 0 05 midstream compared to upstream 2 in spring total concentration of al v cr mn fe co ni cu as cd sb tl pb and u were significantly more abundant upstream compared to downstream and most of the elements were again mainly present in the particulate form 55 6 99 8 rhenium was the only element that increased significantly from upstream to downstream in this fraction dissolved concentrations of al as cd co cu mo ni sb th tl u v and zn were also significantly more abundant upstream of industry compared to downstream in contrast dissolved mn and re increased significantly from upstream to downstream with the exception of fe and pb which were mainly present as inorganic colloids and cu which was mainly found in organic colloids the 1 kda fraction was the dominant dissolved form for all tes in this season primarily inorganic forms of cu and ni were more abundant p 0 05 in the midstream compared to both upstream and downstream moreover the concentrations of ionic as co and v were more abundant p 0 05 upstream or midstream compared to downstream 3 the average concentrations of the investigated tes were below the available provincial and federal surface water quality guidelines moreover only 15 28 of most elements of environmental concern e g pb were present in primarily ionic and small forms which are the most bioavailable arsenic is exceptional in this regard in that 95 of as was found in the truly dissolved fraction in both seasons 4 the pca analysis indicated that tributaries contribute meaningful amounts of total and dissolved tes in the past obtaining high quality te data to assess water quality in the ar has been one of the challenges associated with investigations in this region the cutting edge sampling and analysis methods that have been used in this research eliminated this shortcoming and hopefully understanding of natural inputs has been improved for engineers and scientists knowledge of the sources of tes and the impact of their sizes including colloidal forms on aquatic life is critical considering the bioavailability bioaccessibility and forms of tes in this complex aquatic system will help determine whether these tes pose a risk to aquatic life moreover these findings are important when planning future industrial activities such as the release to the river of treated water from tailings ponds to appropriately

8041,study region qingjiang cascade reservoir china study focus reservoirs regulate the natural streamflow to utilize water resources comprehensively how to mine the existing massive reservoir operation data to describe human operation behaviors is a challenge to address this issue a data driven method long short term memory lstm was used to simulate the reservoir outflow by inputting historical information the physics guided lstm model shortly named pg lstm was formulated by using synthetic flood samples and physical constraints of water balance boundary and monotonicity new hydrological insights 1 pg lstm can reproduce historical outflow with seasonal variations or predict outflow without lags 2 knowledge of reservoir operations can guide lstm with the reduction of negative flow occurrence and the accurate identification of operation behaviors under extreme hydrological conditions 3 specifically compared with conventional lstm gradient boosting regression tree and conventional reservoir operation pg lstm can improve the nash sutcliffe efficiency of cascade reservoir during the test period from 0 50 0 20 and 0 17 to 0 54 in the reproduction scenario and from 0 84 0 26 and 0 17 to 0 85 in the prediction scenario with five fold cross validation method the pg lstm is helpful to describe human operation behaviors of reservoirs keywords lstm data driven extracting human behaviors physics guided data availability all data and codes generated or used in the study are available from the corresponding author by request 1 introduction reservoirs are water resource projects for power generation flood control water supply and comprehensive utilization where efficient operations are essential for the implementation of reservoir functions gong et al 2022 lehner 2011 li 2020b yang et al 2018 with the development of science and technology reservoir managers have recorded a large amount of historical hydrological information and operation data causing an explosive increase in reservoir operation data li et al 2020a yang et al 2017 in reservoir operation operators integrate multiple sources of information to form decisions based on their own experience and professional judgment zhang et al 2021 currently it is a challenge to mine the existing massive data to describe human operation behavior corani et al 2009 hossain and el shafie 2013 yue et al 2018 although operators experience is difficult to quantify yang et al 2019 historical operating data implies operation behaviors facing multiple inflow scenarios yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b therefore the decision making process of the reservoir managers can be extracted by mining the historical operating data if the human operation behavior can be extracted the reservoir operation decision can be reproduced and the outflow from upstream reservoirs can be estimated by the downstream ones which is beneficial to manage cascade reservoirs generally reservoir operation can be implemented by models centered on the water balance principle cheng et al 2021 gong et al 2021a wang et al 2021 such as the optimization reservoir operation model ahmad et al 2014 huang et al 2021 ming et al 2021 and the conventional one gong et al 2021b li et al 2022 ming et al 2017 however due to the heterogeneity of the actual operation process on temporal and spatial scales bayoumi et al 2019 liu et al 2019 these models are inconsistent with the actual reservoir operation because the cognition and assumptions are unsuitable in contrast data mining models make fewer assumptions about the operation process and can extract reservoir operation behaviors from actual operation data which is a beneficial supplement to the traditional reservoir operation model moussa et al 2016 wang et al 2011 data mining models comprise shallow learning and deep learning models shallow learning models mohammadifar et al 2021 such as artificial neural network ann gori and tesi 1992 support vector machine and regression svm and svr zhang et al 2018a decision trees dt and radial basis functions rbfs have been applied to derive reservoir operation rules in recent years for instance the classification and regression tree cart algorithm a kind of dt was used to predict the outflow of nine reservoirs yang et al 2016 and input variable selection cis and gaussian radial basis functions rbfs methods were combined to derive reservoir operation rules yang et al 2017 although shallow learning models are effective for nonlinear simulation the computational difficulty of shallow learning models increases with the expansion of input dimension leading to difficulties in extracting reservoir operation behaviors in various decision scenarios deep learning methods have shown a broad application prospect in hydrology shen 2017 long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1996 a sequential deep learning model considered more efficient than other data mining models has attracted widespread interest in time series predicting kratzert et al 2019 xu et al 2021 recently there has been an increasing interest in the simulation of reservoir outflow by lstm for example zhang et al 2018a investigated the effect of different lstm network parameter setting on the model performance and the ability of lstm to simulate reservoir outflow of different time scales and flow regimes they further compared the performance of recurrent neural network rnn lstm and gated recurrent unit gru in predicting the outflow of the xiluodu reservoir zhang et al 2019a yang et al 2019 explored the ability of nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input narx lstm and genetic algorithm based narx to simulate the outflow of a single reservoir under extreme floods and droughts however reservoir operating patterns can only be extracted by lstm if there is sufficient support from historical operating data as a black box model lstm lacks physical mechanisms xie et al 2021 causing abnormal values such as negative flow becoming a major limitation in extracting reservoir operation behaviors to achieve physical consistency in deep learning models some researchers investigated hybrid strategies jiang et al 2020 markus et al 2019 read et al 2019 tested components responsible for hybrid models including process constraints derived from the energy conservation equation and the data obtained from process based models wang et al 2019 proposed a theory guided neural network framework where the loss function was guided by the governing equations other physical constraints engineering controls and expert knowledge similarly such hybrid strategies can be used to develop an improved model for extracting reservoir operation behaviors unfortunately there is little attention paid to physical based data driven models in reservoir operation this study therefore aims to implant physical knowledge into lstm to develop an improved model named physics guided lstm pg lstm for extracting reservoir operation behaviors specifically this study endeavors to answer the following questions 1 what applications can deep learning models achieve 2 to achieve the above applications what physical mechanism can be added to the deep learning model 3 what are the benefits of deep learning models combined with the physical mechanism compared with conventional deep learning models or shallow learning models the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology for the pg lstm and benchmark models details on the chosen cascade reservoirs are described in section 3 followed by results in section 4 and discussion in section 5 finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 methodology fig 1 provides an overview of the methodology comprising three steps 1 two physical mechanisms of reservoir operation were implanted into lstm to build the pg lstm model section 2 1 2 model inputs and outputs were identified for different scenarios section 2 2 3 varied statistical criteria are used to assess the accuracy and physical consistency section 2 3 2 1 physics guided lstm pg lstm 2 1 1 long short term memory lstm rnns comprise continuous units and the unit calculation results are continuously recursive on the time scale different categories of rnns differ in connections within the unit zhang et al 2018b however if the units manifest a long term dependence on the past information it is difficult to obtain desirable results lecun et al 2015 to overcome the pitfalls of traditional rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 developed the lstm neural network model to handle the long term mapping relationship of time series data a conventional lstm unit contains forget gate input gate output gate and a memory cell the forget gate determines whether to discard information using the sigmoid function the input gate and the tanh function save information to obtain candidate cell state values the memory cell is utilized to store the information of the long term memory and the output gate decides the memory cell output the conventional lstm structure and the calculation procedure can be found in the study of xu et al 2021 2 1 2 physical mechanisms of reservoir operation implanted into lstm two physical mechanisms are integrated into lstm as follows 1 penalty terms are added into the loss function of the deep learning model to encourage physical consistency for violating knowledge of the water balance principle outflow boundary monotonic relationship between inflow and outflow and 2 the training dataset of lstm is supplemented by synthetic samples based on the design flood using the flood routing 2 1 2 1 lstm with physical constraints 1 water balance principle of cascade reservoir a water balance equation of single reservoir 1 v i t 1 v i t i i t q i t δ t i 1 2 n b the hydraulic connection between the upstream reservoir i and the downstream reservoir i 1 2 i i 1 t i i t q i t i

the time interval for routing n is the number of reservoirs in the studied cascade reservoir i i t denotes the local inflow from the zone between the upstream reservoir i and the downstream reservoir i 1 at period t the water balance during the test period was checked by calculating the difference in water volume between inflow outflow and reservoir storage 2 monotonic relationship between inflow and outflow the internal relationship between reservoir inflow and outflow depends on the dynamic interaction between inflow intensity reservoir storage reservoir outflow the monotonic relationship between inflow and outflow is that the reservoir outflow should be not smaller than the original outflow if a small increase appears in reservoir inflow this constraint is considered to ensure the robustness of deep learning models encountering perturbations the monotonic relationship between inflow and outflow is as follows 3 q i t f i i t θ 4 f i i t δ i i θ f i i t θ 0 where q i t is the simulated outflow of reservoir i at period t f donates the simulation function of the deep learning network θ is the parameters of the network δ i i is a small increase of inflow 3 boundary constraints of outflow the boundary constraints of outflow are as follows 5 q l i min q i t q u i max q i t q l i q i t q u i where q l i is the lower boundary of outflow q u i is the upper boundary of outflow 4 the loss function with physical constraints the physical constraints inspired by the physical understandings described above are added to the conventional objective of data fitting thus the pg lstm model can be built with the equation of loss function as follows 6 l o s s λ d a t a l o s s d a t a λ b a l a n c e l o s s b a l a n c e λ m o n o t o n i c i t y l o s s m o n o t o n i

important goal of this study is the effective prediction of outflow facing extreme hydrological events however there are few high flow samples in the historical data under normal reservoir operation conditions leading to the poor simulation of high flow to solve this problem the synthetic samples based on the design flood operating cases are used as the additional input to train the model the synthetic samples can provide more information about the high flow events determined by the flood routing the steps of constructing lstm with synthetic samples are shown in fig 2 1 collection of operational parameters and curves of the studied cascade reservoir and acquisition of design flood information 2 establishing a flood routing model based on reservoir operating rules 3 analysis and extraction of the synthetic samples including information of cascade reservoir inflow outflow and water level 2 1 3 benchmark model to quantitatively show the improvement of deep learning models the gradient boosting regression tree gbrt model and the conventional reservoir operation cro model are used as benchmark models 2 1 3 1 gradient boosting regression tree gbrt gbrt as one of the most important machine learning methods has been employed in engineering science hydrology and water science such as water demand carvalho and filho 2021 runoff he et al 2020 short term load mayrink and hippert 2016 and solar power forecasting persson et al 2017 addressing the problem of non linearity simulating gbrt consists of a sequential ensemble of weak learners friedman 2001 usually decision trees after the creation of decision trees the tree is first used to predict the outflow of cascade reservoirs with a set of explanatory variables then the trees in the sequence focus on the prediction residuals of the previous trees the above procedure repeated with the optimization of loss functions and several hyperparameters needs to be tuned to make the simulation better such as the number of trees the maximum tree depth and the learning rate in this study the gbrt model was constructed by the python programming language and scikit learn package kramer 2016 rossum and drake 2012 different combinations of the number of trees 10 100 the maximum tree depth 2 10 and the learning rate 0 01 0 1 were tested by a mesh search algorithm and tuned using five fold cross validation the chosen hyperparameters can provide the best performance of the simulation as a benchmark model inputs and outputs of gbrt are the same as dl models 2 1 3 2 conventional reservoir operation cro cro gong et al 2021a infers release using the reservoir operating rule curves which are used by reservoir operators in the face of normal hydrological conditions 2 2 model application scenarios the pg lstm model includes constraints of the water balance outflow boundary monotonic relationship between inflow and outflow in the loss function and the synthetic samples of the design flood in the training dataset the application scenarios of pg lstm are further discussed in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 2 2 1 reproduction scenario the reproduction of cascade reservoir historical outflow the first application scenario is the reproduction of the historical outflow decision the long series of the historical operating decision in periods without reservoirs can provide benchmark comparison solutions for the evaluation of optimized reservoir operation model solving the problem that conventional reservoir operation method is harder to assess the benefits of optimized reservoir operation model in the historical period without reservoirs only the day index and cascade reservoir inflow information are available however different reservoir water level states should be considered for operating decision making therefore the mean of the operational water level on a daily scale namely the mean reservoir water level can be used to describe the seasonality of reservoir release the inputs and outputs of models in the reproduction scenario are as shown in fig 3 the mapping relationship between model inputs and outputs can be determined as follows 7 q i t q i 1 t q n t f x θ where q i t i 1 2 n is the release of reservoir i at period t f donates the simulation function of the deep learning network in the reproduction scenario x is model inputs in the reproduction scenario including the day index t the inflow of reservoir i i 1 namely i 1 t i 1 t 1 i 1 t 2 i 1 t 3 local inflow between reservoir i and reservoir i 1 namely i i t i i t 1 i i t 2 i i t 3 i 1 2 n 1 and the static reservoir water level z i θ is the parameters of the network in the reproduction scenario 2 2 2 prediction scenario the prediction of cascade reservoir outflow with leading times the second application scenario is the prediction of cascade reservoir outflow with several leading times for the prediction scenario the currently available data regarding inflow initial reservoir water level and previous outflow can be used as model inputs the inputs and outputs in the prediction scenario are as shown in fig 4 the mapping relationship between model inputs and outputs can be determined as follows 8 q i t q i 1 t q n t f t x θ t 0 1 2 m where q i t q i 1 t q n t t 0 1 2 m is the release of reservoir i i 1 2 n with leading time t f t donates the simulation function of the deep learning

inflow between reservoir i and reservoir i 1 namely i i t i i t 1 i i t 2 i i t 3 i 1 2 n 1 the initial reservoir water level z i t 1 and the outflow of reservoir i i 1 2 n in the previous day θ is the parameters of the network in the prediction scenario 2 3 model evaluation 2 3 1 simulation accuracy in this study three statistical criteria are employed to quantify the model simulation accuracy

compensate for the nse sensible to high flow and the slow response to low flow rate liu 2020 zhou et al 2022 2 3 2 physical consistency the water balance index wbi deng et al 2019 and the percentage of negative flow ponf are used to evaluate the physical consistency of the model wbi is a measure of bias between total simulated outflow and observed outflow the more wbi is close to 1 the better the

settings are trained and tested to identify the optimal hyperparameter the optimization of hyperparameters can refer to the previous study in zhang et al 2018a the final hyperparameters are chosen by obtaining the optimal nse of the cascade reservoir as shown in table 1 the lstm pg lstm and gbrt are developed based on the pytorch framework of python the cro is implemented based on the c programming language 3 case study 3 1 study area the cascade reservoir used in this study is the qingjiang qj cascade reservoir located in the middle and lower reaches of the qj river basin as shown in fig 5 the qj river basin covers an area of 17 600 km2 in the subtropical region between east longitude 108 35 111 35 and north latitude 29 33 30 50 shuibuya geheyan and gaobazhou hydropower stations hereafter sby ghy and gbz respectively are constructed in the middle and lower reaches of the qj river basin sby has a multi year regulation ability which has a drainage area of 10 860 km2 with a total storage capacity of 4 58 billion m3 and the surface area of sby is 64 35 km2 at the normal water level ghy has an annual regulation ability which has a drainage area of 14 430 km2 with a total storage capacity of 3 34 billion m3 and the surface area of ghy is 67 94 km2 at the normal water level gbz is the reverse regulating hydropower station of ghy with daily regulation ability which has a drainage area of 15 650 km2 with a total storage capacity of 489 million m3 and the surface area of gbz is 31 km2 at the normal water level since the time scale of this study is daily only sby and ghy reservoirs are considered 3 2 data description the basic information and operation data of sby and ghy reservoirs are obtained from hubei energy group co ltd the day index daily inﬂow reservoir water level and outflow of sby and ghy are shown in fig 6 the models are trained by information comprising day index cascade reservoir predicted inflow of the current and the next three days cascade reservoir outflow in the previous day cascade reservoir water level of the previous day and the mean water level of cascade reservoir the day index ranges from 1 to 366 with only one of the 366 inputs corresponding to the current day for example if the date of the day is 10 february the day index is 41 the mean water level is the mean of the operational water level on a daily scale which is an attribute of reservoirs used as static inputs at each time step data division is performed by a five fold cross validation method data normalization is accomplished using min max normalization the normalized equation is as follows 14 x i x i o r i x i min x i max x i min where x i are the standardized values for variables x i o r i are the original values for variables x i min x i max are the minimum and the maximum values of variables respectively 4 results the proposed method was applied to reproduction and prediction scenarios respectively first the simulation results and the evaluation metrics were compared by lstm pg lstm cro and gbrt section 4 1 second the simulation of high intermediate and low outflow was presented to explain how the synthetic samples affected the model performance section 4 2 after that the reduction of the negative flow and the improvement of water balance by physical constraints was clarified section 4 3 finally the applicability of reservoir operation by lstm pg lstm cro and gbrt in the reproduction and prediction scenarios was analyzed section 4 4 4 1 comparison of simulation results of models this section compares the simulation outflow of the cascade reservoir by lstm pg lstm gbrt and cro table 2 summarizes the simulation accuracy of pg lstm compared with the results of lstm gbrt and cro lstm gbrt and cro were trained as the benchmark model as seen from table 1 pg lstm had a higher simulation accuracy in the reproduction scenario in the test period the average nse of the cascade reservoir was 0 54 which was 0 04 0 34 and 0 37 higher than the conventional lstm gbrt and cro models in the prediction scenario the average nse of the cascade reservoir was 0 85 which was 0 01 0 59 and 0 68 higher than the conventional lstm gbrt cro respectively compared with deep learning models the conventional learning models failed to absorb the data of reservoir operation compared with lstm the improvement of pg lstm lied in the physical mechanisms added into the network when the model inputs less information in the reproduction scenario as a novel method the physical constraints and the synthetic samples were added to the lstm network to improve the model performance it is indicated that the physical mechanisms can guide the model when less information is input when the input information increased the knowledge of reservoir operation guided the model less than the scenario with fewer data and information input to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach the simulated outflow distribution of cro lstm pg lstm and gbrt was compared during the test period as shown in fig 7 the distributions of the model results showed concentrated characteristics but the characteristics were not identical the results of the observed outflow lstm pg lstm and gbrt models showed a single peaked distribution shape while the results of cro showed a double peaked distribution shape for outflow less than 2500 m3 s the distributions of lstm and pg lstm results were closer to that of the observed outflow however lstm was difficult to realize the simulation of high flow while pg lstm can enable high flow simulation thus the distribution of pg lstm results was closest to that of the observed outflow meanwhile fig 7a and fig 7b show the consistent model performance in sby and ghy reservoirs therefore only the simulation results of sby were analyzed in detail in the following sections 4 2 effect of synthetic samples based on the design flood in the qj cascade reservoir system the outflow of sby and ghy was in the range of 0 1500 m3 s as can be seen from fig 6 due to the inadequate high inflow of actual operation the existing operating data mostly included reservoir operation behaviors with normal operating conditions it is insufficient to handle the rare and intense flood events one approach to tackle the above problem of imbalanced data is to synthesize the high flow operating cases by calculating the design flood from 20 to 0 01 some high flow samples can be generated as shown in fig 8 gbrt presented poor flow simulation in reproduction and prediction scenarios lstm showed poor flow simulation in the reproduction scenario while the high flow simulation in the prediction scenario was more effective than that of the reproduction scenario by considering the outflow and reservoir water level of the previous day with the simulated peak flow of 2050 m3 s pg lstm can effectively simulate the high flow with the simulated peak flow of 4750 m3 s 4385 m3 s in reproduction and prediction scenarios respectively compared with other models pg lstm was most consistent with the observed value the simulated peak flow of cro was 5940 m3 s and the observed value of peak flow was 4660 m3 s the relative error of cro peak was 0 27 while the relative error of pg lstm peak in reproduction and prediction scenarios was 0 02 and 0 06 respectively thus pg lstm outperformed cro pg lstm outperformed lstm in extracting high flow since the relative error of peak of lstm was larger and the peak flow timing of lstm lagged specifically the relative error of peak was reduced using pg lstm compared with the conventional lstm model the relative error of peak decreased from 0 80 to 0 02 in the reproduction scenario from 0 55 to 0 06 in the prediction scenario the performance of lstm in high flow simulation was poor due to the rarity of high flow samples in the training dataset thus the synthetic high flow samples assist in providing more information for deep learning models however pg lstm was less effective in simulating intermediate low flows as shown in fig 9 after the high flow samples were added to the model training dataset the model paid less attention to the intermediate low flow resulting in the overestimation performance in actual reservoir operations outflow decisions for extreme hydrological conditions are critical for reservoir operation although the addition of design flood operating samples would make the model focus less on the intermediate low flow it is still recommended to add the operating samples of the design flood for the model training 4 3 effect of physical constraints derived from reservoir operation to improve the physical consistency of deep learning networks some physical constraints were added to the loss function as shown in table 3 the mean wbi bias of the qj cascade reservoir for lstm pg lstm gbrt and cro in the reproduction scenario were 0 03 0 01 0 11 and 0 04 which indicated that the water balance of the pg lstm model was more desirable similarly this viewpoint can be drawn from the prediction scenario the conventional lstm for outflow simulation appeared negative flow in the prediction scenario the mean ponf of the qj cascade reservoir for lstm and pg lstm in the prediction scenario were 1 03 and 0 14 respectively the results of ponf suggested that pg lstm can effectively reduce the occurrence of negative flow the results showed that the addition of physical constraints can improve model physical consistency the proposed pg lstm network can decrease the water balance bias and reduce the occurrence of negative flow 4 4 applicability of models in the reproduction and prediction scenarios the trained models were applied to the reproduction and prediction scenarios and the performance of the model was evaluated 4 4 1 reproduction scenario the reproduction of cascade reservoir historical outflow fig 10 is the comparison of the reproduced outflow using lstm pg lstm gbrt and cro after the models extracted the experience of reservoir operators the historical information was applied to the model to obtain outflow reproduced by lstm pg lstm gbrt and cro as can be seen from fig 9 the results of lstm and gbrt cannot accommodate the seasonal variation of reservoir inflow and presented auto correlation characteristics the results of cro were similar to that of pg lstm which meant that pg lstm can infer the rule curves used by reservoir operators the results of pg lstm were better than that of cro for example when the inflow was less than 2500 m3 s pg lstm tended to produce a smaller outflow which was consistent with the operating experience of the qj cascade reservoir operators the reasons for the difference between simulation results of cro and pg lstm can be explained as follows cro is usually used for the preparation of the annual reservoir operating plan which cannot consider the forecast information of inflow resulting in conservative operating decisions according to fig 10 cro tended to release more flow during the flood season to make a safe decision and preferred releasing less outflow to ensure the realization of reservoir functions in the non flood season considering the forecast information of inflow the results of pg lstm were closer to the actual operation than those of cro further the daily reservoir water level and power generation can be obtained by using the simulated outflow of pg lstm with the data of 1 may 1962 to 30 april 1963 as an example the results showed that the total power generation of the operation period of cro for the qj cascade reservoir was 7 60 billion kwh while that of pg lstm was 9 26 billion kwh in contrast the total power generation of the cascade reservoir calculated by the deterministic optimization operation is 9 46 billion kwh indicating that pg lstm can be used as a better benchmark compared with the cro method for evaluation of the optimal operation 4 4 2 prediction scenario the prediction of cascade reservoir outflow with several leading times table 4 shows the nse of sby and ghy outflow simulations as can be seen from table 4 the deep learning model outperformed the extraction of reservoir operation behaviors compared to gbrt and cro as for the deep learning models pg lstm was better than lstm in the three lead times with nse of pg lstm higher than that of lstm in the test period in addition the improvement of nse of pg lstm in the test period was greater as the lead time increased and the improvement percentage of pg lstm to lstm was 4 66 with three days ahead fig 11 is the comparison of the outflow predicted by lstm pg lstm and gbrt with several lead times as can be seen from fig 11 the performance of pg lstm decreased more slowly than lstm and gbrt with the increase of lead times fig 12 shows the results of high flow prediction with several lead times using lstm pg lstm and gbrt from fig 12 it can be seen that there was a serious lag in the predicted outflow of lstm as the lead time increased while pg lstm can still ensure accurate high flow predictions therefore pg lstm is more robust than lstm 5 discussion 5 1 verification of the physical mechanism effects from section 4 it was known that synthetic samples using the design flood operating case improved the peak outflow simulation and the loss function revised by physical constraints enhanced the model physical consistency two new experiments were conducted in section 5 1 in which the above two physical mechanisms were added to lstm separately to verify the effects of the physical mechanism table 5 is the comparison of model performance in extracting cascade reservoir outflow behaviors using different modification ways with lstm table 5 illustrates that adding the operating cases of the design flood can gain higher nse than revising the loss function with physical constraints which meant the former is more conducive to improving the nse of the model however only considering the synthetic samples method cannot fully satisfy the physical constraints of reservoir operation for example the results of lstm with synthetic samples had more negative flow and less water balance satisfaction than pg lstm thus physical constraints are beneficial to limit the solution space consequently two reasons can explain why pg lstm is more effective than lstm in the cascade reservoir operation simulation as follows 1 the design flood operating cases provide knowledge to lstm when the extreme flood occurs 2 the penalty terms constraint the range of outflow and promote the model to better reflect the reservoir operation behaviors the two physical mechanisms one is from the perspective of the domain prior knowledge to guide the model and the other is to realize the guidance of the physical mechanism to the deep learning model by increasing the sample richness such a physical mechanism guided method can be applied to other research areas building loss function or activation function containing domain control equations variable constraints obtaining more training samples from physical models to increase the richness of samples the two physical mechanisms can be used to build physically guided data driven models for different domains 5 2 representation of the hydraulic connection in cascade reservoirs for deep learning models hydraulic connection is a key element in the cascade reservoir operation the proposed models in this study took the cascade reservoir as a whole in which the model inputs were the inflow of the upstream reservoir the local flow between cascade reservoir etc and outputs were the outflow of each reservoir in the cascade reservoir in this way the hydraulic connection has been considered in the loss function of pg lstm when the model simultaneously outputs the outflow of sby and ghy thus the hydraulic connection between the upstream and downstream reservoir can be explicitly included in the proposed model a new experiment experiment 2 was added in section 5 2 to compare the original experiment experiment 1 the new experiment separated the reservoirs of the cascade reservoir to obtain the outflow of the single reservoir and the hydraulic connection was calculated step by step from upstream to downstream the comparative analysis of simulation results of experiment 1 and experiment 2 was as follows 5 2 1 experiment 1 a cascade reservoir mode in experiment 1 the hydraulic connection was presented in the loss function the results of experiment 1 have been shown in table 2 and table 3 the models took the information of cascade reservoir for instance the inflow of sby local flow between sby and ghy etc as the input and output the outflow of sby and ghy simultaneously 5 2 2 experiment 2 a single reservoir mode in experiment 2 models were applied independently to each reservoir and the hydraulic connection was calculated step by step from upstream to downstream based on the simulated outflow of the upstream reservoir the hydraulic connection can be formulated as follows 15 i g h y t i s b y g h y t q ˆ s b y t where i g h y t is the inflow of ghy i s b y g h y t is the local flow between sby and ghy q ˆ s b y t is the simulated outflow of sby the models for sby only input the operational information of sby and output sby outflow similarly the models for ghy input the operational information of ghy specifically the inflow of ghy was calculated according to eq 15 and then ghy models output the outflow of ghy from table 6 it can be seen that experiment 1 and experiment 2 have similar nse performance in the test period as pg lstm that listed in table 7 experiment 1 obtains a better physical consistency with ponf of 0 14 and wbi bias of 0 01 in the prediction scenario while that of experiment 2 is 0 21 and 0 01 respectively because experiment 1 owns better physical consistency and can output the outflow of the cascade reservoir simultaneously the model structure of experiment 1 is recommended in this study 6 conclusion this study investigated the effectiveness of pg lstm to extract cascade reservoir operation behaviors the simulation accuracy and physical consistency of pg lstm were evaluated in reproduction and prediction scenarios the main conclusions are as follows 1 this study provides a reservoir operation behavior mining method which can be used for two scenarios one is to reproduce the historical cascade reservoir outflow with significant seasonal variations and the other is to predict the outflow with several lead times without lags 2 to achieve accurate simulation of reservoir operators experience physical mechanisms of reservoir operation are integrated into lstm the proposed physical mechanism of reservoir operation comprises two parts one is to add the design flood operating samples into the training dataset of lstm the other is to utilize the water balance equation the monotonic relationship between inflow and outflow and the boundary constraint of outflow 3 considering the operating samples based on the design flood and the historical operation data as the model training dataset pg lstm can enhance the understanding of lstm for the operation behaviors under extreme hydrological conditions with more accurate high flow simulation moreover using the water balance constraint boundary constraints and monotonic constraint can help pg lstm effectively reduce the occurrence of the negative flow and decrease the bias of the water balance index making the mining operation behavior more consistent with the basic principles of reservoir operation overall compared with lstm gbrt and cro pg lstm can improve nse of cascade reservoir during the test period from 0 50 0 20 0 17 to 0 54 in the reproduction scenario and from 0 84 0 26 and 0 17 to 0 85 in the prediction scenario with five fold cross validation method the proposed pg lstm is helpful to describe human operation behaviors which is capable of providing benefits for cascade reservoir operations and changing the situation that reservoir operation depends on manual experience further research should concentrate on expanding the employment of physically guided data

8041,study region qingjiang cascade reservoir china study focus reservoirs regulate the natural streamflow to utilize water resources comprehensively how to mine the existing massive reservoir operation data to describe human operation behaviors is a challenge to address this issue a data driven method long short term memory lstm was used to simulate the reservoir outflow by inputting historical information the physics guided lstm model shortly named pg lstm was formulated by using synthetic flood samples and physical constraints of water balance boundary and monotonicity new hydrological insights 1 pg lstm can reproduce historical outflow with seasonal variations or predict outflow without lags 2 knowledge of reservoir operations can guide lstm with the reduction of negative flow occurrence and the accurate identification of operation behaviors under extreme hydrological conditions 3 specifically compared with conventional lstm gradient boosting regression tree and conventional reservoir operation pg lstm can improve the nash sutcliffe efficiency of cascade reservoir during the test period from 0 50 0 20 and 0 17 to 0 54 in the reproduction scenario and from 0 84 0 26 and 0 17 to 0 85 in the prediction scenario with five fold cross validation method the pg lstm is helpful to describe human operation behaviors of reservoirs keywords lstm data driven extracting human behaviors physics guided data availability all data and codes generated or used in the study are available from the corresponding author by request 1 introduction reservoirs are water resource projects for power generation flood control water supply and comprehensive utilization where efficient operations are essential for the implementation of reservoir functions gong et al 2022 lehner 2011 li 2020b yang et al 2018 with the development of science and technology reservoir managers have recorded a large amount of historical hydrological information and operation data causing an explosive increase in reservoir operation data li et al 2020a yang et al 2017 in reservoir operation operators integrate multiple sources of information to form decisions based on their own experience and professional judgment zhang et al 2021 currently it is a challenge to mine the existing massive data to describe human operation behavior corani et al 2009 hossain and el shafie 2013 yue et al 2018 although operators experience is difficult to quantify yang et al 2019 historical operating data implies operation behaviors facing multiple inflow scenarios yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b therefore the decision making process of the reservoir managers can be extracted by mining the historical operating data if the human operation behavior can be extracted the reservoir operation decision can be reproduced and the outflow from upstream reservoirs can be estimated by the downstream ones which is beneficial to manage cascade reservoirs generally reservoir operation can be implemented by models centered on the water balance principle cheng et al 2021 gong et al 2021a wang et al 2021 such as the optimization reservoir operation model ahmad et al 2014 huang et al 2021 ming et al 2021 and the conventional one gong et al 2021b li et al 2022 ming et al 2017 however due to the heterogeneity of the actual operation process on temporal and spatial scales bayoumi et al 2019 liu et al 2019 these models are inconsistent with the actual reservoir operation because the cognition and assumptions are unsuitable in contrast data mining models make fewer assumptions about the operation process and can extract reservoir operation behaviors from actual operation data which is a beneficial supplement to the traditional reservoir operation model moussa et al 2016 wang et al 2011 data mining models comprise shallow learning and deep learning models shallow learning models mohammadifar et al 2021 such as artificial neural network ann gori and tesi 1992 support vector machine and regression svm and svr zhang et al 2018a decision trees dt and radial basis functions rbfs have been applied to derive reservoir operation rules in recent years for instance the classification and regression tree cart algorithm a kind of dt was used to predict the outflow of nine reservoirs yang et al 2016 and input variable selection cis and gaussian radial basis functions rbfs methods were combined to derive reservoir operation rules yang et al 2017 although shallow learning models are effective for nonlinear simulation the computational difficulty of shallow learning models increases with the expansion of input dimension leading to difficulties in extracting reservoir operation behaviors in various decision scenarios deep learning methods have shown a broad application prospect in hydrology shen 2017 long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1996 a sequential deep learning model considered more efficient than other data mining models has attracted widespread interest in time series predicting kratzert et al 2019 xu et al 2021 recently there has been an increasing interest in the simulation of reservoir outflow by lstm for example zhang et al 2018a investigated the effect of different lstm network parameter setting on the model performance and the ability of lstm to simulate reservoir outflow of different time scales and flow regimes they further compared the performance of recurrent neural network rnn lstm and gated recurrent unit gru in predicting the outflow of the xiluodu reservoir zhang et al 2019a yang et al 2019 explored the ability of nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input narx lstm and genetic algorithm based narx to simulate the outflow of a single reservoir under extreme floods and droughts however reservoir operating patterns can only be extracted by lstm if there is sufficient support from historical operating data as a black box model lstm lacks physical mechanisms xie et al 2021 causing abnormal values such as negative flow becoming a major limitation in extracting reservoir operation behaviors to achieve physical consistency in deep learning models some researchers investigated hybrid strategies jiang et al 2020 markus et al 2019 read et al 2019 tested components responsible for hybrid models including process constraints derived from the energy conservation equation and the data obtained from process based models wang et al 2019 proposed a theory guided neural network framework where the loss function was guided by the governing equations other physical constraints engineering controls and expert knowledge similarly such hybrid strategies can be used to develop an improved model for extracting reservoir operation behaviors unfortunately there is little attention paid to physical based data driven models in reservoir operation this study therefore aims to implant physical knowledge into lstm to develop an improved model named physics guided lstm pg lstm for extracting reservoir operation behaviors specifically this study endeavors to answer the following questions 1 what applications can deep learning models achieve 2 to achieve the above applications what physical mechanism can be added to the deep learning model 3 what are the benefits of deep learning models combined with the physical mechanism compared with conventional deep learning models or shallow learning models the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology for the pg lstm and benchmark models details on the chosen cascade reservoirs are described in section 3 followed by results in section 4 and discussion in section 5 finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 methodology fig 1 provides an overview of the methodology comprising three steps 1 two physical mechanisms of reservoir operation were implanted into lstm to build the pg lstm model section 2 1 2 model inputs and outputs were identified for different scenarios section 2 2 3 varied statistical criteria are used to assess the accuracy and physical consistency section 2 3 2 1 physics guided lstm pg lstm 2 1 1 long short term memory lstm rnns comprise continuous units and the unit calculation results are continuously recursive on the time scale different categories of rnns differ in connections within the unit zhang et al 2018b however if the units manifest a long term dependence on the past information it is difficult to obtain desirable results lecun et al 2015 to overcome the pitfalls of traditional rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 developed the lstm neural network model to handle the long term mapping relationship of time series data a conventional lstm unit contains forget gate input gate output gate and a memory cell the forget gate determines whether to discard information using the sigmoid function the input gate and the tanh function save information to obtain candidate cell state values the memory cell is utilized to store the information of the long term memory and the output gate decides the memory cell output the conventional lstm structure and the calculation procedure can be found in the study of xu et al 2021 2 1 2 physical mechanisms of reservoir operation implanted into lstm two physical mechanisms are integrated into lstm as follows 1 penalty terms are added into the loss function of the deep learning model to encourage physical consistency for violating knowledge of the water balance principle outflow boundary monotonic relationship between inflow and outflow and 2 the training dataset of lstm is supplemented by synthetic samples based on the design flood using the flood routing 2 1 2 1 lstm with physical constraints 1 water balance principle of cascade reservoir a water balance equation of single reservoir 1 v i t 1 v i t i i t q i t δ t i 1 2 n b the hydraulic connection between the upstream reservoir i and the downstream reservoir i 1 2 i i 1 t i i t q i t i 1 2 n where v i t 1 and v i t are the initial and final water storage of reservoir i at period t respectively i i t and q i t are the inflow and release of reservoir i at period t respectively δ t is the time interval for routing n is the number of reservoirs in the studied cascade reservoir i i t denotes the local inflow from the zone between the upstream reservoir i and the downstream reservoir i 1 at period t the water balance during the test period was checked by calculating the difference in water volume between inflow outflow and reservoir storage 2 monotonic relationship between inflow and outflow the internal relationship between reservoir inflow and outflow depends on the dynamic interaction between inflow intensity reservoir storage reservoir outflow the monotonic relationship between inflow and outflow is that the reservoir outflow should be not smaller than the original outflow if a small increase appears in reservoir inflow this constraint is considered to ensure the robustness of deep learning models encountering perturbations the monotonic relationship between inflow and outflow is as follows 3 q i t f i i t θ 4 f i i t δ i i θ f i i t θ 0 where q i t is the simulated outflow of reservoir i at period t f donates the simulation function of the deep learning network θ is the parameters of the network δ i i is a small increase of inflow 3 boundary constraints of outflow the boundary constraints of outflow are as follows 5 q l i min q i t q u i max q i t q l i q i t q u i where q l i is the lower boundary of outflow q u i is the upper boundary of outflow 4 the loss function with physical constraints the physical constraints inspired by the physical understandings described above are added to the conventional objective of data fitting thus the pg lstm model can be built with the equation of loss function as follows 6 l o s s λ d a t a l o s s d a t a λ b a l a n c e l o s s b a l a n c e λ m o n o t o n i c i t y l o s s m o n o t o n i

important goal of this study is the effective prediction of outflow facing extreme hydrological events however there are few high flow samples in the historical data under normal reservoir operation conditions leading to the poor simulation of high flow to solve this problem the synthetic samples based on the design flood operating cases are used as the additional input to train the model the synthetic samples can provide more information about the high flow events determined by the flood routing the steps of constructing lstm with synthetic samples are shown in fig 2 1 collection of operational parameters and curves of the studied cascade reservoir and acquisition of design flood information 2 establishing a flood routing model based on reservoir operating rules 3 analysis and extraction of the synthetic samples including information of cascade reservoir inflow outflow and water level 2 1 3 benchmark model to quantitatively show the improvement of deep learning models the gradient boosting regression tree gbrt model and the conventional reservoir operation cro model are used as benchmark models 2 1 3 1 gradient boosting regression tree gbrt gbrt as one of the most important machine learning methods has been employed in engineering science hydrology and water science such as water demand carvalho and filho 2021 runoff he et al 2020 short term load mayrink and hippert 2016 and solar power forecasting persson et al 2017 addressing the problem of non linearity simulating gbrt consists of a sequential ensemble of weak learners friedman 2001 usually decision trees after the creation of decision trees the tree is first used to predict the outflow of cascade reservoirs with a set of explanatory variables then the trees in the sequence focus on the prediction residuals of the previous trees the above procedure repeated with the optimization of loss functions and several hyperparameters needs to be tuned to make the simulation better such as the number of trees the maximum tree depth and the learning rate in this study the gbrt model was constructed by the python programming language and scikit learn package kramer 2016 rossum and drake 2012 different combinations of the number of trees 10 100 the maximum tree depth 2 10 and the learning rate 0 01 0 1 were tested by a mesh search algorithm and tuned using five fold cross validation the chosen hyperparameters can provide the best performance of the simulation as a benchmark model inputs and outputs of gbrt are the same as dl models 2 1 3 2 conventional reservoir operation cro cro gong et al 2021a infers release using the reservoir operating rule curves which are used by reservoir operators in the face of normal hydrological conditions 2 2 model application scenarios the pg lstm model includes constraints of the water balance outflow boundary monotonic relationship between inflow and outflow in the loss function and the synthetic samples of the design flood in the training dataset the application scenarios of pg lstm are further discussed in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 2 2 1 reproduction scenario the reproduction of cascade reservoir historical outflow the first application scenario is the reproduction of the historical outflow decision the long series of the historical operating decision in periods without reservoirs can provide benchmark comparison solutions for the evaluation of optimized reservoir operation model solving the problem that conventional reservoir operation method is harder to assess the benefits of optimized reservoir operation model in the historical period without reservoirs only the day index and cascade reservoir inflow information are available however different reservoir water level states should be considered for operating decision making therefore the mean of the operational water level on a daily scale namely the mean reservoir water level can be used to describe the seasonality of reservoir release the inputs and outputs of models in the reproduction scenario are as shown in fig 3 the mapping relationship between model inputs and outputs can be determined as follows 7 q i t q i 1 t q n t f x θ where q i t i 1 2 n is the release of reservoir i at period t f donates the simulation function of the deep learning network in the reproduction scenario x is model inputs in the reproduction scenario including the day index t the inflow of reservoir i i 1 namely i 1 t i 1 t 1 i 1 t 2 i 1 t 3 local inflow between reservoir i and reservoir i 1 namely i i t i i t 1 i i t 2 i i t 3 i 1 2 n 1 and the static reservoir water level z i θ is the parameters of the network in the reproduction scenario 2 2 2 prediction scenario the prediction of cascade reservoir outflow with leading times the second application scenario is the prediction of cascade reservoir outflow with several leading times for the prediction scenario the currently available data regarding inflow initial reservoir water level and previous outflow can be used as model inputs the inputs and outputs in the prediction scenario are as shown in fig 4 the mapping relationship between model inputs and outputs can be determined as follows 8 q i t q i 1 t q n t f t x θ t 0 1 2 m where q i t q i 1 t q n t t 0 1 2 m is the release of reservoir i i 1 2 n with leading time t f t donates the simulation function of the deep learning network with leading time t in the prediction scenario x is model inputs in the prediction scenario including the day index t the inflow of reservoir i i 1 namely i 1 t i 1 t 1 i 1 t 2 i 1 t 3 local inflow between reservoir i and reservoir i 1 namely i i t i i t 1 i i t 2 i i t 3 i 1 2 n 1 the initial reservoir water level z i t 1 and the outflow of reservoir i i 1 2 n in the previous day θ is the parameters of the network in the prediction scenario 2 3 model evaluation 2 3 1 simulation accuracy in this study three statistical criteria are employed to quantify the model simulation accuracy

compensate for the nse sensible to high flow and the slow response to low flow rate liu 2020 zhou et al 2022 2 3 2 physical consistency the water balance index wbi deng et al 2019 and the percentage of negative flow ponf are used to evaluate the physical consistency of the model wbi is a measure of bias between total simulated outflow and observed outflow the more wbi is close to 1 the better the water balance of the model results the wbi bias can be calculated as absolute values of wbi and 1 1 the water balance index wbi and the wbi bias 12 w b i t 1 n q ˆ i t t 1 n q i t w b i b i a s 1 w b

settings are trained and tested to identify the optimal hyperparameter the optimization of hyperparameters can refer to the previous study in zhang et al 2018a the final hyperparameters are chosen by obtaining the optimal nse of the cascade reservoir as shown in table 1 the lstm pg lstm and gbrt are developed based on the pytorch framework of python the cro is implemented based on the c programming language 3 case study 3 1 study area the cascade reservoir used in this study is the qingjiang qj cascade reservoir located in the middle and lower reaches of the qj river basin as shown in fig 5 the qj river basin covers an area of 17 600 km2 in the subtropical region between east longitude 108 35 111 35 and north latitude 29 33 30 50 shuibuya geheyan and gaobazhou hydropower stations hereafter sby ghy and gbz respectively are constructed in the middle and lower reaches of the qj river basin sby has a multi year regulation ability which has a drainage area of 10 860 km2 with a total storage capacity of 4 58 billion m3 and the surface area of sby is 64 35 km2 at the normal water level ghy has an annual regulation ability which has a drainage area of 14 430 km2 with a total storage capacity of 3 34 billion m3 and the surface area of ghy is 67 94 km2 at the normal water level gbz is the reverse regulating hydropower station of ghy with daily regulation ability which has a drainage area of 15 650 km2 with a total storage capacity of 489 million m3 and the surface area of gbz is 31 km2 at the normal water level since the time scale of this study is daily only sby and ghy reservoirs are considered 3 2 data description the basic information and operation data of sby and ghy reservoirs are obtained from hubei energy group co ltd the day index daily inﬂow reservoir water level and outflow of sby and ghy are shown in fig 6 the models are trained by information comprising day index cascade reservoir predicted inflow of the current and the next three days cascade reservoir outflow in the previous day cascade reservoir water level of the previous day and the mean water level of cascade reservoir the day index ranges from 1 to 366 with only one of the 366 inputs corresponding to the current day for example if the date of the day is 10 february the day index is 41 the mean water level is the mean of the operational water level on a daily scale which is an attribute of reservoirs used as static inputs at each time step data division is performed by a five fold cross validation method data normalization is accomplished using min max normalization the normalized equation is as follows 14 x i x i o r i x i min x i max x i min where x i are the standardized values for variables x i o r i are the original values for variables x i min x i max are the minimum and the maximum values of variables respectively 4 results the proposed method was applied to reproduction and prediction scenarios respectively first the simulation results and the evaluation metrics were compared by lstm pg lstm cro and gbrt section 4 1 second the simulation of high intermediate and low outflow was presented to explain how the synthetic samples affected the model performance section 4 2 after that the reduction of the negative flow and the improvement of water balance by physical constraints was clarified section 4 3 finally the applicability of reservoir operation by lstm pg lstm cro and gbrt in the reproduction and prediction scenarios was analyzed section 4 4 4 1 comparison of simulation results of models this section compares the simulation outflow of the cascade reservoir by lstm pg lstm gbrt and cro table 2 summarizes the simulation accuracy of pg lstm compared with the results of lstm gbrt and cro lstm gbrt and cro were trained as the benchmark model as seen from table 1 pg lstm had a higher simulation accuracy in the reproduction scenario in the test period the average nse of the cascade reservoir was 0 54 which was 0 04 0 34 and 0 37 higher than the conventional lstm gbrt and cro models in the prediction scenario the average nse of the cascade reservoir was 0 85 which was 0 01 0 59 and 0 68 higher than the conventional lstm gbrt cro respectively compared with deep learning models the conventional learning models failed to absorb the data of reservoir operation compared with lstm the improvement of pg lstm lied in the physical mechanisms added into the network when the model inputs less information in the reproduction scenario as a novel method the physical constraints and the synthetic samples were added to the lstm network to improve the model performance it is indicated that the physical mechanisms can guide the model when less information is input when the input information increased the knowledge of reservoir operation guided the model less than the scenario with fewer data and information input to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach the simulated outflow distribution of cro lstm pg lstm and gbrt was compared during the test period as shown in fig 7 the distributions of the model results showed concentrated characteristics but the characteristics were not identical the results of the observed outflow lstm pg lstm and gbrt models showed a single peaked distribution shape while the results of cro showed a double peaked distribution shape for outflow less than 2500 m3 s the distributions of lstm and pg lstm results were closer to that of the observed outflow however lstm was difficult to realize the simulation of high flow while pg lstm can enable high flow simulation thus the distribution of pg lstm results was closest to that of the observed outflow meanwhile fig 7a and fig 7b show the consistent model performance in sby and ghy reservoirs therefore only the simulation results of sby were analyzed in detail in the following sections 4 2 effect of synthetic samples based on the design flood in the qj cascade reservoir system the outflow of sby and ghy was in the range of 0 1500 m3 s as can be seen from fig 6 due to the inadequate high inflow of actual operation the existing operating data mostly included reservoir operation behaviors with normal operating conditions it is insufficient to handle the rare and intense flood events one approach to tackle the above problem of imbalanced data is to synthesize the high flow operating cases by calculating the design flood from 20 to 0 01 some high flow samples can be generated as shown in fig 8 gbrt presented poor flow simulation in reproduction and prediction scenarios lstm showed poor flow simulation in the reproduction scenario while the high flow simulation in the prediction scenario was more effective than that of the reproduction scenario by considering the outflow and reservoir water level of the previous day with the simulated peak flow of 2050 m3 s pg lstm can effectively simulate the high flow with the simulated peak flow of 4750 m3 s 4385 m3 s in reproduction and prediction scenarios respectively compared with other models pg lstm was most consistent with the observed value the simulated peak flow of cro was 5940 m3 s and the observed value of peak flow was 4660 m3 s the relative error of cro peak was 0 27 while the relative error of pg lstm peak in reproduction and prediction scenarios was 0 02 and 0 06 respectively thus pg lstm outperformed cro pg lstm outperformed lstm in extracting high flow since the relative error of peak of lstm was larger and the peak flow timing of lstm lagged specifically the relative error of peak was reduced using pg lstm compared with the conventional lstm model the relative error of peak decreased from 0 80 to 0 02 in the reproduction scenario from 0 55 to 0 06 in the prediction scenario the performance of lstm in high flow simulation was poor due to the rarity of high flow samples in the training dataset thus the synthetic high flow samples assist in providing more information for deep learning models however pg lstm was less effective in simulating intermediate low flows as shown in fig 9 after the high flow samples were added to the model training dataset the model paid less attention to the intermediate low flow resulting in the overestimation performance in actual reservoir operations outflow decisions for extreme hydrological conditions are critical for reservoir operation although the addition of design flood operating samples would make the model focus less on the intermediate low flow it is still recommended to add the operating samples of the design flood for the model training 4 3 effect of physical constraints derived from reservoir operation to improve the physical consistency of deep learning networks some physical constraints were added to the loss function as shown in table 3 the mean wbi bias of the qj cascade reservoir for lstm pg lstm gbrt and cro in the reproduction scenario were 0 03 0 01 0 11 and 0 04 which indicated that the water balance of the pg lstm model was more desirable similarly this viewpoint can be drawn from the prediction scenario the conventional lstm for outflow simulation appeared negative flow in the prediction scenario the mean ponf of the qj cascade reservoir for lstm and pg lstm in the prediction scenario were 1 03 and 0 14 respectively the results of ponf suggested that pg lstm can effectively reduce the occurrence of negative flow the results showed that the addition of physical constraints can improve model physical consistency the proposed pg lstm network can decrease the water balance bias and reduce the occurrence of negative flow 4 4 applicability of models in the reproduction and prediction scenarios the trained models were applied to the reproduction and prediction scenarios and the performance of the model was evaluated 4 4 1 reproduction scenario the reproduction of cascade reservoir historical outflow fig 10 is the comparison of the reproduced outflow using lstm pg lstm gbrt and cro after the models extracted the experience of reservoir operators the historical information was applied to the model to obtain outflow reproduced by lstm pg lstm gbrt and cro as can be seen from fig 9 the results of lstm and gbrt cannot accommodate the seasonal variation of reservoir inflow and presented auto correlation characteristics the results of cro were similar to that of pg lstm which meant that pg lstm can infer the rule curves used by reservoir operators the results of pg lstm were better than that of cro for example when the inflow was less than 2500 m3 s pg lstm tended to produce a smaller outflow which was consistent with the operating experience of the qj cascade reservoir operators the reasons for the difference between simulation results of cro and pg lstm can be explained as follows cro is usually used for the preparation of the annual reservoir operating plan which cannot consider the forecast information of inflow resulting in conservative operating decisions according to fig 10 cro tended to release more flow during the flood season to make a safe decision and preferred releasing less outflow to ensure the realization of reservoir functions in the non flood season considering the forecast information of inflow the results of pg lstm were closer to the actual operation than those of cro further the daily reservoir water level and power generation can be obtained by using the simulated outflow of pg lstm with the data of 1 may 1962 to 30 april 1963 as an example the results showed that the total power generation of the operation period of cro for the qj cascade reservoir was 7 60 billion kwh while that of pg lstm was 9 26 billion kwh in contrast the total power generation of the cascade reservoir calculated by the deterministic optimization operation is 9 46 billion kwh indicating that pg lstm can be used as a better benchmark compared with the cro method for evaluation of the optimal operation 4 4 2 prediction scenario the prediction of cascade reservoir outflow with several leading times table 4 shows the nse of sby and ghy outflow simulations as can be seen from table 4 the deep learning model outperformed the extraction of reservoir operation behaviors compared to gbrt and cro as for the deep learning models pg lstm was better than lstm in the three lead times with nse of pg lstm higher than that of lstm in the test period in addition the improvement of nse of pg lstm in the test period was greater as the lead time increased and the improvement percentage of pg lstm to lstm was 4 66 with three days ahead fig 11 is the comparison of the outflow predicted by lstm pg lstm and gbrt with several lead times as can be seen from fig 11 the performance of pg lstm decreased more slowly than lstm and gbrt with the increase of lead times fig 12 shows the results of high flow prediction with several lead times using lstm pg lstm and gbrt from fig 12 it can be seen that there was a serious lag in the predicted outflow of lstm as the lead time increased while pg lstm can still ensure accurate high flow predictions therefore pg lstm is more robust than lstm 5 discussion 5 1 verification of the physical mechanism effects from section 4 it was known that synthetic samples using the design flood operating case improved the peak outflow simulation and the loss function revised by physical constraints enhanced the model physical consistency two new experiments were conducted in section 5 1 in which the above two physical mechanisms were added to lstm separately to verify the effects of the physical mechanism table 5 is the comparison of model performance in extracting cascade reservoir outflow behaviors using different modification ways with lstm table 5 illustrates that adding the operating cases of the design flood can gain higher nse than revising the loss function with physical constraints which meant the former is more conducive to improving the nse of the model however only considering the synthetic samples method cannot fully satisfy the physical constraints of reservoir operation for example the results of lstm with synthetic samples had more negative flow and less water balance satisfaction than pg lstm thus physical constraints are beneficial to limit the solution space consequently two reasons can explain why pg lstm is more effective than lstm in the cascade reservoir operation simulation as follows 1 the design flood operating cases provide knowledge to lstm when the extreme flood occurs 2 the penalty terms constraint the range of outflow and promote the model to better reflect the reservoir operation behaviors the two physical mechanisms one is from the perspective of the domain prior knowledge to guide the model and the other is to realize the guidance of the physical mechanism to the deep learning model by increasing the sample richness such a physical mechanism guided method can be applied to other research areas building loss function or activation function containing domain control equations variable constraints obtaining more training samples from physical models to increase the richness of samples the two physical mechanisms can be used to build physically guided data driven models for different domains 5 2 representation of the hydraulic connection in cascade reservoirs for deep learning models hydraulic connection is a key element in the cascade reservoir operation the proposed models in this study took the cascade reservoir as a whole in which the model inputs were the inflow of the upstream reservoir the local flow between cascade reservoir etc and outputs were the outflow of each reservoir in the cascade reservoir in this way the hydraulic connection has been considered in the loss function of pg lstm when the model simultaneously outputs the outflow of sby and ghy thus the hydraulic connection between the upstream and downstream reservoir can be explicitly included in the proposed model a new experiment experiment 2 was added in section 5 2 to compare the original experiment experiment 1 the new experiment separated the reservoirs of the cascade reservoir to obtain the outflow of the single reservoir and the hydraulic connection was calculated step by step from upstream to downstream the comparative analysis of simulation results of experiment 1 and experiment 2 was as follows 5 2 1 experiment 1 a cascade reservoir mode in experiment 1 the hydraulic connection was presented in the loss function the results of experiment 1 have been shown in table 2 and table 3 the models took the information of cascade reservoir for instance the inflow of sby local flow between sby and ghy etc as the input and output the outflow of sby and ghy simultaneously 5 2 2 experiment 2 a single reservoir mode in experiment 2 models were applied independently to each reservoir and the hydraulic connection was calculated step by step from upstream to downstream based on the simulated outflow of the upstream reservoir the hydraulic connection can be formulated as follows 15 i g h y t i s b y g h y t q ˆ s b y t where i g h y t is the inflow of ghy i s b y g h y t is the local flow between sby and ghy q ˆ s b y t is the simulated outflow of sby the models for sby only input the operational information of sby and output sby outflow similarly the models for ghy input the operational information of ghy specifically the inflow of ghy was calculated according to eq 15 and then ghy models output the outflow of ghy from table 6 it can be seen that experiment 1 and experiment 2 have similar nse performance in the test period as pg lstm that listed in table 7 experiment 1 obtains a better physical consistency with ponf of 0 14 and wbi bias of 0 01 in the prediction scenario while that of experiment 2 is 0 21 and 0 01 respectively because experiment 1 owns better physical consistency and can output the outflow of the cascade reservoir simultaneously the model structure of experiment 1 is recommended in this study 6 conclusion this study investigated the effectiveness of pg lstm to extract cascade reservoir operation behaviors the simulation accuracy and physical consistency of pg lstm were evaluated in reproduction and prediction scenarios the main conclusions are as follows 1 this study provides a reservoir operation behavior mining method which can be used for two scenarios one is to reproduce the historical cascade reservoir outflow with significant seasonal variations and the other is to predict the outflow with several lead times without lags 2 to achieve accurate simulation of reservoir operators experience physical mechanisms of reservoir operation are integrated into lstm the proposed physical mechanism of reservoir operation comprises two parts one is to add the design flood operating samples into the training dataset of lstm the other is to utilize the water balance equation the monotonic relationship between inflow and outflow and the boundary constraint of outflow 3 considering the operating samples based on the design flood and the historical operation data as the model training dataset pg lstm can enhance the understanding of lstm for the operation behaviors under extreme hydrological conditions with more accurate high flow simulation moreover using the water balance constraint boundary constraints and monotonic constraint can help pg lstm effectively reduce the occurrence of the negative flow and decrease the bias of the water balance index making the mining operation behavior more consistent with the basic principles of reservoir operation overall compared with lstm gbrt and cro pg lstm can improve nse of cascade reservoir during the test period from 0 50 0 20 0 17 to 0 54 in the reproduction scenario and from 0 84 0 26 and 0 17 to 0 85 in the prediction scenario with five fold cross validation method the proposed pg lstm is helpful to describe human operation behaviors which is capable of providing benefits for cascade reservoir operations and changing the situation that reservoir operation depends on manual experience further research should concentrate on expanding the employment of physically guided data

8042,study region water sampling for stable isotopes 18o and 2h was carried out during 2009 2019 across alberta canada as part of a survey targeting 1022 open water wetlands the study presents the first site specific wetland water balance assessment spanning grassland parkland foothills mountains and boreal regions including the oil sands region a corridor of rapid development study focus climate reanalysis watershed data and isotopic data for wetlands were incorporated into a steady state isotope mass balance model and applied to estimate site specific evaporation losses from the wetlands as well as runoff groundwater inflow total outflow and seasonal drawdown regional scale water balance fluxes water balance indicators and site specific classifications were mapped and described new hydrological insights for the region systematic variations in evaporation losses watershed runoff to wetlands wetland discharge and net groundwater inflow are revealed across the major subregions of alberta including the oil sands region isotope balance calculations suggest that 13 of wetlands are predominantly evaporative 87 have surface and or groundwater outflow 90 have positive water yields 47 likely have groundwater inflow and 2 are apparently fed by allochthonous water sources either snow or glacial melt for the 3 oil sands regions a scoping survey suggests that between 20 and 40 of wetlands within the bitumen zones are detectably groundwater reliant compared to 35 50 in the wider vicinity of the deposits keywords stable isotopes water balance wetlands evaporation runoff groundwater 1 introduction wetlands are vital elements of water and biogeochemical cycles in natural watersheds of western canada supporting habitat for microbes plants insects amphibians reptiles birds fish mammals and an array of valuable ecosystem services to society including recreation improvement of water quality carbon sequestration erosion drought and flood control regulation of seasonal low flows and mitigation of interannual and long term climate changes intensive and extensive anthropogenic activities including urbanization agriculture mining and oil and gas development have led to degradation and loss of natural wetlands worldwide including within alberta roy et al 2018 approximately 20 000 km2 or 14 4 of the rapidly developing alberta oil sands region aosr has some evidence of human footprint eaton and charette 2017 in addition up to 70 of wetlands have been lost due to various land use activities in the grassland parkland regions of alberta roy et al 2018 despite the recognized ecological value of wetlands relatively few quantitative studies have been conducted to characterize the role of wetlands in the regional water balance the degree to which wetlands are under the direct influence of groundwater the magnitude of groundwater recharge or discharge from wetlands and the relative importance of wetland storage among the many sources feeding river discharge remain to be widely studied in detail at the local and regional scale such factors are particularly important for predicting broader impacts on the water cycle from land use impacts and climatic change especially in regions under rapid development such as the aosr oil sands development including mining and in situ extraction of bitumen has accelerated over the past 30 years in wetland rich regions of the province including the athabasca cold lake and peace river regions fig 1 characterizing and mitigating anthropogenic impacts to wetlands in these areas is of primary concern to joint federal provincial monitoring and research organizations as well as policy makers this study focuses on characterization of water balance in a representative 20 km x 20 km gridded network of open water wetland sites across alberta operated by the alberta biodiversity monitoring institute abmi a not for profit publicly funded multi sector research alliance organization while the network was created and is largely maintained for the purpose of monitoring biodiversity and habitat changes water samples have been collected for stable isotope analysis of 2h and 18o as part of a joint program with innotech alberta for the specific purpose of investigating water balance processes and the relationships between hydrology vegetation and ecosystems to date water samples have been obtained from 1022 out of 1656 sites or roughly 2 3 of sites spanning the province s 662 583 km2 open water wetlands were selected among the common wetland types in alberta bog fen marsh open water swamp aep 2020 as they occurred in all ecoregions across the province including grassland parkland foothills rocky mountains and boreal forest groundwater reliance is an important unknown for open water wetlands both shallow and deep groundwaters are potential inflow sources and outflow sinks for these ecosystems based on previous hydrologic investigations deep groundwater sources may include discharge from saline formations which manifest as localized springs or broader seepage zones especially within the hyporheic zone or along incised river valleys of the lower athabasca region jasechko et al 2012 gue et al 2015 birks et al 2018 deep groundwater may also flow along structural or geological contacts such as the devonian prairie evaporite salt dissolution collapse breccia zone broughton 2013 which serve as preferred pathways for deep groundwater to enter surface water bodies in northeastern alberta including along the clearwater river and lower athabasca rivers seeps and springs are typically found to be glaciogenic which has been inferred from geochemical and isotopic fingerprints grasby and chen 2005 birks et al 2019 these waters are distinct from deep basin brines typical of southerly and westerly strata of the alberta basin which are thought to be associated with buried seawater connolly et al 1990b overall shallow aquifer sources within unconsolidated sediments and or till which often closely resemble the isotopic composition of modern precipitation are expected to be more important and more ubiquitous sources to wetlands buried channels which are abundant in many areas of alberta may also be influential in controlling groundwater exchange with lakes and rivers andriashek and atkinson 2007 alberta geological survey 2021 in the boreal forest region shallow bedrock is dominated by cretaceous sandstone and shales including the bituminous mcmurray formation in the athabasca region the gething and bluesky formations in the peace region and the clearwater formation in the cold lake region which overlie more permeable devonian strata comprised largely of carbonates and evaporites surface mining of bitumen is confined to 20 of the athabasca deposit where the bitumen zone occurs at less than 60 m below surface whereas bitumen extraction in all other deep seated zones within the deposit utilizes various in situ technologies mahaffey and dubé 2016 several regional plateaus within the boreal plains region including the stony muskeg birch and caribou mountains are underlain by impermeable shales and are dominated by thin tills with extensive bog formation topographically driven flows from these plateaus to adjacent lowlands are prevalent barson et al 2001 the parkland region tends to have moderately thick overburden with relatively impermeable bedrock grasslands are similar to parklands but semi arid with depression focused recharge occurring only during spring melt rocky mountain areas especially sediment filled river valleys are important recharge zones whereas thin overburden in the foothills region tends to limit the scale of aquifers although gravel deposits or interconnected tills may form important local water sources for some wetlands the stable isotope surveys by abmi were conducted over a decade from 2009 to 2019 during field visits to the sites and analyses were performed by innotech alberta within two months of the date of water collection although this inventory also facilitates regional comparisons between hydrologic indicators and physical chemical and biological properties of wetlands in the province this paper focuses on hydrology and water balance thus far there has been considerable interest in this dataset from the abmi alberta environment parks aep the oil sands monitoring program osm and environment climate change canada eccc with potential applications of the dataset or isotope mass balance synthesis products for a evaluating site specific wetland water balance b examining wetland dependence on groundwater c assessing streamflow dependence on wetlands d understanding relationships between plant community characteristics and associations with wetland water balance e and for investigating the regional impacts and sustainability of bitumen extraction and related activities in the peace athabasca and cold lake oil sands regions the potential to use isotopic indicators to examine and monitor the underlying causes of change in water quality and quantity such as changes in water sources and or water balance associated with land cover and climate change is of paramount interest to these organizations isotope tracers have been widely utilized in hydrological studies in canada including studies of lakes rivers and watershed hydrology gibson et al 2005 2020 birks and gibson 2009 2021 the evaporation process is traceable owing to enrichment of the heavy isotopologues 1h1h18o 1h2h16o compared to the common isotopologue 1h1h16o in the residual liquid due to fractionation by diffusion through the atmospheric boundary layer horita et al 2008 a number of recent studies have demonstrated the value of isotopes for quantifying water balance of natural lakes in a wide variety of settings including boreal arctic prairie and coastal areas pham et al 2012 arnoux et al 2017 wan et al 2020 gibson et al 2016a 2017 2018 2019a 2019b these studies were also successful in capturing altered water balances associated with operation of artificial recharge galleries masse dufresne et al 2020 and mine tailings ponds baer et al 2016 chad et al in press while several studies have used isotopes to determine contribution of wetland runoff to river discharge including st amour et al 2005 and gibson et al 2016c relatively few studies have directly assessed water budgets of wetlands bam and ireson 2019 a subset of the 18o data reported here was previously used to explore statistical relationships between hydrologic setting and plant communities in grassland parkland areas roy et al 2018 although the dataset has not otherwise been used for water balance assessment we recognized a unique opportunity to leverage the wetland isotope dataset to inform several provincial monitoring scientific objectives which help to fill gaps in understanding of the role of wetlands in regional runoff relationships between water balance and vegetation communities and the impact of disturbances of different kinds and magnitude on water balance and vegetation communities quantitative interpretation of the isotopic dataset allows for assessment and mapping of hydrological indicators and site by site water balance classifications which are expected to serve as a first demonstration of the regional scale impact attribution capabilities of the method once systematic isotopic enrichment signals were confirmed from abmi open water wetlands across the province our initial hypothesis was that water balance was mainly responding to regional climatic drivers including precipitation evaporation evapotranspiration humidity and temperature but with secondary influences arising from local factors such as land cover and landscape position overall differences between ecoregions were anticipated which we demonstrate in the results and discussion but the analysis offers a novel perspective including some unanticipated results of water balance variations in wetlands on the regional and provincial scale 2 method 2 1 study sites study sites across the province of alberta are shown in fig 1 while the precise geographic location of abmi monitoring sites is maintained as confidential to protect the integrity of the sites and its landowners the sites were originally selected by abmi based on nearest neighbor to a pre defined 20 km grid which is publicly available public coordinates can be used to identify the site locations to within a radius of 10 km from the precise geographic coordinate so that resolution remains only slightly reduced but still is quite useful for capturing regional scale patterns wetlands are defined by abmi as water bodies with an open surface area of between 1 and 100 ha with a maximum depth between 0 5 and 2 m and a low probability of complete water evaporation within or between years i e they are permanent wetlands to be selected for study a wetland also had to support a well developed zone of wetland vegetation so that plants could be sampled effectively the abmi s wetland selection criteria did not preclude human created or modified wetlands 2 2 climate data climate parameters were obtained from the north american regional reanalysis narr dataset mesinger et al 2006 gridded 32 km monthly climate data 2009 2019 were extracted for the grid cells corresponding to the location of each of the abmi sampling sites the parameters extracted included i total precipitation at surface mm yr 1 ii total evaporation at surface mm yr 1 iii 2 m relative humidity and iv 2 m temperature k raw data were averaged and evaporation flux weighted so that water balance calculations were representative of the open water evaporation season see gibson et al 2019a 2 3 watershed and open water delineations application of the isotope mass balance imb model required delineation of watershed areas wetland areas and wetland elevations for each of the abmi sampling locations this information was derived from digital elevation model data individual watersheds were delineated in the arcgis program using the archydro tools and hydrographic and elevation datasets then were used to depict wetland outlet locations the planimetric areas of both the wetland and watershed polygons were calculated in arcgis land cover classification was based on alberta biodiversity monitoring institute 2013 water balance indicator rasters were created using the spatial analyst kriging tool in esri arcgis version 10 7 1 cell size was set to 5000 m and all other tool defaults were retained the kriging method was ordinary and used the spherical semi variogram model each raster cell was interpolated using 12 variable points 2 4 water sampling and isotopic analysis water samples were collected in 30 ml high density polyethylene bottles by abmi field staff during 2009 2019 typically in mid summer june or july using field protocols developed by innotech alberta and widely used in previous isotope based assessments in the region see gibson et al 2019a repeat sampling where conducted was carried out in subsequent years within 2 weeks of prior year visits to each site samples were returned to the laboratory refrigerated and analyzed within 3 months of collection using a thermo scientific delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were analyzed on separate subsamples with oxygen determined by equilibration with carbon dioxide using a gasbench ii paul and skrzypek 2006 and hydrogen determined by injection of water on hot chromium using an h device reactor brand et al 1996 results are reported in δ notation in permil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and normalized to the smow slap scale where slap is standard light arctic precipitation nelson 2000 analytical uncertainty predicted based on 2 σ of repeats is 0 0 09 for δ18o n 159 and 0 52 for δ2h n 160 2 5 isotopic characterization of precipitation and atmospheric vapour isotopic composition of precipitation was estimated from time series ensembles 2009 2019 using a modified version of the model of delavau et al 2015 that included δ2h for all narr coordinates falling within the canadian landmass from which climate data for alberta sites were extracted the regression based model relied mainly on monthly data collected by the canadian network for isotopes in precipitation cnip birks and gibson 2009 the united states network for isotopes in precipitation usnip welker 2012 and global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea wmo 2014 amount weighted annual values for δ18o in precipitation were calculated as the dot product of the sequence of monthly isotopic values and precipitation amounts divided by the total precipitation isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture was estimated using the precipitation equilibrium assumption gibson et al 2008 1 δ a δ p ε α where ε is the equilibrium water vapour isotope separation horita and wesolowski 1994 and α decimal notation is the equilibrium isotopic fractionation where these quantities are related by ε 10 3 α 1 to account for seasonally variable conditions under which evaporation takes place the exchange terms in eq 1 were evaluated on a monthly time step and evaporation flux weighted for each grid point evaporation flux weighting was achieved by computing the dot product of the sequence of monthly δa outputs from eq 1 and monthly evaporation divided by the total evaporation similar calculations were made to estimate evaporation flux weighted temperature and relative humidity at 2 m atmospheric height 2 6 water and isotope mass balance the site specific water balance of each open water wetland was evaluated based on the balance between water inputs i water outputs q and evaporation e which regulate long term wetland volumetric changes d v d t according to 2 d v d t i q e m 3 considering that inputs included precipitation on the lake p surface runoff to the wetland from the watershed r o and groundwater input to the wetland g w i n and outputs included surface outflow s w o u t and groundwater discharge g w o u t the wetland water balance as illustrated in fig 2 can be expressed as 3 d v d t p r o g w i n s w o u t g w o u t e m 3 which for the case of hydrologic steady state simplifies to 3a p r o g w i n s w o u t g w o u t e 0 m 3 a first approximation of surface runoff to the wetland was estimated from the precipitation minus evapotranspiration deficit 4 r o p w e t w m 3 where p w is precipitation on the watershed and e t w is evapotranspiration from the watershed while this relationship is approximate as ro may also include shallow subsurface flow from the surrounding watershed it was tested and found to be a useful indicator of surface reliant wetlands as compared to groundwater reliant wetlands the latter likely receiving excess input from recharge outside the immediate catchment area or from deep seated groundwater sources note that in the case of vertical fluxes derived from climate data volumes are calculated based on the annual equivalent depths whereby 5 p p l a m 3 6 e e l a m 3 7 p w p w a m 3 8 e t w e t w a m 3 where l a is lake area m2 w a is watershed area not including the wetland itself m2 p is precipitation depth m e is open water evaporation depth m and e t is evapotranspiration depth m similarly we denote other depth equivalent variables including i runoff r o r o w a 1 ii groundwater inflow g w i n g w i n d b a 1 and iii total discharge q s w o u t g w o u t d b a 1 where drainage basin area d b a l a w a isotope mass balance imb was applied to the open water wetlands based on the methodology of gibson et al 2016b similar approaches have been applied for lake water balance assessments in alberta wolfe et al 2007 gibson et al 2019a 2019b and elsewhere in western canada gibson et al 2017 2018 wan et al 2020 isotope based evaporation inflow x for the wetlands was calculated as follows 9 x e i δ i δ l δ e δ l u n i t l e s s where δ i is the mean weighted isotopic value of input i i e a weighted mixture of isotope values in precipitation δ p runoff δ r o and groundwater inflow δ g w i n and δ l is the mean isotopic value of the wetland water body assumed to be well mixed such that it is also representative of liquid outflows δout including potential surface water and groundwater outflows q o u t g w o u t δ e is the mean weighted isotope value for evaporation from the wetland water body which we evaluate using a simplified craig and gordon 1965 model approach given by gibson et al 2016b as 10 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k where δ l and δ a are isotopic compositions of the wetland water body and ambient atmospheric moisture respectively h is ambient relative humidity decimal fraction and ε k is the kinetic contribution to the liquid vapour isotopic separation in horita et al 2008 these terms were also evaporation flux weighted due to lack of site specific isotopic data on watershed runoff and groundwater sources at each site we assumed that the isotopic composition of inflow was well characterized by that of precipitation i e δ i δ p this approach has been applied successfully in other assessments within alberta e g gibson et al 2016a 2020 and is most applicable for headwater catchments wherein runoff and groundwater are non evaporated and derived from local precipitation sources the simplification of δ o u t δ l is supported by our observations in previous studies that small shallow open water wetlands are typically well mixed in summer substitution of δ e into eq 9 then yields 11 x δ l δ i m δ δ l u n i t l e s s where 12 m h 10 3 ε k ε α 1 h 10 3 ε k u n i t l e s s and 13 δ h δ a ε k ε α h 10 3 ε k ε α isotope based evaporation loss x evaluated from eq 11 can then substituted into the steady state wetland water balance given in eq 3a 14 x e p r o g w i n u n i t l e s s for this assessment we make use of climatological data via eq 4 to estimate watershed runoff r o as a metric to evaluate whether a wetland is sustained largely by runoff from its local watershed i e fed by local precipitation recharge here termed surface water reliant or whether a water balance deficit exists requiring additional water input to account for ro deficits this additional water is g w i n estimated by rearranging eq 14 to obtain 15 g w i n e x p r o x m 3 which represents groundwater inflow that may derive from deep sources or from outside of the topographically defined catchment as would be the case for regional groundwater flows several scenarios are observed for sustainable wetlands including i surface water reliant wetlands where r o 0 g w i n 0 ii groundwater reliant wetlands where g w i n 0 iii wetlands within disconnected watersheds where r o 0 and g w i n 0 note that wetlands may be both groundwater reliant and situated within disconnected watersheds as is the case for many wetlands across much of the grassland region there are also 30 sites 2 9 in our analysis that yielded unrealistically large g w i n estimates that appear to exceed potential groundwater input volumes these sites are found to be mainly located along glacial meltwater channel deposits or flood prone areas near river channels as for the peace athabasca delta region for context it is important to note that in previous applications of the isotope balance method for lakes in alberta ro and g w i n were left undifferentiated and referred to as water yield see gibson et al 2019a the current approach was introduced here as a first approximation method for differentiating surface versus groundwater dependency of wetlands because liquid outflows occuring from the wetland by either surface or groundwater pathways are isotopically indiscernible these fluxes cannot be separately resolved by the isotope balance as a result water outputs including s w o u t and g w o u t remain grouped as q in our analysis where 16 q 1 x i m 3 while it is possible to identify occurrence of surface outflow based on air photo or satellite imagery interpretation and thereby eliminate swout from the balance when not present such an analysis has not yet been conducted we note another potentially useful isotope based water balance indicator discharge inflow a k a throughput defined as 16a q i 1 x u n i t l e s s which we apply along with evaporation inflow x to illustrate broad trends in water balance across the province due to the shallowness of some open water wetlands included in the survey a simple correction for the isotopic effect of volumetric reduction was applied which describes water bodies where drawdown is controlled by evaporation d v d t e the initial isotopic composition δ 0 was estimated by 17 δ 0 δ l δ 1 f m f m where seasonal volumetric drawdown was characterized by 18 f d d e u n i t l e s s and d is the mean water depth measured in each open water wetland at the time of sampling implementation of this correction required that δ 0 from eq 17 be used in place of δ l in eq 10 and eq 11 a similar approximation was recently applied for estimating water balance of tundra lakes with measurable seasonal drawdown wan et al 2020 note that the volume of water required to refill the wetland to account for seasonal drawdown was also added to the estimate of g w i n calculated from eq 15 although groundwater reliant wetlands tended to have reduced seasonal drawdown as compared to many surface water reliant wetlands 3 results and discussion 3 1 isotope characteristics of precipitation and open water wetlands wetland surface waters were found to be differentially enriched in 18o and 2h consistent with the effect of isotopic fractionation of water during evaporation under variable wetland water balance conditions as noted in numerous previous studies of canadian surface waters see gibson et al 2016b in dual isotope space δ18o vs δ2h fig 3 the isotopic composition of precipitation at abmi sites is shown to plot close to the canadian meteoric water line cmwl see gibson et al 2020 with precipitation values for individual sites ranging from 23 25 to 15 74 in δ18o 177 26 to 117 90 for δ2h as influenced by climate including mean annual temperature and continentality of each site in contrast open water wetlands are found to plot below the cmwl along an evaporation line with a slope close to 5 and individual wetlands are found to be enriched to varying degrees fig 3 isotope values for open water wetlands ranged from 22 53 to 2 25 for δ18o and 173 54 to 60 0 for δ2h with offset between wetland water and precipitation at some sites reaching as high as 16 64 for δ18o and 78 15 for δ2h similar isotopic enrichment ranges have been reported in regional lake surveys in central and northern alberta wolfe et al 2007 gibson et al 2016a 2019a note that water balance was not calculated for open water wetlands sites that were found to have depleted isotopic values relative to precipitation by up to 3 5 in δ18o and 27 for δ2h indicating that the current water balance model framework was not valid for these sites potentially this may have been due to systematic error in precipitation model estimates or may alternately reflect the presence of water derived from allochthonous sources i e sources other than modern precipitation recharged within the delineated watershed of the wetland the sites in question are classified mapped and discussed later on 3 2 climate data landscape runoff and individual water fluxes histograms showing distributions of depth equivalent values of precipitation evaporation and evapotranspiration used in the analysis are shown in fig 4 as well as watershed runoff calculated by eq 4 isotope based estimates of groundwater inflow based on eq 15 and total outflow based on eq 16 precipitation i e long term annual values ranged from 360 to 890 mm average 550 mm and evaporation ranged from 280 to 400 mm average 206 mm both with relatively symmetrical distributions fig 4 evapotranspiration ranged from 54 to 590 mm averaging 400 mm and runoff ranged up to 594 mm averaging 147 mm with less regular distributions we note that wetlands in the grassland region tend to have higher evapotranspiration than precipitation and therefore yield negative runoff according to eq 4 which is a strong indication of non contributing areas or watershed disconnection calculated groundwater inflow which together with runoff forms the total water yield to the wetlands is shown to be positively skewed as is the total estimated outflow similar skewed distributions have been found in previous water yield surveys using isotopes across western canada see gibson et al 2018 the current imb approach improves upon previous approaches as use of eq 4 to estimate surface runoff allows for a first order partitioning of surface and groundwater inputs as for outflows we point out again that partitioning of surface and groundwater discharges are not possible as the isotopic response in the wetland is equivalent and indistinguishable for both flow pathways 3 3 latitudinal variations latitudinal variations in water balance fluxes illustrate the extent of climate driven variability across alberta fig 5 mid latitude peaks in runoff are driven by gradients in precipitation combined with more subdued gradients in evaporation and evapotranspiration note that the resulting groundwater inflows and outflow show no obvious latitudinal patterns but rather appear in some high throughput cases to be directly coupled this would be expected for example in floodplain wetlands along river channels which are dominated by flushing combination of these individual water fluxes to assess systematic variations in site to site water balance is discussed below and then is applied to classify wetlands according to dominant water balance features 3 4 water balance indicators evaporation loss and throughput were calculated for the abmi open water wetlands based on eqs 11 and 16a respectively allowing for characterization of province wide variations in water balance the ratio of precipitation derived inputs was also calculated based on the approach developed by wan et al 2019 but did not significantly improve upon the other indicators at the provincial or regional scale basic maps showing variations in the indicators fig 6 revealed significant site to site differences depicting a patchwork of complex water balance sub regions across the province notably evaporative zones fig 6a are well delineated based on evaporation inflow whereas high throughflow high runoff areas are most visible based on the discharge inflow indicator fig 6b the latter type are found in association with topographic highs in particular the mountains and foothills regions as well as regional upland plateaus in the oil sands region including the caribou mountains and birch mountains both situated northwest of fort mcmurray the muskeg mountains situated northeast of fort mcmurray and the thickwood pelican martenhills situated west and southwest of fort mcmurray fig 6b regional plateaus within the grasslands region including cypress hills rolling sand hills and waterton lakes area are also visible as higher throughflow higher runoff zones fig 6b wetlands in these areas appear to be robustly connected to the regional drainage networks low runoff areas visible as light green coloured areas on the discharge inflow map fig 6b demark areas where open water wetlands have lower throughputs and so appear to be more tenuously connected to the regional runoff these areas include low lying areas along the peace river athabasca river valley beaver river north saskatchewan river and the battle river internally within these areas are situated many endorheic areas mostly individual sites where very evaporative low discharge conditions are evident mainly visible as dark blue areas on the evaporation inflow map fig 6a or as tan coloured specks on the discharge inflow map fig 6b while regional patterns are clear we also presume that characteristics such as landscape position may exert important influences on water balance of open water bodies at individual sites as observed in previous field studies e g devito et al 2005 2017 one of the most evaporative areas appears to be along the prairie grassland fringe where evaporation inflow is found to approach or exceed 100 dark colours fig 6a surficial and bedrock geology presence of peatlands permafrost river floodplain settings and proximity to incised and buried channels are also expected to be influential andriashek and atkinson 2007 gibson et al 2019b further classification of the water balance is explored in the following section based on site specific characteristics such as distribution of wetlands with volumetric drawdown and through closer examination of inflow and outflow partitioning 3 5 water balance classification 3 5 1 sites with volumetric reduction wetlands with significant volumetric drawdown were distinguished initially based on evaporation inflow x greater than 100 in the pre calibrated model these wetlands are shown generally to cluster in the parkland region northern grassland region near the southern boreal parkland transition and in the peace lowland fig 7a such conditions appear to be generally less common moving northward along diminishing evaporation gradients while it was initially surprising to find that volume reduction appeared less frequently in the semi arid grassland region we attribute this result to better groundwater connectivity in these areas which appears to be prerequisite to wetland permanence an important site selection factor which likely was influential in this climate zone we note a high degree of similarity between spatial distribution of wetlands with apparent volumetric reduction based on isotopes fig 7a and spatial distributions of volume surface area and number of geographically isolated wetlands across alberta as identified by cui et al 2021 3 5 2 sites with allochthonous sources our imb model is applied to quantify the site specific water balance scaled primarily using the degree of evaporative isotopic enrichment attained by open water wetlands compared to local precipitation across the abmi sampling network a total of 30 open water wetlands 2 of sites were found to be model outliers having wetland isotope values that were depleted relative to predicted precipitation isotope values at the site systematic distribution of these sites within the province mainly along the rocky mountain foothills region fig 7b may suggest that the delavau et al 2015 model underestimated the commonly observed altitude effect of isotopes in precipitation dansgaard 1964 or more likely that wetlands were receiving water from higher altitude areas outside the topographically delineated catchment such occurrences have been noted previously in alpine regions where bedrock layers may extend beyond topographic boundaries cochand et al 2019 wetland landscapes often originate as discharge from springs at the base of talus slopes which can store large amounts of groundwater christensen et al 2020 in some cases accounting for more than 75 of annual streamflow clow et al 2003 evaporation in such systems is often minor and suspended groundwater storage i e storage and seasonal redistribution of snow and glacial melt may cause extended freshet recessions dominating the hydrograph throughout the summer period cochand et al 2019 it is important to note that meltwater which may contain glacial melt and permafrost thaw derived from precipitation falling under colder climate conditions as during the last glaciation may also be influential in some watersheds while we can reasonably presume that these sites have distinct water balance properties reflecting alpine or sub alpine conditions the imb model would require input sources to be better defined which would require additional sampling and site specific ground truthing to be quantitatively applied at these sites 3 5 3 inflow partitioning runoff to wetlands approximated from eq 4 was found to be positive for 90 of sites with 10 of sites having a long term runoff deficit the latter sites are generally clustered in the grassland region which is known to frequently have watersheds with partial area contributions where large areas of the watershed may become disconnected from regional drainage networks and where wetlands typically occupy low lying areas or depressions such wetlands are typically connected to large areas of the watershed only during the snowmelt period costa et al 2020 groundwater inflow was found to be important for 47 of wetland sites fig 7c and based on the imb results we conclude is essential for maintaining wetlands in the grassland region cyan highlighted area fig 7c examples of such wetlands which may in some cases be temporary or semi permanent have been described in previous studies as groundwater wetland ecosystems or prairie potholes van der kamp and hayashi 2009 sloan 1972 while all open water wetlands in the southeastern grasslands region appear to be reliant upon groundwater mainly driven by climatic factors i e high evaporative demand there are some wetlands in the parkland region boreal region and peace lowland areas that also appear to be reliant upon groundwater and some that are not differentiation of these wetland types provides clear targets for further map analysis as well as for site specific investigations into water balance controls and related mechanisms among important local controls are relief surficial and bedrock geology permafrost thaw presence of peatlands landscape position and proximity to incised and buried channels as noted previously for the boreal forest region the role of groundwater appears to vary significantly from site to site even among nearby wetlands it is important to note that classification of wetlands according to inflow mechanisms should be regarded as a first approximation and does not preclude that groundwater exchange may be occurring at certain times of year though to a much lesser degree even for surface water reliant sites the classification should be viewed as a water balance constraint on whether surface or groundwater sources are the most significant determinant of the long term water balance 3 5 4 outflow partitioning wetlands were also differentiated based on dominant water loss mechanisms fig 7d the main mechanisms being evaporation and liquid outflow the latter comprised of surface and or groundwater discharge lakes that are predominantly evaporative are highlighted in light blue fig 7d based on imb these wetlands do not appear to have significant liquid outflows such wetlands analogous to evaporation pans that lose water principally by evaporation generally occur in local clusters or as individual sites scattered widely across the province evaporative lakes which account for 13 of total sites appear to be more common in the western part of the grassland region and in the southern boreal parkland transition overlapping with areas where volumetric reduction is also detected this consistency supports the conclusion that these sites are evaporation driven the majority of wetlands scattered across the province 87 lose water by both evaporation and some form of liquid outflow unfortunately from imb evidence alone we cannot differentiate the liquid outflow mechanism as both surface outflow and subsurface outflow are isotopically non fractionating as noted previously identification of surface outflows may be possible from further air photo or satellite based analysis which remains a planned future activity 4 discussion 4 1 regional water balance trends broad trends in wetland water balance discernable from the imb on the provincial and regional scale appear consistent with many features of wetlands lakes and watersheds observed previously based on hydrologic field studies and modelling the disconnection of wetlands detected in endorheic zones within the grassland region and generally weaker connection between wetlands and large southern rivers are broadly consistent with the description of these areas as non effective drainages by wolfe et al 2019 non effective drainage area defined as the difference between the gross and effective watershed area has been found to be a reliable index of the hydrological dynamics across the region shook and pomeroy 2012 studies of prairie potholes by van der kamp and hayashi 2009 shook and pomeroy 2011 and others have also shown that potholes located in smaller depressions are largely dependent on snowmelt or shallow groundwater and may completely dry up seasonally or during times of drought however a class of larger semi permanent wetlands has also been described wolfe et al 2019 which we suggest are similar to many of the abmi wetlands in this region which were screened to remove non permanent sites based on our analysis these sites appear to have sustained groundwater inputs on which they rely clusters of surface water reliant wetlands are also found in the grassland region although these appear to be associated with regional uplands such as the cypress hills which were found to support higher watershed runoffs see fig 6b a transition to more surface water reliant sites is evident along northern and western fringes of the grassland region where ro deficits subside although groundwater reliant sites are still predicted to be numerous the parkland region has previously been described as a lake rich region with high potential for evaporative isotopic enrichment and low runoff including some areas with negative water yields i e non effective drainages wolfe et al 2019 based on an imb assessment and statistical analysis of 50 lake watershed systems spanning the region higher runoff to lakes was found to be linked in general to higher percentage of wetlands gibson et al 2016a in some cases higher inflow may also reflect buried channel interaction baker et al 2017 in that study groundwater was estimated to account for approximately 40 of inflow to sylvan lake 52 35 n 114 2 w which is among the deepest lakes in the region mean depth of 9 6 m described as having an anomalously high degree of groundwater connectivity compared to other lakes based on results from these previous studies we posit that water depth is an important control on groundwater interaction for open water bodies such that wetlands 2 m depth are likely to have weaker connections to groundwater than most lakes the water balance results for abmi wetlands in the region reveal that sites are approximately divided between surface water and groundwater reliant sites and roughly divided between evaporation dominated and discharge dominated sites many wetlands have isotopic enrichment levels suggesting evaporative seasonal drawdown which is consistent with recent findings for shallow lakes in the region based on imb gibson et al 2016a water yield to wetlands in both grassland and parkland sites is significantly lower than for mountains foothills and boreal regions consistent with estimates by kienzle and mueller 2013 the rocky mountains and foothills regions characterized by alpine and sub alpine conditions respectively have been described as the hydrologic apex of north america and source regions for many of alberta s large rivers rood et al 2008 our finding of the occurrence of a significant number of wetlands potentially receiving allochthonous inputs and the dominance of wetlands with high throughflow and lower evaporation are expected considering the topographic gradients and other factors mentioned previously cochand et al 2019 the boreal forest region is dominated by low lying wetland rich terrain interspersed with regional uplands that drive topographically driven groundwater flows barson et al 2001 regional groundwater flows often saline flow eastward from the rocky mountains and enter the incised river valleys of the lower peace and athabasca rivers incised river channels and buried valleys as well as occurrence of impermeable bedrock salt dissolution features sinkholes and complex fault networks create complex conditions for surface groundwater interaction birks et al 2018 2019 our imb assessment suggests that wetlands in the region are commonly losing water by evaporation and both surface and or subsurface discharge they are less prone to seasonal drawdown than wetlands in the parkland or grasslands region and they are divided almost equally between surface water and groundwater reliant types considerable site to site variations are consistent with previous field studies that have shown hydrogeological setting landscape position and watershed morphometry to be influential in determining the water balance of lakes and wetlands devito et al 2017 gibson et al 2019a lake hydrology has been reported to be strongly influenced by wetland cover type and extent prepas et al 2001 in some typical examples lakes have also been found to be moderately reliant on groundwater in regional uplands schmidt et al 2008 although deeply incised rivers are known to be the focal points of regional groundwater inflow birks et al 2018 further discussion of wetland conditions the oil sands region is provided below 4 2 alberta oil sands region wetlands evidently play key roles in the alberta oil sands region including water storage filtration flood control carbon and nutrient sequestration as well as sustaining unique vegetation communities and wildlife habitat volik et al 2020 understanding the water balance of wetlands including distribution and degree of surface groundwater interaction and groundwater reliance and relationship to geomorphic and geologic controls is an important prerequisite to understanding and predicting how wetland ecosystems may be affected by cumulative development activities from the abmi dataset comparisons of the inflow partitioning status of open water wetlands in the peace river athabasca and cold lake oil sands districts reveals significant regional differences in the numbers and proportions of surface versus groundwater reliant types fig 8 this initial scoping assessment suggests that groundwater reliant wetlands account for between 20 and 40 of abmi sites within the various bitumen zones whereas such sites appear to be more common in the larger vicinity of each deposit 36 51 reduced frequency of groundwater reliant wetlands in the bitumen zone itself compared to the larger reference areas is consistent with unique geological features of the bitumen zone including occurrence of widespread impermeable cretaceous shales having formed cap rocks for bitumen in many areas and bitumen impregnated rock itself which both form effective aquitards to reduce vertical water movement barson et al 2001 birks et al 2019 enhanced potential for groundwater exchange in the vicinity of the athabasca deposit may be associated with upward movement of formation waters beyond the bitumen edge and beyond the erosional limit of the colorado shale in contrast groundwater reliance in the cold lake region appears to be somewhat more common owing to presence of thicker unconsolidated sediment layers over relatively impermeable bedrock the peace river region appears to have a higher proportion of groundwater reliant sites within the bitumen zone which may be due to the less continuous nature of the bitumen deposits there it is important to note that the abmi sites only include open water wetland types whereas fens and bogs are significantly more abundant in the oil sands region while this may limit the potential value of the current dataset it also recognizes the potential value of broader water sampling programs that include a diversity of wetland types including fens bogs and marshes in addition to open water wetlands significant potential also exists for the use of similar isotopic techniques to monitor reclaimed or constructed treatment wetlands which has proven challenging ketcheson et al 2017 further analysis of the quantitative imb results in combination with physical setting substrates vegetation geochemistry and ground truthing of individual wetland sites and their characteristics will be required to explore a mechanistic understanding of specific controls on groundwater surface water interaction and their relative importance for wetlands while further refinement of imb model parameters is ongoing the current version of the imb outputs demonstrates considerable potential for a first approximation quantitative assessment 4 3 potential applications 4 3 1 network design and monitoring one interesting application of the imb approach is for regional network design to target specific wetland types such as groundwater reliant systems or to stratify monitoring based on water balance conditions to ensure that the full range of variability is captured within a regional monitoring framework water sampling augmented by sampling of isotopic archives in aquatic sediment from open water bodies or shallow cores from peat forming wetlands bogs and fens may be useful for establishing a temporal record of baseline conditions prior to development see gibson et al 2022 archives may also provide a means for establishing baseline conditions in areas lacking traditional baseline monitoring or as an approach to build longer environmental baselines thereby providing extended time series records for constraining the natural range of variability of hydrologic or hydrogeologic conditions this would presumably assist in strengthening of adaptive management strategies and risk assessment frameworks for both surface water and groundwater reliant systems see rohde et al 2017 4 3 2 connectivity to streams and groundwater imb results from this study may be informative for study of wetland sources to receiving waters such as streams and rivers possibly as quantitative indicators of wetland connectivity analysis of spatial distribution of volumetric estimates of wetland discharge within the framework of a reach wise streamflow assessment may provide an approach to establish the importance of wetland sources of streamflow generation for better understanding of the role of wetlands in flooding drought low flows and sustainability of ecosystems resources of potential value for this type of assessment include isotopic monitoring data from streamflow gauging stations across canada gibson et al 2021 as well as multi decadal streamflow isotope records from stations in key development regions gibson et al 2016c similarly we suggest there may be potential value in comparing isotopes in precipitation and shallow groundwater from surficial aquifers bedrock subcrop or springs and seeps to identify recharge versus discharge settings to validate or challenge the preliminary assumption that groundwater isotope values are similar to locally recharged precipitation or to map groundwater development risk isotopic datasets compiled for the groundwater observation well network gown e g humez et al 2016 and by industry consortia such as canadian oil sands innovation alliance cosia e g birks et al 2019 may be particularly important resources for such an analysis given the isotopic differences in 18o and 2h values between modern precipitation glaciogenic brines and deep basin brines it would be prudent to test the sensitivity of the isotope balance results to variations in relative contributions from these sources 4 3 3 water quality water quantity relationships abmi wetland monitoring also included sampling of physico chemical properties such as water depth temperature ph dissolved oxygen conductivity total nitrogen total phosphorous dissolved organic carbon land use according to agriculture urban industrial soft linear hard linear human water use and non agricultural uses roy et al 2018 a preliminary province wide correlation analysis was carried out to illustrate similar inter relationships between hydrology of the wetlands and their physico chemical properties which may be useful for scoping future studies province wide we found positive correlations between evaporation inflow and the following variables temperature r2 0 167 electrical conductivity r2 0 178 total nitrogen r2 0 229 and total phosphorous r2 0 130 such correlations are broadly suggestive of evaporation and flushing rates being influential in controlling thermal conditions and nutrient budgets in open water wetlands a more detailed assessment including regional stratification may be useful for investigating systematic influence of agriculture urban impacts and industrial development on the wetland water cycle 4 3 4 wetland plant communities and biodiversity a recent abmi sponsored study spanning the grassland parkland regions used functional trait habitat relationships at 322 sites to measure influence of environmental factors on ecological communities roy et al 2018 they showed that annual plants are often associated with high disturbance habitats e g at the edge of wetlands whereas perennial plants tend to dominate in low disturbance habitats e g at the core of wetlands groundwater fed sites were found to be associated with plant functional groups that prefer hydrologic stability including perennial and upland species this contrasted with evaporative wetlands which tended to be shallower had higher nutrient levels and were positively associated with species tolerating higher levels of disturbances such as annuals a similar analysis incorporating sites across the province or for other regions would potentially be useful for identifying similar patterns in a wider range of ecosystems 5 summary and conclusions a province wide imb assessment based on 18o and 2h was presented for the province of alberta canada 662 583 km2 based on water sampling of 1022 abmi wetland sites evenly distributed across alberta on a 20 km grid and visited during 2009 2019 the sites were representative of most ecoregions in the province including grassland parkland rocky mountains foothills and boreal forest an imb model was developed incorporating regional reanalysis climate data areal watershed delineation information and isotopic data for wetlands and precipitation and was used to quantify and map water balance indicators and to classify sites by inflow and outflow partitioning characteristics the approach utilized a steady state model but incorporated a simple algorithm based on mean water depth and evaporation loss at each site to account for seasonal volumetric drawdown the assessment has revealed systematic variations in evaporation losses watershed runoff to wetlands wetland discharge and net groundwater exchanges across the major subregions of alberta including the aosr imb calculations indicated that 90 of the wetlands received runoff water yield from their watersheds 47 of sites including apparent groundwater inflow outflow was found to be most commonly by a combination of evaporation and liquid discharge 87 of sites however 13 appeared to be evaporation only a small number of mainly foothills and mountain sites 2 showed evidence of being fed by allochthonous water sources either snow or glacial melt an additional 3 of sites appeared to have unreasonable throughflows suggestive of glacial meltwater channel or stream channel connections combined with geospatial analysis the isotope method is capable of identifying open water wetlands that may be reliant on or under the direct influence of groundwater although these findings remain to be ground truthed and require further map and satellite analysis to confirm explanatory geomorphic or geological controls while some refinements may be required for operational use the imb is potentially a practical approach for wetland water balance assessment that is complementary to ongoing monitoring strategies especially in rapid development areas such as the alberta oil sands region

8042,study region water sampling for stable isotopes 18o and 2h was carried out during 2009 2019 across alberta canada as part of a survey targeting 1022 open water wetlands the study presents the first site specific wetland water balance assessment spanning grassland parkland foothills mountains and boreal regions including the oil sands region a corridor of rapid development study focus climate reanalysis watershed data and isotopic data for wetlands were incorporated into a steady state isotope mass balance model and applied to estimate site specific evaporation losses from the wetlands as well as runoff groundwater inflow total outflow and seasonal drawdown regional scale water balance fluxes water balance indicators and site specific classifications were mapped and described new hydrological insights for the region systematic variations in evaporation losses watershed runoff to wetlands wetland discharge and net groundwater inflow are revealed across the major subregions of alberta including the oil sands region isotope balance calculations suggest that 13 of wetlands are predominantly evaporative 87 have surface and or groundwater outflow 90 have positive water yields 47 likely have groundwater inflow and 2 are apparently fed by allochthonous water sources either snow or glacial melt for the 3 oil sands regions a scoping survey suggests that between 20 and 40 of wetlands within the bitumen zones are detectably groundwater reliant compared to 35 50 in the wider vicinity of the deposits keywords stable isotopes water balance wetlands evaporation runoff groundwater 1 introduction wetlands are vital elements of water and biogeochemical cycles in natural watersheds of western canada supporting habitat for microbes plants insects amphibians reptiles birds fish mammals and an array of valuable ecosystem services to society including recreation improvement of water quality carbon sequestration erosion drought and flood control regulation of seasonal low flows and mitigation of interannual and long term climate changes intensive and extensive anthropogenic activities including urbanization agriculture mining and oil and gas development have led to degradation and loss of natural wetlands worldwide including within alberta roy et al 2018 approximately 20 000 km2 or 14 4 of the rapidly developing alberta oil sands region aosr has some evidence of human footprint eaton and charette 2017 in addition up to 70 of wetlands have been lost due to various land use activities in the grassland parkland regions of alberta roy et al 2018 despite the recognized ecological value of wetlands relatively few quantitative studies have been conducted to characterize the role of wetlands in the regional water balance the degree to which wetlands are under the direct influence of groundwater the magnitude of groundwater recharge or discharge from wetlands and the relative importance of wetland storage among the many sources feeding river discharge remain to be widely studied in detail at the local and regional scale such factors are particularly important for predicting broader impacts on the water cycle from land use impacts and climatic change especially in regions under rapid development such as the aosr oil sands development including mining and in situ extraction of bitumen has accelerated over the past 30 years in wetland rich regions of the province including the athabasca cold lake and peace river regions fig 1 characterizing and mitigating anthropogenic impacts to wetlands in these areas is of primary concern to joint federal provincial monitoring and research organizations as well as policy makers this study focuses on characterization of water balance in a representative 20 km x 20 km gridded network of open water wetland sites across alberta operated by the alberta biodiversity monitoring institute abmi a not for profit publicly funded multi sector research alliance organization while the network was created and is largely maintained for the purpose of monitoring biodiversity and habitat changes water samples have been collected for stable isotope analysis of 2h and 18o as part of a joint program with innotech alberta for the specific purpose of investigating water balance processes and the relationships between hydrology vegetation and ecosystems to date water samples have been obtained from 1022 out of 1656 sites or roughly 2 3 of sites spanning the province s 662 583 km2 open water wetlands were selected among the common wetland types in alberta bog fen marsh open water swamp aep 2020 as they occurred in all ecoregions across the province including grassland parkland foothills rocky mountains and boreal forest groundwater reliance is an important unknown for open water wetlands both shallow and deep groundwaters are potential inflow sources and outflow sinks for these ecosystems based on previous hydrologic investigations deep groundwater sources may include discharge from saline formations which manifest as localized springs or broader seepage zones especially within the hyporheic zone or along incised river valleys of the lower athabasca region jasechko et al 2012 gue et al 2015 birks et al 2018 deep groundwater may also flow along structural or geological contacts such as the devonian prairie evaporite salt dissolution collapse breccia zone broughton 2013 which serve as preferred pathways for deep groundwater to enter surface water bodies in northeastern alberta including along the clearwater river and lower athabasca rivers seeps and springs are typically found to be glaciogenic which has been inferred from geochemical and isotopic fingerprints grasby and chen 2005 birks et al 2019 these waters are distinct from deep basin brines typical of southerly and westerly strata of the alberta basin which are thought to be associated with buried seawater connolly et al 1990b overall shallow aquifer sources within unconsolidated sediments and or till which often closely resemble the isotopic composition of modern precipitation are expected to be more important and more ubiquitous sources to wetlands buried channels which are abundant in many areas of alberta may also be influential in controlling groundwater exchange with lakes and rivers andriashek and atkinson 2007 alberta geological survey 2021 in the boreal forest region shallow bedrock is dominated by cretaceous sandstone and shales including the bituminous mcmurray formation in the athabasca region the gething and bluesky formations in the peace region and the clearwater formation in the cold lake region which overlie more permeable devonian strata comprised largely of carbonates and evaporites surface mining of bitumen is confined to 20 of the athabasca deposit where the bitumen zone occurs at less than 60 m below surface whereas bitumen extraction in all other deep seated zones within the deposit utilizes various in situ technologies mahaffey and dubé 2016 several regional plateaus within the boreal plains region including the stony muskeg birch and caribou mountains are underlain by impermeable shales and are dominated by thin tills with extensive bog formation topographically driven flows from these plateaus to adjacent lowlands are prevalent barson et al 2001 the parkland region tends to have moderately thick overburden with relatively impermeable bedrock grasslands are similar to parklands but semi arid with depression focused recharge occurring only during spring melt rocky mountain areas especially sediment filled river valleys are important recharge zones whereas thin overburden in the foothills region tends to limit the scale of aquifers although gravel deposits or interconnected tills may form important local water sources for some wetlands the stable isotope surveys by abmi were conducted over a decade from 2009 to 2019 during field visits to the sites and analyses were performed by innotech alberta within two months of the date of water collection although this inventory also facilitates regional comparisons between hydrologic indicators and physical chemical and biological properties of wetlands in the province this paper focuses on hydrology and water balance thus far there has been considerable interest in this dataset from the abmi alberta environment parks aep the oil sands monitoring program osm and environment climate change canada eccc with potential applications of the dataset or isotope mass balance synthesis products for a evaluating site specific wetland water balance b examining wetland dependence on groundwater c assessing streamflow dependence on wetlands d understanding relationships between plant community characteristics and associations with wetland water balance e and for investigating the regional impacts and sustainability of bitumen extraction and related activities in the peace athabasca and cold lake oil sands regions the potential to use isotopic indicators to examine and monitor the underlying causes of change in water quality and quantity such as changes in water sources and or water balance associated with land cover and climate change is of paramount interest to these organizations isotope tracers have been widely utilized in hydrological studies in canada including studies of lakes rivers and watershed hydrology gibson et al 2005 2020 birks and gibson 2009 2021 the evaporation process is traceable owing to enrichment of the heavy isotopologues 1h1h18o 1h2h16o compared to the common isotopologue 1h1h16o in the residual liquid due to fractionation by diffusion through the atmospheric boundary layer horita et al 2008 a number of recent studies have demonstrated the value of isotopes for quantifying water balance of natural lakes in a wide variety of settings including boreal arctic prairie and coastal areas pham et al 2012 arnoux et al 2017 wan et al 2020 gibson et al 2016a 2017 2018 2019a 2019b these studies were also successful in capturing altered water balances associated with operation of artificial recharge galleries masse dufresne et al 2020 and mine tailings ponds baer et al 2016 chad et al in press while several studies have used isotopes to determine contribution of wetland runoff to river discharge including st amour et al 2005 and gibson et al 2016c relatively few studies have directly assessed water budgets of wetlands bam and ireson 2019 a subset of the 18o data reported here was previously used to explore statistical relationships between hydrologic setting and plant communities in grassland parkland areas roy et al 2018 although the dataset has not otherwise been used for water balance assessment we recognized a unique opportunity to leverage the wetland isotope dataset to inform several provincial monitoring scientific objectives which help to fill gaps in understanding of the role of wetlands in regional runoff relationships between water balance and vegetation communities and the impact of disturbances of different kinds and magnitude on water balance and vegetation communities quantitative interpretation of the isotopic dataset allows for assessment and mapping of hydrological indicators and site by site water balance classifications which are expected to serve as a first demonstration of the regional scale impact attribution capabilities of the method once systematic isotopic enrichment signals were confirmed from abmi open water wetlands across the province our initial hypothesis was that water balance was mainly responding to regional climatic drivers including precipitation evaporation evapotranspiration humidity and temperature but with secondary influences arising from local factors such as land cover and landscape position overall differences between ecoregions were anticipated which we demonstrate in the results and discussion but the analysis offers a novel perspective including some unanticipated results of water balance variations in wetlands on the regional and provincial scale 2 method 2 1 study sites study sites across the province of alberta are shown in fig 1 while the precise geographic location of abmi monitoring sites is maintained as confidential to protect the integrity of the sites and its landowners the sites were originally selected by abmi based on nearest neighbor to a pre defined 20 km grid which is publicly available public coordinates can be used to identify the site locations to within a radius of 10 km from the precise geographic coordinate so that resolution remains only slightly reduced but still is quite useful for capturing regional scale patterns wetlands are defined by abmi as water bodies with an open surface area of between 1 and 100 ha with a maximum depth between 0 5 and 2 m and a low probability of complete water evaporation within or between years i e they are permanent wetlands to be selected for study a wetland also had to support a well developed zone of wetland vegetation so that plants could be sampled effectively the abmi s wetland selection criteria did not preclude human created or modified wetlands 2 2 climate data climate parameters were obtained from the north american regional reanalysis narr dataset mesinger et al 2006 gridded 32 km monthly climate data 2009 2019 were extracted for the grid cells corresponding to the location of each of the abmi sampling sites the parameters extracted included i total precipitation at surface mm yr 1 ii total evaporation at surface mm yr 1 iii 2 m relative humidity and iv 2 m temperature k raw data were averaged and evaporation flux weighted so that water balance calculations were representative of the open water evaporation season see gibson et al 2019a 2 3 watershed and open water delineations application of the isotope mass balance imb model required delineation of watershed areas wetland areas and wetland elevations for each of the abmi sampling locations this information was derived from digital elevation model data individual watersheds were delineated in the arcgis program using the archydro tools and hydrographic and elevation datasets then were used to depict wetland outlet locations the planimetric areas of both the wetland and watershed polygons were calculated in arcgis land cover classification was based on alberta biodiversity monitoring institute 2013 water balance indicator rasters were created using the spatial analyst kriging tool in esri arcgis version 10 7 1 cell size was set to 5000 m and all other tool defaults were retained the kriging method was ordinary and used the spherical semi variogram model each raster cell was interpolated using 12 variable points 2 4 water sampling and isotopic analysis water samples were collected in 30 ml high density polyethylene bottles by abmi field staff during 2009 2019 typically in mid summer june or july using field protocols developed by innotech alberta and widely used in previous isotope based assessments in the region see gibson et al 2019a repeat sampling where conducted was carried out in subsequent years within 2 weeks of prior year visits to each site samples were returned to the laboratory refrigerated and analyzed within 3 months of collection using a thermo scientific delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were analyzed on separate subsamples with oxygen determined by equilibration with carbon dioxide using a gasbench ii paul and skrzypek 2006 and hydrogen determined by injection of water on hot chromium using an h device reactor brand et al 1996 results are reported in δ notation in permil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and normalized to the smow slap scale where slap is standard light arctic precipitation nelson 2000 analytical uncertainty predicted based on 2 σ of repeats is 0 0 09 for δ18o n 159 and 0 52 for δ2h n 160 2 5 isotopic characterization of precipitation and atmospheric vapour isotopic composition of precipitation was estimated from time series ensembles 2009 2019 using a modified version of the model of delavau et al 2015 that included δ2h for all narr coordinates falling within the canadian landmass from which climate data for alberta sites were extracted the regression based model relied mainly on monthly data collected by the canadian network for isotopes in precipitation cnip birks and gibson 2009 the united states network for isotopes in precipitation usnip welker 2012 and global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea wmo 2014 amount weighted annual values for δ18o in precipitation were calculated as the dot product of the sequence of monthly isotopic values and precipitation amounts divided by the total precipitation isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture was estimated using the precipitation equilibrium assumption gibson et al 2008 1 δ a δ p ε α where ε is the equilibrium water vapour isotope separation horita and wesolowski 1994 and α decimal notation is the equilibrium isotopic fractionation where these quantities are related by ε 10 3 α 1 to account for seasonally variable conditions under which evaporation takes place the exchange terms in eq 1 were evaluated on a monthly time step and evaporation flux weighted for each grid point evaporation flux weighting was achieved by computing the dot product of the sequence of monthly δa outputs from eq 1 and monthly evaporation divided by the total evaporation similar calculations were made to estimate evaporation flux weighted temperature and relative humidity at 2 m atmospheric height 2 6 water and isotope mass balance the site specific water balance of each open water wetland was evaluated based on the balance between water inputs i water outputs q and

can be expressed as 3 d v d t p r o g w i n s w o u t g w o u t e m 3 which for the case of hydrologic steady state simplifies to 3a p r o g w i n s w o u t g w o u t e 0 m 3 a first approximation of surface runoff to the wetland was estimated from the precipitation minus evapotranspiration deficit 4 r o p w e t w m 3 where p w is precipitation on the watershed and e t w is evapotranspiration from the watershed while this relationship is approximate as ro may also include shallow subsurface flow from the surrounding watershed it was tested and found to be a useful indicator of surface reliant wetlands as compared to groundwater reliant wetlands the latter likely receiving excess input from recharge outside the immediate catchment area or from deep seated groundwater sources note that in the case of vertical fluxes derived from climate data volumes are calculated based on the annual equivalent depths whereby 5 p p l a m 3 6 e e l a m 3 7 p w p w a m 3 8 e t w e t w a m 3 where l a is

isotope mass balance imb was applied to the open water wetlands based on the methodology of gibson et al 2016b similar approaches have been applied for lake water balance assessments in alberta wolfe et al 2007 gibson et al 2019a 2019b and elsewhere in western canada gibson et al 2017 2018 wan et al 2020 isotope based evaporation inflow x for the wetlands was calculated as follows 9 x e i δ i δ l δ e δ l u n i t l e s s where δ i is the mean weighted isotopic value of input i i e a weighted mixture of isotope values in precipitation δ p runoff δ r o and groundwater inflow δ g w i n and δ l is the mean isotopic value of the wetland water body assumed to be well mixed such that it is also representative of liquid outflows δout including potential surface water and groundwater outflows q o u t g w o u t δ e is the mean weighted isotope value for evaporation from the wetland water body which we evaluate using a simplified craig and gordon 1965 model approach given by gibson et al 2016b as 10 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k where δ l and δ a are isotopic compositions of the wetland water body and ambient atmospheric moisture respectively h is ambient relative humidity decimal fraction and ε k is the kinetic contribution to the liquid vapour isotopic separation in horita et al 2008 these terms were also evaporation flux weighted due to lack of site specific isotopic data on watershed runoff and groundwater sources at each site we assumed that the isotopic composition of inflow was well characterized by that of precipitation i e δ i δ p this approach has been applied successfully in other assessments within alberta e g gibson et al 2016a 2020 and is most applicable for headwater catchments wherein runoff and groundwater are non evaporated and derived from local precipitation sources the simplification of δ o u t δ l is supported by our observations in previous studies that small shallow open water wetlands are typically well mixed in summer substitution of δ e into eq 9 then yields 11 x δ l δ i m δ δ l u n i t l e s s where 12 m h 10 3 ε k ε α 1 h 10 3 ε k u n i t l e s s and 13 δ h δ a ε k ε α h 10 3 ε k ε α isotope based evaporation loss x evaluated from eq 11 can then substituted into the steady state wetland water balance given in eq 3a 14 x e p r o g w i n u n i t l e s s for this assessment we make use of climatological data via eq 4 to estimate watershed runoff r o as a metric to evaluate whether a wetland is sustained largely by runoff from its local watershed i e fed by local precipitation recharge here termed surface water reliant or whether a water balance deficit exists requiring additional water input to account for ro deficits this additional water is g w i n estimated by rearranging eq 14 to obtain 15 g w i n e x p r o x m 3 which represents groundwater inflow that may derive from deep sources or from outside of the topographically defined catchment as would be the case for regional groundwater flows several scenarios are observed for sustainable wetlands including i surface water reliant wetlands where r o 0 g w i n 0 ii groundwater reliant wetlands where g w i n 0 iii wetlands within disconnected watersheds where r o 0 and g w i n 0 note that wetlands may be both groundwater reliant and situated within disconnected watersheds as is the case for many wetlands across much of the grassland region there are also 30 sites 2 9 in our analysis that yielded unrealistically large g w i n estimates that appear to exceed potential groundwater input volumes these sites are found to be mainly located along glacial meltwater channel deposits or flood prone areas near river channels as for the peace athabasca delta region for context it is important to note that in previous applications of the isotope balance method for lakes in alberta ro and g w i n were left undifferentiated and referred to as water yield see gibson et al 2019a the current approach was introduced here as a first approximation method for differentiating surface versus groundwater dependency of wetlands because liquid outflows occuring from the wetland by either surface or groundwater pathways are isotopically indiscernible these fluxes cannot be separately resolved by the isotope balance as a result water outputs including s w o u t and g w o u t remain grouped as q in our analysis where 16 q 1 x i m 3 while it is possible to identify occurrence of surface outflow based on air photo or satellite imagery interpretation and thereby eliminate swout from the balance when not present such an analysis has not yet been conducted we note another potentially useful isotope based water balance indicator discharge inflow a k a throughput defined as 16a q i 1 x u n i t l e s s which we apply along with evaporation inflow x to illustrate broad trends in water balance across the province due to the shallowness of some open water wetlands included in the survey a simple correction for the isotopic effect of volumetric reduction was applied which describes water bodies where drawdown is controlled by evaporation d v d t e the initial isotopic composition δ 0 was estimated by 17 δ 0 δ l δ 1 f m f m where seasonal volumetric drawdown was characterized by 18 f d d e u n i t l e s s and d is the mean water depth measured in each open water wetland at the time of sampling implementation of this correction required that δ 0 from eq 17 be used in place of δ l in eq 10 and eq 11 a similar approximation was recently applied for estimating water balance of tundra lakes with measurable seasonal drawdown wan et al 2020 note that the volume of water required to refill the wetland to account for seasonal drawdown was also added to the estimate of g w i n calculated from eq 15 although groundwater reliant wetlands tended to have reduced seasonal drawdown as compared to many surface water reliant wetlands 3 results and discussion 3 1 isotope characteristics of precipitation and open water wetlands wetland surface waters were found to be differentially enriched in 18o and 2h consistent with the effect of isotopic fractionation of water during evaporation under variable wetland water balance conditions as noted in numerous previous studies of canadian surface waters see gibson et al 2016b in dual isotope space δ18o vs δ2h fig 3 the isotopic composition of precipitation at abmi sites is shown to plot close to the canadian meteoric water line cmwl see gibson et al 2020 with precipitation values for individual sites ranging from 23 25 to 15 74 in δ18o 177 26 to 117 90 for δ2h as influenced by climate including mean annual temperature and continentality of each site in contrast open water wetlands are found to plot below the cmwl along an evaporation line with a slope close to 5 and individual wetlands are found to be enriched to varying degrees fig 3 isotope values for open water wetlands ranged from 22 53 to 2 25 for δ18o and 173 54 to 60 0 for δ2h with offset between wetland water and precipitation at some sites reaching as high as 16 64 for δ18o and 78 15 for δ2h similar isotopic enrichment ranges have been reported in regional lake surveys in central and northern alberta wolfe et al 2007 gibson et al 2016a 2019a note that water balance was not calculated for open water wetlands sites that were found to have depleted isotopic values relative to precipitation by up to 3 5 in δ18o and 27 for δ2h indicating that the current water balance model framework was not valid for these sites potentially this may have been due to systematic error in precipitation model estimates or may alternately reflect the presence of water derived from allochthonous sources i e sources other than modern precipitation recharged within the delineated watershed of the wetland the sites in question are classified mapped and discussed later on 3 2 climate data landscape runoff and individual water fluxes histograms showing distributions of depth equivalent values of precipitation evaporation and evapotranspiration used in the analysis are shown in fig 4 as well as watershed runoff calculated by eq 4 isotope based estimates of groundwater inflow based on eq 15 and total outflow based on eq 16 precipitation i e long term annual values ranged from 360 to 890 mm average 550 mm and evaporation ranged from 280 to 400 mm average 206 mm both with relatively symmetrical distributions fig 4 evapotranspiration ranged from 54 to 590 mm averaging 400 mm and runoff ranged up to 594 mm averaging 147 mm with less regular distributions we note that wetlands in the grassland region tend to have higher evapotranspiration than precipitation and therefore yield negative runoff according to eq 4 which is a strong indication of non contributing areas or watershed disconnection calculated groundwater inflow which together with runoff forms the total water yield to the wetlands is shown to be positively skewed as is the total estimated outflow similar skewed distributions have been found in previous water yield surveys using isotopes across western canada see gibson et al 2018 the current imb approach improves upon previous approaches as use of eq 4 to estimate surface runoff allows for a first order partitioning of surface and groundwater inputs as for outflows we point out again that partitioning of surface and groundwater discharges are not possible as the isotopic response in the wetland is equivalent and indistinguishable for both flow pathways 3 3 latitudinal variations latitudinal variations in water balance fluxes illustrate the extent of climate driven variability across alberta fig 5 mid latitude peaks in runoff are driven by gradients in precipitation combined with more subdued gradients in evaporation and evapotranspiration note that the resulting groundwater inflows and outflow show no obvious latitudinal patterns but rather appear in some high throughput cases to be directly coupled this would be expected for example in floodplain wetlands along river channels which are dominated by flushing combination of these individual water fluxes to assess systematic variations in site to site water balance is discussed below and then is applied to classify wetlands according to dominant water balance features 3 4 water balance indicators evaporation loss and throughput were calculated for the abmi open water wetlands based on eqs 11 and 16a respectively allowing for characterization of province wide variations in water balance the ratio of precipitation derived inputs was also calculated based on the approach developed by wan et al 2019 but did not significantly improve upon the other indicators at the provincial or regional scale basic maps showing variations in the indicators fig 6 revealed significant site to site differences depicting a patchwork of complex water balance sub regions across the province notably evaporative zones fig 6a are well delineated based on evaporation inflow whereas high throughflow high runoff areas are most visible based on the discharge inflow indicator fig 6b the latter type are found in association with topographic highs in particular the mountains and foothills regions as well as regional upland plateaus in the oil sands region including the caribou mountains and birch mountains both situated northwest of fort mcmurray the muskeg mountains situated northeast of fort mcmurray and the thickwood pelican martenhills situated west and southwest of fort mcmurray fig 6b regional plateaus within the grasslands region including cypress hills rolling sand hills and waterton lakes area are also visible as higher throughflow higher runoff zones fig 6b wetlands in these areas appear to be robustly connected to the regional drainage networks low runoff areas visible as light green coloured areas on the discharge inflow map fig 6b demark areas where open water wetlands have lower throughputs and so appear to be more tenuously connected to the regional runoff these areas include low lying areas along the peace river athabasca river valley beaver river north saskatchewan river and the battle river internally within these areas are situated many endorheic areas mostly individual sites where very evaporative low discharge conditions are evident mainly visible as dark blue areas on the evaporation inflow map fig 6a or as tan coloured specks on the discharge inflow map fig 6b while regional patterns are clear we also presume that characteristics such as landscape position may exert important influences on water balance of open water bodies at individual sites as observed in previous field studies e g devito et al 2005 2017 one of the most evaporative areas appears to be along the prairie grassland fringe where evaporation inflow is found to approach or exceed 100 dark colours fig 6a surficial and bedrock geology presence of peatlands permafrost river floodplain settings and proximity to incised and buried channels are also expected to be influential andriashek and atkinson 2007 gibson et al 2019b further classification of the water balance is explored in the following section based on site specific characteristics such as distribution of wetlands with volumetric drawdown and through closer examination of inflow and outflow partitioning 3 5 water balance classification 3 5 1 sites with volumetric reduction wetlands with significant volumetric drawdown were distinguished initially based on evaporation inflow x greater than 100 in the pre calibrated model these wetlands are shown generally to cluster in the parkland region northern grassland region near the southern boreal parkland transition and in the peace lowland fig 7a such conditions appear to be generally less common moving northward along diminishing evaporation gradients while it was initially surprising to find that volume reduction appeared less frequently in the semi arid grassland region we attribute this result to better groundwater connectivity in these areas which appears to be prerequisite to wetland permanence an important site selection factor which likely was influential in this climate zone we note a high degree of similarity between spatial distribution of wetlands with apparent volumetric reduction based on isotopes fig 7a and spatial distributions of volume surface area and number of geographically isolated wetlands across alberta as identified by cui et al 2021 3 5 2 sites with allochthonous sources our imb model is applied to quantify the site specific water balance scaled primarily using the degree of evaporative isotopic enrichment attained by open water wetlands compared to local precipitation across the abmi sampling network a total of 30 open water wetlands 2 of sites were found to be model outliers having wetland isotope values that were depleted relative to predicted precipitation isotope values at the site systematic distribution of these sites within the province mainly along the rocky mountain foothills region fig 7b may suggest that the delavau et al 2015 model underestimated the commonly observed altitude effect of isotopes in precipitation dansgaard 1964 or more likely that wetlands were receiving water from higher altitude areas outside the topographically delineated catchment such occurrences have been noted previously in alpine regions where bedrock layers may extend beyond topographic boundaries cochand et al 2019 wetland landscapes often originate as discharge from springs at the base of talus slopes which can store large amounts of groundwater christensen et al 2020 in some cases accounting for more than 75 of annual streamflow clow et al 2003 evaporation in such systems is often minor and suspended groundwater storage i e storage and seasonal redistribution of snow and glacial melt may cause extended freshet recessions dominating the hydrograph throughout the summer period cochand et al 2019 it is important to note that meltwater which may contain glacial melt and permafrost thaw derived from precipitation falling under colder climate conditions as during the last glaciation may also be influential in some watersheds while we can reasonably presume that these sites have distinct water balance properties reflecting alpine or sub alpine conditions the imb model would require input sources to be better defined which would require additional sampling and site specific ground truthing to be quantitatively applied at these sites 3 5 3 inflow partitioning runoff to wetlands approximated from eq 4 was found to be positive for 90 of sites with 10 of sites having a long term runoff deficit the latter sites are generally clustered in the grassland region which is known to frequently have watersheds with partial area contributions where large areas of the watershed may become disconnected from regional drainage networks and where wetlands typically occupy low lying areas or depressions such wetlands are typically connected to large areas of the watershed only during the snowmelt period costa et al 2020 groundwater inflow was found to be important for 47 of wetland sites fig 7c and based on the imb results we conclude is essential for maintaining wetlands in the grassland region cyan highlighted area fig 7c examples of such wetlands which may in some cases be temporary or semi permanent have been described in previous studies as groundwater wetland ecosystems or prairie potholes van der kamp and hayashi 2009 sloan 1972 while all open water wetlands in the southeastern grasslands region appear to be reliant upon groundwater mainly driven by climatic factors i e high evaporative demand there are some wetlands in the parkland region boreal region and peace lowland areas that also appear to be reliant upon groundwater and some that are not differentiation of these wetland types provides clear targets for further map analysis as well as for site specific investigations into water balance controls and related mechanisms among important local controls are relief surficial and bedrock geology permafrost thaw presence of peatlands landscape position and proximity to incised and buried channels as noted previously for the boreal forest region the role of groundwater appears to vary significantly from site to site even among nearby wetlands it is important to note that classification of wetlands according to inflow mechanisms should be regarded as a first approximation and does not preclude that groundwater exchange may be occurring at certain times of year though to a much lesser degree even for surface water reliant sites the classification should be viewed as a water balance constraint on whether surface or groundwater sources are the most significant determinant of the long term water balance 3 5 4 outflow partitioning wetlands were also differentiated based on dominant water loss mechanisms fig 7d the main mechanisms being evaporation and liquid outflow the latter comprised of surface and or groundwater discharge lakes that are predominantly evaporative are highlighted in light blue fig 7d based on imb these wetlands do not appear to have significant liquid outflows such wetlands analogous to evaporation pans that lose water principally by evaporation generally occur in local clusters or as individual sites scattered widely across the province evaporative lakes which account for 13 of total sites appear to be more common in the western part of the grassland region and in the southern boreal parkland transition overlapping with areas where volumetric reduction is also detected this consistency supports the conclusion that these sites are evaporation driven the majority of wetlands scattered across the province 87 lose water by both evaporation and some form of liquid outflow unfortunately from imb evidence alone we cannot differentiate the liquid outflow mechanism as both surface outflow and subsurface outflow are isotopically non fractionating as noted previously identification of surface outflows may be possible from further air photo or satellite based analysis which remains a planned future activity 4 discussion 4 1 regional water balance trends broad trends in wetland water balance discernable from the imb on the provincial and regional scale appear consistent with many features of wetlands lakes and watersheds observed previously based on hydrologic field studies and modelling the disconnection of wetlands detected in endorheic zones within the grassland region and generally weaker connection between wetlands and large southern rivers are broadly consistent with the description of these areas as non effective drainages by wolfe et al 2019 non effective drainage area defined as the difference between the gross and effective watershed area has been found to be a reliable index of the hydrological dynamics across the region shook and pomeroy 2012 studies of prairie potholes by van der kamp and hayashi 2009 shook and pomeroy 2011 and others have also shown that potholes located in smaller depressions are largely dependent on snowmelt or shallow groundwater and may completely dry up seasonally or during times of drought however a class of larger semi permanent wetlands has also been described wolfe et al 2019 which we suggest are similar to many of the abmi wetlands in this region which were screened to remove non permanent sites based on our analysis these sites appear to have sustained groundwater inputs on which they rely clusters of surface water reliant wetlands are also found in the grassland region although these appear to be associated with regional uplands such as the cypress hills which were found to support higher watershed runoffs see fig 6b a transition to more surface water reliant sites is evident along northern and western fringes of the grassland region where ro deficits subside although groundwater reliant sites are still predicted to be numerous the parkland region has previously been described as a lake rich region with high potential for evaporative isotopic enrichment and low runoff including some areas with negative water yields i e non effective drainages wolfe et al 2019 based on an imb assessment and statistical analysis of 50 lake watershed systems spanning the region higher runoff to lakes was found to be linked in general to higher percentage of wetlands gibson et al 2016a in some cases higher inflow may also reflect buried channel interaction baker et al 2017 in that study groundwater was estimated to account for approximately 40 of inflow to sylvan lake 52 35 n 114 2 w which is among the deepest lakes in the region mean depth of 9 6 m described as having an anomalously high degree of groundwater connectivity compared to other lakes based on results from these previous studies we posit that water depth is an important control on groundwater interaction for open water bodies such that wetlands 2 m depth are likely to have weaker connections to groundwater than most lakes the water balance results for abmi wetlands in the region reveal that sites are approximately divided between surface water and groundwater reliant sites and roughly divided between evaporation dominated and discharge dominated sites many wetlands have isotopic enrichment levels suggesting evaporative seasonal drawdown which is consistent with recent findings for shallow lakes in the region based on imb gibson et al 2016a water yield to wetlands in both grassland and parkland sites is significantly lower than for mountains foothills and boreal regions consistent with estimates by kienzle and mueller 2013 the rocky mountains and foothills regions characterized by alpine and sub alpine conditions respectively have been described as the hydrologic apex of north america and source regions for many of alberta s large rivers rood et al 2008 our finding of the occurrence of a significant number of wetlands potentially receiving allochthonous inputs and the dominance of wetlands with high throughflow and lower evaporation are expected considering the topographic gradients and other factors mentioned previously cochand et al 2019 the boreal forest region is dominated by low lying wetland rich terrain interspersed with regional uplands that drive topographically driven groundwater flows barson et al 2001 regional groundwater flows often saline flow eastward from the rocky mountains and enter the incised river valleys of the lower peace and athabasca rivers incised river channels and buried valleys as well as occurrence of impermeable bedrock salt dissolution features sinkholes and complex fault networks create complex conditions for surface groundwater interaction birks et al 2018 2019 our imb assessment suggests that wetlands in the region are commonly losing water by evaporation and both surface and or subsurface discharge they are less prone to seasonal drawdown than wetlands in the parkland or grasslands region and they are divided almost equally between surface water and groundwater reliant types considerable site to site variations are consistent with previous field studies that have shown hydrogeological setting landscape position and watershed morphometry to be influential in determining the water balance of lakes and wetlands devito et al 2017 gibson et al 2019a lake hydrology has been reported to be strongly influenced by wetland cover type and extent prepas et al 2001 in some typical examples lakes have also been found to be moderately reliant on groundwater in regional uplands schmidt et al 2008 although deeply incised rivers are known to be the focal points of regional groundwater inflow birks et al 2018 further discussion of wetland conditions the oil sands region is provided below 4 2 alberta oil sands region wetlands evidently play key roles in the alberta oil sands region including water storage filtration flood control carbon and nutrient sequestration as well as sustaining unique vegetation communities and wildlife habitat volik et al 2020 understanding the water balance of wetlands including distribution and degree of surface groundwater interaction and groundwater reliance and relationship to geomorphic and geologic controls is an important prerequisite to understanding and predicting how wetland ecosystems may be affected by cumulative development activities from the abmi dataset comparisons of the inflow partitioning status of open water wetlands in the peace river athabasca and cold lake oil sands districts reveals significant regional differences in the numbers and proportions of surface versus groundwater reliant types fig 8 this initial scoping assessment suggests that groundwater reliant wetlands account for between 20 and 40 of abmi sites within the various bitumen zones whereas such sites appear to be more common in the larger vicinity of each deposit 36 51 reduced frequency of groundwater reliant wetlands in the bitumen zone itself compared to the larger reference areas is consistent with unique geological features of the bitumen zone including occurrence of widespread impermeable cretaceous shales having formed cap rocks for bitumen in many areas and bitumen impregnated rock itself which both form effective aquitards to reduce vertical water movement barson et al 2001 birks et al 2019 enhanced potential for groundwater exchange in the vicinity of the athabasca deposit may be associated with upward movement of formation waters beyond the bitumen edge and beyond the erosional limit of the colorado shale in contrast groundwater reliance in the cold lake region appears to be somewhat more common owing to presence of thicker unconsolidated sediment layers over relatively impermeable bedrock the peace river region appears to have a higher proportion of groundwater reliant sites within the bitumen zone which may be due to the less continuous nature of the bitumen deposits there it is important to note that the abmi sites only include open water wetland types whereas fens and bogs are significantly more abundant in the oil sands region while this may limit the potential value of the current dataset it also recognizes the potential value of broader water sampling programs that include a diversity of wetland types including fens bogs and marshes in addition to open water wetlands significant potential also exists for the use of similar isotopic techniques to monitor reclaimed or constructed treatment wetlands which has proven challenging ketcheson et al 2017 further analysis of the quantitative imb results in combination with physical setting substrates vegetation geochemistry and ground truthing of individual wetland sites and their characteristics will be required to explore a mechanistic understanding of specific controls on groundwater surface water interaction and their relative importance for wetlands while further refinement of imb model parameters is ongoing the current version of the imb outputs demonstrates considerable potential for a first approximation quantitative assessment 4 3 potential applications 4 3 1 network design and monitoring one interesting application of the imb approach is for regional network design to target specific wetland types such as groundwater reliant systems or to stratify monitoring based on water balance conditions to ensure that the full range of variability is captured within a regional monitoring framework water sampling augmented by sampling of isotopic archives in aquatic sediment from open water bodies or shallow cores from peat forming wetlands bogs and fens may be useful for establishing a temporal record of baseline conditions prior to development see gibson et al 2022 archives may also provide a means for establishing baseline conditions in areas lacking traditional baseline monitoring or as an approach to build longer environmental baselines thereby providing extended time series records for constraining the natural range of variability of hydrologic or hydrogeologic conditions this would presumably assist in strengthening of adaptive management strategies and risk assessment frameworks for both surface water and groundwater reliant systems see rohde et al 2017 4 3 2 connectivity to streams and groundwater imb results from this study may be informative for study of wetland sources to receiving waters such as streams and rivers possibly as quantitative indicators of wetland connectivity analysis of spatial distribution of volumetric estimates of wetland discharge within the framework of a reach wise streamflow assessment may provide an approach to establish the importance of wetland sources of streamflow generation for better understanding of the role of wetlands in flooding drought low flows and sustainability of ecosystems resources of potential value for this type of assessment include isotopic monitoring data from streamflow gauging stations across canada gibson et al 2021 as well as multi decadal streamflow isotope records from stations in key development regions gibson et al 2016c similarly we suggest there may be potential value in comparing isotopes in precipitation and shallow groundwater from surficial aquifers bedrock subcrop or springs and seeps to identify recharge versus discharge settings to validate or challenge the preliminary assumption that groundwater isotope values are similar to locally recharged precipitation or to map groundwater development risk isotopic datasets compiled for the groundwater observation well network gown e g humez et al 2016 and by industry consortia such as canadian oil sands innovation alliance cosia e g birks et al 2019 may be particularly important resources for such an analysis given the isotopic differences in 18o and 2h values between modern precipitation glaciogenic brines and deep basin brines it would be prudent to test the sensitivity of the isotope balance results to variations in relative contributions from these sources 4 3 3 water quality water quantity relationships abmi wetland monitoring also included sampling of physico chemical properties such as water depth temperature ph dissolved oxygen conductivity total nitrogen total phosphorous dissolved organic carbon land use according to agriculture urban industrial soft linear hard linear human water use and non agricultural uses roy et al 2018 a preliminary province wide correlation analysis was carried out to illustrate similar inter relationships between hydrology of the wetlands and their physico chemical properties which may be useful for scoping future studies province wide we found positive correlations between evaporation inflow and the following variables temperature r2 0 167 electrical conductivity r2 0 178 total nitrogen r2 0 229 and total phosphorous r2 0 130 such correlations are broadly suggestive of evaporation and flushing rates being influential in controlling thermal conditions and nutrient budgets in open water wetlands a more detailed assessment including regional stratification may be useful for investigating systematic influence of agriculture urban impacts and industrial development on the wetland water cycle 4 3 4 wetland plant communities and biodiversity a recent abmi sponsored study spanning the grassland parkland regions used functional trait habitat relationships at 322 sites to measure influence of environmental factors on ecological communities roy et al 2018 they showed that annual plants are often associated with high disturbance habitats e g at the edge of wetlands whereas perennial plants tend to dominate in low disturbance habitats e g at the core of wetlands groundwater fed sites were found to be associated with plant functional groups that prefer hydrologic stability including perennial and upland species this contrasted with evaporative wetlands which tended to be shallower had higher nutrient levels and were positively associated with species tolerating higher levels of disturbances such as annuals a similar analysis incorporating sites across the province or for other regions would potentially be useful for identifying similar patterns in a wider range of ecosystems 5 summary and conclusions a province wide imb assessment based on 18o and 2h was presented for the province of alberta canada 662 583 km2 based on water sampling of 1022 abmi wetland sites evenly distributed across alberta on a 20 km grid and visited during 2009 2019 the sites were representative of most ecoregions in the province including grassland parkland rocky mountains foothills and boreal forest an imb model was developed incorporating regional reanalysis climate data areal watershed delineation information and isotopic data for wetlands and precipitation and was used to quantify and map water balance indicators and to classify sites by inflow and outflow partitioning characteristics the approach utilized a steady state model but incorporated a simple algorithm based on mean water depth and evaporation loss at each site to account for seasonal volumetric drawdown the assessment has revealed systematic variations in evaporation losses watershed runoff to wetlands wetland discharge and net groundwater exchanges across the major subregions of alberta including the aosr imb calculations indicated that 90 of the wetlands received runoff water yield from their watersheds 47 of sites including apparent groundwater inflow outflow was found to be most commonly by a combination of evaporation and liquid discharge 87 of sites however 13 appeared to be evaporation only a small number of mainly foothills and mountain sites 2 showed evidence of being fed by allochthonous water sources either snow or glacial melt an additional 3 of sites appeared to have unreasonable throughflows suggestive of glacial meltwater channel or stream channel connections combined with geospatial analysis the isotope method is capable of identifying open water wetlands that may be reliant on or under the direct influence of groundwater although these findings remain to be ground truthed and require further map and satellite analysis to confirm explanatory geomorphic or geological controls while some refinements may be required for operational use the imb is potentially a practical approach for wetland water balance assessment that is complementary to ongoing monitoring strategies especially in rapid development areas such as the alberta oil sands region

of plants and products of microbial synthesis which represents a major proportion of carbon flow in fluvial systems kellerman et al 2015 zark and dittmar 2018 fluvial dom plays several significant roles including fueling aquatic food webs keil and kirchman 1991 wetzel 1992 regulating the acid base balance oliver et al 1983 and controlling the fate transport and bioavailability of trace metals and organic pollutants hassett 2006 latch and mcneill 2006 aiken et al 2011 oleinikova et al 2017 worms et al 2019 the metabolism of dom in rivers also makes a major contribution to carbon dioxide degassing to the atmosphere battin et al 2008 raymond et al 2013 as such unraveling the sources behavior and associated properties of fluvial dom is of vital importance to better understand its effect on downstream ecosystems and climate change wilson and xenopoulos 2009 walker et al 2013 spencer et al 2014 hemingway et al 2019 with implications for the geochemical behavior of trace elements in the boreal zone the functionality of dom depends on its chemical reactivity which largely depends upon its intrinsic factors such as size and composition amon and benner 1996 kellerman et al 2015 given the colloidal nature of riverine dom e g small size and large specific surface area a vast array of reactive functional groups are potentially available to interact with trace elements regulating their fate transport and bioaccessibility roditi et al 2000 cuss et al 2018 worms et al 2019 the size properties of dom have also been linked to its source and composition cuss and guéguen 2015 for instance aromatic structures with higher molecular mass generally dominate the terrestrial dom pool e g lignin associated dom and other polyphenols while lower molecular mass compounds e g carbohydrates and amino acids make up a larger proportion of autochthonous dom from algae and macrophytes fellman et al 2010 lee et al 2018 moreover the efficiency of dom utilization by microbes has been linked to its size properties amon and benner 1996 altogether it is apparent that the size properties of dom should be well considered as a variable governing its behavior in freshwaters mixing phenomena occur in a variety of aquatic environments such as river confluences or the estuaries connecting freshwater and marine systems parsons et al 2008 simon et al 2019 to date a large body of studies has been conducted on mixing in estuaries relative to fluvial systems stedmon and markager 2003 abdulla et al 2010 lambert et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 simon et al 2019 at river confluences the non conservative behavior of dom during flow mixing has been examined moreira turcq et al 2003 lambert et al 2016 implying changes of dom quality irrespective of physical mixing aucour et al 2003 simon et al 2019 the processes responsible for such changes include sorption release flocculation coagulation and fractionation mcknight et al 1992 aucour et al 2003 simon et al 2019 although studies of dom during riverine mixing have been increasing information on spatial and temporal variations in dom quality at large river confluences width at confluence 100 m remains scarce parsons et al 2008 simon et al 2019 this lack of knowledge to a great extent limits the discrimination of sources of dom at regional and global scales for instance the quality of dom from its sources may not persist downstream as a result of non conservative mixing behavior at large river confluences which ultimately narrows our understanding of the evolution of dom along the river continuum to the ocean mcknight et al 1992 asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation af4 is a versatile separation technique wahlund and giddings 1987 to date the instrumentation of af4 has matured podzimek 2011 allowing a series of applications such as the separation of natural colloidal particles cuss et al 2017 wang et al 2020 engineered nanoparticles mitrano et al 2012 wang et al 2020 proteins kim and moon 2009 and polymers ehrhart et al 2011 when coupled to ultraviolet visible absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy the continuous size spectra of dom can be examined guéguen and cuss 2011 cuss and guéguen 2012a zhou et al 2016 also detailed mapping of the fluorescence properties produces excitation emission matrices eem which can be connected to size fractionated fluorescent organic matter providing in depth information about its source chemical reactivity and diagenetic state coble 1996 cuss and guéguen 2015 lin and guo 2020 especially when the overlapping peaks in eems are decomposed into their underlying chemical components using the multi way data analysis approach parallel factor analysis parafac the spectral properties of dom can be compared with similar phenomena found in aquatic ecosystems worldwide stedmon and bro 2008 cuss and guéguen 2012a murphy et al 2013 2014 parr et al 2014 stubbins et al 2014 although the application of af4 coupled with optical detectors for characterizing dom properties in freshwaters has also been increasing cuss and guéguen 2015 zhou et al 2016 lin and guo 2020 studies on the variation of dom during river mixing at large confluences are scarce the objectives of the study were 1 to determine the major sources of dom along a 125 km stretch of a large boreal river namely the lower athabasca river lar by measuring its size and optical properties in two different seasons i e fall and spring and 2 to assess if dom behaves conservatively during mixing in the lar at near confluences 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the athabasca river originates at the glaciers of the columbia icefields in jasper national park and extends over 1200 km before emptying into lake athabasca from here waters flow to the mackenzie river and into the arctic ocean the lar is the reach of the river starting downstream of fort mcmurray 56 7267 n 111 3790 w and flowing toward the mouth of the athabasca river fig 1a the lar has received considerable attention due to its complex hydrological and geochemical setting and concerns of potential contamination by metals and organic pollutants from the canadian oil sands industry shotyk et al 2017 sun et al 2017 lima and wrona 2019 tributaries of the lar are characterized by elevated dom concentrations largely due to the abundance of peatlands in their drainage basins guéguen et al 2012 cuss et al 2019 delayed mixing between tributaries and the lar has been observed where the mixing zones coincide with the oil sands industry potentially rendering source discrimination of dom difficult cuss et al 2020a spring freshet between april and june may significantly alter the concentration and properties of dom given changes in flow rate and turbidity both in the lar and its tributaries yi et al 2015 cuss et al 2019 2020b as a result of the annual hydrological cycle in the lar fig s1 major inputs of dom are expected to be different between fall and spring for instance dom inputs in fall are dominated by tributaries and groundwaters in contrast spring freshet exerts more influence in april may potentially carrying a unique dom fingerprint from snowmelt and runoff thus the lar serves as an ideal setting for tracking the sources and evolution of dom from terrestrial boreal landscapes to the receiving freshwater ecosystems downstream during mixing with tributaries and potential pollution from the oil sands industry under different hydrological regimes 2 2 sample collection representative field campaigns occurred in the fall of 2018 sept 25 oct 03 and spring of 2019 may 14 18 and may 25 27 with 95 and 108 water samples taken at 49 and 52 sites respectively sampling sites were chosen along the lar at five mainstem transects t1 t5 each including samples collected from the west middle and east sides fig 1a samples at each location were collected at up to three different water depths depending on river depth 0 3 m from the top and bottom of the water column and in the middle furthermore sampling was conducted at the outlet of eight tributaries i e little fishery r lfr mclean creek mlc beaver r br muskeg r mur mackay r mkr ells r er tar r tar and pierre r pr fig 1a lastly samples were obtained on the river side and close to the bank along three mixing zones between the lar and three major tributaries i e horse r hr clearwater r cl and steepbank r sb see fig 1b f samples collected from the west ar and east hr sides of athabasca r at the five mixing transects were respectively designated as ar hr01 05 and hr hr01 05 similarly ar cl01 06 and cl cl01 06 and ar sb01 04 and sb sb01 04 were used to respectively represent samples from the west side and near shore tributary outflow along the cl and sb mixing zones quality control measures were used for equipment cleaning and preparation and for sample collection and analysis spencer and coble 2014 samples were collected using a peristaltic pump with acid cleaned polypropylene tubing bottles filters and syringes amber glass vials 40 ml with teflon lined caps were rinsed in astm type i water and soaked in 5 hcl for 24 h and again rinsed with astm type i water vials were then covered with aluminum foil and combusted at 450 c for 5 h adequate purging was guaranteed to stabilize water quality measurements and basic quality parameters were determined using a field multimeter ph and ec ysi pro plus yellow springs oh usa the collected sample was immediately transferred to the syringe and filtered into an amber glass vial using 0 22 µm polytetrafluoroethylene filters these filters were conditioned with sample at each site prior to sample collection and the conditioning water was used to rinse the corresponding sample vial filtered samples were immediately stored in coolers with ice packs after collection and during transport to the lab where they were stored at 4 c samples were allowed to warm to room temperature prior to analysis detailed information about procedures for equipment preparation and sample collection can be found elsewhere cuss et al 2019 2 3 analytical methods dissolved organic carbon doc was quantified using the combustion technique followed by the analysis of the resulting co2 shimadzu toc 5000a kyoto japan major anions cl and so4 2 and cations na k mg2 ca2 were determined using ion chromatography dionex ics 2500 sunnyvale california usa and inductively coupled argon plasma optical emission spectrometer thermo fisher scientific icap 6300 waltham massachusetts usa respectively fluorescence eem spectra were measured in ratio s r mode using an agilent g1321b fluorescence detector agilent technologies santa clara usa cuss and guéguen 2015 excitation emission wavelength ranges were set as 220 450 nm and 280 550 nm with 1 nm and 5 nm intervals respectively wavelengths were calibrated following manufacturer recommended procedures the eem of milli q water was measured daily and subtracted from sample eems to eliminate background noise and reduce scatter absorbance spectra were measured over a wavelength range of 200 640 nm using a diode array detector agilent g4212b agilent technologies santa clara usa part of the absorbance spectra 220 550 nm were used to correct for the inner filtering effect kothawala et al 2013 2 4 optical indicators the relative extent of humification hix and autotrophic productivity bix were calculated using the fluorescence indices developed by zsolnay et al 1999 and huguet et al 2009 respectively elevated hix values are related to high fluorescence emission at longer wavelengths suggesting the enrichment of more condensed fluorescent molecules lower h c zsolnay et al 1999 for bix recently produced dom of autochthonous origin is characterized by values larger than 1 the fluorescence index fix was also calculated to estimate the relative contribution of terrestrial and microbial sources to the bulk dom pool mcknight et al 2001 the napierian absorption coefficient at 254 nm a254 was selected to estimate the chromophoric fraction cdom ågren et al 2008 specific uv adsorption at 254 nm suva254 an indicator of dom aromaticity was calculated by normalizing a254 to doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 we also calculated the e2 e3 ratio e2 e3 as the absorbance at 254 nm divided by that at 365 nm notably e2 e3 ratios can not only serve as molecular weight proxies peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 ågren et al 2008 but also show correlations with the quantum yields of singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 dalrymple et al 2010 thus e2 e3 can be a potentially valuable index for the photo degradability and photo reactivity of doc chow et al 2013 2 5 eem parafac a total of 203 filtered samples were analyzed three distinct subsamples of each sample were separately injected into the measurement cell and measured to provide multiple instances of consistent sample spectra with distinct noise profiles and thereby develop a more robust parafac model cuss et al 2019 modeling results from triplicate eems were averaged to provide a more accurate assessment of fluorescence properties the parafac analysis was performed in matlab r2017b mathworks using a total of 664 eems including 55 size fractionated eems after spectral correction with a combination of the domfluor and dreem toolboxes stedmon and bro 2008 murphy et al 2013 fluorescence intensities were normalized to raman units r u lawaetz and stedmon 2009 excitation wavelengths 240 nm were removed due to a low signal to noise ratio first and second raman and rayleigh scatter peaks were recognized and eliminated blank subtraction raman normalization and scatter removal were performed via an elaborated eemcut algorithm cuss and guéguen 2012b the parafac model was constrained to non negative values and an eight component model was successfully derived and split half validated i e s4c6t3 fig 2 and figs s2 s4 murphy et al 2013 random initialization was used to guarantee that the solution was not a local minimum stedmon and bro 2008 the fmax values from each component were normalized to the corresponding doc concentration of the sample to eliminate concentration biases from the parafac model and the subsequent principal component analysis pca korak et al 2014 burns et al 2016 the resulting parafac components were compared using comparafac parr et al 2014 through which quantitative comparisons were conducted with 38 additional parafac models using a modified tucker s congruence coefficient mtcc table s1 moreover spectra of components were uploaded into the online spectral database openfluor for quantitative comparison with all published spectra in the database fig s5 murphy et al 2014 it is well known that certain parameters like ph ionic strength and iron concentration can affect dom fluorescence poulin et al 2014 zhang and he 2015 given comparable conditions in the lar and tributaries we reasoned that these parameters would exert little influence on fluorescence the ph of samples from the lar and tributaries were similar ranging from 8 0 to 8 7 and dom fluorescence is not likely to be altered guéguen et al 2012 the electrical conductivities of samples also were not markedly different given the similar fe dom ratio in the lar and insensitivity of eems for parafac modeling poulin et al 2014 any alteration of dom spectra by fe concentration was also considered insignificant guéguen et al 2012 cuss et al 2019 2 6 size separation size based separation of dom was performed via a postnova af2000 multiflow fff fractionation system with a 300 da polyethersulfone membrane postnova analytics salt lake city utah usa the af4 was coupled to on line diode array and fluorescence detectors agilent technologies g4212 dad and g1321b fld santa clara california usa guéguen and cuss 2011 cuss et al 2017 to provide an analysis of dom quality based on in situ conditions the ec and ph of the carrier fluid were adjusted to values similar to the physicochemical condition of the lar approximately 300 μs cm 1 and ph 8 using a buffer made from 99 999 metal free nh4 2co3 sigma aldrich st louis missouri usa cuss et al 2017 a carrier fluid blank was analyzed before each sample to minimize memory effects the accumulation of dom on in membrane pores may cause the inaccuracy of size measurements by af4 cuss et al 2017 the relationship between retention time and the molecular mass at peak maximum mp therefore requires routine calibration note that a given dom sample may contain numerous molecules of various sizes and the mp serves an approximation of the mode of the size distribution as measured according to its absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm lin and guo 2020 a mixture of bromophenol blue sigma aldrich st louis missouri usa and polystyrene sulfonate na salt standards pss polymer standards service usa inc amherst massachusetts was used to calibrate the channel over a size range of 0 69 20 7 kda cuss et al 2017 the slope and intercept of the size calibration curve varied over the course of measurement with average values of 1 sd 1 log t r t 0 0 574 0 019 log m 1 479 0 064 r 2 0 998 0 002 for n 24 calibrations with void time t 0 retention time t r and molecular mass m the mp of each sample was calculated using the average slope and intercept of the two calibration curves that bracketed every alternating series of ten samples and blanks some dom moieties may not absorb light so that a254 serves only as a proxy for dom concentration suitable for estimating its size properties wang et al 2020 detailed information about the af4 instrumentation e g flow program analytical conditions quality control and optimization steps can be found elsewhere cuss et al 2017 2 7 mass balance calculations mass balance calculations were selectively performed for dom quality measurements to provide quantitative evidence for the conservative mixing behavior in the fall and spring respectively using flow rates from table s2 the mass balance equation is expressed as 2 dom q t 1 flow t 1 flow t 1 flow tr dom q tr flow tr flow t 1 flow tr dom q t 5 with dom quality measurements denoted by dom q also flow t 1 flow t5 and flow tr denote flow rates at the transects of t1 t5 and a specific tributary tr respectively 2 8 data analysis spearman s rank order correlation was calculated for dom quantity and quality measurements including doc concentration mp bix hix fix a254 e2 e3 suva254 and parafac component fmax values given the potential for different relationships correlations were tested separately for two sample sets the mainstem and tributaries and mixing zones using originpro 2020b originlab corporation northampton massachusetts usa data was transformed to obtain gaussian distributions for each variable including the log transformation for doc a254 c1 c2 c5 and c7 and the cubic root transformation for c8 outliers and normality tests were performed using grubb s test and the kolmogorov smirnov test at significance levels of 0 05 and 0 001 respectively principal component analyses were separately applied to two distinct data sets using originpro 2020b i e mainstem tributaries and mixing zone samples the spearman s correlation matrices are provided in support of the pca analyses three and two outliers were detected for the mainstem and tributaries and mixing zone data sets respectively however these values reflected correct measurements and natural levels of variation in the system conducting the pca analyses with and without the outliers also revealed that these values exerted little influence on both the variation explained by and the loadings of most principal components pcs 3 results 3 1 concentration size and optical properties of dom tables 1 and 2 provide statistical data about dom quality indicators in mainstem transects t1 t5 and key tributaries of the lar respectively the spectra of eight parafac derived fluorescent components were characterized as humic like c1 c6 and protein like c7 c8 fig 2 and s2 the published studies regarding sources molecular associations and reactivities for c1 c8 are summarized in table 3 quantitative comparisons of components via comparafac revealed that c1 c7 were good to nearly exact matches i e mtcc 0 95 with those from previous studies table s1 parr et al 2014 however in the openfluor database c6 did not match any of the published models fig s5 3 2 dom in the lar and its tributaries the first three pcs were selected for the pca analysis based on the scree plot fig s6a accounting for 86 8 of the total variance fig 3 the first pc pc1 was largely driven by the majority of variables e g c1 c6 a254 doc suva254 and e2 e3 fig 3c d representing both seasonal fig 3a b and source based variations e g fig 3e 3g in dom quality the second pc pc2 was mainly a function of differences in bix c7 c8 and hix fig 3c and it was also driven by source related variations of dom fig 3e 3g the third pc pc3 was largely a function of variations in fix mp and suva254 fig 3d spatial variations e g east vs west sides and t1 t5 in dom quality in the lar were to a large extent described within the 2d space of pc1 and pc2 in both seasons fig 3a b 3e h the simultaneous detection and visualization of these primary sources of variation across numerous correlated variables highlight the value of using pca for this complex dataset in the fall samples from t1 n 8 and west of t2 n 3 were well separated from the other samples with elevated doc concentration and optical indicator values e g hix as well as doc normalized humic like components fig 3e and table 1 indeed there was a clear gradient of scores at t2 running from the east side n 3 close to cl through the middle n 2 over to the west side in the fall clustered with t1 fig 3e from the lower right hand side to the upper left hand side the scores of samples collected from the west side of t3 n 3 were also clustered nearer to these west side and upstream samples compared to the east side n 2 and middle n 3 whereas scores of these latter samples plotted closer to those from the east side of t2 in addition the scores of several tributaries i e er mur cl tar and pr plotted relatively close to those of the mainstem the score of cl was particularly close to those of t2 east and t3 east and middle for downstream sites t4 n 6 and t5 n 9 scores of samples were largely grouped together halfway between those of the cl and t1 fig 3e showing elevated concentrations of doc and doc normalized c1 c6 as well as greater degrees of humification and aromaticity relative to that of upstream in the spring scores of samples from t1 n 9 were still largely clustered and scores for samples from the west of t2 n 3 were also well separated from those of the middle and east side n 5 fig 3g notably the score cluster of samples from the west side of t2 largely deviated from those of t1 in spring with increased c7 c8 and mp in contrast to the fall scores for samples from t3 n 9 t4 n 9 and t5 n 9 were more spread out on pc1 and pc2 but lacked any major organization from east to west or upstream to downstream in general it was found that elevated doc concentration and optical indicator values e g hix as well as doc normalized humic like components occurred in downstream transects figs 3c and 3g table 1 although the score of cl was much closer to those of the east and middle sides of t2 relative to the west and the scores of t3 t5 largely remained between cl and t1 along the mixing axis that was apparent for the fall scores of most tributary samples were separated from those of the mainstem with four exceptions mlc er mur and cl fig 3g quality measurements of dom of these tributaries were detailed in table 2 fig s7 shows the spearman s correlation matrix between the concentration of doc and the size and optical properties of dom upon which the pca analysis was based 3 3 dom in mixing zones the first two pcs were selected for the pca analysis based on the scree plot fig s6b accounting for 79 5 of the total variance fig 4 scores on pc1 largely distinguished samples from different mixing transects in both the fall and the spring fig 4c d spatial variations in dom quality along pc1 were strongly controlled by c1 c6 doc a254 suva254 bix e2 e3 and fix fig 4b the variability in dom quality scores were largely separated on pc2 in the fall 0 vs spring 0 fig 4a seasonal variability i e pc2 was driven to a great extent by c7 c8 mp bix and hix fig 4b which were higher in the spring compared to the fall difference along pc2 also contributed to the differentiation of samples along the ar cl mixing transect in the fall fig 4c fig s8 shows the spearman s correlation matrix between the concentration of doc and the size and optical properties of dom for mixing zones upon which the pca analysis was based in the fall scores of samples from different sides of mixing transects were well differentiated e g ar cl vs cl cl and ar hr vs hr hr referring to mainstem vs tributary sides along each tributary mixing transect except that the clusters of scores from ar sb and sb sb were partially overlapping fig 4c on the mainstem side the scores of ar cl samples n 10 were largely mixed with the score cluster of ar hr n 8 also scores of samples at the end of the cl mixing zone e g ar cl05 were mixed with ar sb samples e g ar sb02 in general scores of ar cl showed progressive changes during mixing on pc1 and pc2 except for ar cl02 scores of ar sb samples n 8 were located close to scores of cl cl samples n 10 on the tributary side the score clusters from cl cl and the majority of sb sb except for the sb sb01 sample were grouped together on pc1 the scores of hr hr n 5 were well separated from those of cl cl and sb sb n 7 and showed progressive changes during mixing becoming more similar to scores from the lar side of mixing transects in the spring the differentiation of scores from samples at different sides i e the mainstem and the tributary side of the mixing zone was not as clear as in fall fig 4d scores of samples from different sides of the hr and sb mixing zones were largely differentiated while the clusters of scores from ar cl and cl cl were partially overlapping on the mainstem side scores of ar hr n 10 partially mixed with those of ar cl and ar sb n 8 fig 4d the distribution of scores of ar hr was heterogeneous along pc2 and no progressive pattern during mixing was observed scores of ar cl n 12 were largely mixed with those of ar sb and partially mixed with those of hr hr and sb sb the majority of ar sb scores were located close to those of cl cl n 12 and those scores were also partially mixed with those of hr hr on the tributary side scores of hr hr samples n 10 were mixed with those of sb sb n 5 but they were largely separated from those of cl cl fig 4d notably the scores of hr hr changed progressively along pc1 during mixing becoming more similar to the lar side of the mixing transects in contrast the changing pattern of sb sb scores was not progressive during mixing results from mass balance calculations for dom quality measurements of the lar and its three major tributaries i e hr cl and mkr showed that the calculated values greatly matched those of the measured values for all selected parameters for the fall and spring see table 4 4 discussion 4 1 dom sources during base flow here in depth interpretations of major dom sources are compared during both base flow conditions and snowmelt such information forms a basis for the discussion of mixing patterns under distinct hydrological conditions to examine probable dom inputs e g tributaries and groundwaters we first studied variations in dom quality in the fall in the absence of the influence of snowmelt and associated runoff 4 1 1 upstream of industry at t1 dom quality was largely uniform on the west middle and east sides of the river suggesting that the river was well mixed at this transect table 1 fig 3e moving downstream to t2 the dom on the west side shared similar size and optical properties to those of t1 fig 3e highlighting the conservative behavior of dom over this 20 km distance i e a negligible chemical modification of dom composition stedmon and markager 2003 holmes et al 2008 wickland et al 2012 from the west side to the east side of t2 the concentration of doc degree of humification cdom a254 doc normalized concentrations of c1 c6 i e humic like and aromaticity increased fig 3c 3e but the proportion of fresh dom bix decreased this trend points to inputs of allochthonous dom from dom rich tributaries on the east side of the river e g horse r and clearwater r fig 1a yi et al 2015 cuss et al 2018 2019 in addition the score of the cl sample was more similar to those of the east side at t2 relative to that of the hr fig 3e such a pattern indicates that dom from the hr had properties that were very distinct from transect t1 and the west side of transect t2 interestingly the scores associated with dom in the middle of t2 were between scores for the west and east suggesting the dilution of dom during the mixing of the tributaries and the mainstem 4 1 2 midstream flowing downstream to t3 similar to t2 scores from samples collected from the west side were well separated from those of the middle and east fig 3e the quality of dom on the west at t3 also exhibited some similarity to t1 and the west side of t2 but the points were not closely clustered such that one was more similar to the middle at t2 such patterns suggest that dom may have partially dispersed from the middle of t2 masking the original dom quality on the west side fig 1a the quality of dom in the east and middle sides of t3 resembled that of the east of t2 indicating the negligible role of mlc in altering dom quality at the east side of the lar between t2 and t3 fig 1a and the delayed mixing behavior of hr and cl along the lar that leads to similar gradients in trace element concentrations across the river cuss et al 2020a 4 1 3 downstream of industry moving downstream of industry samples from t4 had similar dom composition to those from t5 and their scores were tightly clustered approximately half way between t1 and cl however one sample from the west side was separated from the others i e 0 3 3 5 m fig 3e this surface sample tended to have a larger terrestrial dom fingerprint indicated by elevated hix and lower bix fig 3c but was characterized by lower fluorescence intensities on c1 c8 these differences suggest a unique local dom source with properties similar to cl but with minimal influence on downstream dom quality at t5 fig 3e altogether dom downstream e g t4 and t5 was characterized by higher concentrations of doc greater doc normalized concentrations of c1 c6 and greater degrees of humification and aromaticity compared with that of upstream fig 3c taken together these changes reflect the significant impact of terrestrial dom inputs from wetlands and peatlands by tributaries such as the cl and hr on dom quality downstream 4 1 4 natural vs industrial inputs the dom quality along and across the river became increasingly similar to tributaries from upstream to downstream specifically the clearwater r contributed large amounts of terrestrial dom relative to other major tributaries as a result of higher discharge to the lar which ultimately changed the nature of dom in the river compared to the dom with lower aromaticity from upstream i e 127 and 14 m3 s 1 for cl and hr respectively fig 3e also the ells pierre and tar rivers were much closer to those of t4 and t5 suggesting a probable dom source on the west side of the ar downstream of t3 these west side inputs upstream of t4 may have obscured differences with the middle and east sides limiting detection of delayed mixing across the lar at t4 in fall 2018 the scores from beaver r and mclean creek which flow through the operational areas for the oil sands industry were grouped together far away from those of the mainstem and the other tributaries fig 3e indicating unique dom quality this conclusion is consistent with the findings of sun et al 2017 who claimed that the naphthenic acids in beaver r and mclean creek had a detectably greater similarity to oil sands process affected water and other natural bitumen impacted waters distinguishing them from the natural naphthenic acids present in other tributaries given recent advances in disentangling organic fingerprints for natural bitumen impacted groundwater and oil sands process affected water ahad et al 2020 hewitt et al 2020 additional study is needed for a clear understanding of the dominant sources of dom in beaver r and mclean creek in order to assess the potential influence of the oil sands industry on the local water quality cuss et al 2019 found that both saline and non saline groundwaters were marked by a high proportion of protein like fluorescent components likely contributed by autochthonous dom sources e g microorganisms although groundwater samples were not studied here the trend of dom towards a more humified composition from upstream to downstream suggests that groundwater inputs i e largely involving protein like fluorescent signatures were not a major source of dom in the lar fig 3e 4 2 snowmelt and its effect on dom quality 4 2 1 changes in dom quality from fall to spring in addition to spatial variations in dom quality observed under baseflow condition a large difference in dom quality was observed between base flow conditions in fall and the period following spring snowmelt fig 3a the spring freshet is a major hydrological event in the annual water cycle of the lar fig s1 woo and thorne 2003 yi et al 2015 generally flushing the river and carrying a unique dom fingerprint ågren et al 2008 cao et al 2016 the t1 site was valuable for comparing changes in dom quality in the mainstem between spring and fall before the introduction of dom from the major tributaries studied here e g hr and cl and potential influences from industry and other tributaries downstream elevated concentrations of doc were observed in the late part of the snowmelt period table 1 consistent with previous studies findlay and sinsabaugh 2003 avagyan et al 2016 given that snow normally contains very low concentrations of doc wallis et al 1981 yi et al 2015 the elevated levels of doc could be caused by the mobilization of degraded organic materials in the shallow organic rich surface layer of forest soils wetlands and peatlands upstream of t1 e g leaf leachates and dissolved particles such mobilization of organic materials may be driven by large volume of overland flow during the late spring freshet following the melting of large amounts of snow o donnell et al 2010 wickland et al 2012 cade menun et al 2013 yi et al 2015 cuss et al 2019 the molecular mass size i e mp of dom and degree of aromaticity e g suva254 were higher in spring compared to the fall suggesting that additional high molecular weight aromatic carbon from terrestrial sources was transported into the river during spring freshet such relationships between size suva254 season and source have been previously noted miller and mcknight 2010 wickland et al 2012 the doc normalized fmax values of all parafac components c1 c8 were lower in the fall compared to the spring fig 3c consistent with the findings of walker et al 2013 it should be noted that the extent of the increase of c7 and c8 e g 2 5 times between fall and spring was much higher than that of c1 c6 e g 1 5 2 5 times the increase of c1 c6 suggests terrestrial dom inputs from the flushing of soils richer in humic like components into rivers during spring freshet but the more elevated protein like fluorescence could be attributed to ice melt wherein fluorescence is dominantly protein like as shown by hood et al 2009 and mann et al 2012 additionally it is unlikely that snow contributed a considerable dom fingerprint to the lar since the dom composition of snow and surface waters in the athabasca oil sands region was found to be quite distinct yi et al 2015 thus the increase of c7 and c8 could also result from the long residence time and increased microbial processing of dom in snow or by the preferential adsorption of aromatic moieties to inorganic particle surfaces during transport into the river striegl et al 2005 mann et al 2012 protein like fluorescence could also be contributed by the flushing of leaf needle litter and associated leachates into the river after degradation by several freeze thaw cycles cuss and guéguen 2013 the absence of tyrosine like fluorophores in the lar during the spring period could be explained by its rapid biogeochemical transformation or physical mixing with other organic matter pools within the stream channel masking its spectral signature barker et al 2013 4 2 2 spatial variations in dom quality varying dom quality was also observed along the river during the late snowmelt period e g t1 t2 compare fig 3g h similar to the fall dom quality at t1 was largely uniform and was distinct from other mainstem sites in contrast the quality of dom changed significantly between t1 and the east side and middle of t2 fig 3g similar to the fall this pattern reflected the role of tributary inputs in altering dom quality e g compare t1 and cl on fig 3g and in table 1 it was also observed that the contribution of the parafac derived components e g c7 and c8 increased significantly from t1 to t2 on the west side and showed a significantly negative correlation with hix p 0 001 see fig s7 given that c8 was previously found in recycled water treatment plants fig s6 murphy et al 2011 it was speculated that another unique dom source upstream from t2 on the west side of the lar may have a local impact on dom quality such as the wastewater treatment plant or other industries scores on the middle and east sides of t2 were mixed with those of t3 t5 at sites downstream of t3 there was no apparent trend in dom quality indicators from east to west or from upstream to downstream this is likely due to faster mixing in the spring caused by higher flow rates and greater turbulence combined with the overwhelming effect of snowmelt yi et al 2015 4 3 behavior of dom in mixing zones our data clearly showed changing patterns of dom along and across the lar as a result of tributary inputs in the fall fig 4c generally the behavior of dom at the ar hr transect largely reflected conservative transport however the samples of hr hr were collected only over a distance of 5 km before merging with the cl outflow which does not allow much time for degradation or adsorption moreira turcq et al 2003 mann et al 2012 walker et al 2013 therefore we reason that variations in dom quality on the hr hr side were largely a result of physical mixing processes along the shoreline e g dilution and no evidence of dom loss or degradation highlighting that dom can be used as a conservative tracer during mixing processes over short distances mass balance calculations are generally necessary for defining the conservative mixing as balance is a required condition for conservative mixing transport the mass balance calculations on dom quality measurements greatly support the conservative mixing of dom at confluences in the lar between t1 and t5 table 4 notably contrasting mixing patterns of dom were found between the cl and hr mixing transects that is changes of dom quality were mainly found on the ar cl side instead of the tributary side e g cl cl roughly following the order of ar01 cl ar03 cl ar04 cl ar02 cl and ar05 cl as they moved downstream fig 4c however dom quality did not change markedly on the cl cl side for more than 40 km in the fall fig 1b 4c these differences between the hr and cl transects reflected delayed mixing processes owing to differences in river geomorphology and associated variables known to affect mixing at large river confluences generally the bed height discordance was greater at hr that is the depth at inflow was shallower than the lar at hr but it was similar at the cl the volumetric flow rate at hr was also lower so that upwelling from the lar underneath the hr inflow caused faster mixing rutherford 1994 gaudet and roy 1995 parsons et al 2008 moreover it is likely that the shear layer of cl was primarily vertical because the influx from the cl and its associated depth were sufficient to penetrate beyond the sloping shoreline as such the shear forces that are caused by friction with the riverbanks would be dispersed at the shear layer rutherford 1994 parsons et al 2008 additionally the junction angle for cl vs lar i e right angle see fig 1d c is higher than that of the confluence angle of the hr mixing zone i e acute angle see fig 1b these underlying mechanisms are responsible for the contrasting patterns of mixing zones between the cl and hr mixing transects cuss et al 2020a along the mainstem side of ar sb mixing zone dom quality was highly heterogeneous fig 1f 4c however sb sb01 was well separated from the others suggesting a faster mixing rate between sb and the lar relative to that of hr which could be attributed to the high junction angle and the high shear forces between the sb and the mainstem parsons et al 2008 during the period following snowmelt mixing patterns differed from those in fall fewer progressive changes of dom were observed along the ar cl mixing transect while the score clusters of samples from ar cl and cl cl were partially separated some portion was also overlapping fig 4d the scores of ar cl were quite spread out across the pc2 direction of the plot whereas cl cl were tightly clustered this suggests faster mixing in the spring possibly due to the occurrence of more turbulence similar to the fall the progressive dom quality change at the hr hr side was a major source of variation with an order of hr01 hr hr02 hr hr04 hr hr05 hr and hr03 hr the patterns of dom at the ar hr were heterogeneous for the ar sb mixing zone dom quality at the mainstem side was relatively uniform but the sb sb side was not a general trend could be roughly derived as the quality of dom in sb sb samples progressively changed towards that of the mainstem suggesting progressive dilution by the lar interestingly given that sb is also shallow and the flow is relatively low similar mixing behavior to the hr is expected parsons et al 2008 taken together we highlight that hydrological conditions e g spring freshet and river geomorphology collectively affect the mixing e g at near confluences and transport of dom in the lar and thus remains suspended to exert influence upon downstream water quality mass balance calculations on dom quality measurements in spring showed conservative behavior of dom in the lar as the calculated values at t5 e g doc greatly matched those of measured values see table 4 in addition to these mass balance results the primary principal components for dom properties along transects explained the patterns of mixing between the mainstem and major tributaries the loadings on variables for these pcs were also remarkably similar for the distinct samples and pca analyses for the transects and the mixing zones hence these tributary inputs were the primary source of variation in dom quality along this stretch of the lar 4 4 environmental implications boreal systems play a key role in the global carbon cycle and are experiencing rapid changes as a result of climate change e g rising runoff hutchins et al 2019 examining the key factors that regulate the variability of dom sources and transport in this biome would thus strengthen our ability to predict the transformations and associated changes in its roles within these complex fluvial networks hutchins et al 2019 gómez gener et al 2020 tributaries in the lar drain a large area of wetlands and peatlands where large amounts of aromatic dom can be generated khadka et al 2016 the export of dom largely depends on annual precipitation and runoff making waterborne release pathways a key driver of the downstream carbon pool michaelson et al 1998 jager et al 2009 walker et al 2013 broder et al 2017 conservative and delayed mixing was suggested by the concentration and dom quality gradients in both seasons strengthening our ability to distinguish mixing trends between the mainstem and the tributaries for dom under different hydrological conditions the conservative behavior of dom during mixing also highlights that terrestrial dom has great potential to be transported downstream instead of undergoing sedimentation in large boreal rivers such a pattern is arguably more important at the global scale as it may be intensified with global warming and associated increases in precipitation and runoff hutchins et al 2019 however the potential for continued conservation of aromatic rich terrestrial dom during downstream transport could be limited by photochemical transformation depending upon the depth of light penetration and the degree to which the water column mixes mackay 1970 li et al 2019 simon et al 2019 future studies are thus needed to fully understand the evolution of terrestrial dom downstream of confluences in large boreal rivers 5 conclusions the integration of high resolution sampling has facilitated the resolution of dom sources and mixing processes in a large boreal river i e lar by measuring the size and optical properties of dom results showed that dom quality shifted progressively along the lar due largely to inputs of terrestrial aromatic carbon from wetlands and peatlands through major tributaries such as the clearwater r this dom was dispersed across the river flowing downstream higher levels of doc and greater degrees of humification and aromaticity were observed seasonal variations of dom quality in the lar were observed as a result of spring freshet during which dom tended to be higher in molecular mass and richer in protein like components c7 c8 compared with humic like components c1 c6 source discrimination of dom was thus more obvious under base flow condition relative to the snowmelt period progressive changes in dom quality on the ar cl and hr hr sides were largely a result of physical mixing along the shoreline e g dilution with no evidence of dom loss or degradation the delayed mixing of dom was apparent at confluences especially in both fall and spring and dom can thus be used as a conservative tracer during mixing at large confluences in the lar contrasting mixing patterns in different mixing transects suggested that hydrological conditions e g spring freshet and river geomorphology collectively affect the mixing of dom between the lar and its tributaries such findings will enhance our ability to determine sources of dom and to distinguish mixing trends between the mainstem and the tributaries for dom associated trace elements moreover given that boreal systems are experiencing significant changes due to climate change e g rising precipitation and runoff the impact of the various mixing regimes on the behavior of riverine dom is

simon et al 2019 this lack of knowledge to a great extent limits the discrimination of sources of dom at regional and global scales for instance the quality of dom from its sources may not persist

are scarce the objectives of the study were 1 to determine the major sources of dom along a 125 km stretch of a large boreal river namely the lower athabasca river lar by measuring its size and optical properties in two different seasons i e fall and spring and 2 to assess if dom behaves conservatively during mixing in the lar at near confluences 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the athabasca river originates at the glaciers of the columbia icefields in jasper national park and extends over 1200 km before emptying into lake athabasca from here waters flow to the mackenzie river and into the arctic ocean the lar is the reach of the river starting downstream of fort mcmurray 56 7267 n 111 3790 w and flowing toward the mouth of the athabasca river fig 1a the lar has received considerable attention due to its complex hydrological and geochemical setting and concerns of potential contamination by metals and organic pollutants from the canadian oil sands industry shotyk et al 2017 sun et al 2017 lima and wrona 2019 tributaries of the lar are characterized by elevated dom concentrations largely due to the abundance of peatlands in their drainage basins guéguen et al 2012 cuss et al 2019 delayed mixing between tributaries and the lar has been observed where the mixing zones coincide with the oil sands industry potentially rendering source discrimination of dom difficult cuss et al 2020a spring freshet between april and june may significantly alter the concentration and properties of dom given changes in flow rate and turbidity both in the lar and its tributaries yi et al 2015 cuss et al 2019 2020b as a result of the annual hydrological cycle in the lar fig s1 major inputs of dom are expected to be different between fall and spring for instance dom inputs in fall are dominated by tributaries and groundwaters in contrast spring freshet exerts more influence in april may potentially carrying a unique dom fingerprint from snowmelt and runoff thus the lar serves as an ideal setting for tracking the sources and evolution of dom from terrestrial boreal landscapes to the receiving freshwater ecosystems downstream during mixing with tributaries and potential pollution from the oil sands industry under different hydrological regimes 2 2 sample collection representative field campaigns occurred in the fall of 2018 sept 25 oct 03 and spring of 2019

weishaar et al 2003 we also calculated the e2 e3 ratio e2 e3 as the absorbance at 254 nm divided by that at 365 nm notably e2 e3 ratios can not only serve as molecular weight proxies peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 ågren et al 2008 but also show correlations with the quantum yields of singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 dalrymple et al 2010 thus e2 e3 can be a potentially valuable index

minimum stedmon and bro 2008 the fmax values from each component were normalized to the corresponding doc concentration of the sample to eliminate concentration biases from the parafac model and the subsequent principal component analysis pca korak et al 2014 burns et al 2016 the resulting parafac components were compared using comparafac parr et al 2014 through which quantitative comparisons were conducted with 38 additional parafac models using a modified tucker s congruence coefficient mtcc table s1 moreover spectra of components were uploaded into the online spectral database openfluor for quantitative comparison with all published spectra in the database fig s5 murphy et al 2014 it is well known that certain parameters like ph ionic strength and iron concentration can affect dom fluorescence poulin et al 2014 zhang and he 2015 given comparable conditions in the lar and tributaries we reasoned that these parameters would exert little influence on fluorescence the ph of samples from the lar and tributaries were similar ranging from 8 0 to 8 7 and dom fluorescence is not likely to be altered guéguen et al 2012 the electrical conductivities of samples also were not markedly different given the similar fe dom ratio in the lar and insensitivity of eems for parafac modeling poulin et al 2014 any alteration of dom spectra by fe concentration was also considered insignificant

including the log transformation for doc a254 c1 c2 c5 and c7 and the cubic root transformation for c8 outliers and normality tests were performed using grubb s test and the kolmogorov smirnov test at

the spearman s correlation matrices are provided in support of the pca analyses three and two outliers were detected for the mainstem and tributaries and mixing zone data sets respectively however these values reflected correct measurements and natural levels of variation in the system conducting the pca analyses with and without the outliers also revealed that these values exerted little influence on both the variation explained by and the loadings of most principal components pcs 3 results 3 1 concentration size and optical properties of dom tables 1 and 2 provide statistical data

of variations in fix mp and suva254 fig 3d spatial variations e g east vs west sides and t1 t5 in dom quality in the lar were to a large extent described within the 2d space of pc1 and pc2 in both seasons fig 3a b 3e h the simultaneous detection and visualization of these primary sources of variation across numerous correlated variables highlight the value of using pca for this complex dataset in the fall samples from t1 n 8 and west of t2 n 3 were well separated from the other samples with elevated doc concentration and optical indicator values e g hix as well as doc normalized humic like components fig 3e and table 1 indeed there was a clear gradient of scores at t2 running from the east side n 3 close to cl through the middle n 2 over to the west side in the fall clustered with t1 fig 3e from the lower right hand side to the upper left hand side the scores of samples collected from the west side of t3 n 3 were also clustered nearer to these west side and upstream samples compared to the east side n 2 and middle n 3 whereas scores of these latter samples plotted closer to those from the east side of t2 in addition the scores of several tributaries i e er mur cl tar and pr plotted relatively close to those of the mainstem the score of cl was particularly close to those of t2 east and t3 east and middle for downstream sites t4 n 6 and t5 n 9 scores of samples were largely grouped together halfway between those of the cl and t1 fig 3e showing elevated concentrations of doc and doc normalized c1 c6 as well as greater degrees of humification and aromaticity relative to that of upstream in the spring scores of samples from t1 n 9 were still largely clustered and scores for samples from the west of t2 n 3 were also well separated from those of the middle and east side n 5 fig 3g notably the score cluster of samples from the west side of t2 largely deviated from those of t1 in spring with increased c7 c8 and mp in contrast to the fall scores for samples from t3 n 9 t4 n 9 and t5 n 9 were more spread out on pc1 and pc2 but lacked any major organization from east to west or upstream to downstream in general it was found that elevated doc concentration and optical indicator values e g hix as well as doc normalized humic like components occurred in downstream transects figs 3c and 3g table 1 although the score of cl was much closer to those of the east and middle sides of t2 relative to the west and the scores of t3 t5 largely remained between cl and t1 along the mixing axis that was apparent for the fall scores of most tributary samples were separated from those of the mainstem with four exceptions mlc er mur and cl fig 3g quality measurements of dom of these tributaries were detailed in table 2 fig s7 shows the spearman s correlation matrix between the concentration of doc and the size and optical properties of dom upon which the pca analysis was based 3 3 dom in mixing zones the first two pcs were selected for the pca analysis based on the scree plot fig s6b accounting for 79 5 of the total variance fig 4 scores on pc1 largely distinguished samples from different mixing transects in both the fall and the spring fig

fall 0 vs spring 0 fig 4a seasonal variability i e pc2 was driven to a great extent by c7 c8 mp bix and hix fig 4b which were higher in the spring compared to the fall difference along pc2 also contributed to the differentiation of samples along the ar cl mixing transect in the fall fig 4c fig s8 shows the spearman s correlation matrix between the concentration of doc and the size and optical properties of dom for mixing zones upon which the pca analysis was based in the fall scores of samples from different sides of mixing transects were well differentiated e g ar cl vs cl cl and ar hr vs hr hr referring to mainstem vs tributary sides along each tributary mixing transect except that the clusters of scores from ar sb and sb sb were partially overlapping fig 4c on the mainstem side the scores of ar cl samples n 10 were largely mixed with the score cluster of ar hr n 8 also scores of samples at the end of the cl mixing zone e g ar cl05 were mixed with ar sb samples e g ar sb02 in general scores of ar cl showed progressive changes during mixing on pc1 and pc2 except for ar cl02 scores of ar sb samples n 8 were located close to scores of cl cl samples n 10 on the tributary side the score clusters from cl cl and the majority of sb sb except for the sb sb01 sample were grouped together on pc1 the scores of hr hr n 5 were well separated from those of cl cl and sb sb n 7 and showed progressive changes during mixing becoming more similar to scores from the lar side of mixing transects in the spring the differentiation of scores from samples at different sides i e the mainstem and the tributary side of the mixing zone was not as clear as in fall fig 4d scores of samples from different sides of the hr and sb mixing zones were largely differentiated while the clusters of scores from ar cl and cl cl were partially overlapping on the mainstem side scores of ar hr n 10 partially mixed with those of ar cl and ar sb n 8 fig 4d the distribution of scores of ar hr was heterogeneous along pc2 and no progressive pattern during mixing was observed scores of ar cl n 12 were largely mixed with those of ar sb and partially mixed with those of hr hr and sb sb the majority of ar sb scores were located close to those of cl cl n 12 and those scores were also partially mixed with those of hr hr on the tributary side scores of hr hr samples n 10 were mixed with those of sb sb n 5 but they were largely separated from those of cl cl fig 4d notably the scores of hr hr changed progressively along pc1 during mixing becoming more similar to the lar side of the mixing transects in contrast the changing pattern of sb sb scores was not progressive during mixing results from mass balance calculations for dom quality measurements of the lar and its three major tributaries i e hr cl and mkr showed that the calculated values greatly matched those of the measured values for all selected parameters for the fall and spring see table 4 4 discussion 4 1 dom sources during base flow here in depth interpretations of major dom sources are compared during both base flow conditions and snowmelt such information forms a basis for the discussion of mixing patterns under distinct hydrological conditions to examine probable dom inputs e g tributaries and groundwaters we first studied variations in dom quality in the fall in the absence of the influence of snowmelt and associated runoff 4 1 1 upstream of industry at t1 dom quality was largely uniform on the west middle and east sides of the river suggesting that the river was well mixed at this transect table 1 fig 3e moving downstream to t2 the dom on the west side shared similar size and optical properties to those of t1 fig 3e highlighting the conservative behavior of dom over this 20 km distance i e a negligible chemical modification of dom composition stedmon and markager 2003 holmes et al 2008 wickland et al 2012 from the west side to the east side of t2 the concentration of doc degree of humification cdom a254 doc normalized concentrations of c1 c6 i e humic like and aromaticity increased fig 3c 3e but the proportion of fresh dom bix decreased this trend points to inputs of allochthonous dom from dom rich tributaries on the east side of the river e g horse r and clearwater r fig 1a yi et al 2015 cuss et al 2018 2019 in addition the score of the cl sample was more similar to those of the east side at t2 relative to that of the hr fig 3e such a pattern indicates that dom from the hr had properties that were very distinct from transect t1 and the west side of transect t2 interestingly the scores associated with dom in the middle of t2 were between scores for the west and east suggesting the dilution of dom during the mixing of the tributaries and the mainstem 4 1 2 midstream flowing downstream to t3 similar to t2 scores from samples collected from the west side were well separated from those of the middle and east fig 3e the quality of dom on the west at t3 also exhibited some similarity to t1 and the west side of t2 but the points were not closely clustered such that one was more similar to the middle at t2 such patterns suggest that dom may have partially dispersed from the middle of t2 masking the original dom quality on the west side fig 1a the quality of dom in the east and middle sides of t3 resembled that of the east of t2 indicating the negligible role of mlc in altering dom quality at the east side of the lar between t2 and t3 fig 1a and the delayed mixing behavior of hr and cl along the lar that leads to similar gradients in trace element concentrations across the river cuss et al 2020a 4 1 3 downstream of industry moving downstream of industry samples from t4 had similar dom composition to those from t5 and their scores were tightly clustered approximately half way between t1 and cl however one sample from the west side was separated from the others i e 0 3 3 5 m fig 3e this surface sample tended to have a larger terrestrial dom fingerprint indicated by elevated hix and lower bix fig 3c but was characterized by lower fluorescence intensities on c1 c8 these differences suggest a unique local dom source with properties similar to cl but with minimal influence on downstream dom quality at t5 fig 3e altogether dom downstream e g t4 and t5 was characterized by higher concentrations of doc greater doc normalized concentrations of c1 c6 and greater degrees of humification and aromaticity compared with that of upstream fig 3c taken together these changes reflect the significant impact of terrestrial dom inputs from wetlands and peatlands by tributaries such as the cl and hr on dom quality downstream 4 1 4 natural vs industrial inputs the dom quality along and across the river became increasingly similar to tributaries from upstream to downstream specifically the clearwater r contributed large amounts of terrestrial dom relative to other major tributaries as a result of higher discharge to the lar which ultimately changed the nature of dom in the river compared to the dom with lower aromaticity from upstream i e 127 and 14 m3 s 1 for cl and hr respectively fig 3e also the ells pierre and tar rivers were much closer to those of t4 and t5 suggesting a probable dom source on the west side of the ar downstream of t3 these west side inputs upstream of t4 may have obscured differences with the middle and east sides limiting detection of delayed mixing across the lar at t4 in fall 2018 the scores from beaver r and mclean creek which flow through the operational areas for the oil sands industry were grouped together far away from those of the mainstem and the other tributaries fig 3e indicating unique dom quality this conclusion is consistent with the findings of sun et al 2017 who claimed that the naphthenic acids in beaver r and mclean creek had a detectably greater similarity to oil sands process affected water and other natural bitumen impacted waters distinguishing them from the natural naphthenic acids present in other tributaries given recent advances in disentangling organic fingerprints for natural bitumen impacted groundwater and oil sands process affected water ahad et al 2020 hewitt et al 2020 additional study is needed for a clear understanding of the dominant sources of dom in beaver r and mclean creek in order to assess the potential influence of the oil sands industry on the local water quality cuss et al 2019 found that both saline and non saline groundwaters were marked by a high proportion of protein like fluorescent components likely contributed by autochthonous dom sources e g microorganisms although groundwater samples were not studied here the trend of dom towards a more humified composition from upstream to downstream suggests that groundwater inputs i e largely involving protein like fluorescent signatures were not a major source of dom in the lar fig 3e 4 2 snowmelt and its effect on dom quality 4 2 1 changes in dom quality from fall to spring in addition to spatial variations in dom quality observed under baseflow condition a large difference in dom quality was observed between base flow conditions in fall and the period following spring snowmelt fig 3a the spring freshet is a major hydrological event in the annual water cycle of the lar fig s1 woo and thorne 2003 yi et al 2015 generally flushing the river and carrying a unique dom fingerprint ågren et al 2008 cao et al 2016 the t1 site was valuable for comparing changes in dom quality in the mainstem between spring and fall before the introduction of dom from the major tributaries studied here e g hr and cl and potential influences from industry and other tributaries downstream elevated concentrations of doc were observed in the late part of the snowmelt period table 1 consistent with previous studies findlay and sinsabaugh 2003 avagyan et al 2016 given that snow normally contains very low concentrations of doc wallis et al 1981 yi et al 2015 the elevated levels of doc could be caused by the mobilization of degraded organic materials in the shallow organic rich surface layer of forest soils wetlands and peatlands upstream of t1 e g leaf leachates and dissolved particles such mobilization of organic materials may be driven by large volume of overland flow during the late spring freshet following the melting of large amounts of snow o donnell et al 2010 wickland et al 2012 cade menun et al 2013 yi et al 2015 cuss et al 2019 the molecular mass size i e mp of dom and degree of aromaticity e g suva254 were higher in spring compared to the fall suggesting that additional high molecular weight aromatic carbon from terrestrial sources was transported into the river during spring freshet such relationships between size suva254 season and source have been previously noted miller and mcknight 2010 wickland et al 2012 the doc normalized fmax values of all parafac components c1 c8 were lower in the fall compared to the spring fig 3c consistent with the findings of walker et al 2013 it should be noted that the extent of the increase of c7 and c8 e g 2 5 times between fall and spring was much higher than that of c1 c6 e g 1 5 2 5 times the increase of c1 c6 suggests terrestrial dom inputs from the flushing of soils richer in humic like components into rivers during spring freshet but the more elevated protein like fluorescence could be attributed to ice melt wherein fluorescence is dominantly protein like as shown by hood et al 2009 and mann et al 2012 additionally it is unlikely that snow contributed a considerable dom fingerprint to the lar since the dom composition of snow and surface waters in the athabasca oil sands region was found to be quite distinct yi et al 2015 thus the increase of c7 and c8 could also result from the long residence time and increased microbial processing of dom in snow or by the preferential adsorption of aromatic moieties to inorganic particle surfaces during transport into the river striegl et al 2005 mann et al 2012 protein like fluorescence could also be contributed by the flushing of leaf needle litter and associated leachates into the river after degradation by several freeze thaw cycles cuss and guéguen 2013 the absence of tyrosine like fluorophores in the lar during the spring period could be explained by its rapid biogeochemical transformation or physical mixing with other organic matter pools within the stream channel masking its spectral signature barker et al 2013 4 2 2 spatial variations in dom quality varying dom quality was also observed along the river during the late snowmelt period e g t1 t2 compare fig 3g h similar to the fall dom quality at t1 was largely uniform and was distinct from other mainstem sites in contrast the quality of dom changed significantly between t1 and the east side and middle of t2 fig 3g similar to the fall this pattern reflected the role of tributary inputs in altering dom quality e g compare t1 and cl on fig 3g and in table 1 it was also observed that the contribution of the parafac derived components e g c7 and c8 increased significantly from t1 to t2 on the west side and showed a significantly negative correlation with hix p 0 001 see fig s7 given that c8 was previously found in recycled water treatment plants fig s6 murphy et al 2011 it was speculated that another unique dom source upstream from t2 on the west side of the lar may have a local impact on dom quality such as the wastewater treatment plant or other industries scores on the middle and east sides of t2 were mixed with those of t3 t5 at sites downstream of t3 there was no apparent trend in dom quality indicators from east to west or from upstream to downstream this is likely due to faster mixing in the spring caused by higher flow rates and greater turbulence combined with the overwhelming effect of snowmelt yi et al 2015 4 3 behavior of dom in mixing zones our data clearly showed changing patterns of dom along and across the lar as a result of tributary inputs in the fall fig 4c generally the behavior of dom at the ar hr transect largely reflected conservative transport however the samples of hr hr were collected only over a distance of 5 km before merging with the cl outflow which does not allow much time for degradation or adsorption moreira turcq et al 2003 mann et al 2012 walker et al 2013 therefore we reason that variations in dom quality on the hr hr side were largely a result of physical mixing processes along the shoreline e g dilution and no evidence of dom loss or degradation highlighting that dom can be used as a conservative tracer during mixing processes over short distances mass balance calculations are generally necessary for defining the conservative mixing as balance is a required condition for conservative mixing transport the mass balance calculations on dom quality measurements greatly support the conservative mixing of dom at confluences in the lar between t1 and t5 table 4 notably contrasting mixing patterns of dom were found between the cl and hr mixing transects that is changes of dom quality were mainly found on the ar cl side instead of the tributary side e g cl cl roughly following the order of ar01 cl ar03 cl ar04 cl ar02 cl and ar05 cl as they moved downstream fig 4c however dom quality did not change markedly on the cl cl side for more than 40 km in the fall fig 1b 4c these differences between the hr and cl transects reflected delayed mixing processes owing to differences in river geomorphology and associated variables known to affect mixing at large river confluences generally the bed height discordance was greater at hr that is the depth at inflow was shallower than the lar at hr but it was similar at the cl the volumetric flow rate at hr was also lower so that upwelling from the lar underneath the hr inflow caused faster mixing rutherford 1994 gaudet and roy 1995 parsons et al 2008 moreover it is likely that the shear layer of cl was primarily vertical because the influx from the cl and its associated depth were sufficient to penetrate beyond the sloping shoreline as such the shear forces that are caused by friction with the riverbanks would be dispersed at the shear layer rutherford 1994 parsons et al 2008 additionally the junction angle for cl vs lar i e right angle see fig 1d c is higher than that of the confluence angle of the hr mixing zone i e acute angle see fig 1b these underlying mechanisms are responsible for the contrasting patterns of mixing zones between the cl and hr mixing transects cuss et al 2020a along the mainstem side of ar sb mixing zone dom quality was highly heterogeneous fig 1f 4c however sb sb01 was well separated from the others suggesting a faster mixing rate between sb and the lar relative to that of hr which could be attributed to the high junction angle and the high shear forces between the sb and the mainstem parsons et al 2008 during the period following snowmelt mixing patterns differed from those in fall fewer progressive changes of dom were observed along the ar cl mixing transect while the score clusters of samples from ar cl and cl cl were partially separated some portion was also overlapping fig 4d the scores of ar cl were quite spread out across the pc2 direction of the plot whereas cl cl were tightly clustered this suggests faster mixing in the spring possibly due to the occurrence of more turbulence similar to the fall the progressive dom quality change at the hr hr side was a major source of variation with an order of hr01 hr hr02 hr hr04 hr hr05 hr and hr03 hr the patterns of dom at the ar hr were heterogeneous for the ar sb mixing zone dom quality at the mainstem side was relatively uniform but the sb sb side was not a general trend could be roughly derived as the quality of dom in sb sb samples progressively changed towards that of the mainstem suggesting progressive dilution by the lar interestingly given that sb is also shallow and the flow is relatively low similar mixing behavior to the hr is expected parsons et al 2008 taken together we highlight that hydrological conditions e g spring freshet and river geomorphology collectively affect the mixing e g at near confluences and transport of dom in the lar and thus remains suspended to exert influence upon downstream water quality mass balance calculations on dom quality measurements in spring showed conservative behavior of dom in the lar as the calculated values at t5 e g doc greatly matched those of measured values see table 4 in addition to these mass balance results the primary principal components for dom properties along transects explained the patterns of mixing between the mainstem and major tributaries the loadings on variables for these pcs were also remarkably similar for the distinct samples and pca analyses for the transects and the mixing zones hence these tributary inputs were the primary source of variation in dom quality along this stretch of the lar 4 4 environmental implications boreal systems play a key role in the global carbon cycle and are experiencing rapid changes as a result of climate change e g rising runoff hutchins et al 2019 examining the key factors that regulate the variability of dom sources and transport in this biome would thus strengthen our ability to predict the transformations and associated changes in its roles within these complex fluvial networks hutchins et al 2019 gómez gener et al 2020 tributaries in the lar drain a large area of wetlands and peatlands where large amounts of aromatic dom can be generated khadka et al 2016 the export of dom largely depends on annual precipitation and runoff making waterborne release pathways a key driver of the downstream carbon pool michaelson et al 1998 jager et al 2009 walker et al 2013 broder et al 2017 conservative and delayed mixing was suggested by the concentration and dom quality gradients in both seasons strengthening our ability to distinguish mixing trends between the mainstem and the tributaries for dom under different hydrological conditions the conservative behavior of dom during mixing also highlights that terrestrial dom has great potential to be transported downstream instead of undergoing sedimentation in large boreal rivers such a pattern is arguably more important at the global scale as it may be intensified with global warming and associated increases in precipitation and runoff hutchins et al 2019 however the potential for continued conservation of aromatic rich terrestrial dom during downstream transport could be limited by photochemical transformation depending upon the depth of light penetration and the degree to which the water column mixes mackay 1970 li et al 2019 simon et al 2019 future studies are thus needed to fully understand the evolution of terrestrial dom downstream of confluences in large boreal rivers 5 conclusions the integration of high resolution sampling has facilitated the resolution of dom sources and mixing processes in a large boreal river i e lar by measuring the size and optical properties of dom results showed that dom quality shifted progressively along the lar due largely to inputs of terrestrial aromatic carbon from wetlands and peatlands through major tributaries such as the clearwater r this dom was dispersed across the river flowing downstream higher levels of doc and greater degrees of humification and aromaticity were observed seasonal variations of dom quality in the lar were observed as a result of spring freshet during which dom tended to be higher in molecular mass and richer in protein like components c7 c8 compared with humic like components c1 c6 source discrimination of dom was thus more obvious under base flow condition relative to the snowmelt period progressive changes in dom quality on the ar cl and hr hr sides were largely a result of physical mixing along the shoreline e g dilution with no evidence of dom loss or degradation the delayed mixing of dom was apparent at confluences especially in both fall and spring and dom can thus be used as a conservative tracer during mixing at large confluences in the lar contrasting mixing patterns in different mixing transects suggested that hydrological conditions e g spring freshet and river geomorphology collectively affect the mixing of dom between the lar and its tributaries such findings will enhance our ability to determine sources of dom and to distinguish mixing trends between the mainstem and the tributaries for dom associated trace elements moreover given that boreal systems are experiencing significant changes due to climate change e g rising precipitation and runoff the impact of the various mixing regimes on the behavior of riverine dom is

8044,study region across northern alberta canada patterned rich fens with high concentrations of base cations high ph and high species richness are important landscape features mcclelland wetland is one of the largest representatives of this peatland type study focus we explored the surficial water chemistry and plant community patterns through a grid of 64 plots placed within a patterned rich fen of 420 ha new hydrological insights for the region plant communities and individual species abundances are tightly associated with surface water chemistry and water levels influenced by inflowing waters from surrounding mineral soils based on location and string flark size and orientation five spatial areas are recognized to occur in the fen spatial areas located in the northern portion of the fen have different water chemistry and plant communities than spatial areas of the center and southern portions of the fen the water chemistry of the northern spatial areas contains about one half of the cation concentrations than those from the southern spatial areas and the stoichiometry of the water is different between these regions of the fen distributions of dominant plant species are associated with differing water chemistries and separated by a narrow transition zone water sourced from different areas of the surrounding watershed largely control the water chemistry and plant distributions within the patterned area graphical abstract ga1 keywords alberta boreal hydrology mcclelland wetland monitoring moss peatland patterned fen rich fen scorpidium scorpioides 1 introduction large peatland complexes are an important part of canada s western boreal forest region and consist of mixtures of ombrogenous bogs and minerogenous fens when the complexes occur on shallow drainage divides or on gentle slopes inflowing to lakes fens consist of linearly merged hummocks strings alternating with linearly merged hollows or flarks andersson and hesselmann 1907 oriented along topographic contours of the peatland slope these patterned fens occur across the northern boreal zone and have been documented in north america heinselmann 1963 foster and king 1984 foster et al 1988 glaser et al 1981 1990 1992a 1992b robitaille et al 2021 europe sjörs 1961 ruuhijärvi 1983 asia sakaguchi 1980 botch and mansing 1983 and in the southern hemisphere in new zealand mark et al 1995 and africa backeus 1989 the morphology of alternating dry strings with wet flarks is thought to develop from the run off effect mainly due to melt water from the spring freshet coupled with snow melt flooding across the peatland while the water remains frozen in the upper peat column ruuhijärvi 1983 seppäla and koutaniemi 1985 maintenance of the string flark pattern has been modeled from the combined effects of differential nutrient accumulation in the strings rietkirk et al 2004 water ponding due to differential hydraulic conductivities of strings and flarks kulczynski 1949 and differential peat accumulation due to limits on plant growth belyea and clymo 2001 and summarized by eppinga et al 2009 in western canada as elsewhere patterned fens can be sphagnum dominated with acidic waters poor fens vitt et al 1975 graham et al 2015 or true moss dominated with basic and alkaline waters rich fens slack et al 1980 yu et al 2003 hartsock et al 2021 although rare on the western canadian landscape sodic fens can be patterned and dominated by vascular plants wells and price 2015 volik et al 2017 using ordination and direct gradient analysis along the bog rich fen gradient glaser et al 1992a demonstrated the close relationship between abundance of vascular plants and landform forest spring fen string or flark and secondarily by water chemistry ph and ca2 utilizing similar approaches but confining the analysis to individual patterned fens vitt et al 1975 and slack et al 1980 showed similar close relationships between species abundances and mesohabitat string flark and water chemistry these close linkages between species occurrences and abundance patterns with water chemistry were especially close for species of bryophytes that dominate the ground layer in both poor fens and rich fens as with all minerogenous fens the water quality especially base cations and ph determines peatland site type in minnesota glaser et al 1992b reported that patterned fens are associated with highly permeable sandy outwash and beach deposits whereas areas with high abundance of bogs are associated with relatively impermeable clayey or loamy soils in boreal alberta acidic poor fens most often occur at higher elevations on low drainage divides underlain with sandy soils e g vitt et al 1975 nicholson and vitt 1990 whereas rich fens occur at lower elevations influenced by water in contact with glacial overburden rich in calcareous ground water vitt et al 1975 hence the type of surrounding substrate may directly influence the source water chemistry and affect the distribution of plant species within the fen and ultimately influence plant community composition and occurrence malmer 1986 at the regional scale the relationships between species occurrences and chemical and hydrological gradients have been examined for a number of wetland species bryophytes gignac et al 1991a 1992b sedges gignac et al 2004 but at the local scale species distributions within complex peatland landforms have rarely been quantitatively documented a study by graham et al 2015 clearly demonstrated the close spatial ties between species distributions and chemical and hydrological gradients for a poor fen bog complex in northeastern alberta however we know of no studies for rich fens nor for patterned fens documenting these responses of vegetation to hydrological and chemical gradients is a key component to conservation management and effective reclamation of disturbed boreal wetlands especially for both poor and rich fens that are the most abundant peatland site types on the northern alberta landscape vitt et al 1997 the rich fen studied here lies at the edge of oil sands development in northern alberta where large scale open pit mining has greatly disturbed the landscape in order to better provide direction to future wetland reclamation in the region these vegetation environmental relationships need to be well understood one approach the one taken here is to intensively examine one large peatland complex our study site mcclelland wetland figs 1 2 is one of the largest patterned fens of the region and is influenced by alkaline waters that characterize rich fens as part of future oil sands site development the western portion of the wetland is scheduled for excavation as part of planned oil sands procurement the eastern portion of the wetland is to be maintained in a natural state however the technical challenges to maintaining this portion of wetland are enormous and rely on a thorough understanding of the hydrological and chemical constraints that may affect the functioning and structure of the plant communities and wetland in this study our overall objective is to provide a detailed understanding of how hydrological and chemical gradients influence plant abundances and distributions across the patterned undisturbed area of mcclelland fen in particular we present two hypotheses 1 both hydrological and chemical gradients and plant communities have distinct spatial distributions across the fen and 2 there are close linkages between hydrological and chemical gradients and plant communities and their distributions in order to examine these two hypotheses we provide a detailed assessment of the distributions of these environmental and plant community variables and develop an assessment framework that provides the basis for future monitoring against changing environmental conditions 2 methods 2 1 study site the study site is located at 57º27 01 81

contained within the wetland is 6 6 km long 2 5 km wide and 720 ha in extent with an elevational gradient from 300 4 to 292 8 m the water quality and quantity of the patterned fen are largely determined by precipitation and by ground and surface water arriving at the fen from upland source areas the patterned fen area at mcclelland wetland is influenced by several source areas initially determined by examination of string flark orientation and size two major source areas can be delimited on google earth images 1 water flowing from the southern edge eastward exiting the fen to mcclelland lake via a southern outlet fig 2 source s and 2 water flowing from the northern edge southeastward exiting the fen via a northern outlet fig 2 source n source waters from the southern edge

bordered southward by undulating terrain with a mosaic of upland forests of picea glauca picea mariana and populus tremuloides and bounded on the north by extensive sand deposits vegetated by pinus banksiana additionally a number of large wetland complexes that include bogs poor fens and rich fens are interspersed within the watershed and mcclelland lake borders the fen to the east 2 2 anthropogenic activity in the region fig 3 north and northeastward of the mcclelland watershed the boreal forest remains largely intact except for seismic exploration activities and a large pipeline right away southeast of the watershed extensive oil sands development is evident including the kearl mine imperial oil and the firebag in situ operation suncor both cnrl s jackpine mine and the syncrude aurora mine sites are located to the southwest of the watershed fig 3 extensive logging of aspen stands on the fort hills and operation of the fort hills open pit mine suncor are present in or close by to the mcclelland watershed at present no road access to the watershed is available 2 3 climate climate of the region is cool and moist with short cool summers and long cold winters and has been characterized as sub humid devito et al 2012 between 1999 and 2019 annual maximum temperatures ranged from 4 9 c to 7 7 c with a mean value of 6 3 c annual minimum temperatures ranged from 2

lies on the fort hills continuing westward across the present day athabasca river channel north flowing waters were blocked by ice until deglaciation of the moraine and opening of the drainage northward to the arctic ocean via the mackenzie river that fisher et al 2002 2009 determined took place 11 250 cal yr bp glacial lake agassiz discharged meltwater eastward into the st lawrence river until 11 450 cal yr bp when this outlet closed subsequently at 11 275 cal yr bp an earthen drainage divide was overtopped and incised lowering the lake by 52 m smith and fisher 1993 creating a massive discharge event with maximum volume of 22 000 km3 that was discharged over a 1 5 3 0 year period and followed by continued flow until 10 750 cal yr bp a remnant portion of this discharge channel borders on the south side of the fort hills and contains well developed bog islands and extensive rich fens with mcclelland wetland and the associated mcclelland lake situated in the morainic depression on the north slope of the fort hills this depression is partially filled to surficial outwash sands on which peat was initiated with the earliest basal date for peat initiation at mcclelland wetland 11 457 cal yr bp vitt and house 2021 2 5 methodology 2 5 1 field sampling we examined the easternmost portion of the patterned area of the wetland within an area of approximately 420 ha 58 of the entire patterned area we established and geo referenced a grid of 64 evenly spaced plots figs 2 4a and sampled the species abundances water levels and surface water chemistry of the nearest flark and string plots were approximately 220 m apart positions of sampling plots were randomly placed at each flark string pair within a 10 m circle surrounding the grid point species abundances were estimated as percent cover from within a 2 meter diameter circular plot surface water samples were collected from the flark nearby to the vegetation plots on august 20 28 2018 at each plot one surface water sample from 0 to 7 cm depth was collected in 60 ml high density polyethylene bottles kept cool and shipped to siuc water levels were measured beside the study plot to the nearest centimeter with a 30 cm ruler we recorded height of the water level once during this time period from the moss or bare peat surface which ever was highest based on means of two measurements in the flark and two measurements on the associated string even though both water level and water chemistry are variable throughout the growing season sampling once during a specified time period provides an annual time bounded sampling of the parameters 2 5 2 laboratory analyses water samples were filtered with whatman 541 then whatman 42 filter paper ph was measured using an accumet ab15 meter electrical conductance ec as a measure of salinity was measured using orion 4 star ec meter and base cation concentrations k na ca2 mg2 were determined using a varian 220 fs atomic absorption spectrophotometer the abundances of bryophyte species with known preferences for alkaline waters gignac et al 1991a 1991b were summed and used as indicators of alkaline conditions we used the term sentinel species for these alkaline indicators the distributions of these indicators along with abundant vascular plant and bryophyte species water levels and major water chemistry parameters were mapped using data from the 64 gridded points georeferenced points were created from the coordinates recorded at 64 surveyed flarks and strings using a handheld garmin montana 680 gps unit maps were generated in arcmap version 10 6 and overlaid on a google earth image dated 2005 2 5 3 geospatial analysis using google earth pro we examined orientation of string flark pairs as a surrogate for direction of water flow and source area string flark size and morphology and location within the fen edge center based on these patterns we divided the gridded area of mcclelland fen into five spatial areas fig 4a 1 spatial area sp 1 n 15 the area of small to medium sized flarks influenced by water sourced from uplands to the north of the fen 2 sp 2 n 6 the series of small flarks situated along the northern edge of the patterned area 3 sp 3 n 19 the area to the west within the southern patterned area with small to medium sized flarks 4 sp 4 n 17 the area to the east of the southern patterned fen with large flarks and 5 sp 5 n 7 the series of small flarks situated on the southern edge of the southern patterned fen spatial areas 1 2 are influenced by water sourced from the north while spatial areas 3 5 are influenced by water flowing eastward from the southwest and separated by a narrow zone of relatively small flarks and low strings 2 5 4 statistical analyses to determine if plant community changes occur across the fen plot level species percent cover values were analyzed through ordination using bray curtis non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds with 25 restarts and used to produce an ordination with two axes stress 0 14 in primer 7 clarke and gorley 2006 permanova was used to test whether a priori groups e g strings and flarks five spatial areas were different species richness was evaluated through two measures whittaker 1972 alpha diversity and gamma diversity alpha diversity is the number of species recorded in individual plots gamma diversity is the total number of species in a group differences in diversity and species abundances were tested between the five spatial areas using one way anova f statistic and tukey s pairwise comparisons when data passed a shapiro wilks test for normality p 0 05 failure if data were non normal a kruskal wallis one way anova h statistic on ranks was used and dunn s method was used for pairwise comparisons these tests were utilized to test for differences between the five spatial areas for water chemistry parameters and species cover and diversity of dominant or sentinel species linear regression was used to examine water level differences between strings and flarks and stoichiometry of the water from different spatial areas alpha 0 05 3 results 3 1 environmental gradients 3 1 1 water levels water levels vary over the season owing to three factors 1 sporadic summer rainfall events that increase water levels 2 seasonal draw down after the spring freshet owing to evapotranspiration and outflow to mcclelland lake and 3 the annual vertical growth of the ground layer of bryophytes especially in flarks and strings having dense moss populations with vertical growth e g hamatocaulis vernicosus tomentypnum nitens additionally in wet flarks with a floating ground layer there is a general reduction in height above the water level as moss populations follow the decrease in absolute water levels in general water levels in most flarks varied from 5 cm to 12 cm below the ground layer surface with a few flarks having water levels 1 5 cm above the ground layer surface overall 75 of the flarks had water levels below the ground layer surface fig 4b largely due to active moss growth the wettest flarks occur in spatial area 3 with small flarks and the driest in spatial area 1 with significant differences only between sp 1 and all other spatial areas f 6 895 p 0 001 eighty percent of the strings had water levels less than 15 cm below the ground layer surface fig 4c flark water levels are correlated to those of strings but with a low level of significance p 0 028 r2 0 075 there were no differences between water levels of strings among the five spatial areas f 1 079 p 0 375 3 1 2 water

fig 5a b 3 1 3 spatial variation of water chemistry all four base cations have highest concentrations across the southern portions of the fen spatial areas 3 5 and decrease northward fig 4d i this pattern is especially striking for ca2 mg2 and na k is less distinct but holds a similar north south gradient there is some evidence of somewhat less concentrations of these cations in 2 3 plots to the extreme southeast where the flark orientation suggests some influence from a more dilute southerly water source electrical conductivity is 4 5 times greater in the southern most plots compared to the northern most ones fig 4h likewise ph has a similar pattern highest toward the southern portion of the fen decreasing northward fig 4i 3 2 species diversity and plant communities 3 2 1 species

species of bryophyte species were recorded with spatial area 1 having the greatest number 6 species supplementary table 1 string species richness was considerably higher compared to that of flarks with 81 species recorded from strings compared to 58 species from flarks largely due to fewer species of bryophytes in flarks table 2 gamma landscape diversity for bryophytes was consistently higher

environmental gradients first proposed by sjörs 1950 it has been long recognized that ph and base cations as ec are the most important environmental gradients affecting fen vegetation zoltai 1988 vitt and chee 1990 vitt 1994 also important is a second gradient of wet to dry or depth to water table often designated with the microtopographic units of hummock to mud bottom or pool sjörs 1948 rydin and jeglum 2006 recently hájek et al 2006 and laitinen et al 2021 considered the gradients of ph and cations especially calcium as the primary drivers for differences of fen vegetation across the boreal region and vitt and house 2021 used salinity as one of three primary gradients in a classification of canadian wetlands compared to the rich fen poor fen gradient having calcium and magnesium as the dominant cation brackish and sodic marshes on shallow peat and fens on deep peat have sodium as the dominant cation these differing stoichiometries have consequences for plant occurrences including diminished bryophyte presence fewer trees and shrubs and differing graminoid species purdy et al 2005 trites and bayley 2009 hartsock et al 2021 and carbon accumulation volik et al 2017 in sodic wetlands the linkages demonstrated here between plant communities stoichiometry of the surficial fen water and sources of the water from the surrounding watershed are fundamental to all peatlands in the region 4 2 linkages between water levels and vegetation at our study area water level above or below the peat moss surface provides a gradient of diverse micro environments for plant species most species are restricted to either strings or to flarks irrespective of water chemistry the structural and elevational complexity of strings provide habitats for many more species than the structurally simple flarks and locally rare species are also more frequent on strings than in flarks despite this greater species richness and complexity in structure strings remain surprisingly uniform throughout the fen with all five spatial areas having similar community composition flark communities however show more heterogeneity a feature of flark communities also present in the study of extreme rich fens by slack et al 1980 wherein they reported four separate plant communities present in flarks and only one community on strings among all of the nine fens in their study 4 3 species diversity the number of species recorded in the study area of mcclelland wetland is comparable to that of extreme rich fens in the foothills of the rocky mountains slack et al 1980 who recorded species richness from nine fens located at three widely separated sites compared to 90 species 36 40 of which were bryophytes at mcclelland wetland they reported 94 plant species with 39 41 species of bryophytes compared to mcclelland where strings were more diverse than flarks in their study flarks were somewhat more diverse with 67 species vs 71 species on strings both of these studies of extreme rich fens report considerably greater numbers of species compared to species richness at a poor fen bog complex in northeastern alberta wherein graham et al 2015 reported a total 62 plant species of which 25 40 were bryophytes acidic porewater chemistry along with abundance of sphagnum species may be factors in the reduced species richness of poor fens 4 4 linkages between water chemistry and vegetation concentrations of base cations exhibit clear spatial differentiation across the patterned area of the fen the southern portion of the fen has relatively high base cation concentrations and high ph whereas across a narrow transition zone concentrations and ph decrease and exhibit lower concentrations in the northern portion of the fen these patterns in water chemistry are linked to patterns in vegetation the patterned fen is dominated throughout by larix laricina and betula glandulifera on strings and diverse assemblages of mosses and sedges in the flarks that are clearly associated with surficial water chemistry in contrast to strings plant species occurring in flarks exhibit much more fidelity to water chemistry conditions against a background of several abundant widespread species that characterize wet conditions across the fen e g menyanthes trifoliata carex lasiocarpa several species are strongly associated with particular water chemistries across spatial areas 3 through 5 a number of species are restricted to areas of high cation concentrations and high ph these species include not only the dominant species e g scorpidium scorpioides but also more infrequent ones these infrequent species or sentinel species of bryophytes characterize areas of high cations and occur only in spatial areas 3 5 these species would be characteristic of extreme rich fens sjörs 1983 vitt 2006 flarks with less abundant cations and lower ph also have a set of characteristic species e g hamatocaulis vernicosus carex diandra although these species may occur in lower abundance on strings in areas with high cations and ph see fig 6h i they achieve high abundance only in spatial area 1 where cations have lower concentrations these species and associated water chemistry would be characteristic of moderate rich fens vitt 2006 vitt and house 2021 a large percentage of the peat material composing the deep peat layers is characterized by a small suite of species or structural components peat in wet habitats flarks is largely composed of the bryophytes hamatocaulis vernicosus and scorpidium scorpioides along with sedge roots and leaves peat from drier habitats strings have remains of tomentypnum nitens along with small quantities of wood bark and needles from larix and betula vitt and house 2021 especially important are the three bryophyte species that serve to provide much of the organic material of the peat column these foundation species of bryophytes along with larix and betula have a disproportionate effect on the remainder of the plant community and are key to the resilience of the community dayton 1972 changes in base cation concentrations and water levels have the potential to cause shifts in dominance or potential loss of foundation species that will affect organic matter accumulation of the site malmer et al 1992 in a study of element concentrations in western canadian peatlands concluded that in sites characterized by rich fen vegetation the supply of weathering products above all ca and mg strongly influences the ionic content of the water we suggest the dissimilar water chemistries along with the associated differing plant communities are a direct result of two water sources with differing concentrations of base cations the first with high concentrations of base cations and high ph is from the southern edge of the peatland with contact to calcareous morainic intrusions from the northern slopes of the fort hills and an attenuated sand layer the second water source is from the northern edge of the peatland with waters filtered through a deep sand layer and without contact to the calcareous overburden these two separate water sources provide the fen with waters having very different ratios of cations the southern source is relatively rich in na and mg 2 while the northern sourced water is relatively rich in k and ca2 the differing stoichiometry between the two water sources characterize different parts of the fen and have different plant communities the transition zone between these two distinctive areas is clearly evident in the narrow area of interchange between the two plant communities and dominant species abundances and also is visible on google images of the fen as a zone with smaller narrower flarks and less well developed strings this transition zone provides the opportunity in the future to monitor changing environmental conditions and shifting plant communities regional anthopogenic disturbance in the oil sands area along with climatic change may have an important role is modifying peatlands in the near future and efforts to monitor changing hydrological and chemical inputs should be a priority 5 conclusions fens are the dominant wetland site type across northern alberta their preservation on a disturbed landscape and their reclamation after large scale disturbance depends on providing appropriate hydrological and chemical inputs to the areas in question we hypothesized and have demonstrated that within a patterned rich fen surrounded by complex and variable topography and hydrogeology that both hydrological and chemical components and plant communities have discrete distributions and that there are tight controls of plant species distributions from specific components of chemistry and hydrology the variation in water chemistry appears to be associated with differing source areas having different hydrological features we provide a framework that can be implemented at individual natural and reclaimed wetland sites in order to assess and monitor hydrological and chemical drivers and plant responses to these environmental changes additionally we conclude a high variation in water levels between strings and flarks provide a diverse set of microhabitats with greater richness on strings compared to flarks these separate habitats that must be maintained to preserve species richness b base cation concentrations and ph exhibit significant variation with high concentrations of base cations in the central and southern portions of the fen and lower concentrations and lower ph in the northern area c plant communities especially those of flarks are tightly linked to these water chemistry profiles d individual species distributions show clear spatial abundance patterns across the fen that are also tightly linked to base cation concentrations and ph we suggest that the dissimilar water chemistries are due to the fen receiving water from different surrounding source areas evidence for this includes 1 water chemistry from the northern spatial areas has about one half of the cation concentrations than that from southern areas 2 different stoichiometry of the water between the two areas of the fen and 3 the lack of mixing of waters from the two sources along with differing size and orientation of flark string patterns in the two areas the narrow transition zone of both water chemistry and plant distributions provides an area of chemical and plant response thresholds where changes in fen structure and functioning due to future landscape disturbances could be focused and efficiently monitored the close relationship between rich fen plant distributions water chemistry profiles and hydrology are important regional principles for future wetland monitoring funding this research was funded by suncor energy inc canada

8044,study region across northern alberta canada patterned rich fens with high concentrations of base cations high ph and high species richness are important landscape features mcclelland wetland is one of the largest representatives of this peatland type study focus we explored the surficial water chemistry and plant community patterns through a grid of 64 plots placed within a patterned rich fen of 420 ha new hydrological insights for the region plant communities and individual species abundances are tightly associated with surface water chemistry and water levels influenced by inflowing waters from surrounding mineral soils based on location and string flark size and orientation five spatial areas are recognized to occur in the fen spatial areas located in the northern portion of the fen have different water chemistry and plant communities than spatial areas of the center and southern portions of the fen the water chemistry of the northern spatial areas contains about one half of the cation concentrations than those from the southern spatial areas and the stoichiometry of the water is different between these regions of the fen distributions of dominant plant species are associated with differing water chemistries and separated by a narrow transition zone water sourced from different areas of the surrounding watershed largely control the water chemistry and plant

introduction large peatland complexes are an important part of canada s western boreal forest region and consist of mixtures of ombrogenous bogs and minerogenous fens when the complexes occur on shallow drainage divides or on gentle slopes inflowing to lakes fens consist of linearly merged hummocks strings alternating with linearly merged hollows or flarks andersson and hesselmann 1907 oriented along topographic contours of the peatland slope these patterned fens occur across the northern boreal zone and have been documented in north america heinselmann 1963 foster and king 1984 foster et al 1988 glaser et al 1981 1990 1992a 1992b robitaille et al 2021 europe sjörs 1961 ruuhijärvi 1983 asia sakaguchi 1980 botch and mansing 1983 and in the southern hemisphere in new zealand mark et al 1995 and africa backeus 1989 the morphology of alternating dry strings with wet flarks is thought to develop from the run off effect mainly due to melt water from the spring freshet coupled with snow melt flooding across the peatland while the water remains frozen in the upper peat column ruuhijärvi 1983 seppäla and koutaniemi 1985 maintenance of the string flark pattern has been modeled from the combined effects of differential nutrient accumulation in the strings rietkirk et al 2004 water ponding due to differential hydraulic conductivities of strings and flarks kulczynski 1949 and differential peat accumulation due to limits on plant growth belyea and clymo 2001 and summarized by eppinga et al 2009 in western canada as elsewhere patterned fens can be sphagnum dominated with acidic waters poor fens vitt et al 1975 graham et al 2015 or true moss dominated with basic and alkaline waters rich fens slack et al 1980 yu et al 2003 hartsock et al 2021 although rare on the western canadian landscape sodic fens can be patterned and dominated by vascular plants wells and price 2015 volik et al 2017 using ordination and direct gradient analysis along the bog rich fen gradient glaser et al 1992a demonstrated the close relationship between abundance of vascular plants and landform forest spring fen string or flark and secondarily by water chemistry ph and ca2 utilizing similar approaches but confining the analysis to individual patterned fens vitt et al 1975 and slack et al 1980 showed similar close relationships between species abundances and mesohabitat string flark and water chemistry these close linkages between species occurrences and abundance patterns with water chemistry were especially close for species of bryophytes that dominate the ground layer in both poor fens and rich fens as with all minerogenous fens the water quality especially base cations and ph determines peatland site type in minnesota glaser et al 1992b reported that patterned fens are associated with highly permeable sandy outwash and beach deposits whereas areas with high abundance of bogs are associated with relatively impermeable clayey or loamy soils in boreal alberta acidic poor fens most often occur at higher elevations on low drainage divides underlain with sandy soils e g vitt et al 1975 nicholson and vitt 1990 whereas rich fens occur at lower elevations influenced by water in contact with glacial overburden rich in calcareous ground water vitt et al 1975 hence the type of surrounding substrate may directly influence the source water chemistry and affect the distribution of plant species within the fen and ultimately influence plant community composition and occurrence malmer 1986 at the regional scale the relationships between species occurrences and chemical and hydrological gradients have been examined for a number of wetland species bryophytes gignac et al 1991a 1992b sedges gignac et al 2004 but at the local scale species distributions within complex peatland landforms have rarely been quantitatively documented a study by graham et al 2015 clearly demonstrated the close spatial ties between species distributions and chemical and hydrological gradients for a poor fen bog complex in northeastern alberta however we know of no studies for rich fens nor for patterned fens documenting these responses of vegetation to hydrological and chemical gradients is a key component to conservation management and effective reclamation of disturbed boreal wetlands especially for both poor and rich fens that are the most abundant peatland site types on the northern alberta landscape vitt et al 1997 the rich fen studied here lies at the edge of oil sands development in northern alberta where large scale open pit mining has greatly disturbed the landscape in order to better provide direction to future wetland reclamation in the region these vegetation environmental relationships need to be well understood one approach the one taken here is to intensively examine one large peatland complex our study site mcclelland wetland figs 1 2 is one of the largest patterned fens of the region and is influenced by alkaline waters that characterize rich fens as part of future oil sands site development the western portion of the wetland is scheduled for excavation as part of planned oil sands procurement the eastern portion of the wetland is to be maintained in a natural state however the technical challenges to maintaining this portion of wetland are enormous and rely on a thorough understanding of the hydrological and chemical constraints that may affect the functioning and structure of the plant communities and wetland in this study our overall objective is to provide a detailed understanding of how hydrological and chemical gradients influence plant abundances and distributions across the patterned undisturbed area of mcclelland fen in particular we present two hypotheses 1 both hydrological and chemical gradients and plant communities have distinct spatial distributions across the fen and 2 there are close linkages between hydrological and chemical gradients and plant communities and their distributions in order to examine these two hypotheses we provide a detailed assessment of the distributions of these environmental and plant community variables and develop an assessment framework that provides the basis for future monitoring against changing environmental conditions 2 methods 2 1 study site the study site is located at 57º27 01 81 n 111º25 35 90 w 83 km north of fort mcmurray alberta the mcclelland wetland watershed is 203 km2 in size and contains 15 lake 50 wetland and 35 sandy upland the mcclelland wetland complex is approximately 10 0 km long and 5 0 km wide at its widest point with an area of 3835 ha fig 2 the wetland lies just north of fort hills a low topographic ridge rising to 335 m elevation containing ice thrusted morainic materials underlying the wetland and continuing northward is a deep layer of glacial outwash sand that becomes deeper northward j p jones unpublished results the patterned area contained within the wetland is 6 6 km long 2 5 km wide and 720 ha in extent with an elevational gradient from 300 4 to 292 8 m the water quality and quantity of the patterned fen are largely determined by precipitation and by ground and surface water arriving at the fen from upland source areas the patterned fen area at mcclelland wetland is influenced by several source areas initially determined by examination of string flark orientation and size two major source areas can be delimited on google earth images 1 water flowing from the southern edge eastward exiting the fen to mcclelland lake via a southern outlet fig 2 source s and 2 water flowing from the northern edge southeastward exiting the fen via a northern outlet fig 2 source n source waters from the southern edge contact the glacial morainic materials including clay tills on the northern side of the fort hills while waters from the northern edge have contact with the deep sand layer north of the fen j p jones unpublished results surrounding the patterned area of mcclelland wetland is a complex set of wetland site types including extensive larix larch dominated wooded rich fens areas of bog islands and permafrost dominated peat plateaus that are actively thawing moss graminoid rich fens and riparian swamp forests dominated by picea mariana black spruce fig 2 vitt et al 2003 the mcclelland wetland is bordered southward by undulating terrain with a mosaic of upland forests of picea glauca picea mariana and populus tremuloides and bounded on the north by extensive sand deposits vegetated by pinus banksiana additionally a number of large wetland complexes that include bogs poor fens and rich fens are interspersed within the watershed and mcclelland lake borders the fen to the east 2 2 anthropogenic activity in the region fig 3 north and northeastward of the mcclelland watershed the boreal forest remains largely intact except for seismic exploration activities and a large pipeline right away southeast of the watershed extensive oil sands development is evident including the kearl mine imperial oil and the firebag in situ operation suncor both cnrl s jackpine mine and the syncrude aurora mine sites are located to the southwest of the watershed fig 3 extensive logging of aspen stands on the fort hills and operation of the fort hills open pit mine suncor are present in or close by to the mcclelland watershed at present no road access to the watershed is available 2 3 climate climate of the region is cool and moist with short cool summers and long cold winters and has been characterized as sub humid devito et al 2012 between 1999 and 2019 annual maximum temperatures ranged from 4 9 c to 7 7 c with a mean value of 6 3 c annual minimum temperatures ranged from 2

lies on the fort hills continuing westward across the present day athabasca river channel north flowing waters were blocked by ice until deglaciation of the moraine and opening of the drainage northward to the arctic ocean via the mackenzie river that fisher et al 2002 2009 determined took place 11 250 cal yr bp glacial lake agassiz discharged meltwater eastward into the st lawrence river until 11 450 cal yr bp when this outlet closed subsequently at 11 275 cal yr bp an earthen drainage divide was overtopped and incised lowering the lake by 52 m smith and fisher 1993 creating a massive discharge event with maximum volume of 22 000 km3 that was discharged over a 1 5 3 0 year period and followed by continued flow until 10 750 cal yr bp a remnant portion of this discharge channel borders on the south side of the fort hills and contains well developed bog islands and extensive rich fens with mcclelland wetland and the associated mcclelland lake situated in the morainic depression on the north slope of the fort hills this depression is partially filled to surficial outwash sands on which peat was initiated with the earliest basal date for peat initiation at mcclelland wetland 11 457 cal yr bp vitt and house 2021 2 5 methodology 2 5 1 field sampling we examined the easternmost portion of the patterned area of the wetland within an area of approximately 420 ha 58 of the entire patterned area we established and geo referenced a grid of 64 evenly spaced plots figs 2 4a and sampled the species abundances water levels and surface water chemistry of the nearest flark and string plots were approximately 220 m apart positions of sampling plots were randomly placed at each flark string pair within a 10 m circle surrounding the grid point species abundances were estimated as percent cover from within a 2 meter diameter circular plot surface water samples were collected from the flark nearby to the vegetation plots on august 20 28 2018 at each plot one surface water sample from 0 to 7 cm depth was collected in 60 ml high density polyethylene bottles kept cool and shipped to siuc water levels were measured beside the study plot to the nearest centimeter with a 30 cm ruler we recorded height of the water level once during this time period from the moss or bare peat surface which ever was highest based on means of two measurements in the flark and two measurements on the associated string even though both water level and water chemistry are variable throughout the growing season sampling once during a specified time period provides an annual time bounded sampling of the parameters 2 5 2 laboratory analyses water samples were filtered with whatman 541 then whatman 42 filter paper ph was measured using an accumet ab15 meter electrical conductance ec as a measure of salinity was measured using orion 4 star ec meter and base cation concentrations k na ca2 mg2 were determined using a varian 220 fs atomic absorption spectrophotometer the abundances of bryophyte species with known preferences for alkaline waters gignac et al 1991a 1991b were summed and used as indicators of alkaline conditions we used the term sentinel species for these alkaline indicators the distributions of these indicators along with abundant vascular plant and bryophyte species water levels and major water chemistry parameters were mapped using data from the 64 gridded points georeferenced points were created from the coordinates recorded at 64 surveyed flarks and strings using a handheld garmin montana 680 gps unit maps were generated in arcmap version 10 6 and overlaid on a google earth image dated 2005 2 5 3 geospatial analysis using google earth pro we examined orientation of string flark pairs as a surrogate for direction of water flow and source area string flark size and morphology and location within the fen edge center based on these patterns we divided the gridded area of mcclelland fen into five spatial areas fig 4a 1 spatial area sp 1 n 15 the area of small to medium sized flarks influenced by water sourced from uplands to the north of the fen 2 sp 2 n 6 the series of small flarks situated along the northern edge of the patterned area 3 sp 3 n 19 the area to the west within the southern patterned area with small to medium sized flarks 4 sp 4 n 17 the area to the east of the southern patterned fen with large flarks and 5 sp 5 n 7 the series of small flarks situated on the southern edge of the southern patterned fen spatial areas 1 2 are influenced by water sourced from the north while spatial areas 3 5 are influenced by water flowing eastward from the southwest and separated by a narrow zone of relatively small flarks and low strings 2 5 4 statistical analyses to determine if plant community changes occur across the fen plot level species percent cover values were analyzed through ordination using bray curtis non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds with 25 restarts and used to produce an ordination with two axes stress 0 14 in primer 7 clarke and gorley 2006 permanova was used to test whether a priori groups e g strings and flarks five spatial areas were different species richness was evaluated through two measures whittaker 1972 alpha diversity and gamma diversity alpha diversity is the number of species recorded in individual plots gamma diversity is the total number of species in a group differences in diversity and species abundances were tested between the five spatial areas using one way anova f statistic and tukey s pairwise comparisons when data passed a shapiro wilks test for normality p 0 05 failure if data were non normal a kruskal wallis one way anova h statistic on ranks was used and dunn s method was used for pairwise comparisons these tests were utilized to test for differences between the five spatial areas for water chemistry parameters and species cover and diversity of dominant or sentinel species linear regression was used to examine water level differences between strings and flarks and stoichiometry of the water from different spatial areas alpha 0 05 3 results 3 1 environmental gradients 3 1 1 water levels water levels vary over the season owing to three factors 1 sporadic summer rainfall events that increase water levels 2 seasonal draw down after the spring freshet owing to evapotranspiration and outflow to mcclelland lake and 3 the annual vertical growth of the ground layer of bryophytes especially in flarks and strings having dense moss populations with vertical growth e g hamatocaulis vernicosus tomentypnum nitens additionally in wet flarks with a floating ground layer there is a general reduction in height above the water level as moss populations follow the decrease in absolute water levels in general water levels in most flarks varied from 5 cm to 12 cm below the ground layer surface with a few flarks having water levels 1 5 cm above the ground layer surface overall 75 of the flarks had water levels below the ground layer surface fig 4b largely due to active moss growth the wettest flarks occur in spatial area 3 with small flarks and the driest in spatial area 1 with significant differences only between sp 1 and all other spatial areas f 6 895 p 0 001 eighty percent of the strings had water levels less than 15 cm below the ground layer surface fig 4c flark water levels are correlated to those of strings but with a low level of significance p 0 028 r2 0 075 there were no differences between water levels of strings among the five spatial areas f 1 079 p 0 375 3 1 2 water chemistry over the entire sampling area surface water chemistry from individual plots had high variation electrical conductance ranged from 107 to 535 µs cm 1 and ph from 6 9 to 8 0 base cations also were variable ca2 from 13 2 to 127 5 mg l 1 mg2 from 6 7 to 46 2 mg l 1 na from 2 4 to 12 3 mg l 1 and k from 0 56 to 11 2 mg l 1 spatial areas 1 2 were lower in all surface water parameters compared to those from spatial areas 3 5 p values all 0 001 fig 4c i table 1 with no differences within sp 1 2 or within sp 3 5 ph from spatial areas 1 2 varied from 6 9 to 7 6 and ec from 108 to 250 µs cm 1 compared to ph of 7 3 8 0 and ec of 124 535 µs cm 1 for spatial areas 3 5 in general concentrations of base cations from spatial areas 1 2 were one half those from spatial areas 3 5 mean ca2 31 34 for sp 1 2 compared to 63 72 mg l 1 for sp 3 5 mg2 9 13 for sp 1 2 compared to 29 37 mg l 1 for sp 3 5 sp 1 2 na 3 4 for sp 1 2 compared to 7 9 mg l 1 for sp 3 5 and k 2 3 for sp 1 2 compared to 4 7 mg l 1 for sp 3 5 table 1 furthermore the stoichiometry of base cations in sp 1 2 was distinct from that for sp 3 5 with k and ca2 relatively greater in sp 1 2 and na and mg2 relatively greater in sp 3 5 fig 5a b 3 1 3 spatial variation of water chemistry all four base cations have highest concentrations across the southern portions of the fen spatial areas 3 5 and decrease northward fig 4d i this pattern is especially striking for ca2 mg2 and na k is less distinct but holds a similar north south gradient there is some evidence of somewhat less concentrations of these cations in 2 3 plots to the extreme southeast where the flark orientation suggests some influence from a more dilute southerly water source electrical conductivity is 4 5 times greater in the southern most plots compared to the northern most ones fig 4h likewise ph has a similar pattern highest toward the southern portion of the fen decreasing northward fig 4i 3 2 species diversity and plant communities 3 2 1 species

betula glandulifera carex diandra carex lasiocarpa larix laricina and menyanthes trifoliata and the most abundant bryophytes were hamatocaulis vernicosus scorpidium scorpioides and tomentypnum nitens of the 54 vascular plant species found in our survey 12 22 were found only in 1 or 2 plots spatial area 4 had the greatest number of these locally rare vascular plant species 6 twelve 33 locally rare species of bryophyte species were recorded with spatial area 1 having the greatest number 6 species supplementary table 1 string species richness was considerably higher compared to that of flarks with 81 species recorded from strings compared to 58 species from flarks largely due to fewer species of bryophytes in flarks table 2 gamma landscape diversity for bryophytes was consistently higher on strings 34 species compared to flarks 18 species while less differences were evident for vascular plants 47 on strings and 40 species in flarks overall gamma diversity of bryophytes varied from 6 to 28 species across the five spatial areas for strings and flarks while for vascular plants it varied from 19 to 33 species across the five spatial areas alpha plot diversity for bryophytes varied from 7 2 to 8 1 species on strings with no differences between spatial areas h 1 48 p 0 688 and from 1 7 to 5 0 in flarks with only sp 1 different in richness h 25 63 p 0 001 vascular plant plot

while spatial areas 3 5 flarks form more scattered groups to upper left fig 6a string plots occur intermixed in the ordination of strings only fig 6b with considerable variation within each spatial area however spatial areas 1 2 string plots are in general located to the left of the ordination while those from spatial areas 3 5 are located to the upper right spatial areas 1 2 are different from those of spatial areas 3 5 with no differences within these spatial areas permanova p 0 001 flark plots are distributed widely on the ordination of flarks only fig 6c with plots from spatial areas 1 2 placed to the right on the ordination and those from spatial areas 3 5 to the center and left spatial area 1 is particularly distinctive all five spatial area groups are different from one another

environmental gradients first proposed by sjörs 1950 it has been long recognized that ph and base cations as ec are the most important environmental gradients affecting fen vegetation zoltai 1988 vitt and chee 1990 vitt 1994 also important is a second gradient of wet to dry or depth to water table often designated with the microtopographic units of hummock to mud bottom or pool sjörs 1948 rydin and jeglum 2006 recently hájek et al 2006 and laitinen et al 2021 considered the gradients of ph and cations especially calcium as the primary drivers for differences of fen vegetation across the boreal region and vitt and house 2021 used salinity as one of three primary gradients in a classification of canadian wetlands compared to the rich fen poor fen gradient having calcium and magnesium as the dominant cation brackish and sodic marshes on shallow peat and fens on deep peat have sodium as the dominant cation these differing stoichiometries have consequences for plant occurrences including diminished bryophyte presence fewer trees and shrubs and differing graminoid species purdy et al 2005 trites and bayley 2009 hartsock et al 2021 and carbon accumulation volik et al 2017 in sodic wetlands the linkages demonstrated here between plant communities stoichiometry of the surficial fen water and sources of the water from the surrounding watershed are fundamental to all peatlands in the region 4 2 linkages between water levels and vegetation at our study area water level above or below the peat moss surface provides a gradient of diverse micro environments for plant species most species are restricted to either strings or to flarks irrespective of water chemistry the structural and elevational complexity of strings provide habitats for many more species than the structurally simple flarks and locally rare species are also more frequent on strings than in flarks despite this greater species richness and complexity in structure strings remain surprisingly uniform throughout the fen with all five spatial areas having similar community composition flark communities however show more heterogeneity a feature of flark communities also present in the study of extreme rich fens by slack et al 1980 wherein they reported four separate plant communities present in flarks and only one community on strings among all of the nine fens in their study 4 3 species diversity the number of species recorded in the study area of mcclelland wetland is comparable to that of extreme rich fens in the foothills of the rocky mountains slack et al 1980 who recorded species richness from nine fens located at three widely separated sites compared to 90 species 36 40 of which were bryophytes at mcclelland wetland they reported 94 plant species with 39 41 species of bryophytes compared to mcclelland where strings were more diverse than flarks in their study flarks were somewhat more diverse with 67 species vs 71 species on strings both of these studies of extreme rich fens report considerably greater numbers of species compared to species richness at a poor fen bog complex in northeastern alberta wherein graham et al 2015 reported a total 62 plant species of which 25 40 were bryophytes acidic porewater chemistry along with abundance of sphagnum species may be factors in the reduced species richness of poor fens 4 4 linkages between water chemistry and vegetation concentrations of base cations exhibit clear spatial differentiation across the patterned area of the fen the southern portion of the fen has relatively high base cation concentrations and high ph whereas across a narrow transition zone concentrations and ph decrease and exhibit lower concentrations in the northern portion of the fen these patterns in water chemistry are linked to patterns in vegetation the patterned fen is dominated throughout by larix laricina and betula glandulifera on strings and diverse assemblages of mosses and sedges in the flarks that are clearly associated with surficial water chemistry in contrast to strings plant species occurring in flarks exhibit much more fidelity to water chemistry conditions against a background of several abundant widespread species that characterize wet conditions across the fen e g menyanthes trifoliata carex lasiocarpa several species are strongly associated with particular water chemistries across spatial areas 3 through 5 a number of species are restricted to areas of high cation concentrations and high ph these species include not only the dominant species e g scorpidium scorpioides but also more infrequent ones these infrequent species or sentinel species of bryophytes characterize areas of high cations and occur only in spatial areas 3 5 these species would be characteristic of extreme rich fens sjörs 1983 vitt 2006 flarks with less abundant cations and lower ph also have a set of characteristic species e g hamatocaulis vernicosus carex diandra although these species may occur in lower abundance on strings in areas with high cations and ph see fig 6h i they achieve high abundance only in spatial area 1 where cations have lower concentrations these species and associated water chemistry would be characteristic of moderate rich fens vitt 2006 vitt and house 2021 a large percentage of the peat material composing the deep peat layers is characterized by a small suite of species or structural components peat in wet habitats flarks is largely composed of the bryophytes hamatocaulis vernicosus and scorpidium scorpioides along with sedge roots and leaves peat from drier habitats strings have remains of tomentypnum nitens along with small quantities of wood bark and needles from larix and betula vitt and house 2021 especially important are the three bryophyte species that serve to provide much of the organic material of the peat column these foundation species of bryophytes along with larix and betula have a disproportionate effect on the remainder of the plant community and are key to the resilience of the community dayton 1972 changes in base cation concentrations and water levels have the potential to cause shifts in dominance or potential loss of foundation species that will affect organic matter accumulation of the site malmer et al 1992 in a study of element concentrations in western canadian peatlands concluded that in sites characterized by rich fen vegetation the supply of weathering products above all ca and mg strongly influences the ionic content of the water we suggest the dissimilar water chemistries along with the associated differing plant communities are a direct result of two water sources with differing concentrations of base cations the first with high concentrations of base cations and high ph is from the southern edge of the peatland with contact to calcareous morainic intrusions from the northern slopes of the fort hills and an attenuated sand layer the second water source is from the northern edge of the peatland with waters filtered through a deep sand layer and without contact to the calcareous overburden these two separate water sources provide the fen with waters having very different ratios of cations the southern source is relatively rich in na and mg 2 while the northern sourced water is relatively rich in k and ca2 the differing stoichiometry between the two water sources characterize different parts of the fen and have different plant communities the transition zone between these two distinctive areas is clearly evident in the narrow area of interchange between the two plant communities and dominant species abundances and also is visible on google images of the fen as a zone with smaller narrower flarks and less well developed strings this transition zone provides the opportunity in the future to monitor changing environmental conditions and shifting plant communities regional anthopogenic disturbance in the oil sands area along with climatic change may have an important role is modifying peatlands in the near future and efforts to monitor changing hydrological and chemical inputs should be a priority 5 conclusions fens are the dominant wetland site type across northern alberta their preservation on a disturbed landscape and their reclamation after large scale disturbance depends on providing appropriate hydrological and chemical inputs to the areas in question we hypothesized and have demonstrated that within a patterned rich fen surrounded by complex and variable topography and hydrogeology that both hydrological and chemical components and plant communities have discrete distributions and that there are tight controls of plant species distributions from specific components of chemistry and hydrology the variation in water chemistry appears to be associated with differing source areas having different hydrological features we provide a framework that can be implemented at individual natural and reclaimed wetland sites in order to assess and monitor hydrological and chemical drivers and plant responses to these environmental changes additionally we conclude a high variation in water levels between strings and flarks provide a diverse set of microhabitats with greater richness on strings compared to flarks these separate habitats that must be maintained to preserve species richness b base cation concentrations and ph exhibit significant variation with high concentrations of base cations in the central and southern portions of the fen and lower concentrations and lower ph in the northern area c plant communities especially those of flarks are tightly linked to these water chemistry profiles d individual species distributions show clear spatial abundance patterns across the fen that are also tightly linked to base cation concentrations and ph we suggest that the dissimilar water chemistries are due to the fen receiving water from different surrounding source areas evidence for this includes 1 water chemistry from the northern spatial areas has about one half of the cation concentrations than that from southern areas 2 different stoichiometry of the water between the two areas of the fen and 3 the lack of mixing of waters from the two sources along with differing size and orientation of flark string patterns in the two areas the narrow transition zone of both water chemistry and plant distributions provides an area of chemical and plant response thresholds where changes in fen structure and functioning due to future landscape disturbances could be focused and efficiently monitored the close relationship between rich fen plant distributions water chemistry profiles and hydrology are important regional principles for future wetland monitoring funding this research was funded by suncor energy inc canada
