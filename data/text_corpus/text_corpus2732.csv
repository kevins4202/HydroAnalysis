solutions conclusively immobilized laccase treatment might appear a good choice for bioremediation of dye laden industrial wastewater due to substantial degradation and appreciable improvement in water quality parameters keywords laccase pleurotus nebrodensis immobilization textile dyes degradation reusability 1 introduction one of the major environmental problems is the contamination of water air and soil by toxic chemicals generated through textile dyeing industries which produce enormous wastewater by consuming water in different steps of dyeing and finishing processes this wastewater contains color residues of dyes chemicals and different complex compounds including alkaline and acidic contaminants 1 3 most of the dye residues are highly toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic and thus having a negative impact on the atmosphere and public health 4 5 classical physicochemical processes for wastewater treatment such as chemical oxidation solvent extraction and adsorption with activated carbon are associated with significant drawbacks of harsh reacting conditions and high cost 6 8 researchers have recently rekindled their focus towards biodegradation for the treatment of industrial effluents owing to high efficiency minimal environmental impact and adequate working conditions microbial and enzymatic systems based biodegradation has notably appeared a useful approach to decolorize and degrade dyes in industrial textile effluents 9 11 although microbial methods are economical and realize a great extent of mineralization and degradation along with the low generation of sludge nevertheless microbial systems are incapable of degrading dyes without required nutritional sources and often necessitate the inclusion of carbon or nitrogen sources supplementation of carbon or nitrogen sources undesirably affects water quality and rises the treatment cost 12 additionally the performance of the microbial system is also constrained by the acclamation of target microorganisms growth interference due to color and the prolonged hydraulic residence time for complete degradation biodegradation of effluents with high target environmental pollutants including textile dyes by microbial enzymes seems an excellent strategy among the commonly used enzymes for dye degradation purposes include tyrosinase manganese peroxidase lignin peroxidase polyphenol oxidase azo reductase soybean peroxidase horseradish peroxidase and laccase among the above referenced enzymes laccase is deemed a prospective enzyme for biocatalytic degradation and detoxification of dyeing effluents 13 laccase drives the catalytic oxidation of phenolic substances using molecular oxygen as an excellent electron acceptor 14 nevertheless like other enzymes laccases are also likely to be inactivated by environmental influences and the practical applicability of laccases aided biocatalytic systems are handicapped due to the associated high cost of enzymatic purification and separation as well as marginal stability enzyme immobilization is the most prodigious approach to develop enzymes with enhanced operational stability substrate specificity activity and reusability of the catalyst for their industrial utilization 15 notable methods that have been assessed for laccase immobilization include adsorption inclusion or entrapment microencapsulation cross linking and covalent bonding the thermostable and reusable nature of the immobilized derivatives and their easy recovery from the reaction system is the most considerable benefits which stimulated interest in the synthesis and preparation of immobilized enzymes due to these advantages immobilized enzymes find their use in medicine antibiotics production food industry biodiesel production and environmental bioremediation 16 18 owing to a set of unique attributes including good biocompatibility inertness inexpensive and hydrophilic nature chitosan is widely explored as catalytic support for laccase immobilization 19 20 the availability of plentiful amino and hydroxyl moieties on the surface of chitosan affords marked affinity for proteins and enzymes thus making it useful for diverse applications retention of high enzyme activity using chitosan as support is ascribed to the firm attachment of enzyme utilizing a cross linking agent a robust connection between the support and enzyme continued to the augmented stability and reusability in this study laccase produced by p nebrodensis wc 850 was immobilized onto chitosan beads and optimized parameters were investigated for the free

contributed by archroma pakistan limited faisalabad formerly clariant pakistan ltd to support research work wheat straw used for the laccase production was collected from student land farms of the university of agriculture faisalabad 2 2 production and purification of laccase by p nebrodensis wc 850 experiments for laccase enzyme production were performed in triplicate erlenmeyer flasks 500 ml containing 5 g wheat straw wet with 50 w v kirk s basal nutrient medium 21 and sterilized in a lab scale automated autoclave for 15 min sterilized media was then inoculated with 4 ml homogenous seed culture and flasks were placed in a temperature regulated incubator for fermentation under the static condition at 30 c for 144 h to extract the laccase enzyme distilled water 100 ml was added to the fermented mesh shaken for 1 h at 150 rpm filtered and centrifuged at 30 000 rpm for 10 min sanyo japan the laccase extract thus produced was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation ion exchange deae cellulose and size exclusion chromatography sephadex g 100 2 3 enzyme assay and protein quantification the enzyme assay was carried out using abts as a specific substrate including sodium malonate buffer of ph 4 5 the enzyme assay reaction mixture consists of 0 1 ml of crude enzyme extract 1 ml of abts substrate and 1 ml of buffer solution while the same reaction system lacking enzyme was used as a blank a uv vis spectrophotometer was used to check the absorbance of the sample at 420 nm ε420 36 000 m 1 cm 1 22 one unit of laccase activity is the amount which causes the transformation of 1 μmol of abts substrate per minute under assay conditions to quantify total protein content bradford assay was carried out by considering bsa as a reference standard 23 2 4 development of chitosan beads and laccase immobilization chitosan beads were developed by dissolving 1 0 chitosan powder in 1 5 acetic acid solution followed by continuous stirring at mild temperature 50 c a 2 5 chitosan concentration was tested to acquire rigid and high quality beads with desired mechanical stability the spherically shaped beads of different concentrations of chitosan solution were made by filling solution into a syringe and dropwise addition into 1 m potassium hydroxide solution under consistent stirring and kept as such at a very slow speed for 2 h at 30 c to get fully ripened stable beads the developed beads were collected and treated with glutaraldehyde solution 1 4 v v at 30 c for 3 and 6 h to get the optimum concentration of glutaraldehyde required for activation of beads in order to immobilize the laccase enzyme glutaraldehyde functionalized chitosan beads were mixed with laccase solution 0 2 0 6 mg ml for 24 h at 4 c after that the beads were washed and directly utilized for activity measurement at 420 nm immobilization efficiency was monitored for cts lac using eq 1 1 i m m o b i l i z a t i o n e f f i c i e n c y t o t a l a c t i v i t

carried out for free and cts lac to confirm the presence of specific elements like copper in beads the beads were used in their original form to study their edx spectrum 2 6 characterization of free and cts lac the optimum ph for soluble and cts lac was assessed by incubation of reaction mixture in buffers of variable ph i e 3 10 the buffers were tartrate buffer ph 2 0 3 0 sodium malonate buffer ph 4 0 5 0 citrate phosphate ph 6 0 sodium phosphate ph 7 0 8 0 and carbonate buffer of ph 9 0 10 0 for temperature optima both free and cts lac containing reaction mixture were separately heated at 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 and 70 c a range of abts concentration 0 1 1 mm was used to evaluate its effect on the free and cts lac the k m and v max were computed by employing data into the michaelis menten equation 2 7 dye degradation applicability of free and cts lac six different industrial dyes including drimaren red reactive λ max 547 drimaren yellow reactive λ max 417 drimaren black reactive λ max 585 drimaren turquoise reactive λ max 622 foron turquoise disperse λ max 748 and foron blue disperse λ max 541 were used to explore the dye degradation performance free and cts lac triplicate erlenmeyer flasks having 100 ml of individual dye solution 0 01 g 100 ml and free and cts lac were allowed reacting at 30 c for 5 days in a shaker after each 24 h samples were collected to determine the remaining dye concentrations by measuring absorbance at corresponding wavelengths 2 8 examination of water quality parameters the water quality parameters including bod cod and toc were measured using a bod meter and spectrophotometer a digestion flask containing h2so4 1 6 ml 2 n k2cr2o7 1 ml and respective dye samples 4 ml were allowed to digest at 110 c for 90 min and absorbance was recorded to measure toc at 590 nm after cooling down to room temperature for cod measurement 1 5 ml digestion solution and 3 5 ml catalyst solution were added in digestion vial then 2 5 ml of sample solution was taken in a vial and these vials were positioned in an oven at 150 c for 2 h cod was assessed by noting absorbance at 600 nm 24 2 9 statistical analysis microsoft excel software was used to determine mean and standard deviations from three independent experiments the kinetic parameters were calculated by computing data into graph pad prism 6 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction and purification of laccase from p nebrodensis laccase was produced by cultivating p nebrodensis wc 850 on a low cost lignocellulosic agricultural waste wheat straw adopting the pre standardized solid state fermentation conditions 22 the enzyme activity protein concentration and specific activity for a crude form of p nebrodensis laccase were 318 u ml 1 676 mg ml and 189 73 u mg respectively table 1 the enzyme was ideally precipitated out with an optimal saturation point of 80 ammonium sulfate yielding 1 01 fold purification after extensive dialysis the precipitated enzyme was submitted to ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography for further purification all the purification steps resulted in 3 47 fold purity with a specific laccase activity of 659 65 u mg of protein tian et al 25 purified a novel laccase from fresh fruiting bodies of the p nebrodensis using ion exchange cm cellulose deae cellulose and q sepharose and gel filtration chromatography on superdex 75 the enzyme showed adsorption on q sepharose and deae cellulose but not adsorbed onto cm cellulose laccase recovered from culture extract of t versicolor ibl 04 was precipitated out with 80 ammonium sulfate and attained 4 03 folds purification accompanied by the specific activity of 833 u mg after ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography 26 3 2 immobilization of p nebrodensis laccase on chitosan beads aiming to accomplish effective immobilization different concentrations of chitosan solutions 1 5 were ascertained to develop the chitosan microspheres of desired mechanical steadiness laccase showed the best efficiency using a suitable concentration of 2 5 chitosan solution which results in the preparation of hard rigid and firm quality spherical beads fig 1 the chitosan beads were then reacted with varying concentrations of bifunctional reagent glutaraldehyde 1 4 v v to assess its coupling efficiency with the enzyme molecules results evidenced that the highest laccase entrapment was achieved using 2 glutaraldehyde functionalized chitosan beads after 6 h in the case of p nebrodensis fig 2 portrays the glutaraldehyde activated chitosan beads without enzyme and with immobilized laccase enzyme the chitosan beads provided an efficient biocompatible surface for enzyme attachment leading to an immobilization efficiency of 79 table 2 many reactive hydroxyl and amino groups can be generated after the chemical modifications of enzyme protein which are responsible for the coupling of enzymes with the immobilization supports 27 increased immobilization efficiency occurred after the formation of schiff base with an amino group of enzymes followed by the generation of some aldehyde groups on chitosan beads surface because of glutaraldehyde treatment 28 29 in this way the immobilization process is stimulated by the presence of many amino groups on the backbone of chitosan beads without glutaraldehyde treatment the structure of chitosan beads will be very feeble with insufficient functional steadiness 30 low immobilization efficiency at low glutaraldehyde concentration might be ascribed to the inefficient activation of chitosan beads for enzyme attachment the immobilization efficiency was gradually increased by raising the concentration of glutaraldehyde up to 2 a further increase in glutaraldehyde concentration beyond this optimal point 3 and 4 the enzyme entrapment was again dropped due to hindrance of active regions of the enzyme by cross linker structure and stearic interference induced by multiple cross linking points on the surface of chitosan beads between the enzyme candidates 31 33 in an earlier report zheng et al 34 attained the best laccase activity at a relatively moderate concentration of the cross linking agent which was explicated by the favorable creation of attractive linkages between the cross linker and the enzyme particles at an elevated concentration of glutaraldehyde excessive crosslinking often induces conformational alteration in the enzyme molecules leading to destabilization of catalytic sites and thus reducing the immobilization yield 35 36 3 3 edx analysis for elemental analysis energy dispersive x ray analysis was used to confirm the presence of copper elements in laccase bound chitosan microspheres as copper is a typical element of the laccase enzyme the presence of copper in the chitosan beads by edx analysis further confirmed the occurrence of an enzyme in the immobilized beads the comparison of standard and enzyme coupled beads substantiated that copper was only present in those beads which were immobilized with laccase enzyme fig 2b while it was not detected in those beads without the immobilized enzyme fig 2a 3 4 biochemical characterization of free and cts lac 3 4 1 effect of ph on laccase activity the influence of ph on the activity of free and cts lac was investigated by incubating for 10 min at diverse phs ranged from 2 0 to 10 fig 3 enzyme assay results revealed that the optimum ph of the free enzyme was 3 0 whereas the cts lac performed best 401 01 u ml at a neutral ph of 7 0 immobilization of laccase on different supports allows it to act over a broad spectrum of ph than soluble laccase due to the development of stable interactions between laccase molecules and immobilization support that led to its wider adaptability towards environmental inequities 37 40 it was observed that the immobilization process improved the adaptive capability of laccase to alkaline ph conditions and widened the ph range for biocatalysis with an increase in ph values a declining trend was recorded in the enzyme activity of the free form of the enzyme whereas the immobilized laccase first showed an increasing tendency in enzyme activity up to ph 7 0 following a decline with a much lesser rate compared to the native enzyme at a ph value of 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 the enzyme activities for soluble and cts lac were recorded to be 117 5 118 05 99 05 50 01 and 240 14 409 01 365 13 315 01 respectively the results clearly indicate the enhanced resistance of immobilized laccase to alkaline environments that might be ascribed to the buffering action of large negatively charged amino groups present on the inner surface of the chitosan bio carrier yan et al 41 described that the immobilized laccases are comparatively unlikely to interference from the surroundings and exhibit better resistance to broad ph conditions facilitating its catalytic applicability metin 42 observed that chitosan grafted polyethylene imine films immobilized laccase showed augmented enzyme activity with an increase in ph up to ph 6 5 as compared to the free laccase enzyme that worked optimally at ph 5 5 the ph optimum for free laccase produced by different strains of pleurotus has been reported to be 3 5 43 3 4 2 impact of temperature on laccase enzyme activity the effect of different temperatures on free and cts lac was evaluated in the range of 25 80 c with a 5 c interval after 10 min of incubation under temperature controlled conditions the temperature optimum for the free laccase was 35 c 390 1 u ml which was increased to 50 c with enzyme activity 462 5 u ml in the case of cts lac immobilization fig 4 this notable enhancement in temperature tolerance after the immobilization process may be attributed to the fact that the distinctive embedding network of the catalytic support effectually safeguards the enzyme by furnishing a robust microenvironment 44 moreover after immobilization stable interactions between the immobilization matrix and enzyme molecules increased the rigidity of the enzyme structure thus strengthening its ability to tolerate thermal deactivation on the contrary free form of enzymes readily lost its activity at elevated temperatures 45 46 most of the laccases produced by different white rot basidiomycetes have been lost their activities at higher temperatures and found to be stable and active in the temperature range of 30 50 c 47 48 our results aligned with 49 who attained the utmost enzyme activity at 35 c produced by trichoderma harzianum wl 1 of most recent thiolated chitosan fe3o4 hybrid composite conjugated laccase performed it s performed its maximal activity at 50 c due to the potent linkage between laccase and support 50 3 4 3 kinetic parameters the values of k m and v max for free and cts lac were determined by constructing a double reciprocal plot using the line weaver burk plot and results are portrayed in fig 5 the k m and v max values in case of free enzyme produced by p nebrodensis were 111 μm and 308 u ml while k m and v max values for the cts lac were 120 μm and 597 u ml respectively a slight increase in k m indicates a lower affinity of cts lac for abts and presumably due to diffusional resistance of the substrate caused by the support carrier for the catalytic reaction further the substantially increased v max following immobilization corroborated the aggrandized catalytic efficiency of cts lac similar to our study recently mehandia et al 51 obtained k m values of 480 663 and 500 μm accompanied by v max of 111 86 and 96 u ml min for free cts beads and cts clay conjugate beads immobilized laccases respectively 3 5 laccase assisted biocatalytic degradation of dyes the catalytic efficiency of free and cts lac were ascertained for the degradation of six different dyes and results are displayed in fig 6 percent decolorization and fig 7 a f uv vis spectra decolorization analysis showed that all the tested dyes were efficiently decolorized by the cts lac in comparison to its free form the decolorization efficiencies of 67 54 32 45 60 and 55 were observed for drimaren red drimaren black drimaren yellow drimaren turquoise foron turquoise and foron blue with the free enzymes which were meaningfully increased up to 83 85 88 83 90 and 86 with cts lac respectively it was also observed that the uv vis spectrum of all dyes exhibits prominent peaks at respective wavelengths which gets diminished after treatment with the free and cts lac without any shift in their λmax confirming laccase catalysis based degradation fig 7 the differential magnitude of dye degradation by the enzyme is attributed to a structural difference among different dyes laccase is a class of multicopper oxidase that contains four histidine rich copper binding domains at the reaction center in the presence of molecular oxygen as a co substrate it is capable of oxidizing a vast number of compounds by a radical driven reaction mechanism thus the laccase enzyme can donate electrons to dye molecules which can accept electrons through a non specific interaction mechanism resulting in a colorless solution 9 13 26 laccase has been reported to oxidize a vast spectrum of organic substrates by circumventing the generation of toxic aromatic compounds due to the presence of multi copper phenolic compounds laccases secreted by different strains of wrf including trametes versicolor phlebia radiate penicillium chrysogenum and polyporus pinistus trametes hirusta laccase has demonstrated promising decolorization potential of up to 80 for various textile dyes 52 a purified trametes pubescens laccase catalyzed the 68 84 degradation of acid black 172 dye after exposure to 48 h that was 1 22 fold greater compared to a free enzyme they speculated the differential dye affinities for different enzymatic conjugated which emphasize the impact of the immobilization process on the catalytic behavior of laccases 53 free laccase displayed 24 55 degradation of reactive black 5 methyl red and remazol brilliant blue r dyes which was amplified to 55 73 and 69 85 by cb laccase and ccb laccases respectively under identical reaction conditions the highest degradation achieved was 85 for rbbr followed by 82 and 69 for mr and rb5 respectively by ccb laccase driven catalytic reactions dyes decolorization by cb laccase and ccb laccase was predominantly ascribed to the laccases assisted catalysis because of the negligible adsorption of support materials similarly laccases from trametes trogii bacterial strains and some marine derived cultures have shown efficient decolorization of synthetic dyes 3 6 reuse capability of cts lac biocatalyst the regeneration feasibility of cts lac for continuous uses in multiple cycles is one of the noteworthy aspects of diminishing the overall cost of enzyme based industrial processes to evaluate the recyclability and repeatability of cts lac during batch operations it was tested in eight successive cycles of foron turquoise dye decolorization and results are presented in fig 8 the cts lac bio conjugate maintained 84 19 72 12 and 54 21 of its original biocatalytic activity after three five and eight successive dye removal cycles which indicates the high and stable dye degradation performance in the repeated batches 54 a gradual decline in the residual activity might be due to the excessive washing of laccase chitosan bio conjugates after each reaction cycle that led to escaping out of enzyme from the support network after six continuous cycles a decolorization activity of over 80 was obtained for reactive blue 171 dye by fe3o4 tcs laccase preparation the origin of the enzyme and the chemical structures of the dye pollutant are the significant factors involved in the dye degradation efficacy of the biocatalysts 55 56 3 7 assessment of water quality parameters the potential of cts lac for the degradation and mineralization of different dyes was further corroborated by analyzing bod toc and cod values of free and cts lac treated dye samples fig 9 bod is the amount of dissolved oxygen required by aerobic biological entities in the water system for the decomposition of organic materials it could be regarded as a reliable index of the organic quality of water both untreated and treated samples of synthetic dyes under study were determined for bod mg l and results are presented in fig 9a before enzymatic treatment the bod values were recorded in the range of 220 392 mg l however a meaningful decrease in the bod level was observed in all dye samples exposed to free 24 01 115 01 as well as an immobilized form of enzymes 10 36 17 29 the recorded reductions in bod values were 85 57 74 20 67 51 81 75 85 51 and 92 02 free laccase and 92 25 95 89 96 29 94 54 93 87 and 96 55 cts lac for drimaren red drimaren black drimaren yellow drimaren turquoise foron turquoise and foron blue respectively measurement of cod provides information about the concentration of organic matter present in dye containing solution before and after enzymatic treatment the transformation of organic matter into inorganic compounds decreases the cod and is a direct indicative measure of effective degradation after treatment with the enzymes cod levels were profoundly reduced in all samples before treatment the cod levels were in the range of 423 10 738 13 mg l which were intensely reduced in all samples after treatment with the enzymes and found to be 109 16 150 12 mg l and 33 40 44 31 mg l by free and cts lac treated dye solutions respectively fig 9b the percentage decreases were 81 17 82 25 79 28 82 53 73 20 and 74 49 free laccase and 93 91 93 47 94 67 94 94 93 01 and 91 90 cts lac for drimaren red drimaren black drimaren yellow drimaren turquoise foron turquoise and foron blue respectively likewise a significant reduction in toc was found for all treated dye samples fig 9c the percentage reductions were 37 05 89 77 71 50 85 65 76 19 and 78 05 and 77 01 92 57 83 03 88 98 92 66 and 93 29 by the catalytic action of free and cts lac respectively the reduced toc values indicate the disruption and decomposition of recalcitrant larger dyes molecules present in textile wastewater into simpler fragments 57 in a current report shaheen et al 58 observed a considerable decline in cod 81 34 98 82 bod 66 44 98 22 and toc 80 21 97 77 values of a set of reactive dyes after treatment with ca alginate encapsulated lip from g lucidum notably the water quality parameters were appreciably improved particularly in the case of immobilized laccase assisted treatment of dye solution than that free enzyme and earlier reports 59 62 4 conclusions extracellular laccase produced by pleurotus nebrodensis wc 850 was immobilized onto firm and high quality spherical chitosan beads to demonstrate its efficacy for degradation and detoxification of various textile reactive and disperse dyes in addition to wide working ph and temperature behavior cts lac achieved efficient degradation efficiencies for all the tested dyes and preserved over 50 of its initial activity for foron turquoise after eight consecutive dye exclusion rounds high degradation appreciable reusability and removal of biological chemical oxygen demand and total organic load manifest its excellent perspective for the treatment of textile industry wastewater and dyeing effluents additional studies should be

was used as a blank a uv vis spectrophotometer was used to check the absorbance of the sample at 420 nm ε420 36 000 m 1 cm 1 22 one unit of laccase activity is the amount which causes the transformation of 1 μmol of abts substrate per minute under assay conditions to quantify total protein content bradford assay was carried out by considering bsa as a reference standard 23 2 4 development of chitosan beads and laccase immobilization chitosan beads were developed by dissolving 1 0 chitosan powder in 1 5 acetic acid solution followed by continuous stirring at mild temperature 50 c a 2 5 chitosan concentration was tested to acquire rigid and high quality beads with desired mechanical stability the spherically shaped beads of different concentrations of chitosan solution were made by filling solution into a syringe and dropwise addition into 1 m potassium hydroxide solution under consistent stirring and kept as such at a very slow speed for 2 h at 30 c to get fully ripened stable beads the developed beads were collected and treated with glutaraldehyde solution 1 4 v v at 30 c for 3 and 6 h to get the optimum concentration of glutaraldehyde required for activation of beads in order to immobilize the laccase enzyme glutaraldehyde functionalized chitosan beads were mixed with laccase solution 0 2 0 6 mg ml for 24 h at 4 c after that the beads were washed and directly utilized for activity measurement at 420 nm immobilization efficiency was monitored for cts lac using eq 1 1 i m m o b i l i z a t i o n e f f i c i e n c y t o t a l a c t i v i t

carried out for free and cts lac to confirm the presence of specific elements like copper in beads the beads were used in their original form to study their edx spectrum 2 6 characterization of free and cts lac the optimum ph for soluble and cts lac was assessed by incubation of reaction mixture in buffers of variable ph i e 3 10 the buffers were tartrate buffer ph 2 0 3 0 sodium malonate buffer ph 4 0 5 0 citrate phosphate ph 6 0 sodium phosphate ph 7 0 8 0 and carbonate buffer of ph 9 0 10 0 for temperature optima both free and cts lac containing reaction mixture were separately heated at 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 and 70 c a range of abts concentration 0 1 1 mm was used to evaluate its effect on the free and cts lac the k m and v max were computed by employing data into the michaelis menten equation 2 7 dye degradation applicability of free and cts lac six different industrial dyes including drimaren red reactive λ max 547 drimaren yellow reactive λ max 417 drimaren black reactive λ max 585 drimaren turquoise reactive λ max 622 foron turquoise disperse λ max 748 and foron blue disperse λ max 541 were used to explore the dye degradation performance free and cts lac triplicate erlenmeyer flasks having 100 ml of individual dye solution 0 01 g 100 ml and free and cts lac were allowed reacting at 30 c for 5 days in a shaker after each 24 h samples were collected to determine the remaining dye concentrations by measuring absorbance at corresponding wavelengths 2 8 examination of water quality parameters the water quality parameters including bod cod and toc were measured using a bod meter and spectrophotometer a digestion flask containing h2so4 1 6 ml 2 n k2cr2o7 1 ml and respective dye samples 4 ml were allowed to digest at 110 c for 90 min and absorbance was recorded to measure toc at 590 nm after cooling down to room temperature for cod measurement 1 5 ml digestion solution and 3 5 ml catalyst solution were added in digestion vial then 2 5 ml of sample solution was taken in a vial and these vials were positioned in an oven at 150 c for 2 h cod was assessed by noting absorbance at 600 nm 24 2 9 statistical analysis microsoft excel software was used to determine mean and standard deviations from three independent experiments the kinetic parameters were calculated by computing data into graph pad prism 6 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction and purification of laccase from p nebrodensis laccase was produced by cultivating p nebrodensis wc 850 on a low cost lignocellulosic agricultural waste wheat straw adopting the pre standardized solid state fermentation conditions 22 the enzyme activity protein concentration and specific activity for a crude form of p nebrodensis laccase were 318 u ml 1 676 mg ml and 189 73 u mg respectively table 1 the enzyme was ideally precipitated out with an optimal saturation point of 80 ammonium sulfate yielding 1 01 fold purification after extensive dialysis the precipitated enzyme was submitted to ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography for further purification all the purification steps resulted in 3 47 fold purity with a specific laccase activity of 659 65 u mg of protein tian et al 25 purified a novel laccase from fresh fruiting bodies of the p nebrodensis using ion exchange cm cellulose deae cellulose and q sepharose and gel filtration chromatography on superdex 75 the enzyme showed adsorption on q sepharose and deae cellulose but not adsorbed onto cm cellulose laccase recovered from culture extract of t versicolor ibl 04 was precipitated out with 80 ammonium sulfate and attained 4 03 folds purification accompanied by the specific activity of 833 u mg after ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography 26 3 2 immobilization of p nebrodensis laccase on chitosan beads aiming to accomplish effective immobilization different concentrations of chitosan solutions 1 5 were ascertained to develop the chitosan microspheres of desired mechanical steadiness laccase showed the best efficiency using a suitable concentration of 2 5 chitosan solution which results in the preparation of hard rigid and firm quality spherical beads fig 1 the chitosan beads were then reacted with varying concentrations of bifunctional reagent glutaraldehyde 1 4 v v to assess its coupling efficiency with the enzyme molecules results evidenced that the highest laccase entrapment was achieved using 2 glutaraldehyde functionalized chitosan beads after 6 h in the case of p nebrodensis fig 2 portrays the glutaraldehyde activated chitosan beads without enzyme and with immobilized laccase enzyme the chitosan beads provided an efficient biocompatible surface for enzyme attachment leading to an immobilization efficiency of 79 table 2 many reactive hydroxyl and amino groups can be generated after the chemical modifications of enzyme protein which are responsible for the coupling of enzymes with the immobilization supports 27 increased immobilization efficiency occurred after the formation of schiff base with an amino group of enzymes followed by the generation of some aldehyde groups on chitosan beads surface because of glutaraldehyde treatment 28 29 in this way the immobilization process is stimulated by the presence of many amino groups on the backbone of chitosan beads without glutaraldehyde treatment the structure of chitosan beads will be very feeble with insufficient functional steadiness 30 low immobilization efficiency at low glutaraldehyde concentration might be ascribed to the inefficient activation of chitosan beads for enzyme attachment the immobilization efficiency was gradually increased by raising the concentration of glutaraldehyde up to 2 a further increase in glutaraldehyde concentration beyond this optimal point 3 and 4 the enzyme entrapment was again dropped due to hindrance of active regions of the enzyme by cross linker structure and stearic interference induced by multiple cross linking points on the surface of chitosan beads between the enzyme candidates 31 33 in an earlier report zheng et al 34 attained the best laccase activity at a relatively moderate concentration of the cross linking agent which was explicated by the favorable creation of attractive linkages between the cross linker and the enzyme particles at an elevated concentration of glutaraldehyde excessive crosslinking often induces conformational alteration in the enzyme molecules leading to destabilization of catalytic sites and thus reducing the immobilization yield 35 36 3 3 edx analysis for elemental analysis energy dispersive x ray analysis was used to confirm the presence of copper elements in laccase bound chitosan microspheres as copper is a typical element of the laccase enzyme the presence of copper in the chitosan beads by edx analysis further confirmed the occurrence of an enzyme in the immobilized beads the comparison of standard and enzyme coupled beads substantiated that copper was only present in those beads which were immobilized with laccase enzyme fig 2b while it was not detected in those beads without the immobilized enzyme fig 2a 3 4 biochemical characterization of free and cts lac 3 4 1 effect of ph on laccase activity the influence of ph on the activity of free and cts lac was investigated by incubating for 10 min at diverse phs ranged from 2 0 to 10 fig 3 enzyme assay results revealed that the optimum ph of the free enzyme was 3 0 whereas the cts lac performed best 401 01 u ml at a neutral ph of 7 0 immobilization of laccase on different supports allows it to act over a broad spectrum of ph than soluble laccase due to the development of stable interactions between laccase molecules and immobilization support that led to its wider adaptability towards environmental inequities 37 40 it was observed that the immobilization process improved the adaptive capability of laccase to alkaline ph conditions and widened the ph range for biocatalysis with an increase in ph values a declining trend was recorded in the enzyme activity of the free form of the enzyme whereas the immobilized laccase first showed an increasing tendency in enzyme activity up to ph 7 0 following a decline with a much lesser rate compared to the native enzyme at a ph value of 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 the enzyme activities for soluble and cts lac were recorded to be 117 5 118 05 99 05 50 01 and 240 14 409 01 365 13 315 01 respectively the results clearly indicate the enhanced resistance of immobilized laccase to alkaline environments that might be ascribed to the buffering action of large negatively charged amino groups present on the inner surface of the chitosan bio carrier yan et al 41 described that the immobilized laccases are comparatively unlikely to interference from the surroundings and exhibit better resistance to broad ph conditions facilitating its catalytic applicability metin 42 observed that chitosan grafted polyethylene imine films immobilized laccase showed augmented enzyme activity with an increase in ph up to ph 6 5 as compared to the free laccase enzyme that worked optimally at ph 5 5 the ph optimum for free laccase produced by different strains of pleurotus has been reported to be 3 5 43 3 4 2 impact of temperature on laccase enzyme activity the effect of different temperatures on free and cts lac was evaluated in the range of 25 80 c with a 5 c interval after 10 min of incubation under temperature controlled conditions the temperature optimum for the free laccase was 35 c 390 1 u ml which was increased to 50 c with enzyme activity 462 5 u ml in the case of cts lac immobilization fig 4 this notable enhancement in temperature tolerance after the immobilization process may be attributed to the fact that the distinctive embedding network of the catalytic support effectually safeguards the enzyme by furnishing a robust microenvironment 44 moreover after immobilization stable interactions between the immobilization matrix and enzyme molecules increased the rigidity of the enzyme structure thus strengthening its ability to tolerate thermal deactivation on the contrary free form of enzymes readily lost its activity at elevated temperatures 45 46 most of the laccases produced by different white rot basidiomycetes have been lost their activities at higher temperatures and found to be stable and active in the temperature range of 30 50 c 47 48 our results aligned with 49 who attained the utmost enzyme activity at 35 c produced by trichoderma harzianum wl 1 of most recent thiolated chitosan fe3o4 hybrid composite conjugated laccase performed it s performed its maximal activity at 50 c due to the potent linkage between laccase and support 50 3 4 3 kinetic parameters the values of k m and v max for free and cts lac were determined by constructing a double reciprocal plot using the line weaver burk plot and results are portrayed in fig 5 the k m and v max values in case of free enzyme produced by p nebrodensis were 111 μm and 308 u ml while k m and v max values for the cts lac were 120 μm and 597 u ml respectively a slight increase in k m indicates a lower affinity of cts lac for abts and presumably due to diffusional resistance of the substrate caused by the support carrier for the catalytic reaction further the substantially increased v max following immobilization corroborated the aggrandized catalytic efficiency of cts lac similar to our study recently mehandia et al 51 obtained k m values of 480 663 and 500 μm accompanied by v max of 111 86 and 96 u ml min for free cts beads and cts clay conjugate beads immobilized laccases respectively 3 5 laccase assisted biocatalytic degradation of dyes the catalytic efficiency of free and cts lac were ascertained for the degradation of six different dyes and results are displayed in fig 6 percent decolorization and fig 7 a f uv vis spectra decolorization analysis showed that all the tested dyes were efficiently decolorized by the cts lac in comparison to its free form the decolorization efficiencies of 67 54 32 45 60 and 55 were observed for drimaren red drimaren black drimaren yellow drimaren turquoise foron turquoise and foron blue with the free enzymes which were meaningfully increased up to 83 85 88 83 90 and 86 with cts lac respectively it was also observed that the uv vis spectrum of all dyes exhibits prominent peaks at respective wavelengths which gets diminished after treatment with the free and cts lac without any shift in their λmax confirming laccase catalysis based degradation fig 7 the differential magnitude of dye degradation by the enzyme is attributed to a structural difference among different dyes laccase is a class of multicopper oxidase that contains four histidine rich copper binding domains at the reaction center in the presence of molecular oxygen as a co substrate it is capable of oxidizing a vast number of compounds by a radical driven reaction mechanism thus the laccase enzyme can donate electrons to dye molecules which can accept electrons through a non specific interaction mechanism resulting in a colorless solution 9 13 26 laccase has been reported to oxidize a vast spectrum of organic substrates by circumventing the generation of toxic aromatic compounds due to the presence of multi copper phenolic compounds laccases secreted by different strains of wrf including trametes versicolor phlebia radiate penicillium chrysogenum and polyporus pinistus trametes hirusta laccase has demonstrated promising decolorization potential of up to 80 for various textile dyes 52 a purified trametes pubescens laccase catalyzed the 68 84 degradation of acid black 172 dye after exposure to 48 h that was 1 22 fold greater compared to a free enzyme they speculated the differential dye affinities for different enzymatic conjugated which emphasize the impact of the immobilization process on the catalytic behavior of laccases 53 free laccase displayed 24 55 degradation of reactive black 5 methyl red and remazol brilliant blue r dyes which was amplified to 55 73 and 69 85 by cb laccase and ccb laccases respectively under identical reaction conditions the highest degradation achieved was 85 for rbbr followed by 82 and 69 for mr and rb5 respectively by ccb laccase driven catalytic reactions dyes decolorization by cb laccase and ccb laccase was predominantly ascribed to the laccases assisted catalysis because of the negligible adsorption of support materials similarly laccases from trametes trogii bacterial strains and some marine derived cultures have shown efficient decolorization of synthetic dyes 3 6 reuse capability of cts lac biocatalyst the regeneration feasibility of cts lac for continuous uses in multiple cycles is one of the noteworthy aspects of diminishing the overall cost of enzyme based industrial processes to evaluate the recyclability and repeatability of cts lac during batch operations it was tested in eight successive cycles of foron turquoise dye decolorization and results are presented in fig 8 the cts lac bio conjugate maintained 84 19 72 12 and 54 21 of its original biocatalytic activity after three five and eight successive dye removal cycles which indicates the high and stable dye degradation performance in the repeated batches 54 a gradual decline in the residual activity might be due to the excessive washing of laccase chitosan bio conjugates after each reaction cycle that led to escaping out of enzyme from the support network after six continuous cycles a decolorization activity of over 80 was obtained for reactive blue 171 dye by fe3o4 tcs laccase preparation the origin of the enzyme and the chemical structures of the dye pollutant are the significant factors involved in the dye degradation efficacy of the biocatalysts 55 56 3 7 assessment of water quality parameters the potential of cts lac for the degradation and mineralization of different dyes was further corroborated by analyzing bod toc and cod values of free and cts lac treated dye samples fig 9 bod is the amount of dissolved oxygen required by aerobic biological entities in the water system for the decomposition of organic materials it could be regarded as a reliable index of the organic quality of water both untreated and treated samples of synthetic dyes under study were determined for bod mg l and results are presented in fig 9a before enzymatic treatment the bod values were recorded in the range of 220 392 mg l however a meaningful decrease in the bod level was observed in all dye samples exposed to free 24 01 115 01 as well as an immobilized form of enzymes 10 36 17 29 the recorded reductions in bod values were 85 57 74 20 67 51 81 75 85 51 and 92 02 free laccase and 92 25 95 89 96 29 94 54 93 87 and 96 55 cts lac for drimaren red drimaren black drimaren yellow drimaren turquoise foron turquoise and foron blue respectively measurement of cod provides information about the concentration of organic matter present in dye containing solution before and after enzymatic treatment the transformation of organic matter into inorganic compounds decreases the cod and is a direct indicative measure of effective degradation after treatment with the enzymes cod levels were profoundly reduced in all samples before treatment the cod levels were in the range of 423 10 738 13 mg l which were intensely reduced in all samples after treatment with the enzymes and found to be 109 16 150 12 mg l and 33 40 44 31 mg l by free and cts lac treated dye solutions respectively fig 9b the percentage decreases were 81 17 82 25 79 28 82 53 73 20 and 74 49 free laccase and 93 91 93 47 94 67 94 94 93 01 and 91 90 cts lac for drimaren red drimaren black drimaren yellow drimaren turquoise foron turquoise and foron blue respectively likewise a significant reduction in toc was found for all treated dye samples fig 9c the percentage reductions were 37 05 89 77 71 50 85 65 76 19 and 78 05 and 77 01 92 57 83 03 88 98 92 66 and 93 29 by the catalytic action of free and cts lac respectively the reduced toc values indicate the disruption and decomposition of recalcitrant larger dyes molecules present in textile wastewater into simpler fragments 57 in a current report shaheen et al 58 observed a considerable decline in cod 81 34 98 82 bod 66 44 98 22 and toc 80 21 97 77 values of a set of reactive dyes after treatment with ca alginate encapsulated lip from g lucidum notably the water quality parameters were appreciably improved particularly in the case of immobilized laccase assisted treatment of dye solution than that free enzyme and earlier reports 59 62 4 conclusions extracellular laccase produced by pleurotus nebrodensis wc 850 was immobilized onto firm and high quality spherical chitosan beads to demonstrate its efficacy for degradation and detoxification of various textile reactive and disperse dyes in addition to wide working ph and temperature behavior cts lac achieved efficient degradation efficiencies for all the tested dyes and preserved over 50 of its initial activity for foron turquoise after eight consecutive dye exclusion rounds high degradation appreciable reusability and removal of biological chemical oxygen demand and total organic load manifest its excellent perspective for the treatment of textile industry wastewater and dyeing effluents additional studies should be

13661,millions of people worldwide are exposed to excessive concentrations of fluoride f from groundwater sources ca al co3 layered double hydroxides ldhs have shown promising defluoridation

performance of ca al co3 ldhs for f removal at environmentally relevant concentrations e g 10 mg l to below the who guideline value 1 5 mg l while in comparison to other acids hno3 h2so4 h3po4 the use of hcl and co2 does not lead to the introduction of potentially harmful or undesired anions the addition of hcl and co2 to ldhs suspensions did lead to changes to the ldhs structure leaching experiments supported by phreeqc modelling and characterization sem edx xrd and ftir strongly suggest that the main mechanism of f removal by ca al co3 ldhs was f adsorption or complexation onto into various rehydrated mixed metal oxides which re precipitated upon partial ldhs dissolution when acidifying keywords ca al co3 ldhs fluoride removal acidification by hcl and co2 phreeqc modelling drinking water treatment 1 introduction fluoride f is a trace element that plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of dental caries 1 however exposure to excessive f concentrations can lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis 2 over 200 million people worldwide are exposed to excessive concentrations of f from groundwater sources 3 india and china are the worst affected around 67 million and 41 million people are affected by fluorosis respectively 4 in the past decades numerous methods e g adsorption ion exchange electrochemical coagulation and membrane processes and materials e g activated alumina bone char synthetic hydroxyapatite biosorbents have been investigated for f removal 5 6 however a sustainable solution to this ongoing crisis still appears intangible due to various obstacles including removal efficiency material costs social acceptability complexity of operation and maintenance 7 layered double hydroxides ldhs are a family of anionic clays that have attracted considerable attention and are considered applicable in f removal due to their high defluoridation capacity and cost effectiveness 8 the general formula of ldhs can be expressed as m2 1 xm3 x oh 2 x am x m nh2o where m2 and m3 correspond to a divalent and trivalent metal respectively where am is an exchangeable anion 9 10 various kinds of ldhs such as mg al zn al ni al li al mg cr mg fe fe mg al ldhs have been studied for f removal from aqueous solutions 9 11 16 among these ldhs types the most studied are the mg al ldhs and their calcined products which are of particular value at higher f concentration ranges in contrast f removal by ca al ldhs is rarely reported but considering the affinity of ca2 and al3 towards f 17 has recently shown promising defluoridation efficiency at low environmentally relevant f concentrations 2 12 mg l 18 table 1 however defluoridation by ca al co3 ldhs is highly ph sensitive with better removals at ph 6 8 compared to ph 9 with the inherent problem of ca al co3 ldhs to react caustic upon addition to water i e ph of point of zero charge 12 13 resulting in reduced defluoridation 5 ph 11 5 initial f 10 mg l 18 as a consequence acidification is required e g by hydrochloric acid hcl nitric acid hno3 22 25 or co2 7 26 however potential effects of such acidification on ca al co3 ldhs induced f removal and associated impacts on the water matrix have not been studied previously despite being mentioned as problematic and potentially hampering successful application the mechanism of f removal by ldhs was mainly explained as f adsorption and anion exchange 13 14 considering the structural properties and the adsorption ion exchange characteristics of ldhs more examinations are needed to understand the possible negative impacts of applying ca al co3 ldhs in combination with acidification such as increased anion concentrations competitive adsorption and modifications changes to the structure of ca al co3 ldhs to further explore the mechanism of f removal therefore the main objectives of this study were to a elucidate and compare the impact of various ph adjusting acids on f removal by ca al co3 ldhs from water at environmentally relevant f concentrations b examine the associated effects on the ldhs material and water composition c propose the main mechanism of f removal by ca al co3 ldhs 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all reagents including naf hcl hno3 h2so4 and h3po4 used for the experiments were of analytical grade sigma aldrich all the water used throughout the experiments and treatment processes

kinetic studies an overview on the conducted experiments is given in fig 1 for acids comparison ca al co3 ldhs samples 0 02 or 0 1 g were firstly dispersed in 100 ml naf solution 10 mg f l directly

stirring for 24 h enough to reach equilibrium based on previous studies 14 18 with subsequent ph measurement and membrane filtration by 0 45 μm to remove the solids in a similar manner different phs 6

leaching were examined afterwards and to minimize potential impacts of al species smaller than the membrane pore size 0 1 μm the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min prior to filtration

acidification sequence cf fig 1 ph was adjusted to 6 by both hcl and co2 after 1 g l ldhs addition followed by f dosage of 10 mg f l cf b in fig 1 and f was dosed to 10 mg f l followed by acidification same dosage as in b and 1 g l ldhs addition cf c in fig 1 the solutions were stirred for 3 h under ph 6 with a cap on the jars 1 l to avoid the influence of air samples of 3 ml each were

experiments and dried in an oven at 105 for 12 h then cooled and ground into powder for further use 2 3 analytical methods scanning electron microscope sem images and x ray analyses edx of ca al co3

99 9860 respectively concentrations of ca2 and al3 leaching after experiment were measured by icp ms analytik jena ag germany 2 4 data evaluation and modelling the f removal efficiency at equilibrium and non equilibrium contact times was calculated using the following formula 1 f r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c c 0 100 where c0 and c are initial and f concentrations mg l at equilibrium and non equilibrium contact times respectively data evaluation and model fitting to experimental data were accomplished using originpro 9 0 the calculation of saturation index si of caf2 and the distribution of al and ca species was carried out using phreeqc 27 28 detailed descriptions of simulation and input files can be found in the supplementary information cf section 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of acidification by various acids the f removal by ca al co3 ldhs at 0 2 and 1 g l from solutions adjusted to ph 6 by acidification with various acids are shown in fig 2 a a dosage of 0 2 g l was chosen to reach well discernible results which is comparatively lower than previous studies on ldhs 0 5 7 5 g l 14 29 30 and much lower than that on indian bauxite 12 77 g l 7 a ph of 6 was chosen to reach well discernible results and because substantial benefits of lower ph were observed previously 14 18 30 under acidified conditions the removal reached 37 co2 and 64 hcl at a 0 2 g l ldhs dose 90 co2 and 94 hcl at 1 g l ldhs at the lower ldhs dose acidification by hno3 resulted in a similar f removal as hcl whereas for h3po4 h2so4 removals were 5 and 8 lower respectively possibly due to increased competition of po4 3 and so4 2 with f because of their electrostatic interaction as compared to cl and no3 24 at the higher ldhs dose of 1 g l f removal differences between the tested acidification methods were small and seemed to remain unchanged at different initial concentrations of f due to overall high removal 90 the high ph buffering capacity of ca al co3 ldhs caused the solution ph to rise to 10 9 11 5 at ldhs doses of 0 2 and 1 g l but better f removals were obtained at lower ph therefore to reach the intended ph 6 considerable dosages of acids were required after ldhs addition at ldhs dose of 1 g l the addition of hcl 478 mg l is similar to the report by cherukumilli et al 211 401 mg l while the addition of co2 0 99 g l is much lower than the reports by cherukumilli et al 22 5 34 7 g l 7 and li et al 80 1 g l 26 although the amount of acids is usually not reported 22 25 the consequent anion concentrations cl no3 po4 3 so4 2 and hco3 at 1 g l ldhs are given in fig 2b at the start and end of the experiments respectively the consequent concentrations of no3 so4 2 and po4 3 were much higher than the drinking water threshold cf table s3 whereas the concentrations of cl and hco3 were thought to be acceptable because although excessive cl concentrations 250 mg l is detectable by taste a guideline value for cl in drinking water is not established and hco3 is not proposed as a chemical related to taste or odour in drinking water 31 32 the no3 concentration after dosing hno3 was 835 mg l and decreased only slightly during the experiments 829 mg l at lower ca al co3 ldhs dose 0 2 g l no3 concentration was still high 170 mg l the po4 3 concentrations after dosing h3po4 decreased from 795 to 238 mg l during the experiments and so4 2 concentrations after dosing h2so4 decreased from 671 to 618 mg l these results indicate a partial uptake of po4 3 and so4 2 by ca al co3 ldhs and could potentially result in competition between f and po4 3 or so4 2 as ldhs have been previously documented to have a stronger affinity for multivalent anions 14 then for monovalent ions the high uptake of po4 3 could also be due to the

dosing co2 was approximately 550 mg l at 1 g l ldhs 3 2 effect of ph and initial f concentration on f removal while considerable differences were not discernible between hcl and co2 acidification at the high ldhs dose f removal was slightly higher for hcl than for co2 at the lower ldhs doses at ph 6 and 7 at higher ph no differences appeared fig 3 a overall f removal increased with decreasing ph and the effect was more pronounced for hcl than for co2 acidification possibly due to competition by hco3 upon application of co2 hco3 concentrations rose to 550 mg l and 168 mg l at ph 6 and 7 respectively which is higher than for hcl 90 mg l because of the dissolution of ldhs earlier research has indicated a slight reduction in f removal due to elevated hco3 concentrations 250 mg l such an adverse effect was not observed for cl as a competitive anion 18 the f removal by 0 2 and 1 g l ca al co3 ldhs at varying initial f concentrations are shown in fig 3b the f removal decreased gradually with the increase of initial f concentrations at 0 2 g l ldhs for 1 g l ldhs the initial f concentration has little discernible effect independent of the initial f concentration higher f removal was reached when acidifying with hcl than when using co2 especially at the lower ldhs dose 0 2 g l likely confirming potential adverse competitive effects of hco3 cf 3 1 at the ca al co3 ldhs dose of 0 2 g l concentration of approximately 6 mg l and 3 8 mg l of f could be reduced when ph was adjusted by hcl and co2 respectively whereas all the initial concentrations 2 12 mg f l were reduced to below who guideline 1 5 mg l at the ca al co3 ldhs dose of 1 g l figure s4 3 3 effect of acidification sequence on f removal in order to better understand the f removal process two groups of experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of time and acidification order f was dosed either after or before acidification of the ca al co3 ldhs containing suspension cf fig 1 the absolute and relative f removal is depicted over time for the two tested acidification orders with hcl and co2 respectively in fig 4 several models fit to the kinetic experimental data and are presented in the supplementary information hcl acidification resulted in faster removal kinetics than co2 acidification specifically equilibria were reached after 20 min 60 min 90 min 180 min for hcl f before after and co2 f before after respectively thus the f removal performance was overall faster when ldhs were added to solutions already containing f and acid as compared to when f was dosed to suspensions previously containing acidified ldhs potentially the ca al co3 ldhs surfaces were firstly activated by acids when acidified prior to f addition and simultaneously occupied by respective anions cl and hco3 which subsequently had to be replaced when f was added the effect was particularly pronounced for co2 where the f removal during f dosage after acidification only approached the removal during f dosage before acidification after several hours possibly the competition for adsorption sites between f and hco3 were more pronounced than with the other ions when co2 is diffusing into the solution the hydration of co2 can occur in two paths at ph 10 the predominant mechanism is via direct reaction with oh forming hco3 and co3 2 instantaneous at ph 8 the direct hydration is the predominant mechanism forming h2co3 and hco3 instantaneous 34 35 and resulting in a high concentration of hco3 which has an adverse effect on f removal 18 during hcl acidification there was little difference between dosage of f before or after acidification similar equilibrium removal apparently cl had little competition with f although 90 mg l of hco3 can be formed because of the dissolution of ldhs after hcl acidification no adverse effect was observed at this concentration 18 3 4 al3 and ca2 leaching fig 5 shows the al3 and ca2 concentrations after addition of 1 g l ca al co3 ldhs the concentration reached 70 mg l for both al3 and ca2 without ph control ph 11 5 after hcl acidification al3 concentrations ranged between 0 05 mg l ph 6 and 75 mg l ph 10 and ca2 concentrations ranged between 184 mg l ph 9 and 273 mg l ph 6 during co2 acidification al3 concentrations were in the range of 0 12 mg l ph 6 to 54 mg l ph 10 and ca2 ranged from 35 mg l ph 9 to 241 mg l ph 6 co2 acidification thus caused slightly higher al3 leaching at ph below 9 but less ca2 leaching compared to hcl ca2 concentrations were within the ranges of the who 100 300 mg l however occasionally additional ca2 removal could be needed if this water is distributed for drinking water supply world health organization 2011 the observed al3 and ca2 leaching indicates the dissolution of ca al co3 ldhs based on its formula ca4al2 oh 12co3 nh2o n 4 5 and the measured concentrations of ca2 approximately 24 of ca al co3 ldhs was dissolved with no ph control and over 94 273 mg l and 83 241 mg l dissolved at ph 6 for hcl and co2 acidification respectively 3 5 proposed removal mechanism given the reduced al3 concentrations at decreased ph it is likely that al containing precipitates were formed from the previously dissolved ldhs composition structure and morphology of precipitated al species are affected by ph value from a pure bayerite phase through bayerite α al oh 3 and boemhite γ alooh to amorphous al species with decreasing ph from 11 to 6 36 f removal from solution onto such precipitates was previously observed 37 38 the distribution of al and f species under varying ph conditions was simulated by phreeqc based on the found leaching concentrations as shown in fig 6 for the al species distribution al oh 4 accounted for 8 at ph 6 70 at ph 7 and 99 for ph 8 the predominant species at ph 6 was al oh 2 32 followed by alf2 23 and alf2 22 for the f species distribution free f was 0 3 at ph 6 10 at ph 7 and 94 at ph 8 alf2 55 and alf2 44 were two predominant species at ph 6 phreeqc modelling cf figures s5 s6 underlined that caf2 precipitation was strongly hampered by al3 presence indicating that the here observed f removal resulted rather from f al interactions than from f ca according to phreeqc modelling and literature data the various al containing species such as al oh 2 alf2 alf2 al oh 4 etc were present under the tested conditions particularly when lowering the ph 8 likely serving as adsorption complexation interaction partners for f depending on the respective ph and f al3 ratio 39 41 fig 7 but specifically for co2 acidification f can also be removed by caco3 adsorption 42 the ph buffering capacity of ca al co3 ldhs played a positive impact on f removal by fully hydrolyzing al3 before al f complexation 3 6 characterization of ca al co3 ldhs before and after use given the observed dissolution and re precipitation of the tested ca al co3 ldhs morphology and structure before and after experiments cf c in fig 1 were further characterized the sem edx results in figure s7 show a reduction of ca particularly for acidification by hcl confirming the observed leaching of this cation the formed hco3 after co2 acidification 550 mg l is much more than that after hcl acidification 90 mg l which likely inhibited the dissolution of caco3 cf figure s6 edx further shows presence of f after the experiments thus verifying f uptake into solids for both acidification methods xrd patterns of ca al co3 ldhs before and after the experiments are given in fig 8 a the virgin ldhs show sharp and symmetric characteristic peaks 003 and 006 of hydrotalcite like compounds at lower 2theta values 43 which almost disappeared by both tested acidification methods indicating the damage of the layered hydrotalcite like structure different from previously examined with mg al type ldhs 13 29 44 the phase identification shows that the ca al co3 ldhs after hcl acidification were amorphous whereas after co2 acidification the main compounds were caco3 and al oh 3 the aqueous stability of ldhs is driven by the solubility of the corresponding divalent metal salt 45 46 the damage of the layered hydrotalcite like structure after acidification indicated a low stability of ca al co3 ldhs the ftir spectra of ca al co3 ldhs before and after the experiments are shown in fig 8b acidification by hcl led to profound structural changes as indicated by the disappearance of nearly all bands oh groups in brucite like layers interlayer and or adsorbed water at 3600 3300 cm 1 47 sorbed co2 and interlamellar co3 2 at 1419 and 1363 cm 1 29 48 as well as calcium and aluminum oxides at 1000 and 600 cm 1 30 48 structural changes by co2 acidification were less severe mainly impacting the layered hydrotalcite like structure disappearance of bands between 3600 and 3300 cm 1 the high concentration of hco3 resulting from the co2 injection likely inhibited the dissolution of caco3 cf figure s6 and probably led to the formation of al oh 3 due to the weak acid property of h2co3 49 adsorbents with a high defluoridation capacity are often double or triple metal oxides while they are generally amorphous and show increased performance at lower ph 7 50 53 the main mechanism of f uptake by mg al ldhs mg al no3 and mg al cl ldhs has been previously proposed as the result of exchange between aqueous f and no3 or cl anions positioned in the mg al ldhs interlayer 13 however our proposed removal mechanism is f adsorption or complexation onto into al containing species and caco3 in the case of co2 acidification which can be supported by the characterization results these results suggest that the layered hydrotalcite like structure was damaged f was present and al oh 3 and caco3 in the case of co2 acidification were formed after the experiments apart from the sem edx xrd and ftir characterization additional research is recommended such as transmission electron microscopy tem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps to further examine the f removal mechanism 4 conclusions in the present work the effects of ph adjusting acids on f removal from water by ca al co3 ldhs were reported acidification by conventional acids like hcl or co2 led to a substantially increased performance of ca al co3 ldhs for f removal at environmentally relevant concentrations e g 10 mg l with a relatively lower ldhs dose than that found in most of the literature the observed f removal under ldhs acidification to ph 6 with hcl and co2 were 62 and 92 hcl and 38 and 90 co2 at ldhs doses of 0 2 and 1 g l respectively addition of hcl and co2 to ldhs suspensions led to changes to the ldhs structure demonstrated by sem edx xrd and ftir leaching experiments supported by phreeqc modelling strongly suggest that the main mechanism of f removal by ca al co3 ldhs was f adsorption or complexation onto into various rehydrated mixed metal oxides which re precipitate upon partial ldhs dissolution when acidifying the benefits of the lower costs cf cost estimate calculation in si and lower residual anion concentrations lead to the recommendation to apply co2 as the acidification method in combination with ca al co3 ldhs the reusability and feasibility of ca al co3 ldhs in column and real groundwater should be examed in future studies declaration of competing interest the

13661,millions of people worldwide are exposed to excessive concentrations of fluoride f from groundwater sources ca al co3 layered double hydroxides ldhs have shown promising defluoridation efficiency however defluoridation by ca al co3 ldhs is highly ph sensitive this study showed that simultaneous acidification by conventional acids such as hcl and co2 substantially increased the performance of ca al co3 ldhs for f removal at environmentally relevant concentrations e g 10 mg l to below the who guideline value 1 5 mg l while in comparison to other acids hno3 h2so4 h3po4 the use of hcl and co2 does not lead to the introduction of potentially harmful or undesired anions the addition of hcl and co2 to ldhs suspensions did lead to changes to the ldhs structure leaching experiments supported by phreeqc modelling and characterization sem edx xrd and ftir strongly suggest that the main mechanism of f removal by ca al co3 ldhs was f adsorption or complexation onto into various rehydrated mixed metal oxides which re precipitated upon partial ldhs dissolution when acidifying keywords ca al co3 ldhs fluoride removal acidification by hcl and co2 phreeqc modelling drinking water treatment 1 introduction fluoride f is a trace element that plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of dental caries 1 however exposure to excessive f concentrations can lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis 2 over 200 million people worldwide are exposed to excessive concentrations of f from groundwater sources 3 india and china are the worst affected around 67 million and 41 million people are affected by fluorosis respectively 4 in the past decades numerous methods e g adsorption ion exchange electrochemical coagulation and membrane processes and materials e g activated alumina bone char synthetic hydroxyapatite biosorbents have been investigated for f removal 5 6 however a sustainable solution to this ongoing crisis still appears intangible due to various obstacles including removal efficiency material costs social acceptability complexity of operation and maintenance 7 layered double hydroxides ldhs are a family of anionic clays that have attracted considerable attention and are considered applicable in f removal due to their high defluoridation capacity and cost effectiveness 8 the general formula of ldhs can be expressed as m2 1 xm3 x oh 2 x am x m nh2o where m2 and m3 correspond to a divalent and trivalent metal respectively where am is an exchangeable anion 9 10 various kinds of ldhs such as mg al zn al ni al li al mg cr mg fe fe mg al ldhs have been studied for f removal from aqueous solutions 9 11 16 among these ldhs types the most studied are the mg al ldhs and their calcined products which are of particular value at higher f concentration ranges in contrast f removal by ca al ldhs is rarely reported but considering the affinity of ca2 and al3 towards f 17 has recently shown promising defluoridation efficiency at low environmentally relevant f concentrations 2 12 mg l 18 table 1 however defluoridation by ca al co3 ldhs is highly ph sensitive with better removals at ph 6 8 compared to ph 9 with the inherent problem of ca al co3 ldhs to react caustic upon addition to water i e ph of point of zero charge 12 13 resulting in reduced defluoridation 5 ph 11 5 initial f 10 mg l 18 as a consequence acidification is required e g by hydrochloric acid hcl nitric acid hno3 22 25 or co2 7 26 however potential effects of such acidification on ca al co3 ldhs induced f removal and associated impacts on the water matrix have not been studied previously despite being mentioned as problematic and potentially hampering successful application the mechanism of f removal by ldhs was mainly explained as f adsorption and anion exchange 13 14 considering the structural properties and the adsorption ion exchange characteristics of ldhs more examinations are needed to understand the possible negative impacts of applying ca al co3 ldhs in combination with acidification such as increased anion concentrations competitive adsorption and modifications changes to the structure of ca al co3 ldhs to further explore the mechanism of f removal therefore the main objectives of this study were to a elucidate and compare the impact of various ph adjusting acids on f removal by ca al co3 ldhs from water at environmentally relevant f concentrations b examine the associated effects on the ldhs material and water composition c propose the main mechanism of f removal by ca al co3 ldhs 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all reagents including naf hcl hno3 h2so4 and h3po4 used for the experiments were of analytical grade sigma aldrich all the water used throughout the experiments and treatment processes was lab produced deionized water an f stock solution 1000 mg l was prepared with naf and then diluted to the desired concentrations the used ca al co3 ldhs actilox cahc were of a ca4al2 oh 12co3 nh2o n 4 5 type with a ca al ratio of 1 86 obtained from nabaltec germany ca al co3 ldhs were dried in an oven at 105 for 12 h before use to get rid of water that may be adsorbed 2 2 batch experiments and kinetic studies an overview on the conducted experiments is given in fig 1 for acids comparison ca al co3 ldhs samples 0 02 or 0 1 g were firstly dispersed in 100 ml naf solution 10 mg f l directly

stirring for 24 h enough to reach equilibrium based on previous studies 14 18 with subsequent ph measurement and membrane filtration by 0 45 μm to remove the solids in a similar manner different phs 6

leaching were examined afterwards and to minimize potential impacts of al species smaller than the membrane pore size 0 1 μm the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min prior to filtration effects of variable f concentration on the overall removal efficiency were tested at ph 6 0 2 g ca al co3 ldhs 100 ml and initial f of 2 4 6 8 10 12 mg l cf supplementary materials in kinetic studies acidification sequence cf fig 1 ph was adjusted to 6 by both hcl and co2 after 1 g l ldhs addition followed by f dosage of 10 mg f l cf b in fig 1 and f was dosed to 10 mg f l followed by acidification same dosage as in b and 1 g l ldhs addition cf c in fig 1 the solutions were stirred for 3 h under ph 6 with a cap on the jars 1 l to avoid the influence of air samples of 3 ml each were

experiments and dried in an oven at 105 for 12 h then cooled and ground into powder for further use 2 3 analytical methods scanning electron microscope sem images and x ray analyses edx of ca al co3

99 9860 respectively concentrations of ca2 and al3 leaching after experiment were measured by icp ms analytik jena ag germany 2 4 data evaluation and modelling the f removal efficiency at equilibrium and non equilibrium contact times was calculated using the following formula 1 f r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c c 0 100 where c0 and c are initial and f concentrations mg l at equilibrium and non equilibrium contact times respectively data evaluation and model fitting to experimental data were accomplished using originpro 9 0 the calculation of saturation index si of caf2 and the distribution of al and ca species was carried out using phreeqc 27 28 detailed descriptions of simulation and input files can be found in the supplementary information cf section 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of acidification by various acids the f removal by ca al co3 ldhs at 0 2 and 1 g l from solutions adjusted to ph 6 by acidification with various acids are shown in fig 2 a a dosage of 0 2 g l was chosen to reach well discernible results which is comparatively lower than previous studies on ldhs 0 5 7 5 g l 14 29 30 and much lower than that on indian bauxite 12 77 g l 7 a ph of 6 was chosen to reach well discernible results and because substantial benefits of lower ph were observed previously 14 18 30 under acidified conditions the removal reached 37 co2 and 64 hcl at a 0 2 g l ldhs dose 90 co2 and 94 hcl at 1 g l ldhs at the lower ldhs dose acidification by hno3 resulted in a similar f removal as hcl whereas for h3po4 h2so4 removals were 5 and 8 lower respectively possibly due to increased competition of po4 3 and so4 2 with f because of their electrostatic interaction as compared to cl and no3 24 at the higher ldhs dose of 1 g l f removal differences between the tested acidification methods were small and seemed to remain unchanged at different initial concentrations of f due to overall high removal 90 the high ph buffering capacity of ca al co3 ldhs caused the solution ph to rise to 10 9 11 5 at ldhs doses of 0 2 and 1 g l but better f removals were obtained at lower ph therefore to reach the intended ph 6 considerable dosages of acids were required after ldhs addition at ldhs dose of 1 g l the addition of hcl 478 mg l is similar to the report by cherukumilli et al 211 401 mg l while the addition of co2 0 99 g l is much lower than the reports by cherukumilli et al 22 5 34 7 g l 7 and li et al 80 1 g l 26 although the amount of acids is usually not reported 22 25 the consequent anion concentrations cl no3 po4 3 so4 2 and hco3 at 1 g l ldhs are given in fig 2b at the start and end of the experiments respectively the consequent concentrations of no3 so4 2 and po4 3 were much higher than the drinking water threshold cf table s3 whereas the concentrations of cl and hco3 were thought to be acceptable because although excessive cl concentrations 250 mg l is detectable by taste a guideline value for cl in drinking water is not established and hco3 is not proposed as a chemical related to taste or odour in drinking water 31 32 the no3 concentration after dosing hno3 was 835 mg l and decreased only slightly during the experiments 829 mg l at lower ca al co3 ldhs dose 0 2 g l no3 concentration was still high 170 mg l the po4 3 concentrations after dosing h3po4 decreased from 795 to 238 mg l during the experiments and so4 2 concentrations after dosing h2so4 decreased from 671 to 618 mg l these results indicate a partial uptake of po4 3 and so4 2 by ca al co3 ldhs and could potentially result in competition between f and po4 3 or so4 2 as ldhs have been previously documented to have a stronger affinity for multivalent anions 14 then for monovalent ions the high uptake of po4 3 could also be due to the formation of ca po4 precipitate si of hydroxyapatite 6 31 calculated by phreeqc at ph6 under such condition 33 hcl acidification resulted in 450 mg l cl and the concentration of introduced hco3 after dosing co2 was approximately 550 mg l at 1 g l ldhs 3 2 effect of ph and initial f concentration on f removal while considerable differences were not discernible between hcl and co2 acidification at the high ldhs dose f removal was slightly higher for hcl than for co2 at the lower ldhs doses at ph 6 and 7 at higher ph no differences appeared fig 3 a overall f removal increased with decreasing ph and the effect was more pronounced for hcl than for co2 acidification possibly due to competition by hco3 upon application of co2 hco3 concentrations rose to 550 mg l and 168 mg l at ph 6 and 7 respectively which is higher than for hcl 90 mg l because of the dissolution of ldhs earlier research has indicated a slight reduction in f removal due to elevated hco3 concentrations 250 mg l such an adverse effect was not observed for cl as a competitive anion 18 the f removal by 0 2 and 1 g l ca al co3 ldhs at varying initial f concentrations are shown in fig 3b the f removal decreased gradually with the increase of initial f concentrations at 0 2 g l ldhs for 1 g l ldhs the initial f concentration has little discernible effect independent of the initial f concentration higher f removal was reached when acidifying with hcl than when using co2 especially at the lower ldhs dose 0 2 g l likely confirming potential adverse competitive effects of hco3 cf 3 1 at the ca al co3 ldhs dose of 0 2 g l concentration of approximately 6 mg l and 3 8 mg l of f could be reduced when ph was adjusted by hcl and co2 respectively whereas all the initial concentrations 2 12 mg f l were reduced to below who guideline 1 5 mg l at the ca al co3 ldhs dose of 1 g l figure s4 3 3 effect of acidification sequence on f removal in order to better understand the f removal process two groups of experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of time and acidification order f was dosed either after or before acidification of the ca al co3 ldhs containing suspension cf fig 1 the absolute and relative f removal is depicted over time for the two tested acidification orders with hcl and co2 respectively in fig 4 several models fit to the kinetic experimental data and are presented in the supplementary information hcl acidification resulted in faster removal kinetics than co2 acidification specifically equilibria were reached after 20 min 60 min 90 min 180 min for hcl f before after and co2 f before after respectively thus the f removal performance was overall faster when ldhs were added to solutions already containing f and acid as compared to when f was dosed to suspensions

probably led to the formation of al oh 3 due to the weak acid property of h2co3 49 adsorbents with a high defluoridation capacity are often double or triple metal oxides while they are generally amorphous and show increased performance at lower ph 7 50 53 the main mechanism of f uptake by mg al ldhs mg al no3 and mg al cl ldhs has been previously proposed as the result of exchange between aqueous f and no3 or cl anions positioned in the mg al ldhs interlayer 13 however our proposed removal mechanism is f adsorption or complexation onto into al containing species and caco3 in the case of co2 acidification which can be supported by the characterization results these results suggest that the layered hydrotalcite like structure was damaged f was present and al oh 3 and caco3 in the case of co2 acidification were formed after the experiments apart from the sem edx xrd and ftir characterization additional research is recommended such as transmission electron microscopy tem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps to further examine the f removal mechanism 4 conclusions in the present work the effects of ph adjusting acids on f removal from water by ca al co3 ldhs were reported acidification by conventional acids like hcl or co2 led to a substantially increased performance of ca al co3 ldhs for f removal at environmentally relevant concentrations e g 10 mg l with a relatively lower ldhs dose than that found in most of the literature the observed f removal under ldhs acidification to ph 6 with hcl and co2 were 62 and 92 hcl and 38 and 90 co2 at ldhs doses of 0 2 and 1 g l respectively addition of hcl and co2 to ldhs suspensions led to changes to the ldhs structure demonstrated by sem edx xrd and ftir leaching experiments supported by phreeqc modelling strongly suggest that the main mechanism of f removal by ca al co3 ldhs was f adsorption or complexation onto into various rehydrated mixed metal oxides which re precipitate upon partial ldhs dissolution when acidifying the benefits of the lower costs cf cost estimate calculation in si and lower residual anion concentrations lead to the recommendation to apply co2 as the acidification method in combination with ca al co3 ldhs the reusability and feasibility of ca al co3 ldhs in column and real groundwater should be examed in future studies declaration of competing interest the

13662,acid and thermal treated sepiolite was organophilized by cationic exchange with several alkylammonium cations octylammonium hexadecylammonium tetradecyltrimethylammonium and hexadecyltrimethylammonium the adsorption capacity of btex from aqueous solutions was evaluated through the adsorption isotherms performed in batch the results were analysed using three isotherm models freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich d r model the behaviour of adsorption isotherm suggested the multilayer coverage on a heterogeneous surface which is according to the freundlich isotherm model the thermodynamic analyse using the d r model show that physical mechanisms govern the process the maximum adsorption capacity of btex on the obtained materials was in the range values of 81 19 mg g 1 1448 42 mg g 1 which are higher than those reported up to now the organo sepiolite materials exhibit a high potential in the adsorption of btex compounds from aqueous solutions keywords sepiolite organophilization btex adsorption alkylammonium cations 1 introduction btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene are a group of volatile and flammable compounds widely used as solvents during the last two decades these compounds have become a focus of research because they are carcinogenic and mutagenic agents even at low concentrations 1 the btex compounds are very persistent pollutants in both soil and water and they rapidly expand because of their solubility 2 for instance it was established that would take around 250 years to remove a concentration of 900 mg l 1 by natural mechanisms 3 and the btex compounds from an oil spill have a degradation rate less than 0 0002 per day therefore 200 years would be required for total removal 4 on the other hand the presence of btex in water generates dangerous effects for ecosystems the exponential increase in oxygen demand the decrease in the availability of nitrates and sulphates and the generation of ferrous iron sulphide and carbon dioxide 5 the world health organization classifies the btex compounds as priority carcinogenic pollutants and limits the maximum concentration of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene in drinking water to 0 01 0 7 0 3 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively 6 produced water is a by product of oil and gas extraction and it is the main source of contamination by btex compounds in surface and groundwater reaching btex concentrations up to a value of 600 mg l 1 7 other sources of btex pollution are the leakage of petroleum and its products vehicle exhaust coal and biomass burning 8 disposal of contaminated effluents from the painting and petrochemical industry 2 household wastes 9 and municipal landfills 10 different methods are used to remove btex compounds from aqueous media among them natural and synthetic filters adsorbent materials and chemical substances that allow their fast degradation chemical reactions can generate by products that are even more toxic such as phenols and chlorinated phenols 11 the filters are not an accessible alternative due to their high prices and difficult recovery the adsorption process is the most prominent alternative for btex removal because it allows the subsequent recovery of adsorbents and adsorbates 12 early studies used activated carbon for btex removal from aqueous media due to its efficient adsorption capacity nevertheless irregularly shaped pores increase the diffusion resistance so the adsorption equilibrium takes a long time 13 moreover the overall costs for activation and regeneration became it an expensive adsorbent for industrial applications 14 other carbonaceous materials like lignite have been applied in btex adsorption with a maximum adsorption capacity of 19 309 mg g 1 15 on the other hand zeolites exhibit a specific surface area that is suitable for the adsorption of organic pollutants and there are several reports about the improved adsorption capacity of btex on zeolites reaching a maximum adsorption capacity up to 805 953 mg g 1 16 recently carbon nanotubes cnts emerged exhibiting improved properties respect to conventional materials 17 and the adsorption applications were not an exception in order to reach the maximum sorption capacity of btex several methodologies of surface modification were performed in this way oxidation with naocl allowed to the cnts reaching a maximum adsorption capacity of 1284 12 mg g 1 18 which was the higher up to now the low cost and the easy accessibility of sepiolite and other clays have motivated their wide use in the adsorption of pollutants from aqueous solutions 19 sepiolite is a hydrated magnesium silicate with an ideal formula si12o30mg8 oh 4 oh2 4 8h2o 20 unlike other 2 1 phyllosilicates the sepiolite exhibits fibrous morphology resulting from its discontinuous structure which consists of continuous tetrahedral sheets with apices pointing in opposite directions this structure produces well defined channels similar to the large continuous pores from the zeolite minerals 21 sepiolite has a high specific surface area and various types of adsorption sites allowing the adsorption of water polar liquids and cations 20 like the other natural clays the sepiolite is a markedly hydrophilic material so it exhibits a low adsorption capacity of aromatic compounds this is due to repulsion phenomena between surface water and the non polar compounds 22 in this sense surface functionalization of sepiolite to improve its performance as an adsorbent of organic compounds has been carried out through different methodologies including microwave assisted acid treatment 23 heat and acid treatment 24 organophilization by cation exchange 25 to improve their adsorption properties and in such way cause stand out among others clay minerals the microwave assisted acid treatment of sepiolite exhibits a higher specific surface area and pore volume than raw sample allowing a high and selective adsorption of co2 47 mg g 1 23 on the other hand early studies reported a 20 increase in the specific surface area reaching values greater than 500 m2 g 1 for heat and acid treated sepiolite 26 27 the acid treatment also increased the porosity and the number of acid sites of the sepiolite improving its performance for the ethylene adsorption up to 17 447 mg g 1 28 on the other hand organophilization of sepiolite with hexadecyltrimethylammonium hdtma was successfully applied to adsorb 3 chlorophenol 49 110 mg g 1 the organophilic material exhibited better performance adsorption than the acid treated sepiolite 19 644 mg g 1 29 sepiolite modified with hdtma has also applied in the adsorption of acid green 20 dye 63 29 mg g 1 30 and cr vi 2 184 mg g 1 31 the above results and the use of pure sepiolite as an effective adsorbent for surface oil spill up to 580 mg g 1 32 suggest their potential application in the adsorption of btex compounds although many investigations have reported the removal of the btex compounds from aqueous media by clays modified with organic cations 12 16 33 34 no data are available for the use of sepiolite to remove these pollutants besides the joint effect of acid treatment and organophilization on the performance of sepiolite as adsorbent has not been studied in this research sepiolite was subjected to acid and heat treatment at several acid concentrations and temperatures and subsequently organophilized with octylammonium hexadecylammonium tetradecyltrimethylammonium and hexadecyltrimethylammonium cations to be used in the adsorption of btex from aqueous solutions the influence of the organic cation on the adsorption capacity of btex was evaluated through isotherm studies and the adoption data were fitted to the freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich d r models furthermore the regeneration test of the adsorption process was performed to estimate the applicability of the obtained materials in environmental remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents powdered sepiolite with formula mg4si6o15 oh 2 xh2o cas no 63800 37 3 was purchased from sigma aldrich primary amines octylamine c8h19n and hexadecylamine c16h35n and quaternary ammonium salts tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide c17h38brn and hexadecytrimethylammonium bromide c19h42brn were purchased from sigma aldrich with high purity 99 benzene c6h6 toluene c7h8 ethylbenzene c8h10 and p xylene c8h10 were of analytical grade 99 purity 2 2 organophilization of treated sepiolite for the purification of raw sepiolite raw sep 50 g were ground and suspended in 500 ml of distilled water then 2 0 m hcl solution was added until ph 4 subsequently the suspension was filtered and the solid was dried at 60 c following the sepiolite was suspended in 500 ml of distilled water and heated at 60 c under shaken then 30 h2o2 was dropwise added to the suspension until gas generation ceased 35 the solid obtained was washed with water filtered and dried at 60 c to obtain purified sepiolite pure sep in the second stage the sepiolite purified was treated with both acid and thermal treatment 2 g of pure sep samples were immersed in 20 ml of hcl solutions with different concentration 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m and shaken for 12 h at 25 c subsequently the samples were washed with water filtered and dried the resultant solids were heated at 100 200 and 300 c for 12 h finally the obtained samples were suspended in saturated nacl solutions 4 5 m at 25 c for 24 h in the third stage organophilization procedure was carried out on the sepiolite treated with hcl 1 m heated at 100 c and na saturated sep since these were the experimental conditions that led to the highest specific surface area and cation exchange capacity cec the samples were suspended in solutions of amines and quaternary ammonium salts octylamine hexadecylamine tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide dissolved in aqueous solutions of 0 1 m hcl the concentration of the organic cation was equal to 200 of the cec of sep the solutions were shacked at 80 c for 3 h using bottles with screw cap the resulting solids were separated by centrifugation and washed with a water ethanol mix 1 1 v v at 50 c 36 finally the obtained materials were tagged according to the organic cation used octylammonium oa sep hexadecylammonium hda sep tetradecyltrimethylammonium tdtma sep and hexadecyltrimethylammonium hdtma sep 2 3 adsorption experiments adsorption tests were carried out using the batch technique it was started from an aqueous solution of btex at 100 mg l 1 containing 25 mg l 1 of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and p xylene subsequently additional btex concentrations between 5 and 100 mg l 1 were obtained by dilution also experimental conditions were 25 c 200 rpm an adsorbent dosage of 5 g l 1 and contact time of 24 h after the adsorption process the suspensions were centrifuged 6000 rpm and at 4 c the supernatants were separated and analysed by hplc uv vis experimental data were corrected according to btex loss due to volatilization which was less than 3 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of each material qe mg g 1 was calculated using eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e v m where c0 mg l 1 is the initial concentration of btex ce mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration of btex after adsorption v l is the volume of solution and m g is the mass of adsorbent the adsorption results were fitted to the freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm models through non linear regression of experimental data eq 2 shows the freundlich isotherm model in the non linear form 2 q e k f c e n 1 where qe mg g 1 is the equilibrium adsorption capacity kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 is the freundlich coefficient ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in solution and the term n 1 is the constant of non linear correction 37 on the other hand eq 3 shows non linear form of the langmuir isotherm model 3 q e q l k l c e 1 k l c e where ql mg g 1 is the maximum adsorption capacity calculated under the model and kl l mg 1 is the langmuir constant 38 finally eq 4 shows the non linear form of the d r isotherm model 4 q e q d r e β l n 1 1 c e 2 where qd r mg g 1 is me maximum adsorption capacity and β kj2 mol 2 is an energy coefficient related to the mean adsorption energy e kj mol 1 39 which can be calculated using the eq 5 5 e 1 2 β 2 4 regeneration test similar conditions to those of the adsorption experiments were used to perform the regeneration test each material was first saturated in a btex solution of 100 mg l 1 then it was separated and dried at room temperature for 24 h subsequently the materials were heated at 150 c for 1 h achieving the evaporation of the solutes 12 40 regeneration tests were performed four consecutive times to determinate the variability of the adsorption capacity 2 5 characterization the x ray diffraction xrd patterns were performed using a powder diffractometer bruker model d8 advance with davinci geometry equipped with cu kα radiation λ 1 54 å and operating at 40 kv and 40 ma the diffraction angle was in the range 5 70 2θ with a step size of 0 02 2θ and counting time of 0 2 s per point morphology of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem using jeol jsm 6490 lv equipment at 66 000 semi quantitative energy dispersive spectrometry eds analysis was made using a multi element detector prior sem analysis the samples were coated with graphite to enhance the conductivity for the acid and thermal treated sepiolite the cation exchange capacity was determined using the taylor method 41 and the specific surface area was calculated from the n2 adsorption isotherm on a micrometrics gemini 2375 equipment using the bet method 42 the obtained materials were analysed by diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy drifts using an ftir spectrometer nicolet model is50 in the wave number range 400 4000 cm 1 the thermogravimetric analysis tga was performed in a setaram 1600 equipment under nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature range 25 800 c with a heating rateof 10 c min 1 the concentration of btex solutions was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc in an equipment agilent 1200 series lc with uv vis detector quaternary pump and manual sampler the btex separation was performed on a column silicachrom c18 4 6 mm x 150 mm 5 μm using a flow ratio of 1 ml min 1 and a wavelength of 230 nm the mobile phase used was a methanol b acetonitrile and c 10 mm trisodium phosphate in isocratic gradient a b c 3 1 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 purification of raw sepiolite the xrd patterns of the raw and purified sepiolite are shown in fig 1 a several secondary crystal phases were identified in the xrd pattern of raw sepiolite raw sep which corresponded to quartz q jcpds 046 1045 and other minerals talc jcpds 29 1493 and palygorskite jcpds 31 0783 after the treatment pure sep typical reflections of sepiolite jcpds 01 075 1597 were observed with a strong reflection at 2θ 7 352 corresponding to the crystallographic plane 1 1 0 with basal spacing of 11 959 å 43 the characteristic diffraction reflections of purified sepiolite showed a better definition and intensity which are due to the elimination of most of the secondary phases raw sep sample showed aggregates of various sizes and shapes due to the presence of impurities fig 1c after purification treatment the pure sep material showed acicular morphology with large fibres of 100 nm wide and well defined edges which is typical of sepiolite fig 1b the eds analysis indicated that samples were composed of si mg al f and o the presence of c in the samples is mainly due to the graphite coating prior to sem analysis table 1 the changes in the chemical composition of pure sep regarding raw sep are attributed to the purification process fig 2 shows the tg a and dtg b curves of pure sep and raw sep the purified material showed a total weight loss of 19 7 which was lower than the one of raw sample 28 3 this can be associated to elimination of organic matter and carbonates during the purification process the materials showed a dtg peak in the temperature range 20 200 c corresponding to evaporation of water absorbed on sepiolite surface the dtg peak in the temperature range 200 300 c is attributed to evaporation of water molecules located in zeolitic channels of sepiolite in the third temperature range 300 500 c the dtg peak corresponds to coordinated water of magnesium of the octahedral sheets finally dehydroxylation of mg oh groups occurs in the temperature range 500 800 c generating the thermal decomposition of the crystal structure 44 3 2 acid and thermal treatment of the purified sepiolite fig 3 shows the specific surface area a and cec b regarding both acid concentration and heat temperature in both cases the maximum increase of the parameters was reached with 1 0 m hcl during 12 h and heat at 100 c sep the increase from 15 36 75 62 cmolc kg 1 for cec is attributable to the lixiviation of mg2 ions from the material structure which generates the need of charge compensation increasing the cec 29 the increase in the specific surface area from 292 159 919 188 m2 g 1 during the acid treatment is attributed to the removal of impurities from the open and zeolitic channels and holes generated by lixiviation of mg2 ions 45 the thermal treatment at 100 c generates the dehydration of the open and zeolitic channels allowing better adsorbates access the material treated with 1 0 m hcl during 12 h and heat at 100 c sep did not show a loss of crystallinity respect to purified material fig 3c by contrast higher concentrations of acid during longer times affect the material structure due to aluminium leaching from tetrahedral sheet eliminating the need of charge compensation and decreasing the cec 46 on the other hand higher temperatures 200 c and 300 c generate the gradually loss of the water molecules coordinated to magnesium thus the structure collapses and the accessibility of pores being hindering 47 3 3 organophilization of acid and thermal treated sepiolite sep fig 4 shows the ftir spectra of acid and thermal treated sepiolite sep and sep organophilized with octylammonium oa sep hexadecylammonium hda sep tetradecyltrimethylammonium tdtma sep and hexadecyltrimethylammonium cations hdtma sep the ftir spectrum of sep showed characteristic bands at 3678 cm 1 attributed to oh stretching vibrations in the octahedral sheet 3557 and 3407 cm 1 corresponding to stretching vibrations of hydration and zeolitic water molecules respectively oh groups stretching of water coordinated to magnesium at 1657 cm 1 stretching bands of si o at 1276 1037 and 989 cm 1 bending vibration of mgsioh bounds at 802 cm 1 and bending vibration of mgoh bound at 654 cm 1 48 intensity of the bands associated with water molecules of hydration and zeolitic water between 3689 and 3411 cm 1 decreased in the organo sepiolites additionally the organo sepiolites showed absorption bands associated with organic groups nh3 group at 3640 cm 1 and 3573 cm 1 ch3 group at 2934 cm 1 ch2 group at 2854 cm 1 ch bound at 1467 and 1375 cm 1 and cn bond at 1042 cm 1 49 these results support the exchange of hydrated na cations by the organic cations 50 regardless of the organophilization process the band at 1657 cm 1 which is attributed to coordinated water molecules was not affected thus preserving the discontinuous structure tg and dtg curves of sep and the organo sepiolite materials are shown in fig 5 the organo sepiolites showed a greater total weight loss than sep associated with the incorporation of organic cation in the material the organo sepiolite materials presented a lower intensity of the dtg peak in the temperature range 20 200 c corresponding to evaporation of water molecules of hydration absorbed on sepiolite surface this lower intensity can be attributed to decreasing in the content of water the organo sepiolite materials showed a broad dtg peak in the temperature range 200 500 c which corresponds to thermal decomposition of the incorporated organic cations 51 the oa sep material presented additional dtg peaks at 214 447 and 538 c which is attributed to several interactions between organic cations and material favoured by the non ramified carbon chain with a smaller length of the octylammonium cation the sepiolite presents four types of interactions that can influence the decomposition temperature of the cation a occupation of mg2 vacancies in the octahedral sheet generated during acid and thermal activation b electrostatic attraction with negative charges generated in the tetrahedral sheet isomorphic substitutions c interactions with the si oh groups n sites and d hydrogen bonds between coordinated water molecules and terminal amino groups of the organic cations 52 3 4 adsorption isotherms of btex on sep and organo sepiolites fig 6 shows the influence of initial concentration on adsorption capacity of btex in sep and the organo sepiolite materials a and the adsorption isotherms b the adsorption capacity increased and gradually tended to stabilize when initial btex concentration increased fig 6a this behaviour is typical of systems with high affinity between adsorbent and solute even at a low initial concentration the curvature of the adsorption isotherms fig 6b describes that the equilibrium adsorption capacity depends on the availability of adsorption sites 53 the adsorption capacity of the organo sepiolites was greater than sep and tdtma sep material presented the greatest adsorption capacity the organophilization process with the alkylammonium cations favours the adsorbent adsorbate interactions due to a decrease of hydrated na cations which allows a higher affinity for organic molecules 32 the experimental data fitted to freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich isotherm models are show in fig 7 a c respectively and the calculated parameters of each model are shown in table 2 the adsorption data of btex on sep and the organo sepiolite materials were well fitted to the freundlich isotherm model fig 7a with high values of correlation coefficients r2 0 997 which is attributed to multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous surface several researches have determined that adsorption of btex from aqueous solutions is well described by the freundlich isotherm model 18 33 54 the kf term increased with the equilibrium adsorption capacity which shows the existence of a heterogeneous surface with sites of high and low adsorption affinity 55 the calculated n 1 value for sep was 0 479 and for the organo sepiolite materials was in the range 0 408 0 477 the n 1 constant generally presents values between 0 and 1 the values less than 0 7 describe highly curves isotherms in which the adsorption capacity gradually decrease because of the saturation of adsorption sites 56 the fitting to the langmuir isotherm model fig 7b obtained r2 values 0 964 the ql values calculated from experimental adsorption data followed the order sep 81 191 mg g 1 oa sep 489 494 mg g 1 hda sep 925 281 mg g 1 hdtma sep 1165 887 mg g 1 tdtma sep 1448 425 mg g 1 the difference in the obtained values can be attributed to several factors related with the organic cation such as carbon chain length amount of organic cation incorporated and saturation of the amino group 57 on the other hand surface tension force has an important influence on the adsorption of non polar compounds into the materials 54 table 3 shows values calculated using acd chemsketch software 58 the tdtma cation has a surface tension calculated of 28 70 mn m 1 which is the closest value with regard to the surface tension average for the btex compounds of 28 90 mn m 1 59 the influence of the surface tension force on the adsorption capacity can suggest that adsorption is mainly due to hydrophobic interactions between the sorbate and the organic chains of the cation d r isotherm model was used to calculate the mean adsorption energies the value of the mean adsorption energy is related to the type of process whether e 8 kj mol 1 occurs a physical adsorption when e 16 kj mol 1 occurs a chemical adsorption and from 8 to 16 kj mol 1 the process occurs by ionic exchange 60 the mean adsorption energies of sep and the organo sepiolite materials were between 0 112 and 0 734 kj mol 1 which indicates that the adsorption process of btex on adsorbents is governed by physical mechanisms btex compounds are used as dissolvent in many industrial processes therefore the low energies of adsorption possibility the easy process reversal allowing the adsorbates release in a controlled way table 4 shows the maximum adsorption capacity of btex from aqueous solutions on several materials the greater adsorption capacity with regard to other materials can be attributed to the structural and morphological properties such as the high surface area pore size the organic cations type used in the organophilization process and the existence of n sites and the magnesium vacancies the study of the multicomponent adsorption of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and p xylene was carried out using the tdtma sep material and the previous experimental conditions fig 8 shows the effect of the initial concentration of benzene b toluene t ethylbenzene t and p xylene p x on the adsorption capacity a and the adsorption isotherms fitted to the freundlich b and langmuir c models the adsorption capacity followed the increasing order b t e p x which is in agreement with other reports for btex adsorption on organo clay materials 10 31 32 38 this order is inversely proportional to the water solubility of the compounds b 1790 mg l 1 t 530 mg l 1 e 152 mg l 1 and p x 150 5 mg l 1 which can be obtained from the logarithm of the octanol water partition coefficients kow 62 the presence of methyl and ethyl groups restricts the charge delocalization in the aromatic compounds became them less polar 63 such as it was discussed above the adsorption process in the organo sepiolite materials is mainly governed mainly by hydrophobic interactions therefore less polar compounds are preferentially adsorbed the isotherm parameters for each compound are shown in table 5 the results showed that the freundlich isotherm model fits well for the adsorption of every btex compound on the tdtma sep material reaching a r2 values higher than 0 99 in multicomponent adsorption the n 1 parameter is related to the intensity of the process 64 for all the compounds the value of n 1 was less than 1 b 0 528 t 0 505 e 0 494 p x 0 409 indicating favourable adsorption in the multicomponent system 12 on the order hand the langmuir isotherm model allowed determining the maximum adsorption capacity ql the ql values followed the increasing order benzene 296 011 mg g 1 toluene 424 921 mg g 1 ethyl benzene 439 302 mg g 1 p xylene 471 466 mg g 1 3 5 regeneration test the adsorption cycles of btex on sep and the organo sepiolite materials are shown in fig 9 non organophilized material sep exhibited the least reduction in adsorption capacity which is attributable to the fact that its adsorption capacity is not dependent on the content and distribution of organic cations and the temperature used for regeneration is not high enough to affect the structure of the material on the other hand organo sepiolite materials showed relative adsorption capacities of 93 5 oa sep 96 9 tdma sep 97 8 hdtma sep 98 7 hda sep in the fourth adsorption cycle the difference in the adsorption efficiency after regeneration can be attributable to slight losses of the organic cation due to thermic treatment in this way the oa sep material exhibited the biggest loss of adsorption efficiency which can be attributable to octylammonium has a higher vapour pressure 129 322 n m2 65 than the other organic cations used favouring its volatilization during regeneration tests finally the regeneration test showed that the adsorbents could be reused more than four times without a significant decrease in adsorption efficiency 4 conclusions the purification treatment applied to sepiolite allowed eliminating secondary phases present in the commercial sample in other hand purified material exhibited a uniform fibrous morphology in turn the acid and thermal treatment with 1 0 m hcl and 100 c on the sepiolite generated an increment from 15 36 75 60 cmolc kg 1 and from 292 159 919 188 m2 g 1 for cec and specific surface area respectively isotherm studies carried out with the organo sepiolite materials showed that experimental data were appropriately fitted to the freundlich isotherm model this indicates that the adsorbent presents a heterogeneous surface and the adsorption depends on the adsorption sites availability it was determined that the surface tension force plays an important role in the adsorption capacity of obtained adsorbents tdtma sep material presented the highest adsorption capacity 1448 425 mg g 1 among the materials used in this study and the reported in the literature altogether the obtained materials and mainly tdtma sep demonstrated the effectiveness in the removal of btex from aqueous media this gives an important perspective of its potential

13662,acid and thermal treated sepiolite was organophilized by cationic exchange with several alkylammonium cations octylammonium hexadecylammonium tetradecyltrimethylammonium and hexadecyltrimethylammonium the adsorption capacity of btex from aqueous solutions was evaluated through the adsorption isotherms performed in batch the results were analysed using three isotherm models freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich d r model the behaviour of adsorption isotherm suggested the multilayer coverage on a heterogeneous surface which is according to the freundlich isotherm model the thermodynamic analyse using the d r model show that physical mechanisms govern the process the maximum adsorption capacity of btex on the obtained materials was in the range values of 81 19 mg g 1 1448 42 mg g 1 which are higher than those reported up to now the organo sepiolite materials exhibit a high potential in the adsorption of btex compounds from aqueous solutions keywords sepiolite organophilization btex adsorption alkylammonium cations 1 introduction btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene are a group of volatile and flammable compounds widely used as solvents during the last two decades these compounds have become a focus of research because they are carcinogenic and mutagenic agents even at low concentrations 1 the btex compounds are very persistent pollutants in both soil and water and they rapidly expand because of their solubility 2 for instance it was established that would take around 250 years to remove a concentration of 900 mg l 1 by natural mechanisms 3 and the btex compounds from an oil spill have a degradation rate less than 0 0002 per day therefore 200 years would be required for total removal 4 on the other hand the presence of btex in water generates dangerous effects for ecosystems the exponential increase in oxygen demand the decrease in the availability of nitrates and sulphates and the generation of ferrous iron sulphide and carbon dioxide 5 the world health organization classifies the btex compounds as priority carcinogenic pollutants and limits the maximum concentration of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene in drinking water to 0 01 0 7 0 3 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively 6 produced water is a by product of oil and gas extraction and it is the main source of contamination by btex compounds in surface and groundwater reaching btex concentrations up to a value of 600 mg l 1 7 other sources of btex pollution are the leakage of petroleum and its products vehicle exhaust coal and biomass burning 8 disposal of contaminated effluents from the painting and petrochemical industry 2 household wastes 9 and municipal landfills 10 different methods are used to remove btex compounds from aqueous media among them natural and synthetic filters adsorbent materials and chemical substances that allow their fast degradation chemical reactions can generate by products that are even more toxic such as phenols and chlorinated phenols 11 the filters are not an accessible alternative due to their high prices and difficult recovery the adsorption process is the most prominent alternative for btex removal because it allows the subsequent recovery of adsorbents and adsorbates 12 early studies used activated carbon for btex removal from aqueous media due to its efficient adsorption capacity nevertheless irregularly shaped pores increase the diffusion resistance so the adsorption equilibrium takes a long time 13 moreover the overall costs for activation and regeneration became it an expensive adsorbent for industrial applications 14 other carbonaceous materials like lignite have been applied in btex adsorption with a maximum adsorption capacity of 19 309 mg g 1 15 on the other hand zeolites exhibit a specific surface area that is suitable for the adsorption of organic pollutants and there are several reports about the improved adsorption capacity of btex on zeolites reaching a maximum adsorption capacity up to 805 953 mg g 1 16 recently carbon nanotubes cnts emerged exhibiting improved properties respect to conventional materials 17 and the adsorption applications were not an exception in order to reach the maximum sorption capacity of btex several methodologies of surface modification were performed in this way oxidation with naocl allowed to the cnts reaching a maximum adsorption capacity of 1284 12 mg g 1 18 which was the higher up to now the low cost and the easy accessibility of sepiolite and other clays have motivated their wide use in the adsorption of pollutants from aqueous solutions 19 sepiolite is a hydrated magnesium silicate with an ideal formula si12o30mg8 oh 4 oh2 4 8h2o 20 unlike other 2 1 phyllosilicates the sepiolite exhibits fibrous morphology resulting from its discontinuous structure which consists of continuous tetrahedral sheets with apices pointing in opposite directions this structure produces well defined channels similar to the large continuous pores from the zeolite minerals 21 sepiolite has a high specific surface area and various types of adsorption sites allowing the adsorption of water polar liquids and cations 20 like the other natural clays the sepiolite is a markedly hydrophilic material so it exhibits a low adsorption capacity of aromatic compounds this is due to repulsion phenomena between surface water and the non polar compounds 22 in this sense surface functionalization of sepiolite to improve its performance as an adsorbent of organic compounds has been carried out through different methodologies including microwave assisted acid treatment 23 heat and acid treatment 24 organophilization by cation exchange 25 to improve their adsorption properties and in such way cause stand out among others clay minerals the microwave assisted acid treatment of sepiolite exhibits a higher specific surface area and pore volume than raw sample allowing a high and selective adsorption of co2 47 mg g 1 23 on the other hand early studies reported a 20 increase in the specific surface area reaching values greater than 500 m2 g 1 for heat and acid treated sepiolite 26 27 the acid treatment also increased the porosity and the number of acid sites of the sepiolite improving its performance for the ethylene adsorption up to 17 447 mg g 1 28 on the other hand organophilization of sepiolite with hexadecyltrimethylammonium hdtma was successfully applied to adsorb 3 chlorophenol 49 110 mg g 1 the organophilic material exhibited better performance adsorption than the acid treated sepiolite 19 644 mg g 1 29 sepiolite modified with hdtma has also applied in the adsorption of acid green 20 dye 63 29 mg g 1 30 and cr vi 2 184 mg g 1 31 the above results and the use of pure sepiolite as an effective adsorbent for surface oil spill up to 580 mg g 1 32 suggest their potential application in the adsorption of btex compounds although many investigations have reported the removal of the btex compounds from aqueous media by clays modified with organic cations 12 16 33 34 no data are available for the use of sepiolite to remove these pollutants besides the joint effect of acid treatment and organophilization on the performance of sepiolite as adsorbent has not been studied in this research sepiolite was subjected to acid and heat treatment at several acid concentrations and temperatures and subsequently organophilized with octylammonium hexadecylammonium tetradecyltrimethylammonium and hexadecyltrimethylammonium cations to be used in the adsorption of btex from aqueous solutions the influence of the organic cation on the adsorption capacity of btex was evaluated through isotherm studies and the adoption data were fitted to the freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich d r models furthermore the regeneration test of the adsorption process was performed to estimate the applicability of the obtained materials in environmental remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents powdered sepiolite with formula mg4si6o15 oh 2 xh2o cas no 63800 37 3 was purchased from sigma aldrich primary amines octylamine c8h19n and hexadecylamine c16h35n and quaternary ammonium salts tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide c17h38brn and hexadecytrimethylammonium bromide c19h42brn were purchased from sigma aldrich with high purity 99 benzene c6h6 toluene c7h8 ethylbenzene c8h10 and p xylene c8h10 were of analytical grade 99 purity 2 2 organophilization of treated sepiolite for the purification of raw sepiolite raw sep 50 g were ground and suspended in 500 ml of distilled water then 2 0 m hcl solution was added until ph 4 subsequently the suspension was filtered and the solid was dried at 60 c following the sepiolite was suspended in 500 ml of distilled water and heated at 60 c under shaken then 30 h2o2 was dropwise added to the suspension until gas generation ceased 35 the solid obtained was washed with water filtered and dried at 60 c to obtain purified sepiolite pure sep in the second stage the sepiolite purified was treated with both acid and thermal treatment 2 g of pure sep samples were immersed in 20 ml of hcl solutions with different concentration 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m and shaken for 12 h at 25 c subsequently the samples were washed with water filtered and dried the resultant solids were heated at 100 200 and 300 c for 12 h finally the obtained samples were suspended in saturated nacl solutions 4 5 m at 25 c for 24 h in the third stage organophilization procedure was carried out on the sepiolite treated with hcl 1 m heated at 100 c and na saturated sep since these were the experimental conditions that led to the highest specific surface area and cation exchange capacity cec the samples were suspended in solutions of amines and quaternary ammonium salts octylamine hexadecylamine tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide dissolved in aqueous solutions of 0 1 m hcl the concentration of the organic cation was equal to 200 of the cec of sep the solutions were shacked at 80 c for 3 h using bottles with screw cap the resulting solids were separated by centrifugation and washed with a water ethanol mix 1 1 v v at 50 c 36 finally the obtained materials were tagged according to the organic cation used octylammonium oa sep hexadecylammonium hda sep tetradecyltrimethylammonium tdtma sep and hexadecyltrimethylammonium hdtma sep 2 3 adsorption experiments adsorption tests were carried out using the batch technique it was started from an aqueous solution of btex at 100 mg l 1 containing 25 mg l 1 of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and p xylene subsequently additional btex concentrations between 5 and 100 mg l 1 were obtained by dilution also experimental conditions were 25 c 200 rpm an adsorbent dosage of 5 g l 1 and contact time of 24 h after the adsorption process the suspensions were centrifuged 6000 rpm and at 4 c the supernatants were separated and analysed by hplc uv vis experimental data were corrected according to btex loss due to volatilization which was less than 3 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of each material qe mg g 1 was calculated using eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e v m where c0 mg l 1 is the initial concentration of btex ce mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration of btex after adsorption v l is the volume of solution and m g is the mass of adsorbent the adsorption results were fitted to the freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm models through non linear regression of experimental data eq 2 shows the freundlich isotherm model in the non linear form 2 q e k f c e n 1 where qe mg g 1 is the equilibrium adsorption capacity kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 is the freundlich coefficient ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in solution and the term n 1 is the constant of non linear correction 37 on the other hand eq 3 shows non linear form of the langmuir isotherm model 3 q e q l k l c e 1 k l c e where ql mg g 1 is the maximum adsorption capacity calculated under the model and kl l mg 1 is the langmuir constant 38 finally eq 4 shows the non linear form of the d r isotherm model 4 q e q d r e β l n 1 1 c e 2 where qd r mg g 1 is me maximum adsorption capacity and β kj2 mol 2 is an energy coefficient related to the mean adsorption energy e kj mol 1 39 which can be calculated using the eq 5 5 e 1 2 β 2 4 regeneration test similar conditions to those of the adsorption experiments were used to perform the regeneration test each material was first saturated in a btex solution of 100 mg l 1 then it was separated and dried at room temperature for 24 h subsequently the materials were heated at 150 c for 1 h achieving the evaporation of the solutes 12 40 regeneration tests were performed four consecutive times to determinate the variability of the adsorption capacity 2 5 characterization the x ray diffraction xrd patterns were performed using a powder diffractometer bruker model d8 advance with davinci geometry equipped with cu kα radiation λ 1 54 å and operating at 40 kv and 40 ma the diffraction angle was in the range 5 70 2θ with a step size of 0 02 2θ and counting time of 0 2 s per point morphology of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem using jeol jsm 6490 lv equipment at 66 000 semi quantitative energy dispersive spectrometry eds analysis was made using a multi element detector prior sem analysis the samples were coated with graphite to enhance the conductivity for the acid and thermal treated sepiolite the cation exchange capacity was determined using the taylor method 41 and the specific surface area was calculated from the n2 adsorption isotherm on a micrometrics gemini 2375 equipment using the bet method 42 the obtained materials were analysed by diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy drifts using an ftir spectrometer nicolet model is50 in the wave number range 400 4000 cm 1 the thermogravimetric analysis tga was performed in a setaram 1600 equipment under nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature range 25 800 c with a heating rateof 10 c min 1 the concentration of btex solutions was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc in an equipment agilent 1200 series lc with uv vis detector quaternary pump and manual sampler the btex separation was performed on a column silicachrom c18 4 6 mm x 150 mm 5 μm using a flow ratio of 1 ml min 1 and a wavelength of 230 nm the mobile phase used was a methanol b acetonitrile and c 10 mm trisodium phosphate in isocratic gradient a b c 3 1 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 purification of raw sepiolite the xrd patterns of the raw and purified sepiolite are shown in fig 1 a several secondary crystal phases were identified in the xrd pattern of raw sepiolite raw sep which corresponded to quartz q jcpds 046 1045 and other minerals talc jcpds 29 1493 and palygorskite jcpds 31 0783 after the treatment pure sep typical reflections of sepiolite jcpds 01 075 1597 were observed with a strong reflection at 2θ 7 352 corresponding to the crystallographic plane 1 1 0 with basal spacing of 11 959 å 43 the characteristic diffraction reflections of purified sepiolite showed a better definition and intensity which are due to the elimination of most of the secondary phases raw sep sample showed aggregates of various sizes and shapes due to the presence of impurities fig 1c after purification treatment the pure sep material showed acicular morphology with large fibres of 100 nm wide and well defined edges which is typical of sepiolite fig 1b the eds analysis indicated that samples were composed of si mg al f and o the presence of c in the samples is mainly due to the graphite coating prior to sem analysis table 1 the changes in the chemical composition of pure sep regarding raw sep are attributed to the purification process fig 2 shows the tg a and dtg b curves of pure sep and raw sep the purified material showed a total weight loss of 19 7 which was lower than the one of raw sample 28 3 this can be associated to elimination of organic matter and carbonates during the purification process the materials showed a dtg peak in the temperature range 20 200 c corresponding to evaporation of water absorbed on sepiolite surface the dtg peak in the temperature range 200 300 c is attributed to evaporation of water molecules located in zeolitic channels of sepiolite in the third temperature range 300 500 c the dtg peak corresponds to coordinated water of magnesium of the octahedral sheets finally dehydroxylation of mg oh groups occurs in the temperature range 500 800 c generating the thermal decomposition of the crystal structure 44 3 2 acid and thermal treatment of the purified sepiolite fig 3 shows the specific surface area a and cec b regarding both acid concentration and heat temperature in both cases the maximum increase of the parameters was reached with 1 0 m hcl during 12 h and heat at 100 c sep the increase from 15 36 75 62 cmolc kg 1 for cec is attributable to the lixiviation of mg2 ions from the material structure which generates the need of charge compensation increasing the cec 29 the increase in the specific surface area from 292 159 919 188 m2 g 1 during the acid treatment is attributed to the removal of impurities from the open and zeolitic channels and holes generated by lixiviation of mg2 ions 45 the thermal treatment at 100 c generates the dehydration of the open and zeolitic channels allowing better adsorbates access the material treated with 1 0 m hcl during 12 h and heat at 100 c sep did not show a loss of crystallinity respect to purified material fig 3c by contrast higher concentrations of acid during longer times affect the material structure due to aluminium leaching from tetrahedral sheet eliminating the need of charge compensation and decreasing the cec 46 on the other hand higher temperatures 200 c and 300 c generate the gradually loss of the water molecules coordinated to magnesium thus the structure collapses and the accessibility of pores being hindering 47 3 3 organophilization of acid and thermal treated sepiolite sep fig 4 shows the ftir spectra of acid and thermal treated sepiolite sep and sep organophilized with octylammonium oa sep hexadecylammonium hda sep tetradecyltrimethylammonium tdtma sep and hexadecyltrimethylammonium cations hdtma sep the ftir spectrum of sep showed characteristic bands at 3678 cm 1 attributed to oh stretching vibrations in the octahedral sheet 3557 and 3407 cm 1 corresponding to stretching vibrations of hydration and zeolitic water molecules respectively oh groups stretching of water coordinated to magnesium at 1657 cm 1 stretching bands of si o at 1276 1037 and 989 cm 1 bending vibration of mgsioh bounds at 802 cm 1 and bending vibration of mgoh bound at 654 cm 1 48 intensity of the bands associated with water molecules of hydration and zeolitic water between 3689 and 3411 cm 1 decreased in the organo sepiolites additionally the organo sepiolites showed absorption bands associated with organic groups nh3 group at 3640 cm 1 and 3573 cm 1 ch3 group at 2934 cm 1 ch2 group at 2854 cm 1 ch bound at 1467 and 1375 cm 1 and cn bond at 1042 cm 1 49 these results support the exchange of hydrated na cations by the organic cations 50 regardless of the organophilization process the band at 1657 cm 1 which is attributed to coordinated water molecules was not affected thus preserving the discontinuous structure tg and dtg curves of sep and the organo sepiolite materials are shown in fig 5 the organo sepiolites showed a greater total weight loss than sep associated with the incorporation of organic cation in the material the organo sepiolite materials presented a lower intensity of the dtg peak in the temperature range 20 200 c corresponding to evaporation of water molecules of hydration absorbed on sepiolite surface this lower intensity can be attributed to decreasing in the content of water the organo sepiolite materials showed a broad dtg peak in the temperature range 200 500 c which corresponds to thermal decomposition of the incorporated organic cations 51 the oa sep material presented additional dtg peaks at 214 447 and 538 c which is attributed to several interactions between organic cations and material favoured by the non ramified carbon chain with a smaller length of the octylammonium cation the sepiolite presents four types of interactions that can influence the decomposition temperature of the cation a occupation of mg2 vacancies in the octahedral sheet generated during acid and thermal activation b electrostatic attraction with negative charges generated in the tetrahedral sheet isomorphic substitutions c interactions with the si oh groups n sites and d hydrogen bonds between coordinated water molecules and terminal amino groups of the organic cations 52 3 4 adsorption isotherms of btex on sep and organo sepiolites fig 6 shows the influence of initial concentration on adsorption capacity of btex in sep and the organo sepiolite materials a and the adsorption isotherms b the adsorption capacity increased and gradually tended to stabilize when initial btex concentration increased fig 6a this behaviour is typical of systems with high affinity between adsorbent and solute even at a low initial concentration the curvature of the adsorption isotherms fig 6b describes that the equilibrium adsorption capacity depends on the availability of adsorption sites 53 the adsorption capacity of the organo sepiolites was greater than sep and tdtma sep material presented the greatest adsorption capacity the organophilization process with the alkylammonium cations favours the adsorbent adsorbate interactions due to a decrease of hydrated na cations which allows a higher affinity for organic molecules 32 the experimental data fitted to freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich isotherm models are show in fig 7 a c respectively and the calculated parameters of each model are shown in table 2 the adsorption data of btex on sep and the organo sepiolite materials were well fitted to the freundlich isotherm model fig 7a with high values of correlation coefficients r2 0 997 which is attributed to multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous surface several researches have determined that adsorption of btex from aqueous solutions is well described by the freundlich isotherm model 18 33 54 the kf term increased with the equilibrium adsorption capacity which shows the existence of a heterogeneous surface with sites of high and low adsorption affinity 55 the calculated n 1 value for sep was 0 479 and for the organo sepiolite materials was in the range 0 408 0 477 the n 1 constant generally presents values between 0 and 1 the values less than 0 7 describe highly curves isotherms in which the adsorption capacity gradually decrease because of the saturation of adsorption sites 56 the fitting to the langmuir isotherm model fig 7b obtained r2 values 0 964 the ql values calculated from experimental adsorption data followed the order sep 81 191 mg g 1 oa sep 489 494 mg g 1 hda sep 925 281 mg g 1 hdtma sep 1165 887 mg g 1 tdtma sep 1448 425 mg g 1 the difference in the obtained values can be attributed to several factors related with the organic cation such as carbon chain length amount of organic cation incorporated and saturation of the amino group 57 on the other hand surface tension force has an important influence on the adsorption of non polar compounds into the materials 54 table 3 shows values calculated using acd chemsketch software 58 the tdtma cation has a surface tension calculated of 28 70 mn m 1 which is the closest value with regard to the surface tension average for the btex compounds of 28 90 mn m 1 59 the influence of the surface tension force on the adsorption capacity can suggest that adsorption is mainly due to hydrophobic interactions between the sorbate and the organic chains of the cation d r isotherm model was used to calculate the mean adsorption energies the value of the mean adsorption energy is related to the type of process whether e 8 kj mol 1 occurs a physical adsorption when e 16 kj mol 1 occurs a chemical adsorption and from 8 to 16 kj mol 1 the process occurs by ionic exchange 60 the mean adsorption energies of sep and the organo sepiolite materials were between 0 112 and 0 734 kj mol 1 which indicates that the adsorption process of btex on adsorbents is governed by physical mechanisms btex compounds are used as dissolvent in many industrial processes therefore the low energies of adsorption possibility the easy process reversal allowing the adsorbates release in a controlled way table 4 shows the maximum adsorption capacity of btex from aqueous solutions on several materials the greater adsorption capacity with regard to other materials can be attributed to the structural and morphological properties such as the high surface area pore size the organic cations type used in the organophilization process and the existence of n sites and the magnesium vacancies the study of the multicomponent adsorption of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and p xylene was carried out using the tdtma sep material and the previous experimental conditions fig 8 shows the effect of the initial concentration of benzene b toluene t ethylbenzene t and p xylene p x on the adsorption capacity a and the adsorption isotherms fitted to the freundlich b and langmuir c models the adsorption capacity followed the increasing order b t e p x which is in agreement with other reports for btex adsorption on organo clay materials 10 31 32 38 this order is inversely proportional to the water solubility of the compounds b 1790 mg l 1 t 530 mg l 1 e 152 mg l 1 and p x 150 5 mg l 1 which can be obtained from the logarithm of the octanol water partition coefficients kow 62 the presence of methyl and ethyl groups restricts the charge delocalization in the aromatic compounds became them less polar 63 such as it was discussed above the adsorption process in the organo sepiolite materials is mainly governed mainly by hydrophobic interactions therefore less polar compounds are preferentially adsorbed the isotherm parameters for each compound are shown in table 5 the results showed that the freundlich isotherm model fits well for the adsorption of every btex compound on the tdtma sep material reaching a r2 values higher than 0 99 in multicomponent adsorption the n 1 parameter is related to the intensity of the process 64 for all the compounds the value of n 1 was less than 1 b 0 528 t 0 505 e 0 494 p x 0 409 indicating favourable adsorption in the multicomponent system 12 on the order hand the langmuir isotherm model allowed determining the maximum adsorption capacity ql the ql values followed the increasing order benzene 296 011 mg g 1 toluene 424 921 mg g 1 ethyl benzene 439 302 mg g 1 p xylene 471 466 mg g 1 3 5 regeneration test the adsorption cycles of btex on sep and the organo sepiolite materials are shown in fig 9 non organophilized material sep exhibited the least reduction in adsorption capacity which is attributable to the fact that its adsorption capacity is not dependent on the content and distribution of organic cations and the temperature used for regeneration is not high enough to affect the structure of the material on the other hand organo sepiolite materials showed relative adsorption capacities of 93 5 oa sep 96 9 tdma sep 97 8 hdtma sep 98 7 hda sep in the fourth adsorption cycle the difference in the adsorption efficiency after regeneration can be attributable to slight losses of the organic cation due to thermic treatment in this way the oa sep material exhibited the biggest loss of adsorption efficiency which can be attributable to octylammonium has a higher vapour pressure 129 322 n m2 65 than the other organic cations used favouring its volatilization during regeneration tests finally the regeneration test showed that the adsorbents could be reused more than four times without a significant decrease in adsorption efficiency 4 conclusions the purification treatment applied to sepiolite allowed eliminating secondary phases present in the commercial sample in other hand purified material exhibited a uniform fibrous morphology in turn the acid and thermal treatment with 1 0 m hcl and 100 c on the sepiolite generated an increment from 15 36 75 60 cmolc kg 1 and from 292 159 919 188 m2 g 1 for cec and specific surface area respectively isotherm studies carried out with the organo sepiolite materials showed that experimental data were appropriately fitted to the freundlich isotherm model this indicates that the adsorbent presents a heterogeneous surface and the adsorption depends on the adsorption sites availability it was determined that the surface tension force plays an important role in the adsorption capacity of obtained adsorbents tdtma sep material presented the highest adsorption capacity 1448 425 mg g 1 among the materials used in this study and the reported in the literature altogether the obtained materials and mainly tdtma sep demonstrated the effectiveness in the removal of btex from aqueous media this gives an important perspective of its potential

13663,this study investigated the effects of two local plants wedelia trilobata wt axonopus compressus ac feeding patterns continuous and intermittent and types of bed media sand and charcoal on the treatment performance of shallow bed subsurface flow wetland roofs wrs results showed that changing plant from ac into wt led to an increase in removal rate by 6 12 for cod and 11 13 for total nitrogen tn the removal rate accelerated by 8 for cod 45 64 for tn and 125 for total phosphorus tp when changing from sand to charcoal as bed media continuous feeding mode enhanced the removal rate by 17 19 for cod and 11 13 for tn compared to intermittent feeding mode the findings suggested that the treatment capacity of wr was significantly affected by the type of plant bed material and feeding pattern keywords wetland roof domestic wastewater charcoal bed media feeding pattern 1 introduction nowadays the problems of water pollution and lack of clean water are of increasing concern in urban cities of developing countries there is a large proportion of domestic wastewater in residential areas which is not properly treated in fact this type of wastewater is only pre treated by simple systems such as septic tanks then being discharged directly into the sewer systems or into canals 1 the effluent of the septic tanks rarely meets the discharge standards 2 this issue leads to the pollution of surface water as well as groundwater in addition it also affects public health and appearance of cities besides many countries around the world are facing increased traffic density and the quick development of industrial areas leading to higher emission rates especially greenhouse gases co2 as a subscript contributing to global warming causing climate change 3 meanwhile the green area which helps to reduce the co2 in the air by absorption has been decreasing considerably because of overpopulation rapid urbanization and industrialization in such conditions there is a great need for treatment technologies that can reduce air pollution are easy to operate save space and have low energy consumption and ensure environmental sustainability in the recent decade green roofs grs have been widely applied because of their economic and environmental benefits such as saving energy increasing green space extending roof usage purifying air pollutant and providing stormwater retention 4 gr has been recognized as one of the low impact development lid solutions 5 constructed wetland cw for wastewater treatment has been considered as an effective low cost and simple to operate method especially in the developing countries 6 8 typical substrate depth of cws are quite thick approximately 0 2 0 3 m for free water flow and 0 5 1 0 m for subsurface flow 9 10 in order to enhance nitrogen removal substrate depth of subsurface flow cws is significantly reduced 11 12 this type cw is called as shallow bed cws scws with a reduced weight scw is more attractive when arranged on an open space such as roof also called as wetland roof wr wr has been invented as an integrated technology by combination of gr and cw 13 therefore wrs also obtain the inherent benefits of gr sand scws indeed the high pollutants removal efficiencies of wrs with different plants and hydraulic loading rates hlrs has been widely reported in recent years 13 15 therefore wrs would be a promising and appropriate technology to solve current issues in urban areas however one of the reasons limiting wr s wide range of applicability is its gravity load which affects the roof s load capacity most studies on wrs or scws ignore this issue for wrs plants are a very important factor because they not only help stabilize the surface of the material and accelerate the treatment of pollutants but also provide green space 16 many plants have been proposed and successfully applied to subsurface cws 17 however the plants for wrs must not only meet the criteria for thriving biomass high treatment efficiency limited height 0 5 m to avoid the influence of the wind and aesthetic but also adapt well to harsh rooftop condition 18 therefore our previous studies have proposed some plant species with potential applications such as melampodium paludosum 19 kyllinga brevifoliarottb and cyperus javanicus houtt 13 to enrich the plants for wrs this study is interested in using wedelia trilobata wt and axonopus compressus ac because these species are also quite in line with the above mentioned plant selection criteria feeding pattern of wetland systems plays an important role in improving denitrification ability 20 hu et al 21 found that the efficiency of nitrification process was significantly improved in the intermittent feeding condition in fact tn treatment efficiency reached 83 in a four stage feeding cw caselles osorio and garcía 22 reported that cw with the intermittent feeding pattern was more favorable for oxidized conditions as its ammonium treatment efficiency 99 increased in comparison to continuous feeding mode 79 furthermore wu et al 23 reported that intermittent feeding not only enhanced the homogeneous distribution of influent wastewater but also limited rapid clogging however studies related to this issue on the wrs are limited from the above overview it shows that in order to increase the application of wr the study to find materials lighter than traditional materials sand small rock gravel that apply to previous wrs is essential in addition it is also important to find solutions to improve wastewater treatment efficiency of wr however the studies on these aspects of wr have been limited therefore this study aimed to investigate the effects of feeding patterns continuous and intermittent and different bed materials sand and charcoal on wastewater treatment performance of wrs with two plants wedelia trilobata wt axonopus compressus ac 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of wetland roof systems this study employed wr systems with similar design excepted the type of main material layer in the bed media 90 mm fig 1 in order to effectively utilize operation area prevent clogging improve hydraulic retention time and limit unpleasant odors wrs were designed with three consecutive channels with a bed slope of 1 and shallow horizontal subsurface flow the design of each channel was 1 8 m length 0 6 m width x 0 15 m height from the top the materials consisted of soil 10 mm sand s or charcoal c 90 mm and small rocks 20 mm the inlet and outlet zones were installed with a layer of gravel to reduce clogging the water level of 100 mm was maintained during the operation period wrs were operated at two different feeding patterns which were continuous cont and intermittent inter six pilot scale wrs were used to conduct the experiments namely swt cont cwt cont cwt inter sac cont cac cont cac inter weights and material porosity of wrs were 185 kg m 2 and 26 for s wrs 110 kg m 2 and 35 for c wrs respectively the wrs were placed in vacant and unplanted land under natural weather conditions the average annual temperature 29 5 and precipitation 1 400 2 400 mm 2 2 studied plants based on the main criteria such as local availability low cost aesthetics wastewater treatment capacity and resilience to variable weather conditions on the roof axonopus compressus ac and wedelia trilobata wt were selected in this study with the density of 187 plant m 2 ac is often planted on both sides of the road to create urban landscapes or parks or stadiums in tropical countries the foliage is about 15 cm high wt has yellow flowers and grows up to 45 cm tall the wt is suitable for hot conditions and is cultivated for urban landscapes both plants are easy to grow and groundcover quickly in this study the plants height was maintained to be 20 cm to avoid the impacts of wind and insects during the experimental period 2 3 operation conditions of wrs the procedure for performing the experiments was as follows at stage 1 four wrs with different bed materials and plants were operated under the same feeding condition swt cont sac cont cwt cont cac cont at stage 2 wrs with charcoal material with relatively higher treatment efficiency were studied to evaluate the effects of intermittent feeding pattern cwt inter cac inter at the beginning in order to help plants to quickly adapt as well as to ensure the stability of bed material layers tap water was supplied for the first thirty days then the effluent of a septic tank flowed into wrs under the operating condition shown in table 1 wrs were operated at the average hydraulic loading rate of 264 17 m3 ha 1 day 1 corresponding to the average organic loading rate of 48 4 kg cod ha 1 day 1 the variability of hlrs and olrs between tests of the same materials plants and feeding patterns was controlled to be less than 10 to ensure a reliable comparison of the functions of the wrs 24 the quality of influent and effluent of wrs was evaluated three times a week 2 4 feed wastewater the characteristics of the septic tank effluent collected from the toilets are shown in table 2 the parameters were detected according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 25 the concentrations of cod and ammonia were relatively high leading to the requirement of sufficient treatment before discharging into the environment 2 5 measurement of plant s biomass in order to prevent influences from wind and harmful insects the plants were harvested and maintained at the height of 20 cm moreover biomass harvesting could accelerate nitrogen treatment efficiency 26 above ground biomass including leaf branch and stem of each wr was recorded as fresh weight during the experimental period dry biomass was determined by drying at 70 in an oven until its weight was constant 27 2 6 statistical analysis and data evaluation the statistical program of spss version 20 was used to analyze differences in the treatment efficiencies of wrs the significant difference was obtained at the p less than 0 05 in this work the removal rate evaluated the wr function more precisely than the removal efficiency because it was calculated based on the system s ability to treat pollutants on a unit of volume and in a unit of time it is completely different from pollutant loading rate 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth of plant biomass the biomass development of plants would reflect their ability to adapt to wr conditions and nutrient removal capacity because their growth could enrich the oxygen supported bacterial activity 28 29 stabilize the surface structure of bed materials as well as hydraulic condition 30 and prevent wr from clogging 31 previous studies conducted on cws that had plants compare to ones that did not have plants proved that they were crucial in improving the removal efficiencies of organics and nutrients 32 33 in this study above ground biomass growth of axonopus compressus ac and wedelia trilobata wt were determined fig 2 the results showed that the average biomass growth rate of wt was 4 7 times higher than that of ac this study 3 5 38 times for heliconia and canna 34 1 4 2 7 times higher for cyprus papyrus 35 and 1 1 8 0 times higher for other plants 13 in comparison with ac wt showed a significantly higher biomass growth that enhanced nutrient removal performance of wrs under the same conditions of plant species and feeding pattern both dry and wet biomass growth in the wr with the bed media of charcoal was shown to be higher than those with the sand media this could be explained that charcoal material has a higher porosity than sand so has the potential to accumulate nutrients on its surface resulting in improved nutrient accumulation for plant growth and accelerate the treatment processing of contaminants simultaneously 36 however there was no significant difference between the two feeding patterns 3 2 treatment performance of wetland roof organic pollutants could be treated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in wr organic matters acted as a primary source of carbon for microbial activities the transfer atmospheric diffusion and convection of the roots of plants provided oxygen for aerobic decomposition anaerobic degradation by heterotrophic bacteria occurred inside the media where oxygen was lacking 37 cod removal efficiencies and its rates of the wrs were presented in fig 3 the average efficiencies and rates of wt were slightly higher than that of ac which was not a significant difference p 0 05 under the same feeding condition and plants c wrs had better treatment performance than s wrs the porosity of the c wrs 0 35 which was higher than the s wrs 0 26 enhanced oxygen diffusion and gave a better surface area for attached bacteria as a result it improved the decomposition of organic matters in the wrs using charcoal bed media in fact yakar et al 38 had investigated the effects of two different media types on the wastewater treatment of an up flow cw they found that larger surface area and more porosity media could obtain higher wastewater treatment performance meanwhile cod removal efficiencies of the wrs with intermittent feeding condition were significantly higher than those with continuous feeding condition under the same bed media and plants similar findings were also reported by jia et al 39 which evaluated the effects of the feeding strategies on the wastewater treatment performance of a subsurface flow cw with phragmites australis the results showed that approximately 92 and 96 of cod reduction was observed in the continuous and intermittent cws respectively although cod removal efficiencies of the wrs in this study were similar or 1 0 1 4 times lower than those in previous wrs 13 15 19 cod removal rates in this study were 1 2 1 6 times higher than those in previous wrs in short the cod removal efficiencies of the wrs were significantly influenced by the type of plant bed material and feed pattern applied nitrogen in the effluent of the septic tank was one of the main parameters that exceeded the national standard and needed to be reduced before discharging moreover it was one of the principal factors causing eutrophication restricting diffusion of oxygen into water and affecting the activities of aquatic ecosystem 37 in the subsurface flow wr there were various pathways of nitrogen removal such as volatilization uptake of plants adsorption nitrification ammonification and denitrification the input and output total nitrogen tn concentrations of wrs were measured in this study fig 4 presents tn removal rates and efficiencies of the wrs with different plant types it was proved that wt 60 87 was more effective than ac 55 80 in terms of removal rate wt is slightly higher than ac however under the same feeding condition and plants c wrs had significantly higher tn removal rates than s wrs this could be explained that nh4 n was adsorbed by charcoal media 40 in addition the c wrs with higher porosity supplied more oxygen for oxidizing ammonium nitrogen which was the main components of tn concentration in the studied wastewater table 2 the wrs with intermittent feeding pattern 80 87 treated tn better than those with continuous feeding pattern 73 80 under the condition of same bed media and plants this could be explained that the intermittent feeding condition supported more oxygen diffusion leading to the acceleration of ammonium nitrogen removal through the nitrification process previous studies demonstrated that intermittent feeding could greatly enhance nh4 n removal in cws 22 39 in the study of jia et al 39 nh4 n removal of subsurface flow cws was improved from 63 to 94 the c wrs 73 87 in this study showed more effective than the sand based wetlands in previous studies such as 41 54 for bui et al 18 and vo et al 41 47 69 for jia et al 39 54 81 for vo et al 13 however it was not as good as the work of zapater pereyra et al 15 88 93 which used sand clay and poly lactic acid beads as bed media in short the highest tn removal was obtained in the wrs which used wt plant and charcoal media under the intermittent feeding condition phosphorus was removed in cws by four mechanisms absorption by bed materials precipitation of minerals in the substrate accumulation in plant biomass and substrates supply for microbial activity 42 43 although tp concentration in the influent was relatively low 3 6 1 2 mg l 1 its removal efficiencies and rates were still investigated in this study as presented in fig 5 it showed that tp removal efficiency of ac plant was slightly higher than that of wt plant no noticeable difference between the two types of plants in terms of removal rate was observed under the same feeding pattern and plant type both tp removal rate and efficiency of s wrs were lower than those of c wrs previous studies found that phosphorus was effectively treated by adsorption process of different charcoals 44 45 therefore the use of charcoal in this work had definitely contributed to enhance the efficiencies of tp removal the wrs with intermittent feeding pattern 77 82 0 8 kg tp ha 1 day 1 showed a slightly poorer performance than those with continuous feeding pattern 85 89 0 9 kg tp ha 1 day 1 under the same bed media and plants these results indicated that feeding pattern did not influence much on the tp removal generally the average tp removal was 1 1 2 5 times lower than the work of zapater pereyra et al 15 4 practical application and future perspectives based on the analysis of the influent cod and nh4 n required treatment before discharging as shown in fig 6 the effluent cod concentrations in all cases were less than 100 mg l 1 the nh4 n concentrations significantly decreased when being treated by wrs equipped with the charcoal bed media under the intermittent pattern this indicated that changing bed media and feeding condition helped not only improve the wastewater treatment performance but also reduce the effects of wrs on the load carrying capacity of a roof the results of intermittent c wrs proved that this would be promising technologies to be applied as a field scale in urban areas especially in developing countries as it was the integration of green roof and constructed wetland wr inherited most of the advantages of both systems such as energy savings purification of air pollutants and flood alleviation moreover the challenges and solutions to overcome the disadvantages of this technology have also been detailed in our previous study 16 by analyzing the economic environmental and social benefits of this technology it is expected that it will be well received by the scientific research community as well as residents as the practical means of wrs was undeniable further studies on this technology are necessary 5 conclusions in conclusion wedelia trilobata wt plant had higher biomass growth rate and better treatment efficiency than axonopus compressus ac plant the removal rates of charcoal wrs were significantly higher than those of sand wrs the intermittent feeding mode significantly enhanced both cod and tn removal efficiencies the highest efficiencies 37 kg cod ha 1 day 1 20 kg tn ha 1 day 1 and 0 9 kg tp ha 1 day 1 were observed in wr using wedelia trilobata charcoal media and intermittent feeding the results found that the operating conditions with charcoal media and intermittent feeding mode not only reduced the gravitational loading on the roof but also improved the performance of wetland roof significantly data availability statement all data models and code generated or used during the study appear in the submitted article declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13663,this study investigated the effects of two local plants wedelia trilobata wt axonopus compressus ac feeding patterns continuous and intermittent and types of bed media sand and charcoal on the treatment performance of shallow bed subsurface flow wetland roofs wrs results showed that changing plant from ac into wt led to an increase in removal rate by 6 12 for cod and 11 13 for total nitrogen tn the removal rate accelerated by 8 for cod 45 64 for tn and 125 for total phosphorus tp when changing from sand to charcoal as bed media continuous feeding mode enhanced the removal rate by 17 19 for cod and 11 13 for tn compared to intermittent feeding mode the findings suggested that the treatment capacity of wr was significantly affected by the type of plant bed material and feeding pattern keywords wetland roof domestic wastewater charcoal bed media feeding pattern 1 introduction nowadays the problems of water pollution and lack of clean water are of increasing concern in urban cities of developing countries there is a large proportion of domestic wastewater in residential areas which is not properly treated in fact this type of wastewater is only pre treated by simple systems such as septic tanks then being discharged directly into the sewer systems or into canals 1 the effluent of the septic tanks rarely meets the discharge standards 2 this issue leads to the pollution of surface water as well as groundwater in addition it also affects public health and appearance of cities besides many countries around the world are facing increased traffic density and the quick development of industrial areas leading to higher emission rates especially greenhouse gases co2 as a subscript contributing to global warming causing climate change 3 meanwhile the green area which helps to reduce the co2 in the air by absorption has been decreasing considerably because of overpopulation rapid urbanization and industrialization in such conditions there is a great need for treatment technologies that can reduce air pollution are easy to operate save space and have low energy consumption and ensure environmental sustainability in the recent decade green roofs grs have been widely applied because of their economic and environmental benefits such as saving energy increasing green space extending roof usage purifying air pollutant and providing stormwater retention 4 gr has been recognized as one of the low impact development lid solutions 5 constructed wetland cw for wastewater treatment has been considered as an effective low cost and simple to operate method especially in the developing countries 6 8 typical substrate depth of cws are quite thick approximately 0 2 0 3 m for free water flow and 0 5 1 0 m for subsurface flow 9 10 in order to enhance nitrogen removal substrate depth of subsurface flow cws is significantly reduced 11 12 this type cw is called as shallow bed cws scws with a reduced weight scw is more attractive when arranged on an open space such as roof also called as wetland roof wr wr has been invented as an integrated technology by combination of gr and cw 13 therefore wrs also obtain the inherent benefits of gr sand scws indeed the high pollutants removal efficiencies of wrs with different plants and hydraulic loading rates hlrs has been widely reported in recent years 13 15 therefore wrs would be a promising and appropriate technology to solve current issues in urban areas however one of the reasons limiting wr s wide range of applicability is its gravity load which affects the roof s load capacity most studies on wrs or scws ignore this issue for wrs plants are a very important factor because they not only help stabilize the surface of the material and accelerate the treatment of pollutants but also provide green space 16 many plants have been proposed and successfully applied to subsurface cws 17 however the plants for wrs must not only meet the criteria for thriving biomass high treatment efficiency limited height 0 5 m to avoid the influence of the wind and aesthetic but also adapt well to harsh rooftop condition 18 therefore our previous studies have proposed some plant species with potential applications such as melampodium paludosum 19 kyllinga brevifoliarottb and cyperus javanicus houtt 13 to enrich the plants for wrs this study is interested in using wedelia trilobata wt and axonopus compressus ac because these species are also quite in line with the above mentioned plant selection criteria feeding pattern of wetland systems plays an important role in improving denitrification ability 20 hu et al 21 found that the efficiency of nitrification process was significantly improved in the intermittent feeding condition in fact tn treatment efficiency reached 83 in a four stage feeding cw caselles osorio and garcía 22 reported that cw with the intermittent feeding pattern was more favorable for oxidized conditions as its ammonium treatment efficiency 99 increased in comparison to continuous feeding mode 79 furthermore wu et al 23 reported that intermittent feeding not only enhanced the homogeneous distribution of influent wastewater but also limited rapid clogging however studies related to this issue on the wrs are limited from the above overview it shows that in order to increase the application of wr the study to find materials lighter than traditional materials sand small rock gravel that apply to previous wrs is essential in addition it is also important to find solutions to improve wastewater treatment efficiency of wr however the studies on these aspects of wr have been limited therefore this study aimed to investigate the effects of feeding patterns continuous and intermittent and different bed materials sand and charcoal on wastewater treatment performance of wrs with two plants wedelia trilobata wt axonopus compressus ac 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of wetland roof systems this study employed wr systems with similar design excepted the type of main material layer in the bed media 90 mm fig 1 in order to effectively utilize operation area prevent clogging improve hydraulic retention time and limit unpleasant odors wrs were designed with three consecutive channels with a bed slope of 1 and shallow horizontal subsurface flow the design of each channel was 1 8 m length 0 6 m width x 0 15 m height from the top the materials consisted of soil 10 mm sand s or charcoal c 90 mm and small rocks 20 mm the inlet and outlet zones were installed with a layer of gravel to reduce clogging the water level of 100 mm was maintained during the operation period wrs were operated at two different feeding patterns which were continuous cont and intermittent inter six pilot scale wrs were used to conduct the experiments namely swt cont cwt cont cwt inter sac cont cac cont cac inter weights and material porosity of wrs were 185 kg m 2 and 26 for s wrs 110 kg m 2 and 35 for c wrs respectively the wrs were

13664,a novel catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane was prepared for catalytic reduction of chromium vi to chromium iii first ceramic membrane cm was prepared as a support with blending of 10 w w nanomagnetite using kaolin second polyether sulfone pes with three different nanomagnetite concentration 10 20 30 w w was coated on the ceramic membrane support using phase inversion method the prepared novel catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane was used as a catalytic reactor to convert chromium vi to chromium iii the effect of nanomagnetite concentration 10 20 30 w w applied pressure 1 2 3 bar and solution ph 3 5 7 on cr vi reduction and permeate flux was systematically investigated a dead end filtration system was used for filtration and the vessel contained the chromate solution 10 mgcr 6 l the maximum chromium vi reduction 96 2 were obtained at 1 bar pressure and ph 3 for pes20 cmr10 membrane which indicated 20 w w pes and 10 w w cm the results showed that the catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane effectively reduced the chromium vi to levels below 0 38 mg l without losing activity in repetitive 3 runs the catalytic membrane was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir brunauer emmett teller bet atomic force microscopy afm scanning electron microscopy sem and contact angle instruments the results demonstrated that the chromium vi could be completely eliminated by the novel catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane keywords nanomagnetite catalytic ceramic membrane pes membrane cr vi reduction 1 introduction chromium has an important economic place for industrial use chromium is extensively used in industrial processes such as leather tanning metal electroplating agricultural processes steelworks manufacturing mining activities synthesis of pigments and corrosion protection 1 3 it can be found in groundwater soil leachate and surface water as a result of uncontrolled discharge of chromium into the receiving environment 4 the trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi states are the most common states although it presents in several oxidation states in the environment 5 6 cr vi is one of the important and serious danger toxic contaminant because of its high mobility and strong oxidizing properties which has negative effects on biological systems as well as ecosystem 7 8 cr vi is dangerous and it is known to cause cancer it also targets the respiratory system kidneys liver skin and eyes 9 11 in contrast cr iii is an essential micronutrient for living organisms and cr iii which has limited water solubility is not as dangerous as cr vi 12 13 for this reason it can be seen as the best option reduction of cr vi to cr iii before discharge into the receiving environment until now numerous methods have been reported to remove cr vi from wastewater such as adsorption 14 16 electrochemical reaction 17 18 ion exchange 19 20 biological processes 21 24 and membrane processes 25 26 it is well known that advanced oxidation process aops with homogeneous heterogeneous catalysis is very effective method to treat contaminated water but the recovery and reuse of the catalysts are the major problems thus catalytic membranes have a significant potential for the reduction of heavy metals due to easy procedure low cost and high efficiency for this reason the use of catalytic membranes in recent years has been getting more and more attention 27 so far the catalytic membranes which can be made from organic polymers or inorganic materials were used for different applications in chemical reaction 28 the porous polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf catalytic membrane was developed by blending of fe2o3 and multiwall carbon nanotubes mwcnts into the polymeric solution the prepared membranes were used for the fenton like catalytic degradation of cyclohexanoic acid cha and humic acids has at neutral ph 29 the optimum combination of fe2o3 and mwcnts was investigated and the results showed that the blending of 1 fe2o3and 0 2 mwcnts induced pore formation and improved membrane permeability up to four times the removal efficiency of cha and has was 48 and 53 1 respectively after 24 h of membrane exposure with h2o2 the addition of h2o2 enhanced the catalytic oxidation of organic molecules which accumulated at the membrane surface 29 the porous catalytic microfiltration membrane composed of iron oxide polyacrylic acid paa pvdf was used for degradation of trichloroethylene tce 30 catalytic decomposition of h2o2 generated hydroxyl radicals oh which reacted with tce and h2o2 adsorbed on iron oxide surfaces simultaneously depending on the ratio of iron and h2o2 tce conversions as high as 100 with about 91 dechlorination were obtained 30 catalytic ceramic membrane ccm integrated with 1 67 manganese oxide mno2 loading were fabricated and it was used for 4 hydroxylbenzoic acid hba initial concentration of 80 mg l degradation using sulfate radicals 31 they were reported that high hba degradation 98 9 was obtained at the membrane permeate within 30 min ceramic membranes have good chemical stability high mechanical strength and high temperature resistance in water and wastewater treatment 32 hole defects and uneven membrane thicknesses can lead to poor performance especially in the separation stability of ceramic membranes 33 the macroporous and mesoporous membranes like ceramic membranes have high permeability but low selectivity however microporous membranes like polymeric ultrafiltration membranes have low permeability but high selectivity depending on polymer concentration and pore size diameter the combined phase inversion and sintering technique can improve the selectivity of the ceramic membranes and significantly reduces the number of steps required by eliminating the need to deposit layers on a substrate 32 moreover polymer coated of ceramic membranes can improve the fabrication of membranes with a uniform and crack free surface in this study we prepared catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane with high temperature sintering and phase

pressed under the pressure of 6 tons by a manual hydraulic press mse technology to obtain the disk membranes 40 mm 3 mm in diameter size and thickness respectively after the pressing process ceramic membranes were put in a high temperature muffle furnace protherm plf 160 9 for sintering process the sintering parameters affect the final membrane pore structures such as pore size porosity and tortuosity 35 36 however the mechanism for the two step sintering method using high and relatively low temperature also affect the grain boundary migration and diffusion the first stage sintering step helps to eliminate supercritical pores while the second stage sintering step suppresses grain growth 35 in this study the two step sintering method was applied to control the change in the pore size porosity and cracking of the ceramic membrane during sintering process the temperature in the furnace was increased with two steps the temperatures were increased up to 250 c at 2 c min heating rate in the first step and 900 c at 5 c min heating rate in the second step finally the supports were allowed to cool spontaneously fig 1 the photographs of the kaolin cm nanomagnetite loaded cm and pes cmr with different concentration of nanomagnetite 10 20 30 w w are shown in fig 2 2 4 synthesis of catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane pes membranes were synthesized by a wet phase inversion method onto the catalytic ceramic membrane catalytic ceramic membrane reactor cmr was prepared according to section 2 3 after cm preparation pes membrane was coated on it casting solution

solution was stirred vigorously at 60 c for 6 h and then it was ultra sonicated 10 min to obtain bubble free solution the polymer solution was poured on the cm which was placed onto a glass plate and the membrane was cast on the cm support with a casting knife about 200 μm gap at 100 mm s the thin films were kept 10 s for evaporation and the cm coated with nanomagnetite loaded pes was immersed into a coagulation bath containing distilled water after coagulation pes cm were separated from the coagulation bath and catalytic membrane reactors cmr were kept in distilled water for 1 day to guarantee the complete phase inversion the sample names of the cmr were named as pes10 cmr10 pes20 cmr10 pes30 cmr10 which pes10 pes20 pes30 indicated 10 20 30 w w nanomagnetite was loaded in pes and cmr indicated 10 w w nanomagnetite was loaded in ceramic membrane support 2 5 permeate flux and permeability measurements a dead end filtration system sterlitech hp4750 stirred cell was used to measure the pure water flux and permeability of cmr the permeate flux was calculated using eq 1 1 j w q a δ t where q is the amount of the permeate l a is the effective cmr area m2 δt is the filtration time h the pure water permeability lp was determined using eq 2 2 l p q a δ t δ p where δp is the transmembrane pressure bar 2 6 catalytic reduction experiments catalytic reduction of cr vi

catalytic performance of cmr was tested by using the reduction of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 as the model compound with initial concentration of 10 mg l cr vi ions the efficiency of catalytic performance of cmr was tested by different pressure and solution ph 2 7 characterization methods the mineralogical analysis of kaolin powder was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd the measurement was made by a diffractometer having a cu cathode of wavelength λ 1 54 å equipped with a goniometer and x ray detector was operated under the following conditions 40 kv 40 ma brunauer emmett teller bet isotherm studies were done in the relative pressure range of 0 1 to 1 0 the structural compositions of the cmr were performed by fourier transform infra red ftir spectroscopy in the wave numbers ranging from 450 4000 cm l all the membrane samples for sem analysis were washed three times with deionized water to remove the trace amount of solvent and dried for 10 h to remove moisture samples were coated with platinum by low vacuum sputter coating atomic force microscopy afm park system xe 100 spm was used to characterize the surface roughness of prepared catalytic membranes small squares of dried samples were cut and 10 μm 10 μm areas were scanned by contact mode in the air the contact angle of the pristine and catalytic membranes was measured by ksv cam 200 goniometer ksv instruments the analyses were performed at least five different locations on the membrane surfaces 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of kaolin powder and catalytic membrane reactor fig 3 illustrates the complete adsorption and desorption curves with the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm at 423 k during 90 min for kaolin powder and cmr10 which loaded 10 w w nanomagnetite the specific surface areas obtained from the bet analysis were calculated as 13 532 and 37 296 m² g for kaolin powder and cmr10 respectively the bet results showed that loading of nanomagnetite into the ceramic membrane support increased the surface area this can increase the catalytic performance of cmr kołodyńska et al prepared magnetic hybrid nanocomposite material based on the kraft lignin by the co precipitating method 38 according to the results of bet analyses kraft lignin had the bet surface area 0 43 m2 g with 18 7 nm average pore diameter whereas the magnetic hybrid nanocomposite material had the bet surface area 4 8 m2 g with 20 nm average pore diameter 38 the effect of nanomagnetite modification on textural characteristics of clay matrices was investigated in another study 39 the results showed that bet specific surface area increased from 35 m2 g to 69 m2 g during the transition for saponite7 magnetite content in the composite was 7 wt and saponite10 magnetite content in the composite was 10 wt respectively the modification of saponite clay with magnetite nanoparticles caused the increase in the specific surface area due to formation of the secondary porous structure which developed surface in their structure 39 table 2 shows the pore width distribution value of kaolin powder and cmr10 using the bjh method based on a discrete analysis of the desorption branch of the isotherm the results showed that pore width of the cmr10 decreased after pressing and sintering blending of nanoparticles caused pore size decreasing almost 3 times the peak intensity of the kaolin powders using xrd analysis is shown in fig 4 the powder consisted mainly of minerals associated with kaolinite nacrite and other phases like muscovite and quartz fig 4a the intensities of this diffractogram showed that kaolinite and nacrite were the dominant phases where the peaks appear at 2θ 12 38 24 94 and 62 28 40 the kaolinite and nacrite were the dominant phases for cmr10 and the absorption peaks of mineral quartz were appeared at 2θ 12 22 24 82 and 62 29 41 moreover magnetite fe 2fe2 3o4 was also detected in cmr10 where the peaks appear at 2θ 30 84 35 88 57 85 and 62 30 fig 4b 42 43 3 2 characterization of catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane reactor pes cmr10 the afm analyses were done to define variations in the surface roughness of the catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane reactors pes cmrs the two and three dimensional afm images are shown in fig 5 and values of the average roughness ra the root mean square roughness rq and 10 point average roughness rz of the pes cmrs are given in table 3 the loading of nanomagnetite into the polymeric membrane enhanced to decrease in the ra rq and rz values the presence of inorganic materials within the concavities of the hybrid membrane surface caused the decrease in surface roughness values 44 similar results were reported for hybrid membranes 45 47 the infrared spectra of kaolin powder and polyether sulfone coated ceramic membranes were represented in fig 6 and the spectral positions were tabulated in table 4 the morphological analysis of the pes cmrs using sem is presented in fig 7 the top surface images of the membranes showed that nanomagnetite was clustered when loaded fe3o4 nanoparticles increased from pes10 to pes30 images on the left moreover some cracks in the pes30 membrane were also observed the cross sections of the pes cmrs have proven to cover the pes membrane over the cmrs images in the middle finger like structures are observed in the pes membrane at low nanomagnetite concentrations while these structures disappeared with increasing nanomagnetite concentration images on the right the contact angle values of pes cmrs are shown in fig 8 a the contact angle decreased from 61 30 to 48 42 when nanomagnetite concentration in pes increased from 10 to 30 w w the deionized water hydraulic permeability lp of the pes10 cmr10 pes20 cmr10 pes30 cmr10 are shown in fig 8b lp values were calculated 24 36 9 89 6 56 l m2 h bar for pes10 cmr10 pes20 cmr10 pes30 cmr10 respectively lp value decreased by 3 7 fold when nanomagnetite concentration increased from 10 to 30 w w the decrease of permeate flux could be explained by the plugging of membrane pores due to increasing of nanomagnetite concentration and forming of nanoparticle cluster which caused to decrease of pore size 3 3 the effect of nanomagnetite concentration and pressure on permeate flux and cr vi reduction the first tests were performed with investigation of the effect of magnetite concentration and applied pressure for catalytic reduction of cr vi to cr iii using cmr in model solution containing 10 mg l of cr vi without any ph adjustment catalytic reduction experiments were initially performed by cmr prepared with different concentrations of nanomagnetite from 10 to 30 w w for reduction of cr vi results in fig 9 indicated that increasing nanomagnetite concentration in cmr decreased permeate flux and cumulative volume the decrease of permeate flux could be explained by the plugging of membrane pores due to increasing of nanomagnetite and forming of nanoparticle cluster however permeate flux and cumulative volume increased with increasing of applied pressure the steady state permeate flux increased from 25 9 to 67 3 l m2 h lmh fig 9a from 15 0 to 35 1 lmh fig 9c and from 7 2 to 23 6 lmh fig 9e for cmr10 cmr20 and cmr30 respectively when applied pressure increased from 1 to 3 bar for 120 min besides the cumulative volumes increased from 37 7 to 98 0 ml fig 9b from 21 4 to 51 0 ml fig 9d and from 10 9 to 35 3 ml fig 9f for cmr10 cmr20 and cmr30 respectively when applied pressure increased from 1 to 3 bar for 120 min 3 4 the effect of solution ph on permeate flux and cr vi reduction the performance of cmr20 was evaluated by measurement of the permeate flux as a function of solution ph 3 5 7 at 1 bar operating pressure the results showed that when solution ph increased from 3 to 7 permeate flux as well as cumulative volume increased the steady state permeate flux increased from 12 3 to 15 0 lmh when solution ph increased from 3 to 7 for cmr20 fig 10 a moreover the cumulative volumes increased from 18 7 to 21 4 ml when solution ph increased from 3 to 7 for cmr20 fig 10b the effect of nanomagnetite concentration applied pressure and solution ph were also investigated on permeate flux and cr vi reduction efficiency the results clearly showed that applied pressure had an important effect on reduction and the maximum cr vi reduction efficiency was obtained at low pressure cr vi reduction efficiency decreased from 39 7 to 14 0 from 52 7 to 19 7 and from 54 1 to 21 1 for for cmr10 cmr20 and cmr30 respectively when applied pressure increased from 1 to 3 bar for 120 min fig 11 a the decrease of cr vi reduction efficiency with increasing pressure might be be due to the decreased contact time and hydraulic retention time of the chromium molecules with nanomagnetite therefore increased pressure caused acceleration of solution transition throughout the cmr the effect of ph on the reduction of cr vi ions in cmr can be attributed to the two main phenomena adsorption and catalytic reduction of cr vi ions on nanomagnetite it was observed that solution ph affected cr vi especially at acidic conditions ph 3 cr vi reduction efficiency decreased from 95 5 to 39 7 from 95 8 to 52 7 and from 96 2 to 54 1 for cmr10 cmr20 and cmr30 respectively when solution ph increased from 3 to 7 for 120 min fig 11b this is likely because decrease of solution ph promoted the oxidation of iron in pes membrane and ceramic membrane support and hence the reduction of cr vi as well as the adsorption of cr vi onto membrane surface 51 in addition more acidic conditions cause more protonation of nanomagnetite which are more favorable for adsorption of negatively charged cr2o7 2 52 the reason of reduces cr vi adsorption can be explained when solution ph increased the competition of cr2o7 2 with oh ions increased for adsorption on pes membrane surfaces 53 the distribution of the cr vi species in solution depends on ph and cr vi concentration in the following form 54 55 the dichromate and acid chromate ion species were predominant in solution at low ph values according to the above reaction in acid conditions ph 7 0 the reduction of cr vi to cr iii by fe ii could be described as follow reaction 56 3 f e 2 h c r o 4 7 h c r 3 3 f e 3 4 h 2 o in neutral or alkaline conditions ph 7 0 the reduction of cr vi to cr iii by fe ii or fe oh could be described as follow reaction 57 3 f e 2 c r o 4 2 8 h 2 o c r o h 3 3 f e o h 3 4 h 3 f e o h c r o 4 2 4 h 2 o o h c r o h 3 3 f e o h 3 in this experiment the efficiency of catalytic cmr was tested by using the reduction of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 as the model compound the absorbance peaks of k2cr2o7 are found at 285 nm and 375 nm without a catalyst the maximum cr vi reduction was obtained with 1 bar pressure and the absorbance intensity decreased when pressure decreased from 3 to 1 bar fig 11c the same behaviour was obtained when solution ph decreased from 7 to 3 fig 11d the catalytic properties of the pes20 cmr10 was investigated by measurement of cr vi concentration versus time in the permeate the results showed that cr vi concentration measured in permeate increased with increasing of applied pressure cr vi concentration reached up to from 2 9 to 4 7 mg l in the permeate when applied pressure increased from 1 to 3 bar after 120 min filtration time fig 12 a cr vi reduction efficiency decreased from 71 to 53 when applied pressure increased from 1 to 3 bar fig 12b however cr vi concentration measured in permeate decreased with decreasing of solution ph cr vi concentration decreased from 2 9 to 0 45 mg l in the permeate when solution ph decreased from 7 to 3 after 120 min filtration time fig 12c cr vi reduction efficiency increased from 71 to 95 8 when solution ph decreased from 7 to 3 after 120 min filtration time fig 12d fig 13 shows the synergic effect of pes20 and cmr10 membranes when pes20 membrane was used with nanomagnetite free cmr which did not contain nanomagnetite cr vi concentration reached up to 5 4 mg l in the permeate after 120 min filtration time if cmr10 membrane was used with nanomagnetite free pes cr vi concentration reached up to 4 5 mg l in the permeate after 120 min filtration time besides cr vi concentration reached up to 0 38 mg l in the permeate when pes20 cmr10 was used together 3 5 stability and reusability of the catalytic pes20 cmr10 membrane it is well known that the reuse of the catalyst is an important parameter in evaluating its potential for commercial applications 58 in the present work we also tested the reusability of catalytic pes20 cmr10 membrane under obtained optimal conditions for five runs as shown in fig 14 the catalytic activity of pes20 cmr10 membrane decreased after four consecutive runs it can be seen from the figure that the reduction percentage of cr vi decreased from 96 2 the first run to 74 2 the fourth run this loss of activity is related to the decay of active catalytic sites which are caused by low amount of leached iron from the membrane surface 58 the catalytic membrane was activated and reused after four repetitions the oxidation of magnetite nanoparticles was carried out using 0 07 m nitric acid hno3 a certain volume of hno3 100 ml was filled into the dead end filtration system and it was filtrated witin 15 min after activation of nanomagnetite the catalytic membrane was reused under optimum conditions cr vi reduction efficiency increased from 74 2 the fourth run to 92 4 the last run as shown in fig 14 the catalytic activity of pes20 cmr10 membrane improved after hno3 activation it can be assumed that an oxidation of nanoparticles from the surface to the core where fe2 ions are oxidized from the surface to the core after that fe2 ions are migrating from core to surface 59 the fe ions concentration in the permeate for five reaction runs was analyzed to investigate the release of fe ions from the catalytic pes20 cmr10 membrane the results showed that the concentrations of dissolved fe ions in the permeate for all studied runs were negligible and found to be less than 0 15 mg l this indicates that leaching of iron from catalytic pes20 cmr10 membrane might not cause further metal pollution in the water even under acidic conditions the negligible leaching of fe ions also demonstrated that the fe ion is bonded strongly within the pes20 cmr10 membrane structure making its performance quite stable in the reaction therefore we concluded that catalytic pes20 cmr10 membrane indicates acceptable catalytic stability and durability to remove cr vi from aqueous solution 4 conclusion this study proves an effective method for catalytic reduction of cr vi to cr iii in aqueous medium using catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane reactors the characterization of pes cmr demonstrated that nanomagnetite was loaded successfully in the cmr initial concentration of 10 mg l cr vi was reduced maximum 96 2 under optimum conditions which are mentioned in the following ph 3 0 δp 1 bar in 120 min reaction the results showed that blending of nanomagnetite into pes membrane which coated on ceramic membrane improved the catalytic efficiency of the cmr the prepared pes20 cmr10 showed activity loss after the fourth use hno3 was used for activation of catalytic membrane and cr vi reduction improved after activation of nanomagnetite we also found that the nanomagnetite was bonded strongly within the pes cmr structure making its performance quite stable in the reaction hence using this catalytic membrane which has high stability and reusability can result in a significant reduction of the operational cost the process can be easily adopted in full scale commercial catalytic ceramic membrane

the catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane effectively reduced the chromium vi to levels below 0 38 mg l without losing activity in repetitive 3 runs the catalytic membrane was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir brunauer emmett teller bet atomic force microscopy afm scanning electron microscopy sem and contact angle instruments the results demonstrated that the chromium vi could be completely eliminated by the novel catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane keywords nanomagnetite catalytic ceramic membrane pes membrane cr vi reduction 1 introduction chromium has an important economic place for industrial use chromium is extensively used in industrial processes such as leather tanning metal electroplating agricultural processes steelworks manufacturing mining activities synthesis of pigments and corrosion protection 1 3 it can be found in groundwater soil leachate and surface water as a result of uncontrolled discharge of chromium into the receiving environment 4 the trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi states are the most common states although it presents in several oxidation states in the environment 5 6 cr vi is one of the important and serious danger toxic contaminant because of its high mobility and strong oxidizing properties which has negative effects on biological systems as well as ecosystem 7 8 cr vi is dangerous and it is known to cause cancer it also targets the respiratory system kidneys liver skin and eyes 9 11 in contrast cr iii is an essential micronutrient for living organisms and cr iii which has limited water solubility is not as dangerous as cr vi 12 13 for this reason it can be seen as the best option reduction of cr vi to cr iii before discharge into the receiving environment until now numerous methods have been reported to remove cr vi from wastewater such as adsorption 14 16 electrochemical reaction 17 18 ion exchange 19 20 biological processes 21 24 and membrane processes 25 26 it is well known that advanced oxidation process aops with homogeneous heterogeneous catalysis is very effective method to treat contaminated water but the recovery and reuse of the catalysts are the major problems thus catalytic membranes have a significant potential for the reduction of heavy metals due to easy procedure low cost and high efficiency for this reason the use of catalytic membranes in recent years has been getting more and more attention 27 so far the catalytic membranes which can be made from organic polymers or inorganic materials were used for different applications in chemical reaction 28 the porous polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf catalytic membrane was developed by blending of fe2o3 and multiwall carbon nanotubes mwcnts into the polymeric solution the prepared membranes were used for the fenton like catalytic degradation of cyclohexanoic acid cha and humic acids has at neutral ph 29 the optimum combination of fe2o3 and mwcnts was investigated and the results showed that the blending of 1 fe2o3and 0 2 mwcnts induced pore formation and improved membrane permeability up to four times the removal efficiency of cha and has was 48 and 53 1 respectively after 24 h of membrane exposure with h2o2 the addition of h2o2 enhanced the catalytic oxidation of organic molecules which accumulated at the membrane surface 29 the porous catalytic microfiltration membrane composed of iron oxide polyacrylic acid paa pvdf was used for degradation of trichloroethylene tce 30 catalytic decomposition of h2o2 generated hydroxyl radicals oh which reacted with tce and h2o2 adsorbed on iron oxide surfaces simultaneously depending on the ratio of iron and h2o2 tce conversions as high as 100 with about 91 dechlorination were obtained 30 catalytic ceramic membrane ccm integrated with 1 67 manganese oxide mno2 loading were fabricated and it was used for 4 hydroxylbenzoic acid hba initial concentration of 80 mg l degradation using sulfate radicals 31 they were reported that high hba degradation 98 9 was obtained at the membrane permeate within 30 min ceramic membranes have good chemical stability high mechanical strength and high temperature resistance in water and wastewater treatment 32 hole defects and uneven membrane thicknesses can lead to poor performance especially in the separation stability of ceramic membranes 33 the macroporous and mesoporous membranes like ceramic membranes have high permeability but low selectivity however microporous membranes like polymeric ultrafiltration membranes have low permeability but high selectivity depending on polymer concentration and pore size diameter the combined phase inversion and sintering technique can improve the selectivity of the ceramic membranes and significantly reduces the number of steps required by eliminating the need to deposit layers on a substrate 32 moreover polymer coated of ceramic membranes can improve the fabrication of membranes with a uniform and crack free surface in this study we prepared catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane with high temperature sintering and phase inversion method for reduction of hexavalent chromium cr vi nanomagnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles was homogenously loaded into the pores of a ceramic membrane and polyether sulfone membrane coated onto ceramic membrane for cr vi reduction the prepared catalytic ceramic membrane ccm showed satisfactory performance in reduction of cr vi to cr iii at an initial concentration of 10 mgcr vi l moreover

membranes were put in a high temperature muffle furnace protherm plf 160 9 for sintering process the sintering parameters affect the final membrane pore structures such as pore size porosity and tortuosity 35 36 however the mechanism for the two step sintering method using high and relatively low temperature also affect the grain boundary migration and diffusion the first stage sintering step helps to eliminate supercritical pores while the second stage sintering step suppresses grain growth 35 in this study the two step sintering method was applied to control the change in the pore size porosity and cracking of the ceramic membrane during sintering process the temperature in the furnace was increased with two steps the temperatures were increased up to 250 c at 2 c min heating rate

method 38 according to the results of bet analyses kraft lignin had the bet surface area 0 43 m2 g with 18 7 nm average pore diameter whereas the magnetic hybrid nanocomposite material had the bet surface area 4 8 m2 g with 20 nm average pore diameter 38 the effect of nanomagnetite modification on textural characteristics of clay matrices was investigated in another study 39 the results showed that bet specific surface area increased from 35 m2 g to 69 m2 g during the transition for saponite7 magnetite content in the composite was 7 wt and saponite10 magnetite content in the composite was 10 wt respectively the modification of saponite clay with magnetite nanoparticles caused the increase in the specific surface area due to formation of the secondary porous structure which developed surface in their structure 39 table 2 shows the pore width distribution value of kaolin powder and cmr10 using the bjh method based on a discrete analysis of the desorption branch of the isotherm the results showed that pore width of the cmr10 decreased after pressing and sintering blending of nanoparticles caused pore size decreasing almost 3 times the peak intensity of the kaolin powders using xrd analysis is shown in fig 4 the powder consisted mainly of minerals associated with kaolinite nacrite and other phases like muscovite and quartz fig 4a the intensities of this diffractogram showed that kaolinite and nacrite were the dominant phases where the peaks appear at 2θ 12 38 24 94 and 62 28 40 the kaolinite and nacrite were the dominant phases for cmr10 and the absorption peaks of mineral quartz were appeared at 2θ 12 22 24 82 and 62 29 41 moreover magnetite fe 2fe2 3o4 was also detected in cmr10 where the peaks appear at 2θ 30 84 35 88 57 85 and 62 30 fig 4b 42 43 3 2 characterization of catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane reactor pes cmr10 the afm analyses were done to define variations in the surface roughness of the catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane reactors pes cmrs the two and three dimensional afm images are shown in fig 5 and values of the average roughness ra the root mean square roughness rq and 10 point average roughness rz of the pes cmrs are given in table 3 the loading of nanomagnetite into the polymeric membrane enhanced to decrease in the ra rq and rz values the presence of inorganic materials within the concavities of the hybrid membrane surface caused the decrease in surface roughness values 44 similar results were reported for hybrid membranes 45 47 the infrared spectra of kaolin powder and polyether sulfone coated ceramic membranes were represented in fig 6 and the spectral positions were tabulated in table 4 the morphological analysis of the pes cmrs using sem is presented in fig 7 the top surface images of the membranes showed that nanomagnetite was clustered when loaded fe3o4 nanoparticles increased from pes10 to pes30 images on the left moreover some cracks in the pes30 membrane were also observed the cross sections of the pes cmrs have proven to cover the pes membrane over the cmrs images in the middle finger like structures are observed in the pes membrane at low nanomagnetite concentrations while these structures disappeared with increasing nanomagnetite concentration images on the right the contact angle values of pes cmrs are shown in fig 8 a the contact angle decreased from 61 30 to 48 42 when nanomagnetite concentration in pes increased from 10 to 30 w w the deionized water hydraulic permeability lp of the pes10 cmr10 pes20 cmr10 pes30 cmr10 are shown in fig 8b lp values were calculated 24 36 9 89 6 56 l m2 h bar for pes10 cmr10 pes20 cmr10 pes30 cmr10 respectively lp value decreased by 3 7 fold when nanomagnetite concentration increased from 10 to 30 w w the decrease of permeate flux could be explained by the plugging of membrane pores due to increasing of nanomagnetite concentration and forming of nanoparticle cluster which caused to decrease of pore size 3 3 the effect of nanomagnetite concentration and pressure on permeate flux and cr vi reduction the first tests were performed with investigation of the effect of magnetite concentration and applied pressure for catalytic reduction of cr vi to cr iii using cmr in model solution containing 10 mg l of cr vi without any ph adjustment catalytic reduction experiments were initially performed by cmr prepared with different concentrations of nanomagnetite from 10 to 30 w w for reduction of cr vi results in fig 9 indicated that increasing nanomagnetite concentration in cmr decreased permeate flux and cumulative volume the decrease of permeate flux could be explained by the plugging of membrane pores due to increasing of nanomagnetite and forming of nanoparticle cluster however permeate flux and cumulative volume increased with increasing of applied pressure the steady state permeate flux increased from 25 9 to 67 3 l m2 h lmh fig 9a from 15 0 to 35 1 lmh fig 9c and from 7 2 to 23 6 lmh fig 9e for cmr10 cmr20 and cmr30 respectively when applied pressure increased from 1 to 3 bar for 120 min besides the cumulative volumes increased from 37 7 to 98 0 ml fig 9b from 21 4 to 51 0 ml fig 9d and from 10 9 to 35 3 ml fig 9f for cmr10 cmr20 and cmr30 respectively when applied pressure increased from 1 to 3 bar for 120 min 3 4 the effect of solution ph on permeate flux and cr vi reduction the performance of cmr20 was evaluated by measurement of the permeate flux as a function of solution ph 3 5 7 at 1 bar operating pressure the results showed that when solution ph increased from 3 to 7 permeate flux as well as cumulative volume increased the steady state permeate flux increased from 12 3 to 15 0 lmh when solution ph increased from 3 to 7 for cmr20 fig 10 a moreover the cumulative volumes increased from 18 7 to 21 4 ml when solution ph increased from 3 to 7 for cmr20 fig 10b the effect of nanomagnetite concentration applied pressure and solution ph were also investigated on permeate flux and cr vi reduction efficiency the results clearly showed that applied pressure had an important effect on reduction and the maximum cr vi reduction efficiency was obtained at low pressure cr vi reduction efficiency decreased from 39 7 to 14 0 from 52 7 to 19 7 and from 54 1 to 21 1 for for cmr10 cmr20 and cmr30 respectively when applied pressure increased from 1 to 3 bar for 120 min fig 11 a the decrease of cr vi reduction efficiency with increasing pressure might be be due to the decreased contact time and hydraulic retention time of the chromium molecules with nanomagnetite therefore increased pressure caused acceleration of solution transition throughout the cmr the effect of ph on the reduction of cr vi ions in cmr can be attributed to the two main phenomena adsorption and catalytic reduction of cr vi ions on nanomagnetite it was observed that solution ph affected cr vi especially at acidic conditions ph 3 cr vi reduction efficiency decreased from 95 5 to 39 7 from 95 8 to 52 7 and from 96 2 to 54 1 for cmr10 cmr20 and cmr30 respectively when solution ph increased from 3 to 7 for 120 min fig 11b this is likely because decrease of solution ph promoted the oxidation of iron in pes membrane and ceramic membrane support and hence the reduction of cr vi as well as the adsorption of cr vi onto membrane surface 51 in addition more acidic conditions cause more protonation of nanomagnetite which are more favorable for adsorption of negatively charged cr2o7 2 52 the reason of reduces cr vi adsorption can be explained when solution ph increased the competition of cr2o7 2 with oh ions increased for adsorption on pes membrane surfaces 53 the distribution of the cr vi species in solution depends on ph and cr vi concentration in the following form 54 55 the dichromate and acid chromate ion species were predominant in solution at low ph values according to the above reaction in acid conditions ph 7 0 the reduction of cr vi to cr iii by fe ii could be described as follow reaction 56 3 f e 2 h c r o 4 7 h c r 3 3 f e 3 4 h 2 o in neutral or alkaline conditions ph 7 0 the reduction of cr vi to cr iii by fe ii or fe oh could be described as follow reaction 57 3 f e 2 c r o 4 2 8 h 2 o c r o h 3 3 f e o h 3 4 h 3 f e o h c r o 4 2 4 h 2 o o h c r o h 3 3 f e o h 3 in this experiment the efficiency of catalytic cmr was tested by using the reduction of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 as the model compound the absorbance peaks of k2cr2o7 are found at 285 nm and 375 nm without a catalyst the maximum cr vi reduction was obtained with 1 bar pressure and the absorbance intensity decreased when pressure decreased from 3 to 1 bar fig 11c the same behaviour was obtained when solution ph decreased from 7 to 3 fig 11d the catalytic properties of the pes20 cmr10 was investigated by measurement of cr vi concentration versus time in the permeate the results showed that cr vi concentration measured in permeate increased with increasing of applied pressure cr vi concentration reached up to from 2 9 to 4 7 mg l in the permeate when applied pressure increased from 1 to 3 bar after 120 min filtration time fig 12 a cr vi reduction efficiency decreased from 71 to 53 when applied pressure increased from 1 to 3 bar fig 12b however cr vi concentration measured in permeate decreased with decreasing of solution ph cr vi concentration decreased from 2 9 to 0 45 mg l in the permeate when solution ph decreased from 7 to 3 after 120 min filtration time fig 12c cr vi reduction efficiency increased from 71 to 95 8 when solution ph decreased from 7 to 3 after 120 min filtration time fig 12d fig 13 shows the synergic effect of pes20 and cmr10 membranes when pes20 membrane was used with nanomagnetite free cmr which did not contain nanomagnetite cr vi concentration reached up to 5 4 mg l in the permeate after 120 min filtration time if cmr10 membrane was used with nanomagnetite free pes cr vi concentration reached up to 4 5 mg l in the permeate after 120 min filtration time besides cr vi concentration reached up to 0 38 mg l in the permeate when pes20 cmr10 was used together 3 5 stability and reusability of the catalytic pes20 cmr10 membrane it is well known that the reuse of the catalyst is an important parameter in evaluating its potential for commercial applications 58 in the present work we also tested the reusability of catalytic pes20 cmr10 membrane under obtained optimal conditions for five runs as shown in fig 14 the catalytic activity of pes20 cmr10 membrane decreased after four consecutive runs it can be seen from the figure that the reduction percentage of cr vi decreased from 96 2 the first run to 74 2 the fourth run this loss of activity is related to the decay of active catalytic sites which are caused by low amount of leached iron from the membrane surface 58 the catalytic membrane was activated and reused after four repetitions the oxidation of magnetite nanoparticles was carried out using 0 07 m nitric acid hno3 a certain volume of hno3 100 ml was filled into the dead end filtration system and it was filtrated witin 15 min after activation of nanomagnetite the catalytic membrane was reused under optimum conditions cr vi reduction efficiency increased from 74 2 the fourth run to 92 4 the last run as shown in fig 14 the catalytic activity of pes20 cmr10 membrane improved after hno3 activation it can be assumed that an oxidation of nanoparticles from the surface to the core where fe2 ions are oxidized from the surface to the core after that fe2 ions are migrating from core to surface 59 the fe ions concentration in the permeate for five reaction runs was analyzed to investigate the release of fe ions from the catalytic pes20 cmr10 membrane the results showed that the concentrations of dissolved fe ions in the permeate for all studied runs were negligible and found to be less than 0 15 mg l this indicates that leaching of iron from catalytic pes20 cmr10 membrane might not cause further metal pollution in the water even under acidic conditions the negligible leaching of fe ions also demonstrated that the fe ion is bonded strongly within the pes20 cmr10 membrane structure making its performance quite stable in the reaction therefore we concluded that catalytic pes20 cmr10 membrane indicates acceptable catalytic stability and durability to remove cr vi from aqueous solution 4 conclusion this study proves an effective method for catalytic reduction of cr vi to cr iii in aqueous medium using catalytic polyether sulfone coated ceramic membrane reactors the characterization of pes cmr demonstrated that nanomagnetite was loaded successfully in the cmr initial concentration of 10 mg l cr vi was reduced maximum 96 2 under optimum conditions which are mentioned in the following ph 3 0 δp 1 bar in 120 min reaction the results showed that blending of nanomagnetite into pes membrane which coated on ceramic membrane improved the catalytic efficiency of the cmr the prepared pes20 cmr10 showed activity loss after the fourth use hno3 was used for activation of catalytic membrane and cr vi reduction improved after activation of nanomagnetite we also found that the nanomagnetite was bonded strongly within the pes cmr structure making its performance quite stable in the reaction hence using this catalytic membrane which has high stability and reusability can result in a significant reduction of the operational cost the process can be easily adopted in full scale commercial catalytic ceramic membrane
