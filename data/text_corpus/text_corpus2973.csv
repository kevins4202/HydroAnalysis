14865,parabens are commonly used preservatives that are weakly estrogenic wastewater effluent is the greatest contributor to the spread of parabens into rivers and other surface water while previous studies indicate parabens are well removed in wastewater treatment by way of transformation not much is known about the paraben transformation products this study evaluates paraben transformation and release at two different wastewater treatment plants in texas paraben concentrations were quantified for influent and effluent by season and by year at both treatment plants both seasonal and annual transformation rates were compared between the two wastewater treatment plants compounds were compared to evaluate differences in transformation rates and to determine if decreases in parent product concentrations are correlated to changes in transformation product concentrations the study took place over one year and evaluated each season spring had higher influent concentrations and transformation rates at treatment plant 1 while summer had higher influent concentrations and transformation rates at treatment plant 2 phba was present in greatest amounts in influent and effluent at both sites with average yearly influent concentrations at 223 9 pm at plant 1 and 211 4 pm at plant 2 transformation rates of parent parabens were greater at plant 1 with concentration of all three shorter chained parabens decreasing by over 50 after treatment formation of dichlorinated transformation products were greater at plant 1 with concentrations of cl2mep increasing by 1200 after treatment and cl2etp increasing by 940 while shorter chained parabens generally had a greater transformation rate no correlations were found between decreases in methyl and ethyl parabens and the formation of their respective dichlorinated transformation products graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords parabens disinfection byproducts wastewater treatment emerging contaminants data availability the link to the data code is in the data availability section in the manuscript 1 introduction parabens are ubiquitous in the environment likely due to their widespread use in personal care products and foodstuff after use parabens often go down the drain and enter wastewater treatment brausch and rand 2011 all parabens are esters of para hydroxybenzoic acid phba which is the major paraben degradation product where each paraben differs only by the sidechain haman et al 2015 this is important as the length of the sidechain effects paraben toxicity bledzka et al 2014 parent parabens include methyl ethyl propyl butyl heptyl and benzyl paraben teraksai et al 2013 the degradation from parent paraben to phba occurs naturally in the environment phba has been determined to be less toxic than the parent parabens terasaki et al 2015 due to their degradation to the less toxic phba and the effectiveness of wastewater treatment in removing parent parabens and dilution after release into rivers release of parabens is not expected to pose a risk to human health yamamoto et al 2011 serra roig et al 2016 however parabens are transformed during wastewater treatment these byproducts are then released and may pose more of a risk then their parent compounds chlorinated parabens which will be major byproducts from parabens in wastewater treatment and from interaction between parent parabens and free chlorine have shown greater acute toxicity than their respective parent compounds marino et al 2011 albero et al 2012 free chlorine could also transform phba in ambient water after parent parabens degrade into phba little is known about the toxicity of chlorinated forms of phba or their concentrations in surface water para hydroxybenzoic acid phba would be expected in wastewater influent both due to the use of ozonation in the upstream drinking plant in waco and due to the natural biodegradation and photodegradation of paraben into phba in rivers mono and di chlorinated products are also seen in intake as they are likely to be released as a result of chlorination in drinking water treatment in some cases in areas with high release of free chlorine chlorinated parabens can be transformed from free chlorine remaining after drinking water treatment a study by canosa et al 2006 found that concentrations of chlorine in tap water can transform parabens with concentration as low as 0 5 mg l however at the 0 35 mg l of free chlorine released from the upstream drinking water plant chlorination from chlorine residues is unlikely the occur quickly in this study but should be considered in other locations transformation products formed from these parent compounds during the wastewater process would depend on the treatments used usually wastewater treatment includes primary treatment composed of clarifiers followed by a secondary treatment consisting of degradation cells in primary treatments only natural transformations are expected from degradation such as photodegradation or biodegradation wenhui li et al 2015 in secondary treatments parabens are biodegraded by esterase enzymes from microbial species parabens and phba can also be hydroxylated as a result of biotransformation specifically in the aeration process all the parent compounds share phba acid as their major degradation product and an increase in phba concentrations can be expected during biological treatments tertiary treatments are chemical or physical treatments most of which are referred to as disinfection processes common chemical processes include chlorination and ozonation while physical treatments include ultrafiltration and uv disinfection wenhui li et al 2015 most parabens are not removed during ultra filtration due to the size of the molecules wenhui li et al 2015 during chlorination the most common paraben transformation mechanism involves the addition of a chlorine on the aromatic ring followed by a second addition yoom et al 2018 during ozonation transformation can occur by hydroxylation of either the aromatic ring or the alkyl chain on compounds with longer chains with the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring being more likely gao et al 2016 other reactions can occur however hydroxylation is most likely the toxicity of oxygenated parabens has not been studied uv light is expected to photooxidize organic compounds by aiding the formation of radicals with hydroxyl radicals often facilitating the photooxidation uv light also facilitates the formation of chlorine radicals from free chlorine thus uv disinfection can potentially generate transformation products seen in both ozonation and chlorination the most common transformation products include dichlorinated paraben species monohydroxylated parabens and the major degradation product phba penrose and cobb 2022 studies that evaluate the treatment of paraben species in wastewater tend to emphasize the effectiveness of the treatment by way of sorption filtration or transformation in order to determine how much of the parent compound remains after treatment wenhui li et al 2015 only three studies have evaluated the removal of both parabens and select metabolites these studies involved wastewater facilities located in the us wang and kannan 2016 china ma et al 2018 and india karthikraj et al 2017 these articles mainly discuss the removal of parabens and metabolites found in wastewater influent and do not include products formed during treatment these studies have shown that parent paraben species are well removed in wastewater treatment however settling strategies used in primary treatments are not expected to have high removal rates indicating that much of the removal occurs due to transformation of the parent compounds song et al 2017 this demonstrates a need to evaluate transformation products formed during the wastewater treatment process no known studies evaluate the transformation products that are formed during the treatment process the few studies that have evaluated specific transformation products of parabens evaluate transformations in laboratory settings with none targeting wastewater treatment this research quantifies transformation products resulting from wastewater treatment to determine which products are being released from wastewater treatment and which are released in greater concentrations the average seasonal and yearly influent and effluent concentrations were evaluated at two difference treatment plants to determine differences in paraben transformation by treatment type changes in parent parabens were compared to changes in transformation products to determine if decreases in parent paraben concentrations could be correlated to increases in transformation product concentrations this is the first study to systematically quantify the formation of transformation products within municipal wastewater treatment systems 2 methods 2 1 standards and supplies analytical standards included five parent parabens four chlorinated paraben transformation products three hydroxylated products phba and five internal standards table 1 methyl paraben mep ethyl paraben etp propyl paraben prp and butyl paraben bup were purchased from accustandard 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid dhba methyl 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid mepoh ethyl 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid etpoh methyl 3 4 5 trihydroxybenzoic acid mep oh 2 ethyl 3 4 5 trihydroxybenzoic acid etp oh 2 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid clphba 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid cl2phba methyl 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid clmep methyl 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid cl2mep ethyl 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid cletp and ethyl 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid cl2etp were purchased from sigma aldrich internal standards mep d4 etp d4 prp c13 bup d9 and phba d4 were all purchased from cambridge isotopes 2 2 instrumentation an acquity uplc waters corp milford ma usa coupled to a xevo tqs mass spectrometer was used for quantification of target products chromatographic separation was done using an aquity uplc beh c18 column 2 1 50 mm 1 7 Î¼m waters with an inject volume of 10 Î¼l and a flow rate of 300 Î¼l min the mobile phase consisted of a gradient of 0 01 formic acid and acetonitrile masslynx 4 1 micromass manchester uk software was used to process chromatographic data and targetlynx waters was used to generate calibration curves and quantify analyte concentrations in sample compound were analyzed in esi negative mode with both a quantifier ion and a qualifier ion fragmentation pattern accurate masses and resolution setup were determined by intellistart waters tables with gradient values instrument parameters and a list of quantifier qualifier ions were included as supplemental information 2 3 analyte determination and treatment process evaluation as a preliminary assessment to determine compounds of interest first effluent water samples were taken from two different wastewater treatment plants directly infused into a thermo orbitrap discovery mass spectrometer and detectable compounds were identified using a full scan with a mass range from 65 to 275 m z the analyte scan was limited to compounds that were expected based on compounds detected in influent reported in literature and on transformation products expected from each site s treatment process samples were then taken at each treatment step to further limit target compounds to those seen present during or after wastewater treatment and to reduce the possibility of false positive hits 500 ml samples were taken at influent at effluent and after each treatment step to determine which transformation products could potentially be released in wastewater effluent eight grab samples were taken at influent effluent and after each treatment step samples were taken based on retention time of water within the treatment process this sampling was repeated weekly for three weeks in august 2020 this was done to determine which compounds would be evaluated in the study compounds that were detected in 25 of samples at any treatment step were added to a list of compounds to be considered for analysis identified compounds with available standards were quantified in the seasonal analysis the full list of detected compounds is shown in table 1 the results of the preliminary assessment were only used to create a list of compounds of interest and not used in concentration calculations 2 4 seasonal sample collection and solid phase extraction paraben concentration profiles were evaluated at two treatment plants one using chlorination and another using uv disinfection water samples were collected in 500 ml amber glass bottles as 24 h composite samples composite samples were taken for influent and effluent samples each sample was spiked with 50 ng ml of each internal standard and filtered to remove solids samples were acidified to a ph of 3 using hydrochloric acid following filtration samples were extracted using with oasis hlb solid phase cartridges 6 cm3 200 mg which were conditioned using5 ml of a 1 1 methanol and water mixture after cartridge pretreatment samples were eluted at a rate of approximately 2 5 ml min over a vacuum after all the sample was filtered through the cartridges were left over a vacuum filter for thirty minutes to dry followed by elution with 5 ml of methanol the extract was then concentrated to approximately 1 ml in a nitrogen evaporator and diluted to 2 ml using methanol a 1 5 ml aliquot was then transferred to a glass vial and stored in a 20 c freezer until analysis in lcms 2 5 quality control method blanks were included to monitor possible contamination throughout the analysis concentration detected in method blanks were subtracted from all other samples method spikes were also run along with the samples and were used to standardize sample concentrations two method spikes and two method blanks were included and analyzed with every batch of samples n 16 all samples were spiked with internal standards before extraction in order to evaluate recovery products that have no internal standards but are similar in structure to internal standards of the parent compounds used recovery result from the closest parent compound a calibration curve was created using 8 to 10 calibration standards ranging in concentrations of 0 25 ng ml to 100 ng ml for most analytes and concentrations ranging from 2 5 ng ml to 1000 ng ml for phba and dhba a reference standard of 10 ng ml was used to automatically correct for shifts in retention time between runs 2 6 data analysis 2 6 1 compound comparisons molar ratios were used when comparing analyte concentrations the concentration of each transformation product was compared to determine which of the products have higher yearly concentrations concentration changes were calculated as the difference between effluent and influent concentrations the correlation between product formation and parent loss was evaluated to determine if the increase of transformation product concentration is correlated to the decrease in parent concentration 2 6 2 seasonal evaluation parabens and transformation products were evaluated for seasonal differences at each site seasonal concentrations were reported in picomolar pm units with variance reported as confidence intervals seasonal concentrations were plotted against each other to evaluate differences in seasonal intake and release seasonal changes in concentration between influent and effluent for each site were calculated to determine if decreases or increases in paraben and transformation product concentrations could be dependent on season 2 6 3 plant wise comparisons seasonal and average yearly influent and effluent concentrations were calculated at plant 1 and plant 2 concentrations at the two sites were compared to determine which of the treatment procedures resulted in greater transformation rates to do this percent change was calculated by determining change for each sample day and the changes were averaged to determine seasonal and yearly averages by treatment plant concentrations were plotted to make visual comparisons between the sites influent and effluent concentrations differences between influent and effluent were calculated to evaluated transformation 2 6 4 statistical analysis normality and homogeneity of variances were evaluated for non transformed data first to determine if the data meet the assumptions required to run anovas normality was evaluated using shapiro wilk s test where tests resulting in greater than a p value of 0 05 were determined to be normal bartlett s tests were used to evaluate homogeneity of variances where population variances were similar if test resulted in a p value above 0 05 as untransformed data did not meet the assumptions data were log transformed the transformed data was first evaluated for normality using shapiro wilk s tests followed by bartlett tests for homogeneity of variances as less than half the compounds met the assumptions of anova even after transformations non parametric tests were considered kruskal wallis tests were used to analyze differences followed by dunn tests maximum likelihood estimations mle were used to treat non detects before performing statistical analysis statistical analyses were done using microsoft excel 2016 r version 3 4 1 and sigma plot 12 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 analyte determination potential analytes were determined based on the study site s treatment setups fig 1 the average flow rate for treatment plant 1 is 20 million of gallons per day mgd while the average flow rate at treatment plant 2 is 1 8 mgd daily changes in flow rate would affect the retention time at each step during scoping trials parent parabens phba dhba and small amounts of chlorinated parabens were detected in influent at both treatment facilities transformation products detected at treatment plant 1 include dichlorinated products which are expected in effluent due to the use of chlorination chlorinated products were found in influent an average dichlorinated mep concentration of 0 78 pm 0 21 pm to 2 9 pm in local drinking water demonstrates that chlorinated parabens in drinking water could contribute to the concentrations seen in influent however the concentration of chlorinated parabens in drinking water are lower than what is quantified in wastewater influent results for specific parabens and paraben transformation products in tap water are included as supplemental information in table s11 chlorination of parabens from chlorine residues after drinking water treatment is possible however the residual chlorine concentrations in local drinking water are unlikely to be high enough to cause the concentration of chlorinated parabens seen in influent monochlorinated mep was detected in more than 80 of effluent samples at both treatment plants monochlorinated etp had only been detected in 20 of samples in the evaluated influent and effluent samples at both treatment plants however this was included for comparison to the dichlorinated form which was present in above 90 of effluent samples hydroxylated products were expected because of biotransformation from aerobic microbes during aeration however only the mono hydroxylated species were sufficiently detected being detected in above 50 of samples at plant 1 this could be due to the preferential formation of phba dhba phenol or hydroquinone during biodegradation phenol and hydroquinone were not included as potential products due to their use in industry and both are common products that could result from the transformation of a variety of natural compounds therefore increases in either phenol or hydroquinone would not be expected to show correlation with parent paraben transformation the main difference between the two treatment setups was the use of uv disinfection at treatment plant 2 instead of chlorinated plant 2 also include an anoxic unit which is a treatment process with little to no oxygen but does not include microbes and does not significantly affect paraben concentrations plant 2 had detectable amounts of both chlorinated and hydroxylated products in effluent which was expected due to the use of uv disinfection of the 18 identified transformation products table 1 only phba dhba mono and dichlorinated methyl paraben and dichlorinated ethyl paraben and mono hydroxylated methyl paraben and mono hydroxylated ethyl paraben had standards at the time of this study these and the five parent parabens were quantified in this study standards for four compounds including mono and dichlorinated phba became available after running samples these compounds were run but not in the controls results for the four extra compounds are included as supplemental information 3 2 seasonal analysis 3 2 1 treatment plant 1 seasonal analysis influent and effluent concentrations at plant 1 varied by season fig 2 phba had the highest concentration in influent p 0 001 and effluent p 0 01 with fall having the highest concentration of phba at 500 0 pm 270 0 pm to 930 pm in the influent effluent concentrations were similar across seasons p 0 14 among the parents mep was quantified at highest concentrations except during fall which had higher concentrations of prp in influent with fall prp concentrations of 73 pm 42 pm to 130 pm in influent p 0 01 and 4 1 pm 1 7 pm to 9 9 pm in effluent p 0 01 mep concentrations were highest in both influent and effluent during the spring at 140 pm 100 pm to 480 nm in influent p 0 01 and 26 pm in effluent p 0 01 of the transformation products cl2mep was present at the greatest concentrations with the highest concentrations being found during the spring the spring concentrations of cl2mep were highest in spring effluent p 0 01 at 40 pm 22 pm to 73 pm overall at treatment plant 1 summer had the lowest influent parent compound concentrations which is unexpected due to the expected increase in personal care product use in later spring and summer months however the area served by the treatment plant experiences a decrease in population over the summer months due to a high student population which could be a factor in the lower influent concentrations spring had the highest concentrations of parent product in influent which could be due to increased personal care product use spring also had the highest concentration of transformation products detected in effluent which is partly due to both the high parent concentrations in influent and high transformation rates fall had greater percent decreases of methyl ethyl and propyl paraben with decreases above 94 table 2 increases in bzp concentrations were seen in winter and summer p 0 04 these evaluated increases could be due to variation from methods and instrumental analyses as bzp was quantified in very low concentrations in both influent and effluent both bup and bzp have high variations in most seasons and are generally detected in very low concentrations in both influent and effluent mep had a smaller decrease in summer than in winter the reasons for this difference are undetermined summer had overall lower decreases in parent concentrations the lower transformation rate in the summer could be explained by high rainfall in summer with 3 inches in june 4 5 in july and 7 in august resulting in high flow rates and lower retention times percent changes also had higher variations in the summer which could be due to greater fluctuations in flow rate the high variation could also be due to lower influent concentrations for some compounds in the summer resulting in greater sensitivity to error the rainfall in fall was much lower with 0 94 inches in september 3 8 in october and 0 98 in november the concentration decreases in parent parabens are greater than the concentrations increase in transformation products which suggests that there are other transformation products produced from parabens that are not currently quantified as plant 1 uses chlorination the most common transformation products are dichlorinated paraben species however only the shorter chained dichlorinated parabens have standards the longer chained species are unaccounted for there are not any available standards for any transformation products of either butyl or benzyl paraben degradation products are also expected especially due to the use of aeration tanks while phba is the major degradation products of parabens phba saw decreases during treatment in multiple seasons this means that if parabens are being degraded into phba they are being further transformed after being degraded into phba potential pathways for phba transformation include chlorination into mono or dichlorinated phba hydroxylation into dhba further degradation into phenols and quinones are also possible and is more likely to occur via biodegradation by microbes during aeration of the transformation products dichlorinated parabens had the greatest increase after treatment at plant 1 table 3 cl2mep large percent change values in the spring and summer with a 2700 increase in spring and a 1200 increase in the summer however despite the noticeable larger average changes in both seasons there were no differences in cl2mep percent changes between seasons p 0 0833 the lack of differences suggests that the high percent changes during spring and summer are due to the large percent changes on certain days rather than high percent changes across the whole season cl2etp had a high percent change in the summer at 3100 as with dichlorinated mep the high change could be due to a few days with high percent change however with cl2etp percent changes between seasons were significantly different p 0 0366 percent changes in were notably different for mepoh p 0 01 phba p 0 01 and dhba p 0 01 across seasons mepoh only saw an average increase in the summer with an increase of 230 phba and dhba saw increases across multiple seasons with the highest increase for phba being in the summer at 160 and for dhba in the spring at 320 phba dhba and mepoh are potential transformation products in aeration meaning that these changes could stem from aeration perhaps low flow rates could have allowed sufficient treatment time for biodegradation into phba dhba and mepoh but the treatment time for chlorination was not long enough to transform them further this would not be the case for summer as higher flow rates were seen however etpoh did not follow the same trend as mepoh which could be due to the limited concentration of etp present during treatment or the generally lower transformation rates of etp when compared to mep 3 2 2 treatment plant 2 seasonal analysis seasonal differences at treatment plant 2 follow some of the same trends in treatment plant 1 fig 3 prp was highest during the fall months and is the parent compound detected in highest amounts during that season at 81 pm 40 pm to 170 pm in fall influent and is notably higher than all other seasons p 0 01 similarly phba concentrations was also higher numerically higher during the fall at 570 pm 250 pm to 1300 pm but were not significantly different than other seasons p 0 06 at treatment plant 2 other parent paraben concentrations were higher during the summer than the other seasons which does not match the trend seen at plant 1 this could be due to the plant location this site is in a nearby area to plant 1 the main difference is that this area is not as dependent on a student population however plant 2 would have experienced similar rainfall in the summer as plant 1 concentrations of dichlorinated species were higher in summer effluent p 0 001 with an average cl2mep concentration of 44 pm 24 pm to 54 pm in summer effluent mep and etp concentrations decreased after treatment during all seasons with decreases above 72 during all seasons table 4 however removal rates were not significantly different between seasons for any of the parents p 0 98 for mep p 0 15 for etp p 0 07 for prp p 0 49 for bup and p 0 85 cl2mep generally increased after treatment with differences in change between seasons p 0 01 increases in cl2mep range from 66 in the spring to 3800 in the winter and a decrease of 55 in the fall table 5 cl2etp increased in all seasons but no notable differences were seen between seasons p 0 25 percent change was similar across seasons for all hydroxylated products p 0 14 for mepoh p 0 41 for etpoh and p 0 81 for dhba phba concentration generally decreased due to treatment except during the summer with a percent change showing increase at 51 percent change values for phba were similar across seasons p 0 25 increases in dichlorinated products were expected due to parent paraben interactions with residual chlorine after excitation during uv disinfection however hydroxylated compounds were also expected both from the use of aeration and the use of uv disinfection the decreases in these compounds could be due to formation of other products such as further hydroxylated products phenol or hydroquinone however all of the transformation products had high variability in percent change data at plant 2 and some of the high percent change values could be affected by the high variability and low influent concentrations 3 3 plant wise comparisons 3 3 1 seasonal comparisons by treatment plant parent paraben influent concentrations were similar p 0 08 for mep p 0 43 for etp p 0 95 for prp p 0 09 for bup and p 0 36 for bzp between the two treatment plants during the winter fig 4 in winter effluents etp was the only parent paraben with concentrations that were different by plant p 0 01 of the transformation products phba was quantified in greatest concentrations winter influent concentrations of phba were determined to be similar but the effluent concentrations were different between the two plants p 0 01 phba concentrations were higher in plant 1 effluent meaning that either transformation from phba to other compounds is more likely at plant 1 or that plant 2 is forming more phba from parent compounds but that the phba is being transformed after transformation to phba is likely as phba is expected as a uv disinfection byproduct at plant 2 the transformation from parent paraben to phba would not be likely in chlorination at plant 1 though some phba can be produced in biodegradation at both sites the average concentration of phba at plant 1 effluent is 260 pm 160 pm to 420 pm and 27 pm 14 pm to 52 pm phba concentrations decreased after treatment in plant 2 but increased after treatment at plant 1 the increase in phba seen at plant 1 is odd given the decrease seen in other seasons especially since the same trend was not seen at plant 2 cl2mep concentrations increased at both plants and effluent concentrations were different between the two treatments during all seasons p values for all products are included as supplemental information though uv disinfection requires cleaner water with less suspended solids this treatment plant does not use an ultrafilter beforehand treatment could have been more effective if the influent was cleaner during specific months chlorination rates can also vary by month rates are often higher during warmer months up to 5 ppm this is due to chlorine and chloramine lasting longer in colder water the slower degradation could result in greater concentrations of chlorine being released in effluent spring influent concentrations were generally similar fig 5 the only parent compound that was significantly higher in plant 1 influent than plant 2 influent during the spring was prp p 0 01 mep was the parent compound quantified at the highest concentration with an average concentration of 140 pm 41 pm to 480 pm in plant 1 spring influent and 140 pm 55 pm to 330 pm in plant 2 influent fig 5 however the treatment setup did not notably effect mep removal as the effluent concentrations were similar p 0 21 transformation product concentrations in spring influent were similar at both plants phba p 0 02 and clmep p 0 01 were the only transformation products with noticeable differences in spring influent concentrations with higher clmep and phba concentrations at plant 1 influent dhba concentrations increased after treatment at both plants during the spring with a greater increase at plant 1 despite the increases in dhba treatment caused decreases in phba concentrations at both sites increases in dhba could be due to higher hydroxylation rates in the spring resulting in greater phba to dhba transformation rates increased degradation to phba followed by hydroxylation to dhba is another explanation for the observed increase summer influent mep p 0 01 and prp p 0 04 concentrations were higher at plant 2 fig 6 phba p 0 01 was found at greater concentration in plant 2 influent at an average concentration of 240 pm 100 pm to 410 pm cl2mep concentrations p 0 01 were higher in the plant 2 effluent in the summer with an average concentration of 37 pm 32 pm to 42 pm at plant 1 and 44 pm 20 pm to 97 pm at plant 2 variation in cl2mep concentrations was much higher in plant 2 effluent summer is the only season where cl2mep effluent concentrations were higher at plant 2 than at plant 1 phba concentrations increased after treatment at both sites during the summer phba influent p 0 01 and effluent p 0 03 concentrations were higher at plant 2 during the summer however variations in phba concentrations were high in effluents at both plants the varying phba concentrations in plant 2 effluent could represent inconsistent outputs of phba in effluent at that site a cause of the increase seen at both plants could be the transformation of parabens into phba as all parabens share phba as a common degradation product longer biodegradation or uv disinfection treatments in the summer are unlikely to be the cause due to higher flow rates however for phba concentrations to increase further transformations cannot occur and the high flow rates may decrease further transformations phba transformations include chlorinated phba species and degradation into phenols quinone or dhba prp concentrations were higher in influent at both plants during the fall than during any other season but concentrations were similar between plant influents p 0 12 fig 7 prp concentrations decreased after treatment at both treatment plants but were found to be similar in fall effluent between plants p 0 47 prp being high in the influent of both sites means there would have been a higher use of prp or more waste containing prp during the fall months that would have increased concentrations found in influent expected prp transformation products include dichlorinated prp and different forms of hydroxylated prp many of which do not have standards and are not currently quantified common prp degradation products include phba dhba and further degradation into quinones and phenols mono chlorinated prp and trihydroxylated prp have standards that are now available but were not obtained before the end of this study phba was also detected in higher concentrations during the fall in influent at both plants the phba concentrations quantified were similar between the plants with an average concentration of 500 pm 270 pm to 930 at plant 1 influent and 570 pm 250 pm to 1300 pm at plant 2 influent p 0 55 fall effluent concentrations were also similar at both plants with an average concentration of 110 pm 58 pm to 210 pm at plant 1 and 160 pm 77 pm to 150 pm at plant 2 p 0 54 3 3 2 yearly comparisons by plant yearly parent paraben concentrations were generally similar at plant 1 and plant 2 fig 8 the only parent compound found to be significantly different between the plants was bup p 0 02for influent and p 0 01 for effluent while the parent paraben concentrations were similar between the two sites transformation product concentrations were found to vary by plant dhba concentrations were greater in plant 2 influent p 0 01 the average yearly concentration of dhba at plant 1 influent was 46 pm 31 pm to 69 pm and 120 pm 79 pm to 190 pm effluent dhba concentrations were similar p 0 13 between the two plants with an average concentration of 100 pm 79 pm to 130 pm at plant 1 and 88 pm 64 pm to 120pm at plant 2 while dhba concentrations were different between influents phba concentrations were similar in both influent p 0 52 and effluent p 0 05 between the two sites cl2mep was higher at plant 1 in both influent p 0 01 and effluent p 0 01 however cl2etp concentrations were similar between the two plants in both influent p 0 20 and effluent p 0 52 decreases in parent compound concentrations from treatment were similar between the two plants table 6 meaning that the treatment setup did not significantly affect yearly parent paraben removal rates longer chained parabens had lower removal rates than shorter chained parents at both sites however variation was higher for the longer chained parents longer chained parabens such as bzp are expected to have lower decreases however increases are not expected unless bzp is being introduced from an outside source it is more likely that the observed increases seen during certain seasons are due to a combination of the relatively low influent and effluent bzp concentrations and random variation the cl2mep and etp were the only compound that increased in concentration after treatment at both treatment plants table 7 cl2etp was expected to be present in higher concentrations in effluent at plant 1 due to the use of chlorination however differences in etp concentration changes between the two plants were not significant with a p value of 0 101 meaning that treatment did not have a great effect of transformation into etp this could be due to the limited amount of etp in influent cl2mep concentration increase was higher at plant 1 p 0 02 all other transformation products had overall higher concentration in influent than effluent at both sites phba had lower removal rates than parent compounds matching previous findings that phba is more resistant to treatment than the parents ma et al 2021 wang and kannan 2016 karthikraj et al 2017 though other transformation products seem to have increased at plant 1 while decreasing at plant 2 the only other compound found to have different transformation rates between plants is dhba with an increase at plant 1 and decrease at plant 2 p 0 01 the difference is unexpected as both plants use similar biodegradation steps the higher positive percent changes at plant 1 for mepoh and phba is due to higher percent changes on specific days and during certain seasons 3 4 product comparisons molar concentration pm of parent parabens table 8 and transformation products table 9 were compared butyl and benzyl parabens were present at much lower concentrations than any of the shorter chained parabens in either influent or effluent at both plants mep was generally found in higher concentrations than ethyl or prp in plant 1 influent mep prp p 0 02 etp mep p 0 01 and higher than prp in plant 2 influent mep prp p 0 01 though in lower concentration than mep or prp etp concentrations are higher than expected due to the low use of etp in products etp concentrations are expected to be very low closer to bup concentrations the etp concentrations in this study are more comparable to mep and prp with an etp mep molar ratio of 0 17 in plant 1 influent and 0 23 in plant 2 influent phba concentrations were higher than any other product mep was the compound with the next highest concentration with similar concentration in influent mep phba p 1 at plant 1 and plant 2 but phba was higher than mep in effluent at plant 2 mep phba p 1 at plant 1 and p 0 01 at plant 2 the molar ratios between phba and mep are 2 7 for plant 1 influent 27 for plant 1 effluent 2 3 for plant 2 influent and 18for plant 2 effluent the higher ratios for effluent show that phba removal was lower than that of mep however this could also be due to some transformation into phba rather than just lower transformation of phba cl2mep was the chlorinated disinfection byproduct quantified in greatest concentrations in effluent molar ratios between cl2mep and mep were 0 04 in plant 1 influent 3 1 in plant 1 effluent 0 02in plant 2 influent and 0 81 in plant 2 effluent ratios between dichlorinated mep and mep showed increasing abundance of cl2mep at both plants though only in plant 1 effluent were the concentrations of cl2mep higher than the concentrations of mep mep cl2mep p 0 01 for plant1 effluent and p 1 for plant 2 effluent the two dichlorinated disinfection byproducts cl2mep and cl2etp were the only compounds seen to increase after treatment at both plants correlations between the increase in the dichlorinated species and decreases in their respective parent compounds were evaluated to see if the formation of these transformation products are directly related to the transformation of the parents by evaluating pearson correlation coefficients there were no notable correlations between the mep or etp and their respective dichlorinated transformation products cl2mep and cl2etp at either plant 1 or plant 2 with all the r squared values being below 0 1 meaning that much of the decrease in mep and etp concentrations are not attributed to transformation into dichlorinated mep and dichlorinated etp the plots showing correlation between the parent parabens and dichlorinated disinfection products are included as supplemental information this can also be seen with the determined concentration changes the concentration decrease in methyl and ethyl parabens are much higher than the concentration increases in dichlorinated mep and dichlorinated etp meaning that there are other pathways by which the parent compounds are being removed the most likely pathway being transformation to other unidentified compounds degradation of mep and etp to phba and then further transformation into mono and dichlorinated phba dhba phenols or quinones are other potential transformation products that could attribute to the observed mep and etp decreases 4 conclusions seasonal concentration of parabens and paraben transformation products were evaluated in influent and effluent at two different wastewater treatment plants in texas chlorinated disinfection byproducts are an important factor in both types of treatment release of the dichlorinated species in river water needs to be evaluated plant 1 had overall greater paraben transformation rates but plant 2 had higher rates of dichlorinated transformation product formation the higher transformation rates at plant 1 as well as the lack of correlations between change in parent product and change in transformation product indicates that plant 1 released higher concentrations of unidentified transformation products potential transformation products include phenols and quinones which are paraben transformation products expected during biodegradation in aeration however due to the high production of phenols and quinones and their potential to be transformation products of many compounds they would not be directly correlatable to paraben transformation due to the high concentrations of phba and dhba in influent and effluent concentrations of chlorinated phba and dhba should be evaluated future research should focus on identifying and quantifying other transformation product that could explain the large removal of parent products these compounds will be important factors in evaluating the effect of effluent discharge into surface water and studies involving environmental effects of these other products research could also be geared towards determining which treatment setups would be more likely to result

14865,parabens are commonly used preservatives that are weakly estrogenic wastewater effluent is the greatest contributor to the spread of parabens into rivers and other surface water while previous studies indicate parabens are well removed in wastewater treatment by way of transformation not much is known about the paraben transformation products this study evaluates paraben transformation and release at two different wastewater treatment plants in texas paraben concentrations were quantified for influent and effluent by season and by year at both treatment plants both seasonal and annual transformation rates were compared between the two wastewater treatment plants compounds were compared to evaluate differences in transformation rates and to determine if decreases in parent product concentrations are correlated to changes in transformation product concentrations the study took place over one year and evaluated each season spring had higher influent concentrations and transformation rates at treatment plant 1 while summer had higher influent concentrations and transformation rates at treatment plant 2 phba was present in greatest amounts in influent and effluent at both sites with average yearly influent concentrations at 223 9 pm at plant 1 and 211 4 pm at plant 2 transformation rates of parent parabens were greater at plant 1 with concentration of all three shorter chained parabens decreasing by over 50 after treatment formation of dichlorinated transformation products were greater at plant 1 with concentrations of cl2mep increasing by 1200 after treatment and cl2etp increasing by 940 while shorter chained parabens generally had a greater transformation rate no correlations were found between decreases in methyl and ethyl parabens and the formation of their respective dichlorinated transformation products graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords parabens disinfection byproducts wastewater treatment emerging contaminants data availability the link to the data code is in the data availability section in the manuscript 1 introduction parabens are ubiquitous in the environment likely due to their widespread use in personal care products and foodstuff after use parabens often go down the drain and enter wastewater treatment brausch and rand 2011 all parabens are esters of para hydroxybenzoic acid phba which is the major paraben degradation product where each paraben differs only by the sidechain haman et al 2015 this is important as the length of the sidechain effects paraben toxicity bledzka et al 2014 parent parabens include methyl ethyl propyl butyl heptyl and benzyl paraben teraksai et al 2013 the degradation from parent paraben to phba occurs naturally in the environment phba has been determined to be less toxic than the parent parabens terasaki et al 2015 due to their degradation to the less toxic phba and the effectiveness of wastewater treatment in removing parent parabens and dilution after release into rivers release of parabens is not expected to pose a risk to human health yamamoto et al 2011 serra roig et al 2016 however parabens are transformed during wastewater treatment these byproducts are then released and may pose more of a risk then their parent compounds chlorinated parabens which will be major byproducts from parabens in wastewater treatment and from interaction between parent parabens and free chlorine have shown greater acute toxicity than their respective parent compounds marino et al 2011 albero et al 2012 free chlorine could also transform phba in ambient water after parent parabens degrade into phba little is known about the toxicity of chlorinated forms of phba or their concentrations in surface water para hydroxybenzoic acid phba would be expected in wastewater influent both due to the use of ozonation in the upstream drinking plant in waco and due to the natural biodegradation and photodegradation of paraben into phba in rivers mono and di chlorinated products are also seen in intake as they are likely to be released as a result of chlorination in drinking water treatment in some cases in areas with high release of free chlorine chlorinated parabens can be transformed from free chlorine remaining after drinking water treatment a study by canosa et al 2006 found that concentrations of chlorine in tap water can transform parabens with concentration as low as 0 5 mg l however at the 0 35 mg l of free chlorine released from the upstream drinking water plant chlorination from chlorine residues is unlikely the occur quickly in this study but should be considered in other locations transformation products formed from these parent compounds during the wastewater process would depend on the treatments used usually wastewater treatment includes primary treatment composed of clarifiers followed by a secondary treatment consisting of degradation cells in primary treatments only natural transformations are expected from degradation such as photodegradation or biodegradation wenhui li et al 2015 in secondary treatments parabens are biodegraded by esterase enzymes from microbial species parabens and phba can also be hydroxylated as a result of biotransformation specifically in the aeration process all the parent compounds share phba acid as their major degradation product and an increase in phba concentrations can be expected during biological treatments tertiary treatments are chemical or physical treatments most of which are referred to as disinfection processes common chemical processes include chlorination and ozonation while physical treatments include ultrafiltration and uv disinfection wenhui li et al 2015 most parabens are not removed during ultra filtration due to the size of the molecules wenhui li et al 2015 during chlorination the most common paraben transformation mechanism involves the addition of a chlorine on the aromatic ring followed by a second addition yoom et al 2018 during ozonation transformation can occur by hydroxylation of either the aromatic ring or the alkyl chain on compounds with longer chains with the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring being more likely gao et al 2016 other reactions can occur however hydroxylation is most likely the toxicity of oxygenated parabens has not been studied uv light is expected to photooxidize organic compounds by aiding the formation of radicals with hydroxyl radicals often facilitating the photooxidation uv light also facilitates the formation of chlorine radicals from free chlorine thus uv disinfection can potentially generate transformation products seen in both ozonation and chlorination the most common transformation products include dichlorinated paraben species monohydroxylated parabens and the major degradation product phba penrose and cobb 2022 studies that evaluate the treatment of paraben species in wastewater tend to emphasize the effectiveness of the treatment by way of sorption filtration or transformation in order to determine how much of the parent compound remains after treatment wenhui li et al 2015 only three studies have evaluated the removal of both parabens and select metabolites these studies involved wastewater facilities located in the us wang and kannan 2016 china ma et al 2018 and india karthikraj et al 2017 these articles mainly discuss the removal of parabens and metabolites found in wastewater influent and do not include products formed during treatment these studies have shown that parent paraben species are well removed in wastewater treatment however settling strategies used in primary treatments are not expected to have high removal rates indicating that much of the removal occurs due to transformation of the parent compounds song et al 2017 this demonstrates a need to evaluate transformation products formed during the wastewater treatment process no known studies evaluate the transformation products that are formed during the treatment process the few studies that have evaluated specific transformation products of parabens evaluate transformations in laboratory settings with none targeting wastewater treatment this research quantifies transformation products resulting from wastewater treatment to determine which products are being released from wastewater treatment and which are released in greater concentrations the average seasonal and yearly influent and effluent concentrations were evaluated at two difference treatment plants to determine differences in paraben transformation by treatment type changes in parent parabens were compared to changes in transformation products to determine if decreases in parent paraben concentrations could be correlated to increases in transformation product concentrations this is the first study to systematically quantify the formation of transformation products within municipal wastewater treatment systems 2 methods 2 1 standards and supplies analytical standards included five parent parabens four chlorinated paraben transformation products three hydroxylated products phba and five internal standards table 1 methyl paraben mep ethyl paraben etp propyl paraben prp and butyl paraben bup were purchased from accustandard 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid dhba methyl 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid mepoh ethyl 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid etpoh methyl 3 4 5 trihydroxybenzoic acid mep oh 2 ethyl 3 4 5 trihydroxybenzoic acid etp oh 2 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid clphba 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid cl2phba methyl 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid clmep methyl 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid cl2mep ethyl 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid cletp and ethyl 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid cl2etp were purchased from sigma aldrich internal standards mep d4 etp d4 prp c13 bup d9 and phba d4 were all purchased from cambridge isotopes 2 2 instrumentation an acquity uplc waters corp milford ma usa coupled to a xevo tqs mass spectrometer was used for quantification of target products chromatographic separation was done using an aquity uplc beh c18 column 2 1 50 mm 1 7 Î¼m waters with an inject volume of 10 Î¼l and a flow rate of 300 Î¼l min the mobile phase consisted of a gradient of 0 01 formic acid and acetonitrile masslynx 4 1 micromass manchester uk software was used to process chromatographic data and targetlynx waters was used to generate calibration curves and quantify analyte concentrations in sample compound were analyzed in esi negative mode with both a quantifier ion and a qualifier ion fragmentation pattern accurate masses and resolution setup were determined by intellistart waters tables with gradient values instrument parameters and a list of quantifier qualifier ions were included as supplemental information 2 3 analyte determination and treatment process evaluation as a preliminary assessment to determine compounds of interest first effluent water samples were taken from two different wastewater treatment plants directly infused into a thermo orbitrap discovery mass spectrometer and detectable compounds were identified using a full scan with a mass range from 65 to 275 m z the analyte scan was limited to compounds that were expected based on compounds detected in influent reported in literature and on transformation products expected from each site s treatment process samples were then taken at each treatment step to further limit target compounds to those seen present during or after wastewater treatment and to reduce the possibility of false positive hits 500 ml samples were taken at influent at effluent and after each treatment step to determine which transformation products could potentially be released in wastewater effluent eight grab samples were taken at influent effluent and after each treatment step samples were taken based on retention time of water within the treatment process this sampling was repeated weekly for three weeks in august 2020 this was done to determine which compounds would be evaluated in the study compounds that were detected in 25 of samples at any treatment step were added to a list of compounds to be considered for analysis identified compounds with available standards were quantified in the seasonal analysis the full list of detected compounds is shown in table 1 the results of the preliminary assessment were only used to create a list of compounds of interest and not used in concentration calculations 2 4 seasonal sample collection and solid phase extraction paraben concentration profiles were evaluated at two treatment plants one using chlorination and another using uv disinfection water samples were collected in 500 ml amber glass bottles as 24 h composite samples composite samples were taken for influent and effluent samples each sample was spiked with 50 ng ml of each internal standard and filtered to remove solids samples were acidified to a ph of 3 using hydrochloric acid following filtration samples were extracted using with oasis hlb solid phase cartridges 6 cm3 200 mg which were conditioned using5 ml of a 1 1 methanol and water mixture after cartridge pretreatment samples were eluted at a rate of approximately 2 5 ml min over a vacuum after all the sample was filtered through the cartridges were left over a vacuum filter for thirty minutes to dry followed by elution with 5 ml of methanol the extract was then concentrated to approximately 1 ml in a nitrogen evaporator and diluted to 2 ml using methanol a 1 5 ml aliquot was then transferred to a glass vial and stored in a 20 c freezer until analysis in lcms 2 5 quality control method blanks were included to monitor possible contamination throughout the analysis concentration detected in method blanks were subtracted from all other samples method spikes were also run along with the samples and were used to standardize sample concentrations two method spikes and two method blanks were included and analyzed with every batch of samples n 16 all samples were spiked with internal standards before extraction in order to evaluate recovery products that have no internal standards but are similar in structure to internal standards of the parent compounds used recovery result from the closest parent compound a calibration curve was created using 8 to 10 calibration standards ranging in concentrations of 0 25 ng ml to 100 ng ml for most analytes and concentrations ranging from 2 5 ng ml to 1000 ng ml for phba and dhba a reference standard of 10 ng ml was used to automatically correct for shifts in retention time between runs 2 6 data analysis 2 6 1 compound comparisons molar ratios were used when comparing analyte concentrations the concentration of each transformation product was compared to determine which of the products have higher yearly concentrations concentration changes were calculated as the difference between effluent and influent concentrations the correlation between product formation and parent loss was evaluated to determine if the increase of transformation product concentration is correlated to the decrease in parent concentration 2 6 2 seasonal evaluation parabens and transformation products were evaluated for seasonal differences at each site seasonal concentrations were reported in picomolar pm units with variance reported as confidence intervals seasonal concentrations were plotted against each other to evaluate differences in seasonal intake and release seasonal changes in concentration between influent and effluent for each site were calculated to determine if decreases or increases in paraben and transformation product concentrations could be dependent on season 2 6 3 plant wise comparisons seasonal and average yearly influent and effluent concentrations were calculated at plant 1 and plant 2 concentrations at the two sites were compared to determine which of the treatment procedures resulted in greater transformation rates to do this percent change was calculated by determining change for each sample day and the changes were averaged to determine seasonal and yearly averages by treatment plant concentrations were plotted to make visual comparisons between the sites influent and effluent concentrations differences between influent and effluent were calculated to evaluated transformation 2 6 4 statistical analysis normality and homogeneity of variances were evaluated for non transformed data first to determine if the data meet the assumptions required to run anovas normality was evaluated using shapiro wilk s test where tests resulting in greater than a p value of 0 05 were determined to be normal bartlett s tests were used to evaluate homogeneity of variances where population variances were similar if test resulted in a p value above 0 05 as untransformed data did not meet the assumptions data were log transformed the transformed data was first evaluated for normality using shapiro wilk s tests followed by bartlett tests for homogeneity of variances as less than half the compounds met the assumptions of anova even after transformations non parametric tests were considered kruskal wallis tests were used to analyze differences followed by dunn tests maximum likelihood estimations mle were used to treat non detects before performing statistical analysis statistical analyses were done using microsoft excel 2016 r version 3 4 1 and sigma plot 12 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 analyte determination potential analytes were determined based on the study site s treatment setups fig 1 the average flow rate for treatment plant 1 is 20 million of gallons per day mgd while the average flow rate at treatment plant 2 is 1 8 mgd daily changes in flow rate would affect the retention time at each step during scoping trials parent parabens phba dhba and small amounts of chlorinated parabens were detected in influent at both treatment facilities transformation products detected at treatment plant 1 include dichlorinated products which are expected in effluent due to the use of chlorination chlorinated products were found in influent an average dichlorinated mep concentration of 0 78 pm 0 21 pm to 2 9 pm in local drinking water demonstrates that chlorinated parabens in drinking water could contribute to the concentrations seen in influent however the concentration of chlorinated parabens in drinking water are lower than what is quantified in wastewater influent results for specific parabens and paraben transformation products in tap water are included as supplemental information in table s11 chlorination of parabens from chlorine residues after drinking water treatment is possible however the residual chlorine concentrations in local drinking water are unlikely to be high enough to cause the concentration of chlorinated parabens seen in influent monochlorinated mep was detected in more than 80 of effluent samples at both treatment plants monochlorinated etp had only been detected in 20 of samples in the evaluated influent and effluent samples at both treatment plants however this was included for comparison to the dichlorinated form which was present in above 90 of effluent samples hydroxylated products were expected because of biotransformation from aerobic microbes during aeration however only the mono hydroxylated species were sufficiently detected being detected in above 50 of samples at plant 1 this could be due to the preferential formation of phba dhba phenol or hydroquinone during biodegradation phenol and hydroquinone were not included as potential products due to their use in industry and both are common products that could result from the transformation of a variety of natural compounds therefore increases in either phenol or hydroquinone would not be expected to show correlation with parent paraben transformation the main difference between the two treatment setups was the use of uv disinfection at treatment plant 2 instead of chlorinated plant 2 also include an anoxic unit which is a treatment process with little to no oxygen but does not include microbes and does not significantly affect paraben concentrations plant 2 had detectable amounts of both chlorinated and hydroxylated products in effluent which was expected due to the use of uv disinfection of the 18 identified transformation products table 1 only phba dhba mono and dichlorinated methyl paraben and dichlorinated ethyl paraben and mono hydroxylated methyl paraben and mono hydroxylated ethyl paraben had standards at the time of this study these and the five parent parabens were quantified in this study standards for four compounds including mono and dichlorinated phba became available after running samples these compounds were run but not in the controls results for the four extra compounds are included as supplemental information 3 2 seasonal analysis 3 2 1 treatment plant 1 seasonal analysis influent and effluent concentrations at plant 1 varied by season fig 2 phba had the highest concentration in influent p 0 001 and effluent p 0 01 with fall having the highest concentration of phba at 500 0 pm 270 0 pm to 930 pm in the influent effluent concentrations were similar across seasons p 0 14 among the parents mep was quantified at highest concentrations except during fall which had higher concentrations of prp in influent with fall prp concentrations of 73 pm 42 pm to 130 pm in influent p 0 01 and 4 1 pm 1 7 pm to 9 9 pm in effluent p 0 01 mep concentrations were highest in both influent and effluent during the spring at 140 pm 100 pm to 480 nm in influent p 0 01 and 26 pm in effluent p 0 01 of the transformation products cl2mep was present at the greatest concentrations with the highest concentrations being found during the spring the spring concentrations of cl2mep were highest in spring effluent p 0 01 at 40 pm 22 pm to 73 pm overall at treatment plant 1 summer had the lowest influent parent compound concentrations which is unexpected due to the expected increase in personal care product use in later spring and summer months however the area served by the treatment plant experiences a decrease in population over the summer months due to a high student population which could be a factor in the lower influent concentrations spring had the highest concentrations of parent product in influent which could be due to increased personal care product use spring also had the highest concentration of transformation products detected in effluent which is partly due to both the high parent concentrations in influent and high transformation rates fall had greater percent decreases of methyl ethyl and propyl paraben with decreases above 94 table 2 increases in bzp concentrations were seen in winter and summer p 0 04 these evaluated increases could be due to variation from methods and instrumental analyses as bzp was quantified in very low concentrations in both influent and effluent both bup and bzp have high variations in most seasons and are generally detected in very low concentrations in both influent and effluent mep had a smaller decrease in summer than in winter the reasons for this difference are undetermined summer had overall lower decreases in parent concentrations the lower transformation rate in the summer could be explained by high rainfall in summer with 3 inches in june 4 5 in july and 7 in august resulting in high flow rates and lower retention times percent changes also had higher variations in the summer which could be due to greater fluctuations in flow rate the high variation could also be due to lower influent concentrations for some compounds in the summer resulting in greater sensitivity to error the rainfall in fall was much lower with 0 94 inches in september 3 8 in october and 0 98 in november the concentration decreases in parent parabens are greater than the concentrations increase in transformation products which suggests that there are other transformation products produced from parabens that are not currently quantified as plant 1 uses chlorination the most common transformation products are dichlorinated paraben species however only the shorter chained dichlorinated parabens have standards the longer chained species are unaccounted for there are not any available standards for any transformation products of either butyl or benzyl paraben degradation products are also expected especially due to the use of aeration tanks while phba is the major degradation products of parabens phba saw decreases during treatment in multiple seasons this means that if parabens are being degraded into phba they are being further transformed after being degraded into phba potential pathways for phba transformation include chlorination into mono or dichlorinated phba hydroxylation into dhba further degradation into phenols and quinones are also possible and is more likely to occur via biodegradation by microbes during aeration of the transformation products dichlorinated parabens had the greatest increase after treatment at plant 1 table 3 cl2mep large percent change values in the spring and summer with a 2700 increase in spring and a 1200 increase in the summer however despite the noticeable larger average changes in both seasons there were no differences in cl2mep percent changes between seasons p 0 0833 the lack of differences suggests that the high percent changes during spring and summer are due to the large percent changes on certain days rather than high percent changes across the whole season cl2etp had a high percent change in the summer at 3100 as with dichlorinated mep the high change could be due to a few days with high percent change however with cl2etp percent changes between seasons were significantly different p 0 0366 percent changes in were notably different for mepoh p 0 01 phba p 0 01 and dhba p 0 01 across seasons mepoh only saw an average increase in the summer with an increase of 230 phba and dhba saw increases across multiple seasons with the highest increase for phba being in the summer at 160 and for dhba in the spring at 320 phba dhba and mepoh are potential transformation products in aeration meaning that these changes could stem from aeration perhaps low flow rates could have allowed sufficient treatment time for biodegradation into phba dhba and mepoh but the treatment time for chlorination was not long enough to transform them further this would not be the case for summer as higher flow rates were seen however etpoh did not follow the same trend as mepoh which could be due to the limited concentration of etp present during treatment or the generally lower transformation rates of etp when compared to mep 3 2 2 treatment plant 2 seasonal analysis seasonal differences at treatment plant 2 follow some of the same trends in treatment plant 1 fig 3 prp was highest during the fall months and is the parent compound detected in highest amounts during that season at 81 pm 40 pm to 170 pm in fall influent and is notably higher than all other seasons p 0 01 similarly phba concentrations was also higher numerically higher during the fall at 570 pm 250 pm to 1300 pm but were not significantly different than other seasons p 0 06 at treatment plant 2 other parent paraben concentrations were higher during the summer than the other seasons which does not match the trend seen at plant 1 this could be due to the plant location this site is in a nearby area to plant 1 the main difference is that this area is not as dependent on a student population however plant 2 would have experienced similar rainfall in the summer as plant 1 concentrations of dichlorinated species were higher in summer effluent p 0 001 with an average cl2mep concentration of 44 pm 24 pm to 54 pm in summer effluent mep and etp concentrations decreased after treatment during all seasons with decreases above 72 during all seasons table 4 however removal rates were not significantly different between seasons for any of the parents p 0 98 for mep p 0 15 for etp p 0 07 for prp p 0 49 for bup and p 0 85 cl2mep generally increased after treatment with differences in change between seasons p 0 01 increases in cl2mep range from 66 in the spring to 3800 in the winter and a decrease of 55 in the fall table 5 cl2etp increased in all seasons but no notable differences were seen between seasons p 0 25 percent change was similar across seasons for all hydroxylated products p 0 14 for mepoh p 0 41 for etpoh and p 0 81 for dhba phba concentration generally decreased due to treatment except during the summer with a percent change showing increase at 51 percent change values for phba were similar across seasons p 0 25 increases in dichlorinated products were expected due to parent paraben interactions with residual chlorine after excitation during uv disinfection however hydroxylated compounds were also expected both from the use of aeration and the use of uv disinfection the decreases in these compounds could be due to formation of other products such as further hydroxylated products phenol or hydroquinone however all of the transformation products had high variability in percent change data at plant 2 and some of the high percent change values could be affected by the high variability and low influent concentrations 3 3 plant wise comparisons 3 3 1 seasonal comparisons by treatment plant parent paraben influent concentrations were similar p 0 08 for mep p 0 43 for etp p 0 95 for prp p 0 09 for bup and p 0 36 for bzp between the two treatment plants during the winter fig 4 in winter effluents etp was the only parent paraben with concentrations that were different by plant p 0 01 of the transformation products phba was quantified in greatest concentrations winter influent concentrations of phba were determined to be similar but the effluent concentrations were different between the two plants p 0 01 phba concentrations were higher in plant 1 effluent meaning that either transformation from phba to other compounds is more likely at plant 1 or that plant 2 is forming more phba from parent compounds but that the phba is being transformed after transformation to phba is likely as phba is expected as a uv disinfection byproduct at plant 2 the transformation from parent paraben to phba would not be likely in chlorination at plant 1 though some phba can be produced in biodegradation at both sites the average concentration of phba at plant 1 effluent is 260 pm 160 pm to 420 pm and 27 pm 14 pm to 52 pm phba concentrations decreased after treatment in plant 2 but increased after treatment at plant 1 the increase in phba seen at plant 1 is odd given the decrease seen in other seasons especially since the same trend was not seen at plant 2 cl2mep concentrations increased at both plants and effluent concentrations were different between the two treatments during all seasons p values for all products are included as supplemental information though uv disinfection requires cleaner water with less suspended solids this treatment plant does not use an ultrafilter beforehand treatment could have been more effective if the influent was cleaner during specific months chlorination rates can also vary by month rates are often higher during warmer months up to 5 ppm this is due to chlorine and chloramine lasting longer in colder water the slower degradation could result in greater concentrations of chlorine being released in effluent spring influent concentrations were generally similar fig 5 the only parent compound that was significantly higher in plant 1 influent than plant 2 influent during the spring was prp p 0 01 mep was the parent compound quantified at the highest concentration with an average concentration of 140 pm 41 pm to 480 pm in plant 1 spring influent and 140 pm 55 pm to 330 pm in plant 2 influent fig 5 however the treatment setup did not notably effect mep removal as the effluent concentrations were similar p 0 21 transformation product concentrations in spring influent were similar at both plants phba p 0 02 and clmep p 0 01 were the only transformation products with noticeable differences in spring influent concentrations with higher clmep and phba concentrations at plant 1 influent dhba concentrations increased after treatment at both plants during the spring with a greater increase at plant 1 despite the increases in dhba treatment caused decreases in phba concentrations at both sites increases in dhba could be due to higher hydroxylation rates in the spring resulting in greater phba to dhba transformation rates increased degradation to phba followed by hydroxylation to dhba is another explanation for the observed increase summer influent mep p 0 01 and prp p 0 04 concentrations were higher at plant 2 fig 6 phba p 0 01 was found at greater concentration in plant 2 influent at an average concentration of 240 pm 100 pm to 410 pm cl2mep concentrations p 0 01 were higher in the plant 2 effluent in the summer with an average concentration of 37 pm 32 pm to 42 pm at plant 1 and 44 pm 20 pm to 97 pm at plant 2 variation in cl2mep concentrations was much higher in plant 2 effluent summer is the only season where cl2mep effluent concentrations were higher at plant 2 than at plant 1 phba concentrations increased after treatment at both sites during the summer phba influent p 0 01 and effluent p 0 03 concentrations were higher at plant 2 during the summer however variations in phba concentrations were high in effluents at both plants the varying phba concentrations in plant 2 effluent could represent inconsistent outputs of phba in effluent at that site a cause of the increase seen at both plants could be the transformation of parabens into phba as all parabens share phba as a common degradation product longer biodegradation or uv disinfection treatments in the summer are unlikely to be the cause due to higher flow rates however for phba concentrations to increase further transformations cannot occur and the high flow rates may decrease further transformations phba transformations include chlorinated phba species and degradation into phenols quinone or dhba prp concentrations were higher in influent at both plants during the fall than during any other season but concentrations were similar between plant influents p 0 12 fig 7 prp concentrations decreased after treatment at both treatment plants but were found to be similar in fall effluent between plants p 0 47 prp being high in the influent of both sites means there would have been a higher use of prp or more waste containing prp during the fall months that would have increased concentrations found in influent expected prp transformation products include dichlorinated prp and different forms of hydroxylated prp many of which do not have standards and are not currently quantified common prp degradation products include phba dhba and further degradation into quinones and phenols mono chlorinated prp and trihydroxylated prp have standards that are now available but were not obtained before the end of this study phba was also detected in higher concentrations during the fall in influent at both plants the phba concentrations quantified were similar between the plants with an average concentration of 500 pm 270 pm to 930 at plant 1 influent and 570 pm 250 pm to 1300 pm at plant 2 influent p 0 55 fall effluent concentrations were also similar at both plants with an average concentration of 110 pm 58 pm to 210 pm at plant 1 and 160 pm 77 pm to 150 pm at plant 2 p 0 54 3 3 2 yearly comparisons by plant yearly parent paraben concentrations were generally similar at plant 1 and plant 2 fig 8 the only parent compound found to be significantly different between the plants was bup p 0 02for influent and p 0 01 for effluent while the parent paraben concentrations were similar between the two sites transformation product concentrations were found to vary by plant dhba concentrations were greater in plant 2 influent p 0 01 the average yearly concentration of dhba at plant 1 influent was 46 pm 31 pm to 69 pm and 120 pm 79 pm to 190 pm effluent dhba concentrations were similar p 0 13 between the two plants with an average concentration of 100 pm 79 pm to 130 pm at plant 1 and 88 pm 64 pm to 120pm at plant 2 while dhba concentrations were different between influents phba concentrations were similar in both influent p 0 52 and effluent p 0 05 between the two sites cl2mep was higher at plant 1 in both influent p 0 01 and effluent p 0 01 however cl2etp concentrations were similar between the two plants in both influent p 0 20 and effluent p 0 52 decreases in parent compound concentrations from treatment were similar between the two plants table 6 meaning that the treatment setup did not significantly affect yearly parent paraben removal rates longer chained parabens had lower removal rates than shorter chained parents at both sites however variation was higher for the longer chained parents longer chained parabens such as bzp are expected to have lower decreases however increases are not expected unless bzp is being introduced from an outside source it is more likely that the observed increases seen during certain seasons are due to a combination of the relatively low influent and effluent bzp concentrations and random variation the cl2mep and etp were the only compound that increased in concentration after treatment at both treatment plants table 7 cl2etp was expected to be present in higher concentrations in effluent at plant 1 due to the use of chlorination however differences in etp concentration changes between the two plants were not significant with a p value of 0 101 meaning that treatment did not have a great effect of transformation into etp this could be due to the limited amount of etp in influent cl2mep concentration increase was higher at plant 1 p 0 02 all other transformation products had overall higher concentration in influent than effluent at both sites phba had lower removal rates than parent compounds matching previous findings that phba is more resistant to treatment than the parents ma et al 2021 wang and kannan 2016 karthikraj et al 2017 though other transformation products seem to have increased at plant 1 while decreasing at plant 2 the only other compound found to have different transformation rates between plants is dhba with an increase at plant 1 and decrease at plant 2 p 0 01 the difference is unexpected as both plants use similar biodegradation steps the higher positive percent changes at plant 1 for mepoh and phba is due to higher percent changes on specific days and during certain seasons 3 4 product comparisons molar concentration pm of parent parabens table 8 and transformation products table 9 were compared butyl and benzyl parabens were present at much lower concentrations than any of the shorter chained parabens in either influent or effluent at both plants mep was generally found in higher concentrations than ethyl or prp in plant 1 influent mep prp p 0 02 etp mep p 0 01 and higher than prp in plant 2 influent mep prp p 0 01 though in lower concentration than mep or prp etp concentrations are higher than expected due to the low use of etp in products etp concentrations are expected to be very low closer to bup concentrations the etp concentrations in this study are more comparable to mep and prp with an etp mep molar ratio of 0 17 in plant 1 influent and 0 23 in plant 2 influent phba concentrations were higher than any other product mep was the compound with the next highest concentration with similar concentration in influent mep phba p 1 at plant 1 and plant 2 but phba was higher than mep in effluent at plant 2 mep phba p 1 at plant 1 and p 0 01 at plant 2 the molar ratios between phba and mep are 2 7 for plant 1 influent 27 for plant 1 effluent 2 3 for plant 2 influent and 18for plant 2 effluent the higher ratios for effluent show that phba removal was lower than that of mep however this could also be due to some transformation into phba rather than just lower transformation of phba cl2mep was the chlorinated disinfection byproduct quantified in greatest concentrations in effluent molar ratios between cl2mep and mep were 0 04 in plant 1 influent 3 1 in plant 1 effluent 0 02in plant 2 influent and 0 81 in plant 2 effluent ratios between dichlorinated mep and mep showed increasing abundance of cl2mep at both plants though only in plant 1 effluent were the concentrations of cl2mep higher than the concentrations of mep mep cl2mep p 0 01 for plant1 effluent and p 1 for plant 2 effluent the two dichlorinated disinfection byproducts cl2mep and cl2etp were the only compounds seen to increase after treatment at both plants correlations between the increase in the dichlorinated species and decreases in their respective parent compounds were evaluated to see if the formation of these transformation products are directly related to the transformation of the parents by evaluating pearson correlation coefficients there were no notable correlations between the mep or etp and their respective dichlorinated transformation products cl2mep and cl2etp at either plant 1 or plant 2 with all the r squared values being below 0 1 meaning that much of the decrease in mep and etp concentrations are not attributed to transformation into dichlorinated mep and dichlorinated etp the plots showing correlation between the parent parabens and dichlorinated disinfection products are included as supplemental information this can also be seen with the determined concentration changes the concentration decrease in methyl and ethyl parabens are much higher than the concentration increases in dichlorinated mep and dichlorinated etp meaning that there are other pathways by which the parent compounds are being removed the most likely pathway being transformation to other unidentified compounds degradation of mep and etp to phba and then further transformation into mono and dichlorinated phba dhba phenols or quinones are other potential transformation products that could attribute to the observed mep and etp decreases 4 conclusions seasonal concentration of parabens and paraben transformation products were evaluated in influent and effluent at two different wastewater treatment plants in texas chlorinated disinfection byproducts are an important factor in both types of treatment release of the dichlorinated species in river water needs to be evaluated plant 1 had overall greater paraben transformation rates but plant 2 had higher rates of dichlorinated transformation product formation the higher transformation rates at plant 1 as well as the lack of correlations between change in parent product and change in transformation product indicates that plant 1 released higher concentrations of unidentified transformation products potential transformation products include phenols and quinones which are paraben transformation products expected during biodegradation in aeration however due to the high production of phenols and quinones and their potential to be transformation products of many compounds they would not be directly correlatable to paraben transformation due to the high concentrations of phba and dhba in influent and effluent concentrations of chlorinated phba and dhba should be evaluated future research should focus on identifying and quantifying other transformation product that could explain the large removal of parent products these compounds will be important factors in evaluating the effect of effluent discharge into surface water and studies involving environmental effects of these other products research could also be geared towards determining which treatment setups would be more likely to result

14866,quantitative estimation for tracking the transport of various nitrate sources is required to effectively manage nitrate loading in complex river systems in this study we validated an integrated framework using field isotopic data Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 of nitrates and hydrological modeling hydrological simulation program fortran hspf to determine anthropogenic nitrate flux among different land use types within a watershed nitrate isotopic compositions showed different ranges among four land use types 4 9 to 15 5 for Î´15nno3 4 9 to 12 1 for Î´18ono3 reflecting the different nitrate sources sewage synthetic fertilizer effluent and soil within watersheds based on the integration of hspf modeling we also found that total nitrate loads might be partially controlled by hydrological conditions such as water discharge 12 040 3 22 793 2 l s from upstream to downstream among the nitrate sources the sewage transport showed unique enhancement near urban boundaries along with an increase in total nitrate load 193 5 no3 n g s km2 in downstream areas in addition the isotopic and model based nitrate fluxes showed good correlation for urban sources r2 0 73 p 0 05 but poor correlations for agriculture dominated land use r2 0 13 p 0 05 reflecting the potential influence of surface runoff and ground infiltration into the watershed consequently this research provided useful information to establish nitrogen management policy controlling point and non point nitrate source loads in various land use types for the restoration of water quality and aquatic ecosystem in the complex river system considering the recent increase in human activities near aquatic environments this framework would be effective for individually estimating the quantitative contributions of

sewage and feces discharging into river systems has recently become a critical environmental problem in terms of water quality and biodiversity kendall and mcdonnell 1998 dobermann and cassman 2005 erisman et al 2013 anthropogenic inputs derived from non point point sources such as agriculture livestock and wastewater treatment plants wwtps may be responsible for the increasing annual nitrate export about 40 70 tg n yr into river systems peed et al 2011 in this situation this excessive amount of nitrate 45 mg l in the surface water causes both the eutrophication and hypoxia of water bodies and is a direct threat to human health galloway et al 2004 lu et al 2015 therefore the systematic tracking of various nitrogen sources would be required for effectively managing nitrate loading in complex river systems as nitrate is highly mobile and primarily originates from non point source pollution kreitler 1979 kendall and aravena 2000 zhang et al 2014 romanelli et al 2020 it is distributed across a wide area through various surface and groundwater flow paths and it can be difficult to trace the sources kaushal et al 2011 in this regard nitrogen and oxygen isotopic values of nitrate Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 have unique isotopic compositions for different source origins and biological transformations liu et al 2017 yu et al 2020 based on these different isotopic signatures the origins of various nitrate have been effectively estimated for source appointment and transformation nitrification denitrification in river systems walters et al 2015 bardhan et al 2017 yang et al 2017 however with respect to the quantitative estimation of nitrate sources the overprinting of specific nitrate end members may have a quantitative limitation by causing over under estimation of nitrate sources supplied into complex land use types hydrological model has been widely applied for estimating watershed scale hydrologic conditions and broad pollutant loadings derived from non point

types within extensive river catchment borah and bera 2004 patil et al 2012 wellen et al 2015 among them hspf has often been regarded as an effective hydrological model that can simulate nitrate flux depending on its transportation and biogeochemical cycle with temporal variations donigian and rao 1990 duda et al 2012 actually simulated nitrate fluxes have been applied for estimating the total riverine nitrate budget according to the land use type dependent hydrological and chemical characteristics li et al 2017 however the lack of monitoring data may hamper precise estimation of various nitrate fluxes in complex watersheds in terms of the calibration and validation of hydrological models chen et al 2014 to compensate for the limitations of the two techniques i e isotopic techniques and hydrological model simulation an integrated framework combining the individual advantages of both methods can be proposed for enhancing the precision of assessments of the quantitative loadings of nitrate sources into complex aquatic systems in this study we established an integrated approach for estimating the quantitative nitrate contributions in complex river catchments like the geumho river system where various land use types are present to validate this approach our main strategies were to 1 identify the origins of nitrate sources using dual isotopic compositions Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 2 determine spatial variations of nitrate fluxes derived from a hydrological model we intended to determine quantitative inputs of nitrate sources transported into the river system based on the cross validation and integration between these independent two complementary methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 site information the geumho river drainage area 2053 km2 length 116 km is a major stream

after validation the nitrate flux of each sample site was simulated based on constructed model parameters 2 7 nitrate source contribution flux and load estimation 2 7 1 nitrate source end member selection in this study c2 and c3 forest sites show the heaviest Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 isotope signatures considering vertical profile of nitrogen in the soil layer n transformation processes ammonification nitrification and denitrification could be activated through surface water infiltration to groundwater most forest streams are recharged by groundwater discharge as a base flow winter 2007 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 rumsey et al 2015 in this situation the decreased nitrate concentration through denitrification may enrich the dual isotopic composition in forest gundersen et al 2006 sudduth et al 2013 jacob et al 2016 in this regard the denitrification with limited n supply could result in relatively low nitrate concentration and significantly heavier isotopic composition in c2 and c3 sites for three wwtp end members both isotope values at one site w2 were close to the those at mainstream sites compared to two other wwtp sites w1 and w3 which showed lighter isotope values even though n related dissolved species don no2 n no3 n and nh4 n indicated significantly higher concentrations generally the heavier isotopes of nitrogen and oxygen can be depleted through the ammonification and nitrification that occurred during the treatment process lee et al 2016 schmidt et al 2016 saito et al 2018 meanwhile denitrification for the reduction of nitrate concentration in wwtps result in an increase in isotope ratios tchobanoglus et al 2003 galloway et al 2004 thus sewage treatment processes at two wwtps w1 and w3 might be different from w2 input sewage composition also may affect nitrate dual isotopic ratios in the effluents of wwtps in fact the largest wastewater treatment facility in daegu a metropolitan city is located near w2 demonstrating relatively heavier isotopic signatures caused by nitrogen treatment processes i e ammonium volatilization and denitrification in this regard nitrate isotopes values at w2 may represent the effluent of wwtps near urban areas and the end member of wwtp was used as average isotope values among three wwtps in this study for the end members of the urban source referred to both isotope values e g sewage values of Î´15nno3 2 7 0 4 Î´18ono3 28 5 47 9 and road dust values of Î´15nno3 5 8 6 2 Î´18ono3 6 1 27 6 reported in previous studies kojima et al 2011 pennino et al 2016 archana et al 2018 dual isotopic signatures at the urban tributary c5 indicate much lighter Î´18ono3 and slightly heavier Î´15nno3 in this study a mixture of sewage and road dust discharged into river water through a storm pipeline with heavy rain might make this specific urban nitrate signature meanwhile the lighter isotopic compositions of no3 n at agriculture site c1 may reflect the significant contribution of nh4 fertilizer i e ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate which is chemically produced through the haber bosch process yang and gruber 2016 torres et al 2020 in practice ammonium fertilizer showed lighter isotopic ranges of no3 n Î´15nno3 4 2 0 2 Î´18ono3 5 7 1 7 zhang et al 2018 chen et al 2020 compared to those of nitrate fertilizer 2 7 2 bayesian mixing model based on the isotopic variations Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 at river water samples the proportional contributions of nitrate sources were estimated using bayesian stable isotope mixing models bayesian mixing model in r mixsiar version 3 1 10 stock et al 2018 considering the nitrate budget within the mainstream river is often controlled by surrounding tributaries with diverse land use types li et al 2019 xu et al 2021 Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 values measured at mainstream water samples were assigned as mixtures and the tributary water samples were assigned as sources for isotopic source end member total 6 3 3 and 9 data were used for forest urban agriculture and wwtp end members respectively table 2 alongside the mixing model application the microbial denitrification effect was compared using a 1 1 2 1 relationship between Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 which were fractionated during denitrification kendall et al 2007 divers et al 2014 however considering there was no significant signature of in situ denitrification processes at the surface water in mainstream sites therefore the fractionation factor was not considered in the mixsiar hu et al 2021 cai et al 2022 to validate the accuracy of mixsiar model construction geweke diagnostic 5 of result to be outside 1 96 result in the mixsiar model was confirmed bayesian mixing model in r mixsiar version 3 1 10 stock et al 2018 also uncertainty of each source contribution at each site was denoted as standardization supplementary information table s3 and s6 2 7 3 hydrological model simulation and nitrate flux and loads estimation referred to previous studies the different nitrate loads exported from land use types including wwtp were estimated using the specific area and nitrate loads of each sub catchment within mainstream sites oliveira et al 2016 cui et al 2020 it was assumed that nitrate loads of mainstream sites k1 k11 within the geumho river were the sum of nitrate loads derived from each land use type presented in the sub catchment further the difference between simulated nitrate loads of mainstream sites and the sum of nitrate loads from each land use type were attributed to the contributions of wwtps and upstream sites river borne after simulation of the total nitrate load of each mainstream site the influence of infiltration and groundwater contribution to each land use type was estimated by independent simulations of surfaces interflow and active groundwater flow duda et al 2012 for nitrate flux no3 n g s calculation the simulated water discharge rate at each mainstream site was multiplied with measured nitrate concentration based on total nitrate flux source specific nitrate flux was estimated by multiplying proportional source contribution evaluated by mixsiar and hspf similar to nitrate flux source specific nitrate loads were calculated by multiplying the simulated total nitrate load at each mainstream site with proportional source contribution based on mixsiar and hspf 3 results 3 1 spatial distributions of hydrochemical

properties of various land use types in complex river catchment the spatial variations of poc chl a dtn and din concentrations in mainstream sites were separately evaluated between upstream k1 to k5 and downstream sites k6 to k11 p 0 05 for poc and chl a p 0 1 for dtn and din fig 2 pca results also showed that these parameters discriminated wwtps from other land use types supplementary information fig s2 generally the distinct patterns of water physico chemical parameters e g temperature din dtn don sulfate and chloride may be related to increased inputs of untreated sewage and wwtp effluents xian et al 2016 adebowale et al 2019 among them the increased abundances of n related nutrients and chloride can originate from feces and manure near urban areas agriculture and livestock thayalakumaran et al 2008 zendehbad et al 2019 chen et al 2020 furthermore a high abundance of sulfate near wwtp can be related to the usage of sodium sulfate as a catalyst in dye industries w3 site kaown et al 2009 he et al 2011 oktem et al 2019 for poc abundance their spatial variations have been often used as typical examples that reflect the total export of various poc sources such as terrestrial plants algae bacteria and other contaminants within aquatic organic matter pools hossler and bauer 2013 lee et al 2021 in this regard chl a variations showed a positive correlation with the poc profiles rho 0 79 p 0 01 reflecting the most dominant contribution of algae derived poc caused by more nutrients supplied near wwtps and urban areas in addition quantitative source specific lipid biomarker fluxes indicated most of poc source would be identified by algal derived poc including fresh and or refractory portion lee et al 2021 in such conditions spatial distributions of dtn showed increased abundance near wwtps and urban areas compared to those of pn fig 2 dominant abundances of din may account for increased proportions within n related nutrients from upstream to downstream with respect to wwtp operation dissolved n concentration may be influenced by the wwtp treatment process i e primary processes are physical settling secondary processes are filtering and biological treatment and tertiary processes are uv and chemical treatment lee et al 2016 schmidt et al 2016 saito et al 2018 the basic type of treatment process may reflect insufficient n removal kim et al 2008 jia et al 2016 and high concentrations of din i e no3 n and nh4 n near wwtp sites as point source may be related to the increased contribution of untreated input sewage exported into the river system as an aspect of the potential contribution of n related nutrients via non point sources various n sources may be heterogeneously exported from different land use types e g urban agriculture and forest the distinct pca patterns show that increased din at urban c5 k7 and k9 and agriculture c1 sites might be associated with dominant contributions of anthropogenic activities e g urban sewage septic waste and fertilizer gundersen et al 2006 sudduth et al 2013 torres et al 2020 in contrast to the dominance of natural n sources e g soil nitrogen leaf leachate and precipitation at c2 c3 and c4 sites actually n related nutrients derived from both origins may enhance the nitrate export directly via surface water as well as ground water flow clark and fritz 1997 widory et al 2005 kaown et al 2009 walters et al 2015 archana et al 2018 merchÃ¡n et al 2020 under this condition the source tracing of each n related nutrient transported via various complex land use types is still challenging for precisely determining each contribution between natural and anthropogenic sources in addition riverine nitrate concentrations would be influenced by basal geochemical environments barros et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 knapp et al 2020 thus with respect to the source appointment of nitrate a complementary approach is necessary to effectively estimate the different contributions of nitrate sources within a complex river system 4 2 nitrate source identification in mainstream river water using dual isotope ratio the stable isotope approach Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 is often used for nitrate source appointments transported into a complex river system palmer et al 2007 puig et al 2013 stuart et al 2010 the Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 values determined at the geumho river seem to be the results of mixed contributions of manure sewage soil n and nh4 related fertilizer based on the different isotopic ranges of various end members fig 3 and supplementary information table s1 in this study nitrate sources in mainstream sites were calculated using mixsiar based on four source end members urban forest agriculture and wwtp the end member of each nitrate source was based on Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 values measured at five tributary sites and three wwtp effluents since each tributary site could represent typical isotope values of nitrate sources derived from dominant land use types in the geum river catchment except for c4 forest site which might be affected by the mixed nitrate from the mainstream of the geumho river estimated four nitrate source contribution represented various ranges from 11 to 86 36 20 for urban from 6 to 64 43 16 for forest from 2 to 21 9 6 for agriculture and from 3 to 30 12 8 for wwtp supplementary information table s3 together with the ubiquitous contribution of the forest for the geumho river 43 16 except k7 6 the proportion of anthropogenic no3 n sources e g urban and wwtp effluent significantly increased at downstream sites k7 k9 and k10 fig 4 the urban contribution 86 appears to be massively transported through the tributary c5 near the k7 site where there was intensive urban activity lee et al 2021 in addition the increased contribution of wwtp effluent at k10 30 may be related to the substantial export of n related nutrients the contribution of nitrate derived from agriculture was relatively small except for the relatively higher contribution at k10 21 and k2 17 these mixsiar results suggest that the nitrate sources at mainstream sites should be influenced by the relatively dominant land use type through the tributary of the sub catchment surrounding the geumho river spearman rank correlation analysis of estimated nitrate sources proportion represented a significant correlation between urban and agriculture rho 0 64 p 0 05 although correlation represented insignificant results urban and forest also showed negative results rho 0 48 p 0 1 these negative correlations between land use type nitrate sources were also identified in the correlation between the proportional area of urban agriculture rho 0 68 p 0 05 and forest rho 0 72 p 0 05 similar correlation results in the nitrate source contribution and proportional area indicated watershed area of each land use type might control the quantity of nitrate inflow and budget in the river catchment in this regard for precise estimation of quantitative nitrate inflow and budget in the river system the hydrological character of the river catchment such as water discharge and watershed area needs to be considered 4 3 nitrate loads based on the integrated approach of isotope and hydrological model spatial variation of no3 n sources may be influenced by water discharge in the catchment area which affects the nitrate budget of waterbodies chuman et al 2013 rothwell et al 2010 thus water discharge in each sub catchment area may be an important factor for controlling quantitative nitrate exports to evaluate the water discharge effect we first integrated the lipid biomarker concentration and water discharge which are regarded as possible environmental parameters lee et al 2021 based on the spatio temporal variation of water discharge simulated via the hspf model supplementary information fig s3 the estimated water discharge continuously increased from upstream to downstream fig 5 generally the variation of water discharges can potentially be controlled by diverse ambient parameters such as precipitation inflow rate and morphological characteristics of the stream wetzel and likens 2000 duda et al 2012 higashino and stefan 2019 chai et al 2020 with respect to the increased downstream boundary including catchments and tributary k7 to k10 within the geumho river the physical factors e g morphological characteristics and inflow are responsible for enhancing water discharge downstream piao et al 2007 luthy et al 2015 as shown in fig 5 total nitrate flux also showed an increasing pattern from upstream 25 0 5 9 no3 n g s k1 to k6 to downstream 63 7 27 7 no3 n g s k7 to k11 however relatively higher nitrate fluxes at k2 k3 k7 and k9 sites seem to be related to the increased nitrate concentration of input tributaries c1 and c5 and wwtp effluents w1 w2 and w3 as compared to the increasing downstream pattern of water discharge especially at the k7 site nitrate flux increased to an extremely high value 108 6 no3 n g s due to high nitrate concentration in a nearby tributary and the wwtp c5 and w2 sites intensive human activities in these sites agriculture c1 urban area c5 and wwtp w1 to w3 exported a large amount of nitrate which likely led to the increase in nitrate flux in the mainstream river water supplementary information fig s4 this result suggests that surrounding land use type influence point and non point nitrate fluxes as well as their sources in the mainstream river hydrological model approaches indicated each nitrate source flux from various land use types truly controlled the nitrate budget in the mainstream river which is as an independent result from mixsiar in this study specific nitrate sources of land use types agriculture forest urban and wwtp were estimated by hspf fig 5a and mixsiar fig 5b based on total nitrate fluxes both hspf based and mixsiar based nitrate fluxes were compared for each land use type showing a generally positive correlation between the fluxes fig 6 however few significant correlations between the results of both approaches forest r2 0 61 p 0 05 agriculture r2 0 20 p 0 05 wwtp r2 0 51 p 0 05 are found except for urban r2 0 97 p 0 05 these differences between hspf based and mixsiar based nitrate fluxes may be ascribed to the nitrate inflow from groundwater river borne discharge collected river water both tributary and mainstream samples were a mixture of surface and groundwater caused by hydraulic connection in this condition river nitrate dual isotopic composition may be partially affected by groundwater nitrate which could alter the nitrate isotopic signature of river water and initial source end members in this study the mixsiar did not include the nitrate isotope information of absolute groundwater and nitrate discharge from groundwater was not involved in the nitrate flux based on the current mixsiar in this regard water discharge of river borne nitrate was determined by the hspf model and nitrate load no3 n g s km2 was also calculated by the area of land use type and nitrate flux in the mainstream river catchment to estimate the contribution of river borne nitrate in mixsiar river borne nitrate isotope end member was calculated using an isotopic mass balance equation including five land use types urban forest agriculture wwtp and river borne based on the results of hspf supplementary information and table s4 as a result the average dual isotopic compositions of river borne nitrate were 8 0 9 0 for Î´15nno3 and 6 3 16 9 for Î´18ono3 with a range of the values from 4 5 to 17 5 for Î´15nno3 and 37 4 to 12 4 for Î´18ono3 along the mainstream of the geumho river supplementary information table s4 these isotopic ranges of river borne nitrate may be similar to those of other regional systems such as surface and groundwater systems in agricultural areas in the usa and korea e g kaown et al 2009 martinelli et al 2018 suchy et al 2018 jung et al 2020 the source contribution derived from river borne nitrate in mixsiar was relatively smaller 5 than those in hspf 7 32 as shown in fig 7 supplementary information table s5 the difference in river borne nitrate source contribution based on mixsiar and hspf might derive from two reasons first the stable isotopic composition of river borne nitrate may be altered during transportation by the impact of n transformation processes e g nitrification and denitrification in this situation variation of endmember isotopic composition may induce an over and underestimation of river borne source contribution second limited consideration of the n removal process e g denitrification in the hspf may cause an overestimation of river borne nitrate source contribution as an integrated approach each nitrate source contribution to total loads was based on mixsiar and substantial proportions of anthropogenic sources e g urban and wwtp increased while going downstream along the guemho river k7 to k11 83 4 170 3 g s km2 which was different from the hspf based result in fig 7 after accounting for urban tributary c5 inflow the contribution of urban significantly increased in the k7 site urban flux 160 6 no3 n g s km2 the substantial increase in nitrate loads may be influenced through point sources e g wwtp effluent as well as non point sources e g surface runoff and water sewage pipeline due to increased anthropogenic boundaries i e urban and industrial complexes actually the increase in anthropogenic nitrate loads within the geumho river was comparable to those of other large watershed systems such as agriculture derived nitrate flux in the oak creek watershed poor and mcdonnell 2007 sewage export in the nine mile run watershed divers et al 2014 sewage leaks in the dead run watershed duncan et al 2017 and anthropogenic nitrate export in the xijiang river and chengdu li et al 2019 ding et al 2021 even though the extent of the anthropogenic activity related boundaries within the geumho river was smaller than those of other systems excessive export of nitrate appears to play a critical role in water quality deterioration in river catchments the present results from an integrated approach suggest that non point anthropogenic nitrate inflow specifically derived from urban and industrial areas should provide substantially higher contributions to the nitrate budget in the complex river catchment on the other hand nitrate loads of different land use types were compared in terms of mixsiar and hspf results as shown in fig 8 the loads calculated from two different methods showed significant correlations with each other for urban r2 0 73 p 0 05 forest r2 0 76 p 0 05 and wwtp r2 0 80 p 0 05 but not for agriculture r2 0 13 p 0 05 as compared to the cases that did not consider river borne sources only one correlation for urban meanwhile the correlation from agriculture sources still showed an insignificant correlation reflecting the potential input of a mobilizable subsurface nitrate within the mainstream of the geumho river in this study mobilizable subsurface nitrate indicates a kind of mineralized nitrogen in the soil layer of agricultural area through the estimation of river borne nitrate groundwater source contribution only the agriculture area showed a weak correlation this result may propose possible contribution of organic fertilizer heavier nitrate isotope as another nitrate source or activated n transformation e g denitrification process in agricultural area frequent usage of synthetic fertilizer may enhance the nitrate diffusion into soil layers which can cause increased infiltration of fertilizer derived nitrate into groundwater jain et al 2019 kourakos et al 2012 in such conditions the isotopic signatures derived from anthropogenic nitrate may be displaced by the simultaneous occurrence of substantial nitrogen transformation between the soil layer and groundwater martinelli et al 2018 hu et al 2019 huang et al 2017 bourke et al 2019 kaushal et al 2022 these processes could lead to the underestimated contribution of the synthetic fertilizer derived nitrate within the geumho river in contrast to the heavier isotopic values of nitrate in agriculture 4 4 implication of the integrated approach and its further possible development our integrated approaches may provide a reliable and practical tool for estimating the individual contributions of non point sources surface runoff and groundwater infiltration involved in anthropogenic activities to effectively manage the increased anthropogenic nitrate sources table 3 although both methods mixsiar and hspf show advantages in specifying the source appointment and the hydrological fate of nitrate in the river system respectively the exclusive application of each approach may have be limited in quantitative estimation of nitrate export into complex river systems meier augenstein and kemp 2012 gao and li 2014 tavakoly et al 2019 to resolve these limitations we propose stepwise cross checking approach by complementary methods as shown in fig 9 to date no single approach is available to effectively evaluate the specific nitrate source flux and load in river catchment worldwide because critical errors may occur by simplifying assumptions and omitted parameters e g microbial processes and hydrological factors furthermore it is difficult to directly compare nitrate loads derived from various land use types in one river catchment in this study the integrated approach basically includes comparing mixsiar with hspf a step wise approach is followed by combining the contribution of each nitrate source based on isotopic signature with total nitrate loads of multiple land use types from hspf in complex river system the integration of both approaches provides a new insight to trace various nitrate sources through compensating each method showing quantitative contribution of source specific nitrate loads according to land use types in addition all obvious factors associated with nitrate flux e g groundwater diffusion rate and quantification of microbial nitrogen transformation processes should be considered in future studies particularly seasonal sampling over longer periods would be beneficial to capture the spatial temporal variability based on our proposed framework thus this approach can be applied for the precise estimation of nitrate load with temporal and spatial distributions according to various land use types and it can be helpful for making practical government policies for sustainable river water quality management and preservation 5 conclusion for quantitative estimation and management of nitrate flux in complex river catchments the origin and transport of anthropogenic nitrate into the geumho river were determined using stable isotopes and hydrological model approaches first nitrate isotopic composition of the river water was used to evaluate discriminative contributions of various nitrate sources urban sewage forest soil n agricultural synthetic fertilizer and wwtp effluent in addition mixsiar results showed enhanced contributions of anthropogenic sources in the downstream area with denser urban populations secondly hspf results showed increasing water discharge and total nitrate flux along downstream compared with hspf based nitrate fluxes mixsiar based results indicated that anthropogenic nitrate sources were substantially increased along downstream together with the effect of wwtp effluents as a point source we inferred that a large amount of synthetic fertilizer for agriculture may be transported via groundwater infiltration as non point sources thus our integrated approach provides important evidence for substantial increases in anthropogenic sources based on enhancing river nitrate budget and flux consequently the integrated approach should be useful and has implications for estimating quantitative contributions of natural and anthropogenic nitrate

sources sewage synthetic fertilizer effluent and soil within watersheds based on the integration of hspf modeling we also found that total nitrate loads might be partially controlled by hydrological conditions such as water discharge 12 040 3 22 793 2 l s from upstream to downstream among the nitrate sources the sewage transport showed unique enhancement near urban boundaries along with an increase in total nitrate load 193 5 no3 n g s km2 in downstream areas in addition the isotopic and model based nitrate fluxes showed good correlation for urban sources r2 0 73 p 0 05 but poor correlations for agriculture dominated land use r2 0 13 p 0 05 reflecting the potential influence of surface runoff and ground infiltration into the watershed consequently this research provided useful information to establish nitrogen management policy controlling point and non point nitrate source loads in various land use types for the restoration of water quality and aquatic ecosystem in the complex river system considering the recent increase in human activities near aquatic environments this framework would be effective for individually estimating the quantitative contributions of

erisman et al 2013 anthropogenic inputs derived from non point point sources such as agriculture livestock and wastewater treatment plants wwtps may be responsible for the increasing annual nitrate export about 40 70 tg n yr into river systems peed et al 2011 in this situation this excessive amount of nitrate 45 mg l in the surface water causes both the eutrophication and hypoxia of water bodies and is a direct threat to human health galloway et al 2004 lu et al 2015 therefore the systematic tracking of various nitrogen sources would be required for effectively managing nitrate loading in complex river systems as nitrate is highly mobile and primarily originates from non point source pollution kreitler 1979 kendall and aravena 2000 zhang et al 2014 romanelli et al 2020 it is distributed across a wide area through various surface and groundwater flow paths and it can be difficult to trace the sources kaushal et al 2011 in this regard nitrogen and oxygen isotopic values of nitrate Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 have unique isotopic compositions for different source origins and biological transformations liu et al 2017 yu et al 2020 based on these different isotopic signatures the origins of various nitrate have been effectively estimated for source appointment and transformation nitrification denitrification in river systems walters et al 2015 bardhan et al 2017 yang et al

riverine nitrate budget according to the land use type dependent hydrological and chemical characteristics li et al 2017 however the lack of monitoring data may hamper precise estimation of various nitrate fluxes in complex watersheds in terms of the calibration and validation of hydrological models chen et al 2014 to compensate for the limitations of the two techniques i e isotopic techniques and hydrological model simulation an integrated framework combining the individual advantages of both methods can be proposed for enhancing the precision of assessments of the quantitative loadings of nitrate sources into complex aquatic systems in this study we established an integrated approach for estimating the quantitative nitrate contributions in complex river catchments like the geumho river

selection in this study c2 and c3 forest sites show the heaviest Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 isotope signatures considering vertical profile of nitrogen in the soil layer n transformation processes ammonification nitrification and denitrification could be activated through surface water infiltration to groundwater most forest streams are recharged by groundwater discharge as a base flow winter 2007 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 rumsey et al 2015 in this situation the decreased nitrate concentration through denitrification may enrich the dual isotopic composition in forest gundersen et al 2006 sudduth et al 2013 jacob et al 2016 in this regard the denitrification with limited n supply could result in relatively low nitrate concentration and significantly heavier isotopic composition in c2 and c3 sites for three wwtp end members both isotope values at one site w2 were close to the those at mainstream sites compared to two other wwtp sites w1 and w3 which showed lighter isotope values even though n related dissolved species don no2 n no3 n and nh4 n indicated significantly higher concentrations generally the heavier isotopes of nitrogen and oxygen can be depleted through the ammonification and nitrification that occurred during the treatment process lee et al 2016 schmidt et al 2016 saito et al 2018 meanwhile denitrification for the reduction of nitrate concentration in wwtps result in an increase in isotope ratios tchobanoglus et al 2003 galloway et al 2004 thus sewage treatment processes at two wwtps w1 and w3 might be different from w2 input sewage composition also may affect nitrate dual isotopic ratios in the effluents of wwtps in fact the largest wastewater treatment facility in daegu a metropolitan city is located near w2 demonstrating relatively heavier isotopic signatures caused by nitrogen treatment processes i e ammonium volatilization and denitrification in this regard nitrate isotopes values at w2 may represent the effluent of wwtps near urban areas and the end member of wwtp was used as average isotope values among three wwtps in this study for the end members of the urban source referred to both isotope values e g sewage values of Î´15nno3 2 7 0 4 Î´18ono3 28 5 47 9 and road dust values of Î´15nno3 5 8 6 2 Î´18ono3 6 1 27 6 reported in previous studies kojima et al 2011 pennino et al 2016 archana et al 2018 dual isotopic signatures at the urban tributary c5 indicate much lighter Î´18ono3 and slightly heavier Î´15nno3 in this study a mixture of sewage and road dust discharged into river water through a storm pipeline with heavy rain might make this specific urban nitrate signature meanwhile the lighter isotopic compositions of no3 n at agriculture site c1 may reflect the significant contribution of nh4 fertilizer i e ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate which is chemically produced through the haber bosch process yang and gruber 2016 torres et al 2020 in practice ammonium fertilizer showed lighter isotopic ranges of no3 n Î´15nno3 4 2 0 2 Î´18ono3 5 7 1 7 zhang et al 2018 chen et al 2020 compared to those of nitrate fertilizer 2 7 2 bayesian mixing model based on the isotopic variations Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 at river water samples the proportional contributions of nitrate sources were estimated using bayesian stable isotope mixing models bayesian mixing model in r mixsiar version 3 1 10 stock et al 2018 considering the nitrate budget within the mainstream river is often controlled by surrounding tributaries with diverse land use types li et al 2019 xu et al 2021 Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 values measured at mainstream water samples were assigned as mixtures and the tributary water samples were assigned as sources for isotopic source end member total 6 3 3 and 9 data were used for forest urban agriculture and wwtp end members respectively table 2 alongside the mixing model application the microbial denitrification effect was compared using a 1 1 2 1 relationship between Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 which were fractionated during denitrification kendall et al 2007 divers et al 2014 however considering there was no significant signature of in situ denitrification processes at the surface water in mainstream sites therefore the fractionation factor was not considered in the mixsiar hu et al 2021 cai et al 2022 to validate the accuracy of mixsiar model construction geweke diagnostic 5 of result to be outside 1 96 result in the mixsiar model was confirmed bayesian mixing model in r mixsiar version 3 1 10 stock et al 2018 also uncertainty of each source contribution at each site was denoted as standardization supplementary information table s3 and s6 2 7 3 hydrological model simulation and nitrate flux and loads estimation referred to previous studies the different nitrate loads exported from land use types including wwtp were estimated using the specific area and nitrate loads of each sub catchment within mainstream sites oliveira et al 2016 cui et al 2020 it was assumed that nitrate loads of mainstream sites k1 k11 within the geumho river were the sum of nitrate loads derived from each land use type presented in the sub catchment further the difference between simulated nitrate loads of mainstream sites and the sum of nitrate loads from each land use type were attributed to the contributions of wwtps and upstream sites river borne after simulation of the total nitrate load of each mainstream site the influence of infiltration and groundwater contribution to each land use type was estimated by independent simulations of surfaces interflow and active groundwater flow duda et al 2012 for nitrate flux no3 n g s calculation the simulated water discharge rate at each mainstream site was multiplied with measured nitrate concentration based on total nitrate flux source specific nitrate flux was estimated by multiplying proportional source contribution evaluated by mixsiar and hspf similar to nitrate flux source specific nitrate loads were calculated by multiplying the simulated total nitrate load at each mainstream site with proportional source contribution based on mixsiar and hspf 3 results 3 1 spatial distributions of hydrochemical

relatively high discharge rate at downstream sites k7 to k11 fig 5 compared with water discharge nitrate concentration spearman rho 0 67 p 0 05 and nitrate flux spearman rho 0 69 p 0 05 showed a high

properties of various land use types in complex river catchment the spatial variations of poc chl a dtn and din concentrations in mainstream sites were separately evaluated between upstream k1 to k5 and downstream sites k6 to k11 p 0 05 for poc and chl a p 0 1 for dtn and din fig 2 pca results also showed that these parameters discriminated wwtps from other land use types supplementary information fig s2 generally the distinct patterns of water physico chemical parameters e g temperature din dtn don sulfate and chloride may be related to increased inputs of untreated sewage and wwtp effluents xian et al 2016 adebowale et al 2019 among them the increased abundances of n related nutrients and chloride can originate from feces and manure near urban areas agriculture and livestock thayalakumaran et al 2008 zendehbad et al 2019 chen et al 2020 furthermore a high abundance of sulfate near wwtp can be related to the usage of sodium sulfate as a catalyst in dye industries w3 site kaown et al 2009 he et al 2011 oktem et al 2019 for poc abundance their spatial variations have been often used as typical examples that reflect the total export of various poc sources such as terrestrial plants algae bacteria and other contaminants within aquatic organic matter pools hossler and bauer 2013 lee et al 2021 in this regard chl a variations showed a positive correlation with the poc profiles rho 0 79 p 0 01 reflecting the most dominant contribution of algae derived poc caused by more nutrients supplied near wwtps and urban areas in addition quantitative source specific lipid biomarker fluxes indicated most of poc source would be identified by algal derived poc including fresh and or refractory portion lee et al 2021 in such conditions spatial distributions of dtn showed increased abundance near wwtps and urban areas compared to those of pn fig 2 dominant abundances of din may account for increased proportions within n related nutrients from upstream to downstream with respect to wwtp operation dissolved n concentration may be influenced by the wwtp treatment process i e primary processes are physical settling secondary processes are filtering and biological treatment and tertiary processes are uv and chemical treatment lee et al 2016 schmidt et al 2016 saito et al 2018 the basic type of treatment process may reflect insufficient n removal kim et al 2008 jia et al 2016 and high concentrations of din i e no3 n and nh4 n near wwtp sites as point source may be related to the increased contribution of untreated input sewage exported into the river system as an aspect of the potential contribution of n related nutrients via non point sources various n sources may be heterogeneously exported from different land use types e g urban agriculture and forest the distinct pca patterns show that increased din at urban c5 k7 and k9 and agriculture c1 sites might be associated with dominant contributions of anthropogenic activities e g urban sewage septic waste and fertilizer gundersen et al 2006 sudduth et al 2013 torres et al 2020 in contrast to the dominance of natural n sources e g soil nitrogen leaf leachate and precipitation at c2 c3 and c4 sites actually n related nutrients derived from both origins may enhance the nitrate export directly via surface water as well as ground water flow clark and fritz 1997 widory et al 2005 kaown et al 2009 walters et al 2015 archana et al 2018 merchÃ¡n et al 2020 under this condition the source tracing of each n related nutrient transported via various complex land use types is still challenging for precisely determining each contribution between natural and anthropogenic sources in addition riverine nitrate concentrations would be influenced by basal geochemical environments barros et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 knapp et al 2020 thus with respect to the source appointment of nitrate a complementary approach is necessary to effectively estimate the different contributions of nitrate sources within a complex river system 4 2 nitrate source identification in mainstream river water using dual isotope ratio the stable isotope approach Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 is often used for nitrate source appointments transported into a complex river system palmer et al 2007 puig et al 2013 stuart et al 2010 the Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 values determined at the geumho river seem to be the results of mixed contributions of manure sewage soil n and nh4 related fertilizer based on the different isotopic ranges of various end members fig 3 and supplementary information table s1 in this study nitrate sources in mainstream sites were calculated using mixsiar based on four source end members urban forest agriculture and wwtp the end member of each nitrate source was based on Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 values measured at five tributary sites and three wwtp effluents since each tributary site could represent typical isotope values of nitrate sources derived from dominant land use types in the geum river catchment except for c4 forest site which might be affected by the mixed nitrate from the mainstream of the geumho river estimated four nitrate source contribution represented various ranges from 11 to 86 36 20 for urban from 6 to 64 43 16 for forest from 2 to 21 9 6 for agriculture and from 3 to 30 12 8 for wwtp supplementary information table s3 together with the ubiquitous contribution of the forest for the geumho river 43 16 except k7 6 the proportion of anthropogenic no3 n sources e g urban and wwtp effluent significantly increased at downstream sites k7 k9 and k10 fig 4 the urban contribution 86 appears to be massively transported through the tributary c5 near the k7 site where there was intensive urban activity lee et al 2021 in addition the increased contribution of wwtp effluent at k10 30 may be related to the substantial export of n related nutrients the contribution of nitrate derived from agriculture was relatively small except for the relatively higher contribution at k10 21 and k2 17 these mixsiar results suggest that the nitrate sources at mainstream sites should be influenced by the relatively dominant land use type through the tributary of the sub catchment surrounding the geumho river spearman rank correlation analysis of estimated nitrate sources proportion represented a significant correlation between urban and agriculture rho 0 64 p 0 05 although correlation represented insignificant results urban and forest also showed negative results rho 0 48 p 0 1 these negative correlations between land use type nitrate sources were also identified in the correlation between the proportional area of urban agriculture rho 0 68 p 0 05 and forest rho 0 72 p 0 05 similar correlation results in the nitrate source contribution and proportional area indicated watershed area of each land use type might control the quantity of nitrate inflow and budget in the river catchment in this regard for precise estimation of quantitative nitrate inflow and budget in the river system the hydrological character of the river catchment such as water discharge and watershed area needs to be considered 4 3 nitrate loads based on the integrated approach of isotope and hydrological model spatial variation of no3 n sources may be influenced by water discharge in the catchment area which affects the nitrate budget of waterbodies chuman et al 2013 rothwell et al 2010 thus water discharge in each sub catchment area may be an important factor for controlling quantitative nitrate exports to evaluate the water discharge effect we first integrated the lipid biomarker concentration and water discharge which are regarded as possible environmental parameters lee et al 2021 based on the spatio temporal variation of water discharge simulated via the hspf model supplementary information fig s3 the estimated water discharge continuously increased from upstream to downstream fig 5 generally the variation of water discharges can potentially be controlled by diverse ambient parameters such as precipitation inflow rate and morphological characteristics of the stream wetzel and likens 2000 duda et al 2012 higashino and stefan 2019 chai et al 2020 with respect to the increased downstream boundary including catchments and tributary k7 to k10 within the geumho river the physical factors e g morphological characteristics and inflow are responsible for enhancing water discharge downstream piao et al 2007 luthy et al 2015 as shown in fig 5 total nitrate flux also showed an increasing pattern from upstream 25 0 5 9 no3 n g s k1 to k6 to downstream 63 7 27 7 no3 n g s k7 to k11 however relatively higher nitrate fluxes at k2 k3 k7 and k9 sites seem to be related to the increased nitrate concentration of input tributaries c1 and c5 and wwtp effluents w1 w2 and w3 as compared to the increasing downstream pattern of water discharge especially at the k7 site nitrate flux increased to an extremely high value 108 6 no3 n g s due to high nitrate concentration in a nearby tributary and the wwtp c5 and w2 sites intensive human activities in these sites agriculture c1 urban area c5 and wwtp w1 to w3 exported a large amount of nitrate which likely led to the increase in nitrate flux in the mainstream river water supplementary information fig s4 this result suggests that surrounding land use type influence point and non point nitrate fluxes as well as their sources in the mainstream river hydrological model approaches indicated each nitrate source flux from various land use types truly controlled the nitrate budget in the mainstream river which is as an independent result from mixsiar in this study specific nitrate sources of land use types agriculture forest urban and wwtp were estimated by hspf fig 5a and mixsiar fig 5b based on total nitrate fluxes both hspf based and mixsiar based nitrate fluxes were compared for each land use type showing a generally positive correlation between the fluxes fig 6 however few significant correlations between the results of both approaches forest r2 0 61 p 0 05 agriculture r2 0 20 p 0 05 wwtp r2 0 51 p 0 05 are found except for urban r2 0 97 p 0 05 these differences between hspf based and mixsiar based nitrate fluxes may be ascribed to the nitrate inflow from groundwater river borne discharge collected river water both tributary and mainstream samples were a mixture of surface and groundwater caused by hydraulic connection in this condition river nitrate dual isotopic composition may be partially affected by groundwater nitrate which could alter the nitrate isotopic signature of river water and initial source end members in this study the mixsiar did not include the nitrate isotope information of absolute groundwater and nitrate discharge from groundwater was not involved in the nitrate flux based on the current mixsiar in this regard water discharge of river borne nitrate was determined by the hspf model and nitrate load no3 n g s km2 was also calculated by the area of land use type and nitrate flux in the mainstream river catchment to estimate the contribution of river borne nitrate in mixsiar river borne nitrate isotope end member was calculated using an isotopic mass balance equation including five land use types urban forest agriculture wwtp and river borne based on the results of hspf supplementary information and table s4 as a result the average dual isotopic compositions of river borne nitrate were 8 0 9 0 for Î´15nno3 and 6 3 16 9 for Î´18ono3 with a range of the values from 4 5 to 17 5 for Î´15nno3 and 37 4 to 12 4 for Î´18ono3 along the mainstream of the geumho river supplementary information table s4 these isotopic ranges of river borne nitrate may be similar to those of other regional systems such as surface and groundwater systems in agricultural areas in the usa and korea e g kaown et al 2009 martinelli et al 2018 suchy et al 2018 jung et al 2020 the source contribution derived from river borne nitrate in mixsiar was relatively smaller 5 than those in hspf 7 32 as shown in fig 7 supplementary information table s5 the difference in river borne nitrate source contribution based on mixsiar and hspf might derive from two reasons first the stable isotopic composition of river borne nitrate may be altered during transportation by the impact of n transformation processes e g nitrification and denitrification in this situation variation of endmember isotopic composition may induce an over and underestimation of river borne source contribution second limited consideration of the n removal process e g denitrification in the hspf may cause an overestimation of river borne nitrate source contribution as an integrated approach each nitrate source contribution to total loads was based on mixsiar and substantial proportions of anthropogenic sources e g urban and wwtp increased while going downstream along the guemho river k7 to k11 83 4 170 3 g s km2 which was different from the hspf based result in fig 7 after accounting for urban tributary c5 inflow the contribution of urban significantly increased in the k7 site urban flux 160 6 no3 n g s km2 the substantial increase in nitrate loads may be influenced through point sources e g wwtp effluent as well as non point sources e g surface runoff and water sewage pipeline due to increased anthropogenic boundaries i e urban and industrial complexes actually the increase in anthropogenic nitrate loads within the geumho river was comparable to those of other large watershed systems such as agriculture derived nitrate flux in the oak creek watershed poor and mcdonnell 2007 sewage export in the nine mile run watershed divers et al 2014 sewage leaks in the dead run watershed duncan et al 2017 and anthropogenic nitrate export in the xijiang river and chengdu li et al 2019 ding et al 2021 even though the extent of the anthropogenic activity related boundaries within the geumho river was smaller than those of other systems excessive export of nitrate appears to play a critical role in water quality deterioration in river catchments the present results from an integrated approach suggest that non point anthropogenic nitrate inflow specifically derived from urban and industrial areas should provide substantially higher contributions to the nitrate budget in the complex river catchment on the other hand nitrate loads of different land use types were compared in terms of mixsiar and hspf results as shown in fig 8 the loads calculated from two different methods showed significant correlations with each other for urban r2 0 73 p 0 05 forest r2 0 76 p 0 05 and wwtp r2 0 80 p 0 05 but not for agriculture r2 0 13 p 0 05 as compared to the cases that did not consider river borne sources only one correlation for urban meanwhile the correlation from agriculture sources still showed an insignificant correlation reflecting the potential input of a mobilizable subsurface nitrate within the mainstream of the geumho river in this study mobilizable subsurface nitrate indicates a kind of mineralized nitrogen in the soil layer of agricultural area through the estimation of river borne nitrate groundwater source contribution only the agriculture area showed a weak correlation this result may propose possible contribution of organic fertilizer heavier nitrate isotope as another nitrate source or activated n transformation e g denitrification process in agricultural area frequent usage of synthetic fertilizer may enhance the nitrate diffusion into soil layers which can cause increased infiltration of fertilizer derived nitrate into groundwater jain et al 2019 kourakos et al 2012 in such conditions the isotopic signatures derived from anthropogenic nitrate may be displaced by the simultaneous occurrence of substantial nitrogen transformation between the soil layer and groundwater martinelli et al 2018 hu et al 2019 huang et al 2017 bourke et al 2019 kaushal et al 2022 these processes could lead to the underestimated contribution of the synthetic fertilizer derived nitrate within the geumho river in contrast to the heavier isotopic values of nitrate in agriculture 4 4 implication of the integrated approach and its further possible development our integrated approaches may provide a reliable and practical tool for estimating the individual contributions of non point sources surface runoff and groundwater infiltration involved in anthropogenic activities to effectively manage the increased anthropogenic nitrate sources table 3 although both methods mixsiar and hspf show advantages in specifying the source appointment and the hydrological fate of nitrate in the river system respectively the exclusive application of each approach may have be limited in quantitative estimation of nitrate export into complex river systems meier augenstein and kemp 2012 gao and li 2014 tavakoly et al 2019 to resolve these limitations we propose stepwise cross checking approach by complementary methods as shown in fig 9 to date no single approach is available to effectively evaluate the specific nitrate source flux and load in river catchment worldwide because critical errors may occur by simplifying assumptions and omitted parameters e g microbial processes and hydrological factors furthermore it is difficult to directly compare nitrate loads derived from various land use types in one river catchment in this study the integrated approach basically includes comparing mixsiar with hspf a step wise approach is followed by combining the contribution of each nitrate source based on isotopic signature with total nitrate loads of multiple land use types from hspf in complex river system the integration of both approaches provides a new insight to trace various nitrate sources through compensating each method showing quantitative contribution of source specific nitrate loads according to land use types in addition all obvious factors associated with nitrate flux e g groundwater diffusion rate and quantification of microbial nitrogen transformation processes should be considered in future studies particularly seasonal sampling over longer periods would be beneficial to capture the spatial temporal variability based on our proposed framework thus this approach can be applied for the precise estimation of nitrate load with temporal and spatial distributions according to various land use types and it can be helpful for making practical government policies for sustainable river water quality management and preservation 5 conclusion for quantitative estimation and management of nitrate flux in complex river catchments the origin and transport of anthropogenic nitrate into the geumho river were determined using stable isotopes and hydrological model approaches first nitrate isotopic composition of the river water was used to evaluate discriminative contributions of various nitrate sources urban sewage forest soil n agricultural synthetic fertilizer and wwtp effluent in addition mixsiar results showed enhanced contributions of anthropogenic sources in the downstream area with denser urban populations secondly hspf results showed increasing water discharge and total nitrate flux along downstream compared with hspf based nitrate fluxes mixsiar based results indicated that anthropogenic nitrate sources were substantially increased along downstream together with the effect of wwtp effluents as a point source we inferred that a large amount of synthetic fertilizer for agriculture may be transported via groundwater infiltration as non point sources thus our integrated approach provides important evidence for substantial increases in anthropogenic sources based on enhancing river nitrate budget and flux consequently the integrated approach should be useful and has implications for estimating quantitative contributions of natural and anthropogenic nitrate

14867,bisphenol a bpa is a high production volume chemical with potential estrogenic effects susceptible to abiotic degradation by mno2 bpa transformation products and reaction mechanisms with mno2 have been investigated but detailed process understanding of mn iii mediated degradation has not been attained rapid consumption of bpa occurred in batch reaction vessels with 1 mm mn iii and 63 9 0 7 of 1 76 0 02 Î¼mol bpa was degraded in 1 hour at circumneutral ph bpa was consumed at 1 86 0 09 fold higher rates in vessels with synthetic mno2 comprising approximately 13 mol surface associated mn iii versus surface mn iii free mno2 and 10 35 of bpa transformation could be attributed to mn iii during the initial 10 min reaction phase high resolution tandem mass spectrometry hrms ms analysis detected eight transformation intermediates in reactions with mn iii and quantum calculations proposed 14 bpa degradation products nine of which had not been observed during mno2 mediated bpa degradation suggesting mechanistic differences between mn iii versus mno2 mediated bpa degradation the findings demonstrate that both mn iii and mn iv can effectively degrade bpa and indicate that

abstract keywords bisphenol a mn iii mno2 quantum chemical calculations degradation pathway data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa is a widely used industrial chemical for the production of polycarbonates and epoxy resins staples et al 1998 the global bpa market reached a value of 10 92 billion dollars in 2020 and will reach 30 62 billion dollars by 2026 with increasing demand projected research and markets 2021 high production volume and widespread use introduced bpa to various environmental systems fromme et al 2002 im and lÃ¶ffler 2016 laboratory studies suggested estrogenic effects of bpa staples et al 1998 what has triggered research exploring the fate of bpa im and lÃ¶ffler 2016 shobnam et al 2021 staples et al 1998 sun et al 2021 with a k ow of 3 42 bpa has a tendency for sorption and considerable mass exists in soils sediments and landfills huang et al 2014 kalmykova et al 2013 liao et al 2012 bpa resists anaerobic microbial degradation but is susceptible to abiotic degradation mediated by manganese dioxide mno2 in oxic and anoxic environments balgooyen et al 2017 huang et al 2018 im et al 2015 2014 abiotic bpa degradation by mno2 involves a radical mechanism and several degradation products including coupling products but also compounds with lower molecular weight than bpa have been identified im et al 2015 lin et al 2009 mno2 is a strong and environmentally relevant oxidant that has been shown to transform a variety of organic compounds including priority pollutants im et al 2015 li et al 2018 stone 1987 zhang and huang 2003 the theoretical oxidation state of mn in fully oxidized mno2 is 4 however actual measurements indicate an average oxidation state of synthetic mno2 between 3 3 and 3 9 balgooyen et al 2017 feng et al 2010 learman et al 2011 this discrepancy has been explained by the presence of mn iii in synthetic and biogenic mno2 with reported mn iii contents ranging from 7 to 36 feng et al 2010 huang et al 2018 learman et al 2011 nico and zasoski 2001 villalobos et al 2003 a few studies have demonstrated that mn iii contained in mno2 preparations plays a role as an oxidant in reactions mediated by mno2 huang et al 2018 nico and zasoski 2000 2001 for example the absence of mn iii in the surface of mno2 has been shown to decrease chromium iii and phenol oxidation nico and zasoski 2000 2001 in addition mn iii has been detected in various environments including oxic anoxic interfaces in soils jones et al 2018 and hemipelagic sediments madison et al 2013 trouwborst et al 2006 at micromolar concentrations recent studies documented that soluble mn iii effectively oxidizes a variety of organic compounds including lignin jones et al 2018 chlorophene wang et al 2018 and ciprofloxacin sun et al 2015 as well as inorganics such as the radionuclide uranium iv wang et al 2014 these findings changed the traditional paradigm of mn biogeochemistry and mn iii is now considered an environmentally relevant oxidant however the relative contribution of mn iii to bpa degradation by synthetic mno2 as well as pathways and mechanism of mn iii mediated bpa degradation have not been elucidated or fully characterized the reactivity of phenolic compounds e g bpa is mainly dependent on the frontier electron density fed specifically electron densities in the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo fukui et al 1954 1952 according to the frontier orbital theory the atom with a higher fed at the homo i e 2fed2 homo or fr e 2cr ho 2 is more likely lose an electron and the atom with a higher fed at the homo and lumo i e fed2 homo fed2 lumo or fr r cr ho 2 cr lu 2 is more susceptible to attack by a hydroxyl radical an et al 2010 fukui 1975 ohko et al 2002 also oxidation of organic compounds is generally prone to occur at atoms with greater negative charges wang et al 2018 the oxidant generates radicals in reaction solutions e g h2o which will trigger secondary reactions leading to transformation and degradation of organic compounds potential coupling sites for the formation of polymeric intermediates can be predicted using the spin density which represents the nonbonding molecular orbital with the unpaired electron chen et al 2018 fleck et al 2019 lowe and peterson 2006 density functional theory dft a computational quantum mechanical modeling approach can predict chemical reactivity and has been widely applied to study reaction mechanisms chempath et al 2010 chen et al 2013 xu et al 2018 the objectives of this study were to derive mechanistic and quantitative understanding of mn iii mediated bpa degradation and the role of mn iii in mno2 mediated bpa degradation ultra high performance liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry uhplc hrms ms data paired with quantum chemical calculations generated new pathway information for mn iii mediated bpa degradation and suggested mechanistic differences to mno2 mediated bpa degradation kinetic experiments using synthetic mno2 and surface mn iii free synthetic mno2 revealed the role of mn iii in mno2 mediated bpa

et al 2019 nico and zasoski 2001 with modifications briefly pyrophosphate was used to extract surface mn iii from synthetic mno2 to produce surface mn iii free mno2 liu et al 2019 nico and zasoski 2001 because pyrophosphate can promote the conproportionation of mn ii and mn iv to generate mn iii liu et al 2019 the synthetic mno2 was sequentially washed five times with 30 mm h2so4 and milli q water at least 18 2 mÏ cm to remove mn ii wright et al 2016 surface mn iii free mno2 suspensions were prepared in 160 ml glass serum bottles with a total volume of 100 ml of 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 and 1 mm nominal concentrations synthetic mno2 at ph 7 2 to extract surface associated mn iii pyrophosphate was added to the synthetic mno2 suspensions at a pyrophosphate mn ratio of 50 klewicki and morgan 1998 the mixtures were continuously agitated at 120 rpm in an upright position at room temperature aliquots 1 ml were periodically collected and filtered through 0 22 Î¼m polyethersulfone membrane nalgene rochester ny usa into 1 cm light path quartz cuvettes corning inc corning ny usa for absorbance measurements at 258 nm to collect surface mn iii free mno2 the pyrophosphate mno2 suspensions

degradation of bpa by soluble mn iii synthetic mno2 and surface mn iii free mno2 experiments were performed in 60 ml glass serum bottles with a total volume of 40 ml of 5 mm phosphate buffer zhang et al 2021 ph 7 2 containing 44 Î¼m bpa 1 76 Î¼mol preliminary experiments verified that the 5 mm phosphate buffer solution did not affect the reactivity of mno2 during the initial incubation phase i e 10 min fig s1 the experiments were conducted at circumneutral ph 7 2 to avoid disproportionation of mn iii to mn ii and mn iv which readily occurs under acidic conditions fig s2 gao et al 2018 klewicki and morgan 1998 wang et al 2022 sodium chloride was added to reach a constant ionic strength of 10 mm to measure bpa degradation rates and extents mn iii was added to serum bottles to achieve concentrations of 0 01 0 02 0 05 0 25 and 1 mm synthetic mno2 and surface mn iii free mno2 suspensions were added to the serum bottles to achieve nominal concentrations of 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 and 1 mm using plastic syringes the vessels were manually shaken before 0 5 ml aliquots were periodically collected and transferred to 1 5 ml plastic centrifuge tubes containing 20 Î¼l of l ascorbic acid solution 5 g l 1 and immediately vortexed l ascorbic acid is a reaction quencher by converting any remaining solid phase mn iv as mno2 to soluble mn ii ions and also liberates any adsorbed bpa lin et al 2009 control experiments compared bpa concentrations in ascorbic acid treated samples versus untreated filtered 0 2 Î¼m ptfe membranes thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa samples and determined that the adsorption of bpa to solid phase mno2 did not affect bpa degradation the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g eppendorf centrifuge 5415d for 10 min and the supernatant of each tube was transferred to a 2 ml glass hplc autosampler vial the conversion efficiency of bpa to hca was calculated by dividing the amount Î¼mol of hca generated by the amount of bpa oxidized im et al 2015 and reported as percentage the pseudo first order rate constants were obtained by plotting the natural log of bpa concentrations as a function of time using six early time points i e 10 min where linear relationships were observed im et al 2015 mn ii a product of mn iv and mn iii reduction was not measured due to sorption to unreacted mno2 and interference of bpa transformation products with spectrophotometric quantification balgooyen et al 2017 zhang and huang 2003 2 4 detection of transformation intermediates tis degradation experiments were performed in 160 ml glass serum bottles with a total volume of 100 ml of 5 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 2 containing 44 Î¼m bpa and 0 5 mm soluble mn iii following a 4 hour incubation period entire vessels were extracted yan et al 2018 briefly sep pak c18 cartridges waters corp milford ma usa were rinsed with 3 ml of methanol followed by a wash with 60 ml of milli q water residual water was removed by pushing air through the cartridges using a 20 ml plastic syringe following these preparation steps 100 ml of bpa reaction mixture was slowly passed approximately one drop per second through the column then the column was rinsed with 5 ml of milli q water which was removed by pushing air through the cartridge using a 10 ml plastic syringe bound compounds were eluted from the column in 2 ml of methanol the extracts were stored at 4 c for no longer than 24 h before analysis extracts were analyzed using uhplc hrms ms following an established methosd with modifications see the supporting information for details choi and lee 2017 2 5 incubation conditions the experiments were performed under ambient air conditions and at room temperature 21 c and all vessels were incubated on a rotary shaker 200 rpm unless indicated otherwise with the stoppers facing up all experiments were performed in the dark to exclude potential interference with photochemical reactions e g photo induced hydroxyl radical formation 2 6 analytical procedures bpa and hca were quantified using an agilent 1100 series hplc system equipped with a diode array detector and a fluorescence detector fld sun et al 2021 separation was performed on an agilent eclipse xdb c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 Î¼m using isocratic elution at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 of acetonitrile and milli q water 50 50 v v at ph 7 2 the fld was set at excitation and emission wavelengths of 226 nm and 310 nm respectively for standard curve construction vials containing 0 4 1 1 2 2 11 44 and 88 Î¼m bpa and 50 mg ml 1 l ascorbic acid were prepared in triplicates hca standard curves were created using solutions of 0 7 1 4 2 8 11 1 and 44 4 Î¼m the limit of detection and limit of quantification were 0 4 Î¼m and 1 1 Î¼m for bpa and 0 2 Î¼m and 0 7 Î¼m for hca with signal to noise ratios of 3 1 and 10 1 respectively soluble mn iii was quantified by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 258 nm perkinelmer lambda 35 uv vis spectrophotometer immediately after collecting sun et al 2015 a molar extinction coefficient of 6 750 m 1 cm 1 was used to calculate concentrations of dissolved mn iii liu et al 2019 the percentage of extractable mn iii on a molar basis was calculated by dividing the amount Î¼mol of mn iii pyrophosphate formed by the initial amount Î¼mol of synthetic mno2 the kinetics of mn iii pyrophosphate extraction from synthetic mno2 were simulated with the first order rate law eq 1 klewicki and morgan 1999 liu et al 2019 1 mn iii pyrophosphate mn iii pyrophosphate max 1 e k l t where mn iii pyrophosphate max is the concentration of mn iii pyrophosphate at equilibrium k l hour 1 is the first order rate constant and t hour is the incubation period 2 7 quantum chemical calculations the gaussian 09 software package was applied for all quantum chemical calculations frisch et al 2009 the structure of bpa with minimum energy was optimized using the dft method at the b3lyp 6 311g level wang et al 2018 the fed values of the homo i e fed2 homo and lumo i e fed2 lumo charge density and spin density were obtained from the gaussian output files values of 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo were obtained to predict the reaction sites of electron extraction and hydroxyl attack fukui 1975 fukui et al 1954 1952 the charge density and spin density of radicals were used to predict the coupling reactions between radicals finally the molecular structure of tis and degradation pathways were proposed based on the results of the uhplc hrms ms analysis and the quantum calculations 2 8 toxicity prediction since data for risk assessment development for bpa degradation products are lacking acute and chronic toxicity of bpa and its degradation products were predicted using the us epa ecological structure activity relationships ecosar software version 2 2 usepa 2022 the ecosar software evaluates the risks of organic compound exposure to fish daphnia and green algae by using quantitative structure activity relationship models the prediction results include the half maximum effective concentrations ec50 half maximum lethal concentrations lc50 and chronic toxicity chv of each compound 3 results 3 1 bpa degradation by soluble mn iii in vessels with 0 01 to 1 mm soluble mn iii a rapid decline of bpa was observed and 20 26 of the initial 1 76 0 02 Î¼mol of bpa was consumed within the first 2 min of incubation suggesting mn iii mediated bpa degradation is a fast process fig 1 subsequent i e 2 min bpa removal occurred at lower rates and 20 64 of the initial amount of bpa was consumed following a 1 hour incubation period fig 1 soluble mn iii mediated bpa degradation yielded one major degradation product with a retention time matching that of the synthetic hca standard fig s3 a finding confirmed by uhplc hrms ms analysis fig s4 when 0 05 mm mn iii was incubated with 44 Î¼m bpa the conversion efficiency of bpa to hca reached 7 4 0 5 following a 10 min incubation period fig 1b fig s5 similar conversion efficiencies were observed with mn iii loadings 0 05 mm fig s5 suggesting that mn iii reacts preferentially with bpa rather than with hca 3 2 identification of bpa tis generated by soluble mn iii bpa tis generated in reaction vessels with soluble mn iii were identified using uhplc hrms ms analysis table 1 two tis were identified with a mass to charge ratio m z lower than the bpa parent ion while several tis had m z values higher than the bpa parent ion table 1 fig s6 the first ti ti 1 fig s6a b was eluted at 4 7 min with a m z of 151 0671 m h and matched the mass spectrum of the hca standard fig s4 the second ti ti 2 fig s6a c was eluted at 4 6 min with a m z of 133 0656 m h and correlated to the dehydration product of hca p4 fig 2 the remaining tis all had m z values higher than the bpa parent molecule table 1 these intermediates are likely formed via reactions between bpa hca ti 1 and hydroxyl radicals intermediate 3 ti 3 fig s6a d with a m z of 243 1019 and a predicted molecular formula of c15h15o3 likely represents an oxidized form of bpa since the fragmentation data did not reveal evidence of a dehydrated product like hca it is unlikely that ti 3 contains a similar isopropanol functional group suggesting a structure similar to p1 is more likely than structures p9 or p13 fig 2 ti 4 with a m z of 301 1436 has twice the molecular mass of hca ti 1 and likely represents different hca dimers p10 and p14 fig 2 ti 5 with a m z of 319 1328 could be formed in a coupling reaction between a bpa radical and a phenoxyl radical fragmentation of ti 5 yielded a single product with a m z of 108 0207 and a relative intensity 55 fig s6f which corresponds to a radical anion fragment with the possible formula of c6h4o2 and may correspond to the neutral loss of a bisphenol moiety p2 and p5 fig 2 fragmentation of ti 6 m z 377 1772 yielded a major fragment with a m z of 359 1664 suggesting the loss of h2o fig s6g further fragmentation gave several low intensity signals with predicted molecular formulae of c24h21o2 c18h17o2 and c23h20o3 generated by the loss of h2o a phenolate ion or a methyl radical respectively the fragmentation pattern of ti 6 supports connectivity resembling p12 versus p8 and p11 as it contains a biphenyl 2 2 diol moiety capable of forming a dibenzofuran from a loss of h2o fig 2 fig s6g ti 7 and ti 8 had the same m z of 453 2095 and 453 2093 respectively 0 287 ppm difference table 1 but differed in retention time by 1 4 min fig s6a h i fragmentation of both intermediates yielded a common m z of 359 1665 with intensities of 15 ti 7 and 25 ti 8 which likely corresponds to the loss of a phenolate anion resulting in the same product with a predicted formula of c24h23o3 ti 7 yielded another fragment m z 423 1623 with relative intensity greater than 10 while ti 8 yielded no other fragments above this intensity taken together these data suggest that ti 7 and ti 8 are structural isomers that correspond to the bpa dimers p6 and p7 fig 2 3 3 reaction schemes based on the identified tis a novel reaction scheme for bpa degradation by soluble mn iii is proposed fig 2 table 1 the quantum calculations support the proposed pathways and the two major reaction types namely hydroxylation and single electron coupling fig 2 hydroxylation of bpa most likely occurred at position 7c 13c due to the highest fed2 homo fed2 lumo value fig 3 thus the hydroxyl substitution reaction would generate the mono hydroxylated ti 1 p1 fig 2 ti 3 with an m z 243 1033 identified by uhplc hrms ms is consistent with the fed prediction of a hydroxylated product fig 3 table s1 the degradation of bpa is likely initiated by a single electron transfer to mn iii resulting in the formation of a bpa radical the electron rich position 1o 11o is a preferred target for mn iii attack and the formation of radical r1 fig 2 by considering both 2fed2 homo and charge density fig 3 fig s7 further the calculation results of spin densities table s1 show that the unpaired electron in r1 can delocalize to the 3c 7c or 5c positions and form r2 and r3 respectively fig 2 table s1 following radical formation coupling reactions via carbon carbon c c and carbon oxygen c o can occur and generate bpa dimers a para co coupling reaction is likely to occur between r1 and r2 by taking both spin densities and charge into account table s1 and would yield an unstable intermediate which re aromatizes to form p2 and either p3 hydration or p4 elimination fig 2 r2 could undergo Î² scission to yield the radical r2 1 which may engage in coupling reactions with r1 and r3 and yield products p2 and p5 with the same chemical formula respectively other coupling reactions can occur between r1 and r3 through ortho c o coupling and between r3 and r3 through ortho ortho c c coupling and yield p6 and p7 fig 2 uhplc hrms ms fragmentation of the tis confirmed the formation of these products p2 p7 in reaction assays with mn iii and bpa hca p3 in fig 2 was identified as a major bpa ti fig 1 which was susceptible to further degradation by mn iii the quantum calculations suggest that position 1o is most likely to lose an electron due to a higher 2fed2 homo value and the lowest charge density fig 3 fig s7 suggesting that r4 fig 2 could be formed via a one electron extraction and subsequently yield r5 and r6 due to electron resonance table s1 fig 2 these three radicals together with the radicals directly derived from bpa could trigger a series of reactions that give rise to several additional tis for example the coupling reactions between r4 and either r3 r2 1 or r6 would yield p8 p9 and p10 fig 2 respectively in addition the para co coupling reactions between r5 and r1 and between r5 and r4 could generate unstable intermediates and yield p2 and p9 respectively fig 2 lastly r6 could be coupling with r1 r3 r2 1 as well as r6 resulting in the formation of p11 p12 p13 and p14 respectively fig 2 uhplc hrms ms fragmentation of the tis corroborated the formation of these products from reactions with hca 3 4 pyrophosphate extractable mn iii from synthetic mno2 to compare the reactivity of the synthetic mno2 and surface mn iii free mno2 mn iii associated with synthetic mno2 was extracted by using pyrophosphate after eliminating the interference of conproportionation caused by mn ii see the method for details fig 4 a shows uv vis spectra of the extract obtained following pyrophosphate treatment for 150 h the spectrum shows the characteristic absorption peak of the mn iii pyrophosphate complex at 258 nm no absorbance increases at 258 nm were observed in incubations lacking synthetic mno2 indicating pyrophosphate did not contribute to the signal mn iii pyrophosphate formation only occurred in the presence of synthetic mno2 and a linear relationship r2 0 994 between 258 nm readings and the nominal concentrations of synthetic mno2 was observed fig 4a demonstrating that the amount of pyrophosphate extractable mn iii correlated with the initial loadings of synthetic mno2 extraction of mn iii with pyrophosphate was fast during the first 24 h of incubation and plateaued after about 170 h mn iii extracted from reaction vessels with 0 05 2 mm nominal concentration of synthetic mno2 accounted for 8 3 0 1 to 13 1 1 0 of the total synthetic mno2 loadings fig 4b 3 5 effect of mno2 associated mn iii on bpa degradation the contribution of surface associated mn iii to bpa degradation was assessed in reaction vessels amended with synthetic mno2 or surface mn iii free mno2 the amounts of bpa removed increased with the loadings of synthetic mno2 or surface mn iii free mno2 fig s8 for example 15 2 1 5 and 87 6 0 2 of the initial amount of 1 76 Î¼mol bpa was removed during a 10 min incubation period with 0 05 and 1 mm synthetic mno2 respectively table 2 fig s8a surface mn iii free mno2 removed less bpa fig s8b and 5 2 1 2 and 52 8 2 7 of the initial 1 76 Î¼mol bpa were transformed over a 10 min incubation period with 0 05 and 1 mm surface mn iii free mno2 respectively based on the differences in bpa consumption 10 35 of bpa degradation could be attributed to mn iii associated with mno2 during the initial 10 min reaction phase the initial bpa concentration decreases followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics but the rates declined after 10 min in both systems with synthetic mno2 or surface mn iii free mno2 therefore the initial rate constants k init min 1 were calculated from six early time points i e 10 min where linear relationships between the bpa removal and the loadings of synthetic mno2 and surface mn iii free mno2 were observed fig 5 the reaction rates of bpa removed by synthetic mno2 were 1 86 0 09 fold higher than those measured for surface mn iii free mno2 fig 5 indicating that mn iii contributes significantly to synthetic mno2 mediated bpa degradation 4 discussion solid phase mno2 is a naturally occurring mixed valence oxidant containing mn iii and mn iv with relevant roles for biogeochemical cycling in addition to mno2 soluble mn iii is now recognized as a strong oxidant and contributor to redox processes in environmental systems johnson et al 2018 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2014 and has been implicated in the degradation of adsorbed bpa im et al 2015 lin et al 2009 shobnam et al 2021 sun et al 2021 a number of studies reported reaction kinetics products and mechanisms in reaction assays with mno2 balgooyen et al 2017 im et al 2015 lin et al 2009 however such information is largely lacking for bpa degradation mediated by mn iii and the relative contributions of mn iv versus mn iii toward bpa degradation have not been disentangled 4 1 mn iii mediated bpa degradation the experimental efforts demonstrated that bpa is efficiently degraded by environmentally relevant concentrations i e 80 Î¼m of soluble mn iii madison et al 2013 suggesting that mn iii potentially plays a role in attenuating bpa in environmental systems similar to prior work studying mno2 mediated bpa degradation hca was a major ti in reaction vessels with soluble mn iii although a lower bpa to hca conversion efficiency of 7 4 was measured compared to 30 during mno2 mediated bpa degradation balgooyen et al 2017 im et al 2015 the differences in conversion efficiencies could be due to higher reactivity of mn iii than mno2 toward hca however the experimental data fig s5 do not support this explanation im et al 2015 a more plausible explanation is pathway differences and mn iii mediated bpa degradation generates other intermediates fig 2 in addition to hca not predominantly hca as was observed for mno2 mediated degradation balgooyen et al 2017 im et al 2015 lin et al 2009 4 2 bpa degradation products generated by mn iii the uhplc hrms ms analysis identified tis with eight different m z and quantum calculations predicted 14 different degradation products based on the detected m z and the predicted formulae fig 2 table 1 prior work documented the utility of this combined approach to predict degradation products and propose degradation pathways blotevogel et al 2010 huang and weber 2005 ohko et al 2002 wang et al 2018 in laboratory systems with mno2 11 bpa degradation products have been experimentally identified lin et al 2009 five of which were also observed in our studies with soluble mn iii nine of the 14 predicted bpa degradation products are unique and had not been described in prior studies that used mno2 as oxidant the main differences in the bpa degradation pathways mediated by mn iii versus mn iv are related to the formation of hca one major degradation product in both pathways hca is susceptible to oxidation by soluble mn iii and the transformation of hca gave rise to seven i e p8 p14 of the nine distinct degradation products proposed prior studies demonstrated that hca is susceptible to further degradation by mno2 however no tis of hca had been identified im et al 2015 shobnam et al 2021 bpa is a potential hormonally active agent and transformation degradation should result in reduced endocrine disrupting activity however the human health concerns associated with the degradation products are not clear some bpa degradation products have been documented to impact human cancer cells more than the parent compound mccormick et al 2011 nakamura et al 2011 suzuki et al 2004 and the major product observed in biotic and abiotic degradation hca has higher estrogen receptor binding affinity than bpa nakamura et al 2011 the ecosar program has predictive capabilities and can estimate the toxicity of bpa degradation products for which risk assessment data are not available to aquatic organisms such as fish daphnia and green algae ecosar categorizes bpa as toxic to very toxic lc50 ec50 chv 10 mg l 1 to aquatic organisms table s2 bpa degradation yielded products with lower ecosar predicted toxicity i e p1 p3 p13 and p14 however several e g p2 p5 p6 p7 p8 p11 and p12 have higher predicted toxicity than bpa and ecosar categorizes these compounds as very toxic lc50 ec50 chv 1 mg l 1 bpa concentrations in impacted environments are generally well below the very toxic level i e 1 mg l 1 im and lÃ¶ffler 2016 liao et al 2012 and it is not likely that mn iii mn iv mediated degradation will generate bpa degradation products at concentrations that would result in acute or chronic toxicity table s2 considering the predicted increase in global bpa production and the uncertainties of bpa fate and exposure routes under conditions of environmental change detailed toxicological studies of bpa transformation products to establish robust risk assessment are warranted liao et al 2012 research and markets 2021 4 3 contribution of mn iii in mno2 mediated bpa degradation the synthetic mno2 used in the experimental work contained about 13 mol mol mn iii fig 4 consistent with prior reports liu et al 2019 nico and zasoski 2001 solid mno2 is a mixed valence mineral phase of mn iv and mn iii oxides and previous work has implicated mn iii in mno2 reactivity huang et al 2018 nico and zasoski 2000 2001 the kinetic analysis performed here demonstrated that surface mn iii free mno2 mediates bpa degradation at lower rates than synthetic mno2 prior to the removal of surface associated mn iii fig 5 emphasizing the role of mn iii when studying mno2 mediated degradation mn iii mediated oxidation activity was most apparent during the early stages i e 10 min of incubation fig 1a which overlaps with the time period generally used for determining degradation rates in systems with synthetic mno2 in addition the data demonstrate that the surface associated mn iii present in the experimental reaction assays was insufficient to completely degrade the initial 1 76 Î¼mol of bpa fig 1 fig s8 the structural properties of synthetic mno2 and surface mn iii free mno2 differ which may affect the reactivity liu et al 2019 a number of studies have demonstrated that mn iii content rather than the phase structure of mno2 determines reactivity huang et al 2018 nico and zasoski 2000 2001 therefore the oxidation rates reported in systems with synthetic mno2 and attributed to mn iv likely represent the combined reactivity of mn iv and surface associated mn iii the participation of two distinct reactants is consistent with the observation of two different reaction mechanisms i e mn iii mediated and mn iv mediated in aqueous systems with mno2 nico and zasoski 2001 the discussion above considers the role of the mn iii associated with mno2 however a one electron reduction of mn iv can generate additional mn iii which may impact bpa degradation rate and extent in reaction vessels with mno2 previous studies have demonstrated that the contribution of internally generated mn iii is strongly ph dependent with negligible formation under neutral to slightly alkaline ph 7 9 conditions chen et al 2021 gao et al 2018 jiang et al 2010 wang et al 2022 the experiments in our study were conducted at ph 7 2 suggesting that interference from internally generated mn iii is unlikely to impact the results and their interpretation 4 4 theoretical considerations of mn iii and mno2 mediated bpa degradation abiotic redox reactions proceed in three steps including pre reaction complex formation electron transfer and post reaction complex dissociation nico and zasoski 2000 the electron transfer is generally considered the rate limiting step metzler nolte and kraatz 2006 the overall gibbs free energy change Î´g nef of the reaction is related to the reduction potential e and controls the rate of electron transfer between reductant and oxidant marcus 1993 the standard reduction potential eÂº values for the reduction of mn iv to mn ii and mn iii to mn ii are 1 29 v wang and stone 2006 and 1 51 v kostka et al 1995 respectively thus the reduction of mn iii to mn ii should be a faster reaction assuming that the eÂº of bpa oxidation in both reactions is the same also mn iii can directly coordinate with bpa through the empty Ï orbital t2g 3eg 1 tg 3eg 2 to accept electrons whereas mn iv would have to undergo outer sphere electron transfer t2g 3 t2g 3eg 2 during the oxidation process ukrainczyk and mcbride 1992 the latter process is more challenging because an outer electron transfer into a Ï orbital requires a change in the mn spin state ukrainczyk and mcbride 1992 our results are consistent with these theories and lower bpa degradation rates were observed in systems with surface mn iii free mno2 as oxidant fig 5 5 conclusions bpa is recalcitrant to microbial degradation in anoxic sediments but susceptible to chemical degradation by oxidized mn species this study highlights the role of mn iii in mno2 mediated degradation and surface associated mn iii substantially increases the rate of bpa degradation an observation that likely extends to other contaminants susceptible to oxidation by mno2 the findings indicate that oxic anoxic transition zones with active mn cycling are hotpots for bpa attenuation mn iii and mno2 mediated bpa degradation shares hca as a major intermediate however mechanistic differences lead to divergent transformation products with different toxicological profiles detailed knowledge about degradation pathways and products formed is required to meaningfully assess risk and predict potential threats to human health and to

2021 with a k ow of 3 42 bpa has a tendency for sorption and considerable mass exists in soils sediments and landfills huang et al 2014 kalmykova et al 2013 liao et al 2012 bpa resists anaerobic microbial degradation but is susceptible to abiotic degradation mediated by manganese dioxide mno2 in oxic and anoxic environments balgooyen et al 2017 huang et al 2018 im et al 2015 2014 abiotic bpa degradation by mno2 involves a radical mechanism and several degradation products including coupling products but also compounds with lower molecular weight than bpa have been identified im et al 2015 lin et al 2009 mno2 is a strong and environmentally relevant oxidant that has been shown to transform a variety of organic compounds including priority pollutants im et al 2015 li et al 2018 stone 1987 zhang and huang 2003 the theoretical oxidation state of mn in fully oxidized mno2 is 4 however actual measurements indicate an average oxidation state of synthetic mno2 between 3 3 and 3 9 balgooyen et al 2017 feng et al 2010 learman et al 2011 this discrepancy has been explained by the presence of mn iii in synthetic and biogenic mno2 with reported mn iii contents ranging from 7 to 36 feng et al 2010 huang et al 2018 learman et al 2011 nico and zasoski 2001 villalobos et al 2003 a few studies have demonstrated that mn iii contained in mno2 preparations plays a role as an oxidant in reactions mediated by mno2 huang et al 2018 nico and zasoski 2000 2001 for example the absence of mn iii in the surface of mno2 has been shown to decrease chromium iii and phenol oxidation nico and zasoski 2000 2001 in addition mn iii has been detected in various environments including oxic anoxic interfaces in soils jones et al 2018 and hemipelagic sediments madison et al 2013 trouwborst et al 2006 at micromolar concentrations recent studies documented that soluble mn iii effectively oxidizes a variety of organic compounds including lignin jones et al 2018 chlorophene wang et al 2018 and ciprofloxacin sun et al 2015 as well as inorganics such as the radionuclide uranium iv wang et al 2014 these findings changed the traditional paradigm of mn biogeochemistry and mn iii is now considered an environmentally relevant oxidant however the relative contribution of mn iii to bpa degradation by synthetic mno2 as well as pathways and mechanism of mn iii mediated bpa degradation have not been elucidated or fully characterized the reactivity of phenolic compounds e g bpa is mainly dependent on the frontier electron density fed specifically electron densities in the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo fukui et al 1954 1952 according to the frontier orbital theory the atom with a higher fed at the homo i e 2fed2 homo or fr e 2cr ho 2 is more likely lose an electron and the atom with a higher fed at the homo and lumo i e fed2 homo fed2 lumo or fr r cr ho 2 cr lu 2 is more susceptible to attack by a hydroxyl radical an et al 2010 fukui 1975 ohko et al 2002 also oxidation of organic compounds is generally prone to occur at atoms with greater negative charges wang et al 2018 the oxidant generates radicals in reaction solutions e g h2o which will trigger secondary reactions leading to transformation and degradation of organic compounds potential coupling sites for the formation of polymeric intermediates can be

et al 2019 nico and zasoski 2001 with modifications briefly pyrophosphate was used to extract surface mn iii from synthetic mno2 to produce surface mn iii free mno2 liu et al 2019 nico and zasoski 2001 because pyrophosphate can promote the conproportionation of mn ii and mn iv to generate mn iii liu et al 2019 the synthetic mno2 was sequentially washed five times with 30 mm h2so4 and milli q

10 min fig s1 the experiments were conducted at circumneutral ph 7 2 to avoid disproportionation of mn iii to mn ii and mn iv which readily occurs under acidic conditions fig s2 gao et al 2018

using plastic syringes the vessels were manually shaken before 0 5 ml aliquots were periodically collected and transferred to 1 5 ml plastic centrifuge tubes containing 20 Î¼l of l ascorbic acid solution 5 g l 1 and immediately vortexed l ascorbic acid is a reaction quencher by converting any remaining solid phase mn iv as mno2 to soluble mn ii ions and also liberates any adsorbed bpa lin et al 2009 control experiments compared bpa concentrations in ascorbic acid treated samples versus untreated filtered 0 2 Î¼m ptfe membranes thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa samples and determined that the adsorption of bpa to solid phase mno2 did not affect bpa degradation the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g eppendorf centrifuge 5415d for 10 min and the supernatant of each tube was

2015 a molar extinction coefficient of 6 750 m 1 cm 1 was used to calculate concentrations of dissolved mn iii liu et al 2019 the percentage of extractable mn iii on a molar basis was calculated by dividing the amount Î¼mol of mn iii pyrophosphate formed by the initial amount Î¼mol of synthetic mno2 the kinetics of mn iii pyrophosphate extraction from synthetic mno2 were simulated with the first order rate law eq 1 klewicki and morgan 1999 liu et al 2019 1 mn iii pyrophosphate mn iii pyrophosphate max 1 e k l t where mn iii pyrophosphate max is the concentration of mn iii pyrophosphate at equilibrium k l hour 1 is the first order rate constant and t hour is the incubation period 2 7 quantum chemical calculations the gaussian 09 software package was applied for all quantum chemical calculations frisch et al 2009 the structure of bpa with minimum energy was optimized using the dft method at the b3lyp 6 311g level wang et al 2018 the fed values of the homo i e fed2 homo and lumo i e fed2 lumo charge density and spin density were obtained from the gaussian output files values of 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo were obtained to predict the reaction sites of electron extraction and hydroxyl attack fukui 1975 fukui et al 1954 1952 the charge density and spin density of radicals were used to predict the coupling reactions between radicals finally the molecular structure of tis and degradation pathways were proposed based on the results of the uhplc hrms ms analysis and the quantum calculations 2 8 toxicity prediction since data for risk assessment development for bpa degradation products are lacking acute and chronic toxicity of bpa and its degradation products were predicted using the us epa ecological structure activity relationships ecosar software version 2 2

include the half maximum effective concentrations ec50 half maximum lethal concentrations lc50 and chronic toxicity chv of each compound 3 results 3 1 bpa degradation by soluble mn iii in vessels with 0 01 to 1 mm soluble mn iii a rapid decline of bpa was observed and 20 26 of the initial 1 76 0 02 Î¼mol of bpa was consumed within the first 2 min of incubation suggesting mn iii mediated bpa degradation is a fast process fig 1 subsequent i e 2 min bpa removal occurred at lower rates and 20 64 of the initial amount of bpa was consumed following a 1 hour incubation period fig 1 soluble mn iii mediated bpa degradation yielded one major degradation product with a retention time matching that of the synthetic hca standard fig s3 a finding confirmed by uhplc hrms ms analysis fig s4 when 0 05 mm mn iii was incubated with 44 Î¼m bpa the conversion efficiency of bpa to hca reached 7 4 0 5 following a 10 min incubation period fig 1b fig s5 similar conversion efficiencies were observed with mn iii loadings 0 05 mm fig s5 suggesting that mn iii reacts preferentially with bpa rather than with hca 3 2 identification of bpa tis generated by soluble mn iii bpa tis generated in reaction vessels with soluble mn iii were identified using uhplc hrms ms analysis table 1 two tis were identified with a mass to charge ratio m z lower than the bpa parent ion while several tis had m z values higher than the bpa parent ion table 1 fig s6 the first ti ti 1 fig s6a b was eluted at 4 7 min with a m z of 151 0671 m h and matched the mass spectrum of the hca standard fig s4 the second ti ti 2 fig s6a c was eluted at 4 6 min with a m z of 133 0656 m h and correlated to the dehydration product of hca p4 fig 2 the remaining tis all had m z values higher than the bpa parent molecule table 1 these intermediates are likely formed via reactions between bpa hca ti 1 and hydroxyl radicals intermediate 3 ti 3 fig s6a d with a m z of 243 1019 and a predicted molecular formula of c15h15o3 likely represents an oxidized form of bpa since the fragmentation data did not reveal evidence of a dehydrated product like hca it is unlikely that ti 3 contains a similar isopropanol functional group suggesting a structure similar to p1 is more likely than structures p9 or p13 fig 2 ti 4 with a m z of 301 1436 has twice the molecular mass of hca ti 1 and likely represents different hca dimers p10 and p14 fig 2 ti 5 with a m z of 319 1328 could be formed in a coupling reaction between a bpa radical and a phenoxyl radical fragmentation of ti 5 yielded a single product with a m z of 108 0207 and a relative intensity 55 fig s6f which corresponds to a radical anion fragment with the possible formula of c6h4o2 and may correspond to the neutral loss of a bisphenol moiety p2 and p5 fig 2 fragmentation of ti 6 m z 377 1772 yielded a major fragment with a m z of 359 1664 suggesting the loss of h2o fig s6g further fragmentation gave several low intensity signals with predicted molecular formulae of c24h21o2 c18h17o2 and c23h20o3 generated by the loss of h2o a phenolate ion or a methyl radical respectively the fragmentation pattern of ti 6 supports connectivity resembling p12 versus p8 and p11 as it contains a biphenyl 2 2 diol moiety capable of forming a dibenzofuran from a loss of h2o fig 2 fig s6g ti 7 and ti 8 had the same m z of 453 2095 and 453 2093 respectively 0 287 ppm difference table 1 but differed in retention time by 1 4 min fig s6a h i fragmentation of both intermediates yielded a common m z of 359 1665 with intensities of 15 ti 7 and 25 ti 8 which likely corresponds to the loss of a phenolate anion resulting in the same product with a predicted formula of c24h23o3 ti 7 yielded another fragment m z 423 1623 with relative intensity greater than 10 while ti 8 yielded no other fragments above this intensity taken together these data suggest that ti 7 and ti 8 are structural isomers that correspond to the bpa dimers p6 and p7 fig 2 3 3 reaction schemes based on the identified tis a novel reaction scheme for bpa degradation by soluble mn iii is proposed fig 2 table 1 the quantum calculations support the proposed pathways and the two major reaction types namely hydroxylation and single electron coupling fig 2 hydroxylation of bpa most likely occurred at position 7c 13c due to the highest fed2 homo fed2 lumo value fig 3 thus the hydroxyl substitution reaction would generate the mono hydroxylated ti 1 p1 fig 2 ti 3 with an m z 243 1033 identified by uhplc hrms ms is consistent with the fed prediction of a hydroxylated product fig 3 table s1 the degradation of bpa is likely initiated by a single electron transfer to mn iii resulting in the formation of a bpa radical the electron rich position 1o 11o is a preferred target for mn iii attack and the formation of radical r1 fig 2 by considering both 2fed2 homo and charge density fig 3 fig s7 further the calculation results of spin densities table s1 show that the unpaired electron in r1 can delocalize to the 3c 7c or 5c positions and form r2 and r3 respectively fig 2 table s1 following radical formation coupling reactions via carbon carbon c c and carbon oxygen c o can occur and generate bpa dimers a para co coupling reaction is likely to occur between r1 and r2 by taking both spin densities and charge into account table s1 and would yield an unstable intermediate which re aromatizes to form p2 and either p3 hydration or p4 elimination fig 2 r2 could undergo Î² scission to yield the radical r2 1 which may engage in coupling reactions with r1 and r3 and yield products p2 and p5 with the same chemical formula respectively other coupling reactions can occur between r1 and r3 through ortho c o coupling and between r3 and r3 through ortho ortho c c coupling and yield p6 and p7 fig 2 uhplc hrms ms fragmentation of the tis confirmed the formation of these products p2 p7 in reaction assays with mn iii and bpa hca p3 in fig 2 was identified as a major bpa ti fig 1 which was susceptible to further degradation by mn iii the quantum calculations suggest that position 1o is most likely to lose an electron due to a higher 2fed2 homo value and the lowest charge density fig 3 fig s7 suggesting that r4 fig 2 could be formed via a one electron extraction and subsequently yield r5 and r6 due to electron resonance table s1 fig 2 these three radicals together with the radicals directly derived from bpa could trigger a series of reactions that give rise to several additional tis for example the coupling reactions between r4 and either r3 r2 1 or r6 would yield p8 p9 and p10 fig 2 respectively in addition the para co coupling reactions between r5 and r1 and between r5 and r4 could generate unstable intermediates and yield p2 and p9 respectively fig 2 lastly r6 could be coupling with r1 r3 r2 1 as well as r6 resulting in the formation of p11 p12 p13 and p14 respectively fig 2 uhplc hrms ms fragmentation of the tis corroborated the formation of these products from reactions with hca 3 4 pyrophosphate extractable mn iii from synthetic mno2 to compare the reactivity of the synthetic mno2 and surface mn iii free mno2 mn iii associated with synthetic mno2 was extracted by using pyrophosphate after eliminating the interference of conproportionation caused by mn ii see the method for details fig 4 a shows uv vis spectra of the extract obtained following pyrophosphate treatment for 150 h the spectrum shows the characteristic absorption peak of the mn iii pyrophosphate complex at 258 nm no absorbance increases at 258 nm were observed in incubations lacking synthetic mno2 indicating pyrophosphate did not contribute to the signal mn iii pyrophosphate formation only occurred in the presence of synthetic mno2 and a linear relationship r2 0 994 between 258 nm readings and the nominal concentrations of synthetic mno2 was observed fig 4a demonstrating that the amount of pyrophosphate extractable mn iii correlated with the initial loadings of synthetic mno2 extraction of mn iii with pyrophosphate was fast during the first 24 h of incubation and plateaued after about 170 h mn iii extracted from reaction vessels with 0 05 2 mm nominal concentration of synthetic mno2 accounted for 8 3 0 1 to 13 1 1 0 of the total synthetic mno2 loadings fig 4b 3 5 effect of mno2 associated mn iii on bpa degradation the contribution of surface associated mn iii to bpa degradation was assessed in reaction vessels amended with synthetic mno2 or surface mn iii free mno2 the amounts of bpa removed increased with the loadings of synthetic mno2 or surface mn iii free mno2 fig s8 for example 15 2 1 5 and 87 6 0 2 of the initial amount of 1 76 Î¼mol bpa was removed during a 10 min incubation period with 0 05 and 1 mm synthetic mno2 respectively table 2 fig s8a surface mn iii free mno2 removed less bpa fig s8b and 5 2 1 2 and 52 8 2 7 of the initial 1 76 Î¼mol bpa were transformed over a 10 min incubation period with 0 05 and 1 mm surface mn iii free mno2 respectively based on the differences in bpa consumption 10 35 of bpa degradation could be attributed to mn iii associated with mno2 during the initial 10 min reaction phase the initial bpa concentration decreases followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics but the rates declined after 10 min in both systems with synthetic mno2 or surface mn iii free mno2 therefore the initial rate constants k init min 1 were calculated from six early time points i e 10 min where linear relationships between the bpa removal and the loadings of synthetic mno2 and surface mn iii free mno2 were observed fig 5 the reaction rates of bpa removed by synthetic mno2 were 1 86 0 09 fold higher than those measured for surface mn iii free mno2 fig 5 indicating that mn iii contributes significantly to synthetic mno2 mediated bpa degradation 4 discussion solid phase mno2 is a naturally occurring mixed valence oxidant containing mn iii and mn iv with relevant roles for biogeochemical cycling in addition to mno2 soluble mn iii is now recognized as a strong oxidant and contributor to redox processes in environmental systems johnson et al 2018 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2014 and has been implicated in the degradation of adsorbed bpa im et al 2015 lin et al 2009 shobnam et al 2021 sun et al 2021 a number of studies reported reaction kinetics products and mechanisms in reaction assays with mno2 balgooyen et al 2017 im et al 2015 lin et al 2009 however such information is largely lacking for bpa degradation mediated by mn iii and the relative contributions of mn iv versus mn iii toward bpa degradation have not been disentangled 4 1 mn iii mediated bpa degradation the experimental efforts demonstrated that bpa is efficiently degraded by environmentally relevant concentrations i e 80 Î¼m of soluble mn iii madison et al 2013 suggesting that mn iii potentially plays a role in attenuating bpa in environmental systems similar to prior work studying mno2 mediated bpa degradation hca was a major ti in reaction vessels with soluble mn iii although a lower bpa to hca conversion efficiency of 7 4 was measured compared to 30 during mno2 mediated bpa degradation balgooyen et al 2017 im et al 2015 the differences in conversion efficiencies could be due to higher reactivity of mn iii than mno2 toward hca however the experimental data fig s5 do not support this explanation im et al 2015 a more plausible explanation is pathway differences and mn iii mediated bpa degradation generates other intermediates fig 2 in addition to hca not predominantly hca as was observed for mno2 mediated degradation balgooyen et al 2017 im et al 2015 lin et al 2009 4 2 bpa degradation products generated by mn iii the uhplc hrms ms analysis identified tis with eight different m z and quantum calculations predicted 14 different degradation products based on the detected m z and the predicted formulae fig 2 table 1 prior work documented the utility of this combined approach to predict degradation products and propose degradation pathways blotevogel et al 2010 huang and weber 2005 ohko et al 2002 wang et al 2018 in laboratory systems with mno2 11 bpa degradation products have been experimentally identified lin et al 2009 five of which were also observed in our studies with soluble mn iii nine of the 14 predicted bpa degradation products are unique and had not been described in prior studies that used mno2 as oxidant the main differences in the bpa degradation pathways mediated by mn iii versus mn iv are related to the formation of hca one major degradation product in both pathways hca is susceptible to oxidation by soluble mn iii and the transformation of hca gave rise to seven i e p8 p14 of the nine distinct degradation products proposed prior studies demonstrated that hca is susceptible to further degradation by mno2 however no tis of hca had been identified im et al 2015 shobnam et al 2021 bpa is a potential hormonally active agent and transformation degradation should result in reduced endocrine disrupting activity however the human health concerns associated with the degradation products are not clear some bpa degradation products have been documented to impact human cancer cells more than the parent compound mccormick et al 2011 nakamura et al 2011 suzuki et al 2004 and the major product observed in biotic and abiotic degradation hca has higher estrogen receptor binding affinity than bpa nakamura et al 2011 the ecosar program has predictive capabilities and can estimate the toxicity of bpa degradation products for which risk assessment data are not available to aquatic organisms such as fish daphnia and green algae ecosar categorizes bpa as toxic to very toxic lc50 ec50 chv 10 mg l 1 to aquatic organisms table s2 bpa degradation yielded products with lower ecosar predicted toxicity i e p1 p3 p13 and p14 however several e g p2 p5 p6 p7 p8 p11 and p12 have higher predicted toxicity than bpa and ecosar categorizes these compounds as very toxic lc50 ec50 chv 1 mg l 1 bpa concentrations in impacted environments are generally well below the very toxic level i e 1 mg l 1 im and lÃ¶ffler 2016 liao et al 2012 and it is not likely that mn iii mn iv mediated degradation will generate bpa degradation products at concentrations that would result in acute or chronic toxicity table s2 considering the predicted increase in global bpa production and the uncertainties of bpa fate and exposure routes under conditions of environmental change detailed toxicological studies of bpa transformation products to establish robust risk assessment are warranted liao et al 2012 research and markets 2021 4 3 contribution of mn iii in mno2 mediated bpa degradation the synthetic mno2 used in the experimental work contained about 13 mol mol mn iii fig 4 consistent with prior reports liu et al 2019 nico and zasoski 2001 solid mno2 is a mixed valence mineral phase of mn iv and mn iii oxides and previous work has implicated mn iii in mno2 reactivity huang et al 2018 nico and zasoski 2000 2001 the kinetic analysis performed here demonstrated that surface mn iii free mno2 mediates bpa degradation at lower rates than synthetic mno2 prior to the removal of surface associated mn iii fig 5 emphasizing the role of mn iii when studying mno2 mediated degradation mn iii mediated oxidation activity was most apparent during the early stages i e 10 min of incubation fig 1a which overlaps with the time period generally used for determining degradation rates in systems with synthetic mno2 in addition the data demonstrate that the surface associated mn iii present in the experimental reaction assays was insufficient to completely degrade the initial 1 76 Î¼mol of bpa fig 1 fig s8 the structural properties of synthetic mno2 and surface mn iii free mno2 differ which may affect the reactivity liu et al 2019 a number of studies have demonstrated that mn iii content rather than the phase structure of mno2 determines reactivity huang et al 2018 nico and zasoski 2000 2001 therefore the oxidation rates reported in systems with synthetic mno2 and attributed to mn iv likely represent the combined reactivity of mn iv and surface associated mn iii the participation of two distinct reactants is consistent with the observation of two different reaction mechanisms i e mn iii mediated and mn iv mediated in aqueous systems with mno2 nico and zasoski 2001 the discussion above considers the role of the mn iii associated with mno2 however a one electron reduction of mn iv can generate additional mn iii which may impact bpa degradation rate and extent in reaction vessels with mno2 previous studies have demonstrated that the contribution of internally generated mn iii is strongly ph dependent with negligible formation under neutral to slightly alkaline ph 7 9 conditions chen et al 2021 gao et al 2018 jiang et al 2010 wang et al 2022 the experiments in our study were conducted at ph 7 2 suggesting that interference from internally generated mn iii is unlikely to impact the results and their interpretation 4 4 theoretical considerations of mn iii and mno2 mediated bpa degradation abiotic redox reactions proceed in three steps including pre reaction complex formation electron transfer and post reaction complex dissociation nico and zasoski 2000 the electron transfer is generally considered the rate limiting step metzler nolte and kraatz 2006 the overall gibbs free energy change Î´g nef of the reaction is related to the reduction potential e and controls the rate of electron transfer between reductant and oxidant marcus 1993 the standard reduction potential eÂº values for the reduction of mn iv to mn ii and mn iii to mn ii are 1 29 v wang and stone 2006 and 1 51 v kostka et al 1995 respectively thus the reduction of mn iii to mn ii should be a faster reaction assuming that the eÂº of bpa oxidation in both reactions is the same also mn iii can directly coordinate with bpa through the empty Ï orbital t2g 3eg 1 tg 3eg 2 to accept electrons whereas mn iv would have to undergo outer sphere electron transfer t2g 3 t2g 3eg 2 during the oxidation process ukrainczyk and mcbride 1992 the latter process is more challenging because an outer electron transfer into a Ï orbital requires a change in the mn spin state ukrainczyk and mcbride 1992 our results are consistent with these theories and lower bpa degradation rates were observed in systems with surface mn iii free mno2 as oxidant fig 5 5 conclusions bpa is recalcitrant to microbial degradation in anoxic sediments but susceptible to chemical degradation by oxidized mn species this study highlights the role of mn iii in mno2 mediated degradation and surface associated mn iii substantially increases the rate of bpa degradation an observation that likely extends to other contaminants susceptible to oxidation by mno2 the findings indicate that oxic anoxic transition zones with active mn cycling are hotpots for bpa attenuation mn iii and mno2 mediated bpa degradation shares hca as a major intermediate however mechanistic differences lead to divergent transformation products with different toxicological profiles detailed knowledge about degradation pathways and products formed is required to meaningfully assess risk and predict potential threats to human health and to

14868,photogranules are a novel wastewater treatment technology that can utilize the sun s energy to treat water with lower energy input and have great potential for nutrient recovery applications they have been proven to efficiently remove nitrogen and carbon but show lower conversion rates for phosphorus compared to established treatment systems such as aerobic granular sludge in this study we successfully introduced polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos to an established photogranular culture we operated photobioreactors in sequencing batch mode with six cycles per day and alternating anaerobic dark and aerobic light phases we were able to increase phosphorus removal recovery by 6 times from 5 4 to 30 mg l d while maintaining similar nitrogen and carbon removal compared to photogranules without paos to maintain paos activity alternating anaerobic feast and aerobic famine conditions were required in future applications where aerobic conditions are dependent on in situ oxygenation via photosynthesis the process will rely on sunlight availability therefore we investigated the feasibility of the process under diurnal cycles with a 12 h anaerobic phase during nighttime and six short cycles during the 12 h daytime the 12 h anaerobic phase had no adverse effect on the paos and phototrophs due to the extension of one anaerobic phase to 12 h the six aerobic phases were shortened by 47 and consequently decreased the light hours per day this resulted in a decrease of phototrophs which reduced nitrogen removal and biomass productivity up to 30 finally we discuss and suggest strategies to apply pao enriched photogranules at large scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater microalgal bacterial granules enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr photoebpr microbial ecology aerobic granular sludge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater treatment must become more sustainable by applying technologies that recover energy and nutrients as well as removing pollutants recently the commercialization of well settling aerobic granular sludge ags as nereda has transformed biological wastewater treatment by increasing treatment capacity while decreasing the aerial footprint of treatment plants and saving on energy costs pronk et al 2015 still ags requires a substantial amount of mechanical aeration up to 50 of total energy costs and emits greenhouse gasses such as co2 and n2o brockmann et al 2021 pronk et al 2015 additionally ags systems are designed to convert nitrogen into n2 rather than recovering it as biomass an alternative to mechanical aeration is in situ oxygenation via photosynthesis in recent years photogranules have become a promising technology to close the co2 and o2 cycles in treatment systems and thereby lower or eliminate the need for external aeration photogranules consists of phototrophs microalgae cyanobacteria and other non phototrophic microorganisms nitrifiers denitrifiers that form dark green spheroid agglomerates the principle of photogranular wastewater treatment is to eliminate external o2 supply via in situ oxygenation by photosynthesis and sequester co2 produced internally via phototrophs photogranules can efficiently remove and recover carbon and nitrogen but show lower phosphorus assimilation than other established biological treatment systems trebuch et al 2020 enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is a widely used strategy in conventional activated sludge cas or ags systems to increase phosphorus removal the main contributors to phosphorus removal are polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos that can accumulate vast amounts of intracellular polyphosphate up to 0 38 mgp mgvss chen et al 2020 the addition of paos in phototrophic cultivation in suspension as photoebpr showed improved phosphorus removal compared to phototrophic systems only carvalho et al 2021 2018 mohamed et al 2021 oyserman et al 2017 the main metabolic functions within the photoebpr process are 1 photosynthesis 2 polyphosphate accumulation 3 chemoheterotrophy cod removal 4 nitrification and 5 denitrification combining all functions together in one reactor system can be difficult as competition for nutrients and inhibition e g by product accumulation can adversely affect microorganisms competition between phototrophs nitrifiers and paos for nutrients often led to suboptimal removal rates and a decrease in pao abundance carvalho et al 2018 mohamed et al 2021 additionally nitrite oxidizing bacteria have been shown to be sensitive to light and compete with phototrophs for co2 wang et al 2015 while paos are sensitive to high nitrite and oxygen concentration chen et al 2020 granules exhibit physical and chemical gradients e g light nutrients which facilitate stratification and spatial heterogeneity of microbial communities flemming and wingender 2010 trebuch 2022 this allows for niche differentiation and the coexistence of diverse organisms even those that feed on the same substrate or produce metabolites that negatively affect each other louca et al 2018 in the context of photoebpr photogranules could provide niches for all organisms phototrophs paos nitrifiers and denitrifiers allowing them to coexist in the same reactor while expressing high conversion rates needed for wastewater treatment a few studies already investigated the combination of photogranules and ags performing ebpr cai et al 2019 huang et al 2015 ji et al 2020 meng et al 2019 however reactor operation was often not optimized for the combination of phototrophs and paos which included low and uncontrolled light input huang et al 2015 light irradiation during anaerobic feeding huang et al 2015 meng et al 2019 cai et al 2019 and not ideal f m ratios with too short anaerobic feeding phases ji et al 2020 this resulted in unstable operation and impaired removal rates compared to other ags systems de graaff et al 2020 de kreuk et al 2005 pronk et al 2015 for example huang et al 2015 reported that the growth of microalgae on ags deteriorated phosphorus removal by 50 compared to ags without microalgae therefore it is vital to explore strategies to effectively incorporate paos into photogranules optimize operation conditions for high conversion rates and get a deeper insight into their microbial community assembly and functions additionally an important aspect of light driven processes is its dependency on the natural diel cycle of the sun when considering a photoebpr system with in situ oxygenation this would lead to an extended anaerobic phase during the night at night phototrophs would do maintenance and respire photosynthate e g carbohydrates stored during the light period so far there are no reports on the long term effect of an extended anaerobic phase on pao performance and it is unknown if operating a photoebpr system under a natural diel cycle is feasible in this study we integrated paos from ags into an established photogranular culture and analyzed microbial community assembly and functioning additionally we investigated an operation scheme that would allow the photoebpr process to run under natural light conditions diel cycle with 12 h light and 12 h darkness 2 materials and method 2 1 inoculation strategy and adaptation phase two different types of biomasses were used for inoculation 1 photogranules pg and 2 aerobic granular sludge ags performing enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr pg were obtained from previous research trebuch et al 2020 ags originated from the research of de graaff et al 2020 both types of granules were adapted to the experimental conditions nutrient load salinity ph and temperature for 28 days prior to the start of the actual experiment during the experimental phase three bioreactors were operated in parallel with different inocula 1 the first bioreactor termed pg1 received homogenized photogranules and intact ags in equal weight proportions homogenization by a miccra d9 homogeniser miccra gmbh 2 the second bioreactor termed pg2 received both intact photogranules and ags in equal weight proportions 3 the third bioreactor was operated with intact ags which served as a benchmark for phosphorus removal via ebpr 2 2 bioreactor set up and operation three glass bubble column bioreactors with a diameter of 10 cm a total height of 28 cm and a working volume of 1 6 l were used figure s1 all three bioreactors were operated as sequencing batch reactors sbrs employing six cycles per day during the co cultivation phase of photogranules and ags one cycle consisted of anaerobic influent feeding 5 min and reaction 70 min aerobic reaction 150 min settling 5 min effluent removal 3 min and nitrogen sparging 7 min figure s2 the co cultivation phase lasted for 56 days mixing of the bioreactor content was achieved via gassing with nitrogen n2 during the anaerobic phase and with air during the aerobic phase both enriched with 5 w w co2 in both phases a gas flowrate of 0 5 l min was maintained via mass flow controllers prior to feeding the bioreactor content was sparged with n2 gas for 7 min to remove residual o2 and to ensure anaerobic conditions the bioreactor temperature was kept at 20 0 5 c using external water baths and ph at 7 25 0 1 by automatic addition of 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh bioreactors pg1 and pg2 were illuminated during the aerobic phase with three warm white led panels each figure s3 the light sources were placed at three sides of the bioreactor with 90 between panel 1 and 2 90 between panel 2 and 3 and 180 between panel 3 and 1 the average incident light intensity measured over the whole bioreactor surface was 170 Âµmol m2 s with a total light input of 0 43 mol l day 15 h light per day synthetic wastewater was prepared by mixing tap water with 10 ml l of stock a and 10 ml l of stock b stock a consisted of 42 80 g l ch3coona 3h2o 1 09 g l kh2po4 and 4 20 g l k2hpo4 stock b consisted of 6 84 g l nh4cl 7 50 g l mgso4 7h2o 3 60 g l cacl2 2h2o 3 50 g l kcl and 100 ml l of trace element solution prepared according to vishniac and santer 1957 with 2 2 g l of znso4 7h2o instead of 22 g l the concentrations of major constituents of the final synthetic wastewater were 18 mg l of nitrogen 10 mg l phosphorus and 200 mg l of cod after 6 weeks day 14 56 of stable c n and p removal one of the anaerobic phases was extended to 12 h 720 min while maintaining an aerobic phase of 80 min the other five cycles had equal anaerobic phases of 40 min and aerobic phases of 80 min figure s2 the length of the light period in pg1 and pg2 was adjusted to the aerobic phases and was therefore shorter the overall light input was reduced from 15 h day to 8 h day and thereby to 0 23 mol l day the extension of the anaerobic phase was done gradually over one week it was first extended from 60 to 180 min with subsequent extension to 350 530 and 690 min until finally to 720 min the bioreactors were operated for an additional 3 weeks with a 12 h anaerobic phase throughout the whole experiment a hydraulic retention time hrt of 0 33 days was applied with a volume exchange ratio of 0 5 per cycle the solids retention time srt was maintained at 14 days by daily removal of 114 ml of mixed liquor the nutrient load was 55 mg l d of nitrogen 30 mg l d of phosphorus and 600 mg l d of cod 2 3 analytical methods during the experiment liquid samples were taken from the influent and the effluent of the bioreactors to study nutrient removal in addition a liquid sample was taken at the end of the anaerobic phase once a week one cycle on day 4 11 15 25 30 36 46 and 53 or two consecutive cycles on day 67 73 and 79 were sampled in 5 or 10 min intervals to gain more insight in conversion kinetics all liquid samples were filtered through 0 2 Âµm syringe filters pes membrane vwr and analyzed for ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n and phosphate po4 3 p with a skalar san autoanalyzer skalar analytical b v according to standard methods apha et al 2012 acetate was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc for more information see supplemental materials for rapid testing of the liquid samples for po4 3 p the phosver 3 kit hach lange was used total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss and sludge volume index svi were assessed according to standard methods apha et al 2012 2 4 biomass characteristics and morphology the elemental composition of homogenized freeze dried biomass was measured for c and n analyses an aliquot about 2 mg was folded into a tin cup and analyzed in an organic elemental analyzer flash 2000 interscience cellular p was analyzed by combusting an aliquot about 2 mg for 30 min at 550 c in pyrex glass tubes followed by a digestion step with 10 ml persulfate 2 5 for 30 min at 121 c the digested solution was measured for po4 3 p on the skalar san autoanalyzer skalar analytical b v chlorophyll was extracted with ethanol 100 from biomass samples from pg1 and pg2 according to the protocol of cuaresma franco et al 2012 the full extraction protocol can be found in the supplemental materials biomass samples were observed via a stereomicroscope leica m205c to assess granule morphology and the integration of photogranules and ags images were taken using the leica application suite v4 13 photogranule size was determined by analyzing multiple microscopic images per sample with a total of at least 400 particles using imagej milferstedt et al 2017 2 5 microbial community assessment and functional annotation the microbial community of day 0 8 15 31 53 67 and 79 was assessed using 16s and 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing according to trebuch et al 2020 the detailed dna extraction sequencing and processing of sequencing reads can be found in the supplemental materials the raw 16s and 18s rrna gene sequence data is available in the ebi database under project number prjeb54716 the 16s dataset was annotated with functions using the tool faprotax louca et al 2016 the default database of faprotax was extended with taxa functionally annotated within the midas database version 4 8 1 nierychlo et al 2020 it is important to note that several functions can be annotated to one single taxon and consequently sum of the functional distribution can exceed 100 3 results 3 1 assembly of pg photogranules enriched with polyphosphate accumulating organisms in this study we successfully combined photogranules pg with aerobic granular sludge ags enriched with polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos to form pg enriched with paos named pg pg were operated as a phototrophic enhanced biological phosphorus removal photoebpr system to investigate the assembly of pg two different inoculation strategies were tested 1 pg were mechanically homogenized and co cultivated with intact ags referred to as pg1 2 both pg and ags were kept intact and co cultivated referred to as pg2 the co cultivation phase lasted for 56 days and the assembly of the pg was followed via microscopic observations fig 1 the first pg appeared in both pg1 and pg2 after one week of cultivation they arose among intact native pg in pg2 and ags within 2 3 weeks of operation the bioreactors were completely dominated by pg most pg were in the range of 0 8 1 4 mm in diameter with a maximum of 1 8 mm the morphology of pg was characterized by an interwoven network of cyanobacteria with cauliflower shaped aggregates of ags in between white areas on surface fig 1 while the pg morphology of pg1 and pg2 was similar two modes of assembly could be identified depending on the size and morphology of the initial pg and ags in the first mode of assembly especially in the pg1 treatment ags were colonized by the homogenized microbial community of pg and were gradually overgrown by phototrophic organisms fig 1 upper path over time the phototrophs covered the whole surface and formed a thick mat with pao colonies protruding the surface this eventually resulted in the typical pg morphology the second mode of assembly was pg being colonized by small to medium sized ags fig 1 lower path over time the ags were incorporated into the pg and finally formed mature pg similar to the ones obtained via the first mode of assembly 3 2 bioreactor performance of pg and ags during the co cultivation phase all three bioreactors pg1 pg2 ags were operated with 6 cycles per day with 70 min of anaerobic dark and 150 min of aerobic light phase despite the different inoculation strategies of pg1 and pg2 their performance during steady state was similar reaching full removal of nitrogen phosphorus and cod already after one week of operation 53 1 mgn l d 29 9 0 5 mgp l d and 600 mgcod l d figure s4 phosphorus release and reuptake dynamics were similar in all three bioreactors with maximum release concentrations of about 60 mgp l fig 2 a c while ags showed the highest specific phosphorus release with 25 mgp gvss compared to 10 and 12 mgp gvss for pg1 and pg2 the acetate was quickly consumed in all three bioreactors at similar rates ammonium concentrations were relatively stable during the anaerobic phase and ammonium was primarily consumed during the aerobic phase all three bioreactors showed excellent settling properties with average svi values from day 10 to day 56 of 49 3 ml g pg1 52 3 ml g pg2 and 42 3 ml g ags figure s5 and average effluent concentrations of 24 15 mgtss l pg1 67 72 mgtss l pg2 and 15 3 mgtss l ags figure s6 both pg1 and pg2 showed full nitrogen removal while ags achieved 50 60 removal the phototrophs in pg1 and pg2 could make use of light energy and consequently had double the biomass productivity which resulted in 2 3x higher biomass concentration 5 9 0 5 gvss l in pg1 and 5 2 0 5 gvss l in pg2 compared to 2 2 0 2 gvss l in ags figure s6 due to the difference in biomass concentration despite similar bioreactor performance the specific removal rates for cod and p observed for pg1 and pg2 were 2 3x lower compared to ags figure s7 10 the phosphorus content in the biomass of ags was more than double 12 3 w w compared to in pg1 and pg2 4 6 w w fig 2d overall pg showed 4 5x higher phosphorus recovery potential than native pg which exhibited about 1 w w of phosphorus in their biomass ags showed nitrification activity of maximum 5 mgn l d 3 3 mgn gvss d which helped with ammonium removal but not with overall nitrogen removal denitrification may have occurred but was not investigated in this study the dissolved oxygen do concentration during the aerobic light phase increased for both pg1 and pg2 in a similar fashion and reached a maximum concentration of about 12 mg l at the end of the phase for ags the do increased over the course of the aerobic phase and peaked at around 6 mg l this was a clear difference due to the in situ oxygenation via phototrophs in pg1 and pg2 in all three bioreactors the do rose further once all phosphorus was taken up suggesting reduced respiration by paos and other heterotrophs 3 3 the effect of a 12 h anaerobic phase on pg and ags systems to test the pg performance under natural light conditions we extended one of the anaerobic cycles to 12 h thus simulating the night in a diurnal cycle the overall light input decreased by 47 because the inclusion of the 12 h anaerobic dark phase required shortening of the aerobic light phases to preserve the feast famine regime throughout the rest of the cycle the reduction of the light input resulted in an equivalent decrease in phototrophic biomass productivity and a decrease in the biomass concentration over time fig 3 d and s3 thereby the overall nitrogen assimilation also decreased and overall nitrogen removal in pg1 and pg2 was reduced by 12 16 fig 3f similar to ags pg1 established an active nitrifying community which contributed to full ammoniacal nitrogen removal the nitrifying activity was low and comparable to the one of ags with 5 mg l d turned over pg2 had only marginable conversion of ammonium into nitrite or nitrate and thereby did not show full ammoniacal nitrogen removal generally ags was not affected by the change in operation conditions and maintained similar biomass productivity biomass concentration and specific removal rates to that seen during the co cultivation phase fig 3 figure s7 10 phosphorus release and reuptake dynamics were almost identical for all three bioreactors and comparable to the co cultivation phase interestingly the release during the 12 h anaerobic phase max 62 mg l of phosphorus was higher than in the subsequent 40 min anaerobic phases max 54 mg l of phosphorus fig 3a c still the total phosphorus removal was complete in all three bioreactors the specific phosphorus release of ags stayed almost equal releasing 24 mgp gvss compared to 25 mgp gvss during the co cultivation phase the specific phosphorus release rate for pg1 and pg2 was lower releasing 7 and 8 mgp gvss compared to 10 and 12 mgp gvss during the co cultivation phase fig 2e and fig 3e the svi of pg1 and pg2 increased slightly to 52 5 ml g and 55 4 ml g while the svi of ags decreased to 36 1 ml g figure s5 average biomass concentrations in the effluent of all three bioreactors were similar at about 20 mg l figure s6 3 4 microbial community analysis and functional annotation during the co cultivation phase and the extension of the anaerobic phase to 12 h chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b were measured as an indication of the fraction of phototrophic biomass fig 4 pg1 and pg2 had different starting chlorophyll concentrations pg1 23 mg gvss and pg2 18 mg gvss but showed similar values at the end of the co cultivation phase to about 28 mg gvss the extension of one anaerobic phase to 12 h had a strong effect on the phototrophic community the light input was reduced by 47 and that led to a decrease of the phototrophic biomass fraction of 40 50 during the last 3 weeks of operation the microbial community of pg pg1 pg2 and ags was analyzed both with 16s and 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing when looking from the inoculum to the end of the experiment the prokaryotic community converged for pg1 and pg2 in the last three sampling points showing the strong selective effect of operating the bioreactors as photoebpr fig 5 the photogranular inoculum consisted of a diverse prokaryotic community of several cyanobacteria e g cephalothrix komarekiana alkalinema pantanalense leptolyngbya boryanum pseudanabaena biceps and chemoheterotrophic organisms e g thauera sp zoogloea sp prosthecobacter sp and shinella sp figure s14 at the end of the co cultivation phase day 53 and 12 h anaerobic phase the community was simplified day 67 and 79 figure s15 alkalinema pantanalense became the dominant filamentous cyanobacteria and most abundant prokaryotic organism in pg1 and pg2 while the abundance of chemoheterotrophs thauera sp and zoogloea sp were below 1 candidatus accumulibacter sp and tetrasphaera sp became the dominant paos making up about 52 in ags and 7 15 in pg1 and pg2 after enrichment other paos such as dechloromonas sp and halobacter sp were also present in all three bioreactors but in low abundance 1 3 nitrifiers candidatus nitrotoga and nitrosomonas sp were abundant in small amounts below 1 in all three bioreactors with ags and pg1 as the only two bioreactors showing nitrifying activity the eukaryotic community in pg1 and pg2 was characterized by green algae botryosphaerella sp chlorella sp chlorococcum sp and desmodesmus sp fig 5b figure s14 similar to the prokaryotic community the eukaryotic algal community started off more diverse and converged to a simplified community with chlorella sp and desmodesmus sp as dominant green algae at the end of the co cultivation phase fig 5d next to eukaryotic algae other organisms such as amoeba rotifers and fungi were detected in pg1 and pg2 2 11 the eukaryotic community of ags was characterized by only amoeba rotifers and fungi and an absence of eukaryotic algae the functional annotation of the 16s dataset revealed different distributions of functions for ags pg pg and pg 12 h ags was dominated by paos 54 nitrification 1 and denitrification 55 while pg was characterized by photosynthesis 48 chemoheterotrophy 52 nitrification 0 2 and denitrification 7 fig 6 and table 1 the hybrid granule pg showed photosynthesis 58 pao 10 chemoheterotrophy 36 nitrification 1 and denitrification 10 when extending one anaerobic phase to 12 h in pg 12 h photosynthesis was reduced by 4 and glycogen accumulating organisms gao activity started to appear with 21 of organisms performing glycogen accumulation 4 discussion 4 1 pg assembly and granule morphology biofilm structures such as granules are largely determined by substrate concentration gradients at the biofilm liquid interface the detachment forces working on the biofilm hydrodynamic shear the biomass yield and extracellular polymeric substance eps production loosdrecht et al 1997 the key for ags formation was the introduction of an anaerobic feeding phase followed by an aerobic reaction phase in this operation scheme paos and gaos incorporate cod anaerobically as storage polymers pha and grow on these aerobically that yields a lower aerobic growth rate compared to heterotrophic bacteria but results in dense and sturdy biofilms de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 the granulation further relies to some extent on hydrodynamic conditions in sequencing batch reactors or plug flow reactors where shear force can determine granule morphology nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 photogranules formation was proven to work differently and is not necessarily dependent on specific operation schemes motile filamentous cyanobacteria govern photogranulation by the generation of extracellular polymeric substances eps and locomotive entanglement milferstedt et al 2017 trebuch et al 2020 this has been shown to work both in hydrodynamic conditions in sequencing batch reactors and also in static incubations confirming that external drivers such as hydrodynamic shear washout and fluctuating chemical conditions are not necessary for photogranulation gikonyo et al 2021 milferstedt et al 2017 pg assembled rapidly from a diverse and species rich inoculum of pg and ags and showed full treatment capacity 1 2 weeks after inoculation the interplay of filamentous cyanobacteria i e alkalinema pantanalense forming a complex network and ags i e paos forming cauliflower shaped agglomerates were crucial for pg assembly on one hand the filamentous cyanobacteria formed mat like structures in photogranules that served as a harbor for other organisms to embed themselves in milferstedt et al 2017 on the other hand the motility of filamentous cyanobacteria could actively capture and incorporate microbial communities such as ags into the photogranules structure this locomotive entanglement of particles e g sand grains by cyanobacteria was previously observed in natural occurring photogranules such as cryoconites or microbialites brehm et al 2003 takeuchi et al 2001 further the cauliflower shaped agglomerates of ags provided the phototrophic organisms a rugged surface to attach to the early attachment of the pg microbial community on ags occurred especially in cracks and crevices these assembly mechanisms manifested in the two identified pg assembly modes described in fig 1 smaller homogenized pgs colonized the surface of larger ags fig 1 upper path or ags were incorporated by locomotive entanglement of intact pg fig 1 lower path the particle size ratio of pg intact or homogenized to ags might have been relevant in determining which assembly pathway predominates 4 2 pg functions and functional redundancy the desired functional groups in pg are 1 oxygenic photosynthesis 2 polyphosphate accumulation 3 chemoheterotrophy cod removal with 4 nitrification and 5 denitrification as optional functions to enhance overall nitrogen removal representatives of these functions were presented above figs 5 and 6 in complex and diverse microbial communities each function or metabolism can often be performed by multiple taxonomically distinct organisms louca et al 2016 due to the specific and selective operation conditions feast famine the microbial community was simplified figure s14 and s15 but still had at least 5 taxa per function that were capable of the same metabolism this established a functional redundancy that is important for the resilience of the microbial community and functions to biotic and abiotic influences environmental perturbations although the microbial community composition in the beginning of the co cultivation phase was still changing fig 5 the bioreactor performance was stable figure s4 10 confirming functional redundancy in the pg system functional stability during taxonomic fluctuations is a commonly observed phenomenon in natural ecosystems and biological wastewater treatment systems wang et al 2011 another example for functional redundancy is the taxonomic change in the functional group of chemoheterotrophs and denitrifiers during the assembly from pg to pg thauera and zoogloea are prominent representatives of these functional groups in photogranules trebuch et al 2020 in pg they were outcompeted by paos and gaos that consumed all acetate during the anaerobic phase leaving no organic carbon substrate in the bulk liquid for thauera zoogloea to grow during the aerobic phase besides the very specific polyphosphate metabolism of paos they can also perform chemoheterotrophy and denitrification that can replace the functions of thauera and zoogloea the high activity of polyphosphate cycling in ags and pg suggests that the actual abundance of paos might be higher than determined by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 5 and s14 the relative abundance might differ from actual biomass fractions due to dna extraction biases primer biases and variation in cell size and 16s 18s rrna gene copy number between species albertsen et al 2015 this issue of underrepresentation was especially evident for paos when investigating microbial communities in conventional wastewater treatment systems stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 other techniques such as staining paos with fluorescence in situ hybridization fish probes weissbrodt et al 2013 or a recently suggested de novo proteomics approach kleikamp et al 2021 might show a higher enrichment of paos in ags and pg 4 3 pg wastewater treatment performance compared to previous photogranules and non granular photoebpr systems abouhend et al 2018 ji et al 2020 mohamed et al 2021 cod and nitrogen removal were improved by 2 3x in pg expect for pg where similar n removal was found trebuch et al 2020 p removal was enhanced by 3 6x due to integration of paos into the pg the overall removal capacity and removal kinetics for phosphorus and cod of pg were consistent with other lab scale operated ags systems while showing higher rates of nitrogen assimilation into biomass de graaff et al 2020 de kreuk et al 2005 the introduction of photosynthesis led to a two fold increase in biomass productivity and nitrogen removal in pg while maintaining the same cod removal and phosphorus dynamics as ags generating metabolic energy from light also simultaneously produced oxygen for heterotrophic activities in situ oxygenation via photosynthesis increases the association of phototrophs and heterotrophs via the exchange of o2 and co2 further it can reduce or even remove the need for mechanical aeration which potentially could save up to 50 of the total energy costs currently needed in conventional wastewater treatment brockmann et al 2021 pg achieved full removal of cod n and p before the end of the cycles indicating that a larger removal capacity is surely attainable cod was already fully consumed after 20 min into the anaerobic feeding phase total 70 min fig 2 and 3 while p reuptake was completed 60 min into the aerobic phase total of 150 min and n was completely removed after 100 min the early n and p depletion during the aerobic phase possibly hindered phototrophs from functioning at maximum capacity and nitrifiers from fully establishing further paos would be able to cope with higher cod and p loads as demonstrated in previous studies de graaff et al 2020 de kreuk et al 2005 this suggests that the nutrient load in general can be increased increasing cod and p load would lead to an increased enrichment of paos and ease competition for p additionally an increased n load could facilitate simultaneous nitrification and denitrification which can occur in the aerobic and anoxic zones of granules with sizes of 1 5 mm de kreuk et al 2005 pronk et al 2015 combining phototrophs and paos in photoebpr systems can also have adverse effects cai et al 2019 observed an increase in nitrogen removal due to the growth of phototrophs but phosphorus removal by paos appeared to be hindered and consequently lowered a similar observation was reported previously by huang et al 2015 they concluded that light and phototrophs inhibited nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and nitrite accumulation in the bioreactor led to inhibition of paos which are sensitive to elevated nitrite concentrations pijuan et al 2010 nitrification is frequently observed in photogranules abouhend et al 2018 tiron et al 2015 trebuch et al 2020 but did not fully establish in pg this can be attributed to competition for co2 and ammonium risgaard petersen et al 2004 which was rapidly consumed in the pg systems however at elevated ammonium concentrations nitrite accumulation could become an issue and should be investigated 4 4 how to fit the pg process into a natural diurnal cycle light is a primary energy input for pg and will majorly constrain the treatment capacity of the system by using natural light instead of artificial light we maximize the utilization of the sun s energy with minimum energy losses making it more sustainable and economically feasible blanken et al 2013 high sunlight input throughput the year therefore will be crucial for the efficiency of the pg process this favorable condition can be found predominantly in lower latitude countries with higher light input year round slegers et al 2013 in a light driven wastewater treatment system operated under natural light conditions all daylight should be used as efficiently as possible when operating a pg system as sequencing batch reactor the culture must be temporarily shaded in the daytime during the anaerobic phases and consequently valuable light energy remains unused this was seen in the decrease of phototrophs and nitrogen removal in pg when accommodating 6 short cycles within the 12 h daytime and having a 12 h anaerobic phase fig 2 4 instead of operating in a time based manner in one reactor vessel sequencing batch reactor with defined phases in time it could be more advantageous to design the process in space recently the ags process was performed continuously as plug flow with defined reactor compartments for each phase li et al 2021 sun et al 2019 from these studies valuable insights can be gained about how to operate a pg system at large scale a plug flow system would allow the treatment process to run continuously and have an aerobic compartment illuminated throughout the entire day utilizing all light energy it is important that the continuous system is designed and operated in a way that photogranules formation and functioning at high rates are still facilitated although a 12 h anaerobic phase had no negative effect on phosphorus cycling of paos there was a proliferation of gaos towards the end of the 3 weeks experimental phase paos and gaos have a similar metabolism and compete anaerobically for the organic carbon source acetate in this study while gao can proliferate in the same feast famine conditions as paos they do not have the benefit of using polyphosphate as an intermediate energy storage and can only use glycogen chen et al 2020 this results in strongly decreased phosphorus removal in gao dominated systems lopez vazquez et al 2009 while phosphorus removal was not affected in the 3 weeks of operating at a 12 h anaerobic phase the proliferation of gaos in photogranular systems should be investigated in future studies 4 5 advantages and shortcomings of a pg wastewater treatment system the advantage of including phototrophic chemoautotrophic nitrifiers and heterotrophic paos denitrifiers processes in one system is that overall biomass productivity and thereby biomass assimilation of nutrients was increased currently high biomass productivity is not desired in conventional treatment systems since it can have a significant impact on the operational costs due to sludge disposal cieÅlik et al 2015 however using the produced biomass as a resource could transform wastewater treatment systems into valuable resource recovery facilities where besides the major elements c n p microelements e g fe mo zn cu are also reclaimed and transformed kehrein et al 2020 suleiman et al 2020 the whole biomass could be used either as fertilizer c n p and microelements or fractionated for extracellular polymeric substances eps or polyhydroxyalkanoates pha for biopolymer production kehrein et al 2020 including phototrophs into the treatment system can potentially extend the product range of the biomass by e g photopigments lipids proteins and antioxidants borowitzka 2013 pg rapidly assembled from pg and ags and showed resilience to a 12h anaerobic phase this suggests that the pg process can be quickly established and is suitable to be operate under a natural diel cycle a hurdle for pg application as for all light driven processes e g phototrophic microalgal production is the design of a full scale system photobioreactors need a high surface to volume ratio to harness light common designs are closed tubular systems or shallow 20 40 cm deep open raceway ponds consequently light driven wastewater treatment will have larger areal footprints compared to conventional wastewater treatment techniques such as cas or ags nevertheless this disadvantage of the pg system will be outweighed by its advantages using the sun s energy for lowering or eradicating mechanical aeration and producing valuable biomass for nutrient recovery and other raw materials eps bulk chemicals transitioning to light driven technologies i e pg will require us to rethink wastewater treatment systems and ideally align resource e g water nutrients consumption and recovery to the diurnal cycle of the sun constraining use and discharge of waste water predominantly to the light periods of the day could be an effective tool to increase resource use efficiency and reduce our ecological footprint this might be necessary to accommodate the needs of an ever growing population and ensure a sustainable future 5 conclusion in this study we successfully integrated paos i e candidatus accumulibacter tetrasphaera sp from ags into native pgs and created a hybrid granule named pg performing photoebpr thereby pg significantly improved phosphorus recovery by 3 6x compared to native pg used in this study photogranules from other studies and other microalgae based technologies photoautotrophs such as cyanobacteria and green algae additionally generated metabolic energy from light and led to 2 3x higher biomass productivity of pg compared to ags operating the pg system under a diurnal cycle of 12 h light and 12 h dark resulted in an 12 h anaerobic phase which had no adverse effect on polyphosphate cycling or phototrophic activity however the short anaerobic phases during the 12 h daytime resulted in an overall lower light availability due to shorter aerobic phases and consequently reduced phototrophic growth this decreased biomass productivity and nitrogen removal during operation under a natural diurnal cycle by around 30 therefore we suggest reconsidering the bioreactor operation in sequencing batch mode and developing a continuous operation mode with separate anaerobic dark and aerobic light compartments this would allow photogranules to maximally utilize the light input during daytime and optimize such a light driven wastewater treatment system

14868,photogranules are a novel wastewater treatment technology that can utilize the sun s energy to treat water with lower energy input and have great potential for nutrient recovery applications they have been proven to efficiently remove nitrogen and carbon but show lower conversion rates for phosphorus compared to established treatment systems such as aerobic granular sludge in this study we successfully introduced polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos to an established photogranular culture we operated photobioreactors in sequencing batch mode with six cycles per day and alternating anaerobic dark and aerobic light phases we were able to increase phosphorus removal recovery by 6 times from 5 4 to 30 mg l d while maintaining similar nitrogen and carbon removal compared to photogranules without paos to maintain paos activity alternating anaerobic feast and aerobic famine conditions were required in future applications where aerobic conditions are dependent on in situ oxygenation via photosynthesis the process will rely on sunlight availability therefore we investigated the feasibility of the process under diurnal cycles with a 12 h anaerobic phase during nighttime and six short cycles during the 12 h daytime the 12 h anaerobic phase had no adverse effect on the paos and phototrophs due to the extension of one anaerobic phase to 12 h the six aerobic phases were shortened by 47 and consequently decreased the light hours per day this resulted in a decrease of phototrophs which reduced nitrogen removal and biomass productivity up to 30 finally we discuss and suggest strategies to apply pao enriched photogranules at large scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater microalgal bacterial granules enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr photoebpr microbial ecology aerobic granular sludge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater treatment must become more sustainable by applying technologies that recover energy and nutrients as well as removing pollutants recently the commercialization of well settling aerobic granular sludge ags as nereda has transformed biological wastewater treatment by increasing treatment capacity while decreasing the aerial footprint of treatment plants and saving on energy costs pronk et al 2015 still ags requires a substantial amount of mechanical aeration up to 50 of total energy costs and emits greenhouse gasses such as co2 and n2o brockmann et al 2021 pronk et al 2015 additionally ags systems are designed to convert nitrogen into n2 rather than recovering it as biomass an alternative to mechanical aeration is in situ oxygenation via photosynthesis in recent years photogranules have become a promising technology to close the co2 and o2 cycles in treatment systems and thereby lower or eliminate the need for external aeration photogranules consists of phototrophs microalgae cyanobacteria and other non phototrophic microorganisms nitrifiers denitrifiers that form dark green spheroid agglomerates the principle of photogranular wastewater treatment is to eliminate external o2 supply via in situ oxygenation by photosynthesis and sequester co2 produced internally via phototrophs photogranules can efficiently remove and recover carbon and nitrogen but show lower phosphorus assimilation than other established biological treatment systems trebuch et al 2020 enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is a widely used strategy in conventional activated sludge cas or ags systems to increase phosphorus removal the main contributors to phosphorus removal are polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos that can accumulate vast amounts of intracellular polyphosphate up to 0 38 mgp mgvss chen et al 2020 the addition of paos in phototrophic cultivation in suspension as photoebpr showed improved phosphorus removal compared to phototrophic systems only carvalho et al 2021 2018 mohamed et al 2021 oyserman et al 2017 the main metabolic functions within the photoebpr process are 1 photosynthesis 2 polyphosphate accumulation 3 chemoheterotrophy cod removal 4 nitrification and 5 denitrification combining all functions together in one reactor system can be difficult as competition for nutrients and inhibition e g by product accumulation can adversely affect microorganisms competition between phototrophs nitrifiers and paos for nutrients often led to suboptimal removal rates and a decrease in pao abundance carvalho et al 2018 mohamed et al 2021 additionally nitrite oxidizing bacteria have been shown to be sensitive to light and compete with phototrophs for co2 wang et al 2015 while paos are sensitive to high nitrite and oxygen concentration chen et al 2020 granules exhibit physical and chemical gradients e g light nutrients which facilitate stratification and spatial heterogeneity of microbial communities flemming and wingender 2010 trebuch 2022 this allows for niche differentiation and the coexistence of diverse organisms even those that feed on the same substrate or produce metabolites that negatively affect each other louca et al 2018 in the context of photoebpr photogranules could provide niches for all organisms phototrophs paos nitrifiers and denitrifiers allowing them to coexist in the same reactor while expressing high conversion rates needed for wastewater treatment a few studies already investigated the combination of photogranules and ags performing ebpr cai et al 2019 huang et al 2015 ji et al 2020 meng et al 2019 however reactor operation was often not optimized for the combination of phototrophs and paos which included low and uncontrolled light input huang et al 2015 light irradiation during anaerobic feeding huang et al 2015 meng et al 2019 cai et al 2019 and not ideal f m ratios with too short anaerobic feeding phases ji et al 2020 this resulted in unstable operation and impaired removal rates compared to other ags systems de graaff et al 2020 de kreuk et al 2005 pronk et al 2015 for example huang et al 2015 reported that the growth of microalgae on ags deteriorated phosphorus removal by 50 compared to ags without microalgae therefore it is vital to explore strategies to effectively incorporate paos into photogranules optimize operation conditions for high conversion rates and get a deeper insight into their microbial community assembly and functions additionally an important aspect of light driven processes is its dependency on the natural diel cycle of the sun when considering a photoebpr system with in situ oxygenation this would lead to an extended anaerobic phase during the night at night phototrophs would do maintenance and respire photosynthate e g carbohydrates stored during the light period so far there are no reports on the long term effect of an extended anaerobic phase on pao performance and it is unknown if operating a photoebpr system under a natural diel cycle is feasible in this study we integrated paos from ags into an established photogranular culture and analyzed microbial community assembly and functioning additionally we investigated an operation scheme that would allow the photoebpr process to run under natural light conditions diel cycle with 12 h light and 12 h darkness 2 materials and method 2 1 inoculation strategy and adaptation phase two different types of biomasses were used for inoculation 1 photogranules pg and 2 aerobic granular sludge ags performing enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr pg were obtained from previous research trebuch et al 2020 ags originated from the research of de graaff et al 2020 both types of granules were adapted to the experimental conditions nutrient load salinity ph and temperature for 28 days prior to the start of the actual experiment during the experimental phase three bioreactors were operated in parallel with different inocula 1 the first bioreactor termed pg1 received homogenized photogranules and intact ags in equal weight proportions homogenization by a miccra d9 homogeniser miccra gmbh 2 the second bioreactor termed pg2 received both intact photogranules and ags in equal weight proportions 3 the third bioreactor was operated with intact ags which served as a benchmark for phosphorus removal via ebpr 2 2 bioreactor set up and operation three glass bubble column bioreactors with a diameter of 10 cm a total height of 28 cm and a working volume of 1 6 l were used figure s1 all three bioreactors were operated as sequencing batch reactors sbrs employing six cycles per day during the co cultivation phase of photogranules and ags one cycle consisted of anaerobic influent feeding 5 min and reaction 70 min aerobic reaction 150 min settling 5 min effluent removal 3 min and nitrogen sparging 7 min figure s2 the co cultivation phase lasted for 56 days mixing of the bioreactor content was achieved via gassing with nitrogen n2 during the anaerobic phase and with air during the aerobic phase both enriched with 5 w w co2 in both phases a gas flowrate of 0 5 l min was maintained via mass flow controllers prior to feeding the bioreactor content was sparged with n2 gas for 7 min to remove residual o2 and to ensure anaerobic conditions the bioreactor temperature was kept at 20 0 5 c using external water baths and ph at 7 25 0 1 by automatic addition of 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh bioreactors pg1 and pg2 were illuminated during the aerobic phase with three warm white led panels each figure s3 the light sources were placed at three sides of the bioreactor with 90 between panel 1 and 2 90 between panel 2 and 3 and 180 between panel 3 and 1 the average incident light intensity measured over the whole bioreactor surface was 170 Âµmol m2 s with a total light input of 0 43 mol l day 15 h light per day synthetic wastewater was prepared by mixing tap water with 10 ml l of stock a and 10 ml l of stock b stock a consisted of 42 80 g l ch3coona 3h2o 1 09 g l kh2po4 and 4 20 g l k2hpo4 stock b consisted of 6 84 g l nh4cl 7 50 g l mgso4 7h2o 3 60 g l cacl2 2h2o 3 50 g l kcl and 100 ml l of trace element solution prepared according to vishniac and santer 1957 with 2 2 g l of znso4 7h2o instead of 22 g l the concentrations of major constituents of the final synthetic wastewater were 18 mg l of nitrogen 10 mg l phosphorus and 200 mg l of cod after 6 weeks day 14 56 of stable c n and p removal one of the anaerobic phases was extended to 12 h 720 min while maintaining an aerobic phase of 80 min the other five cycles had equal anaerobic phases of 40 min and aerobic phases of 80 min figure s2 the length of the light period in pg1 and pg2 was adjusted to the aerobic phases and was therefore shorter the overall light input was reduced from 15 h day to 8 h day and thereby to 0 23 mol l day the extension of the anaerobic phase was done gradually over one week it was first extended from 60 to 180 min with subsequent extension to 350 530 and 690 min until finally to 720 min the bioreactors were operated for an additional 3 weeks with a 12 h anaerobic phase throughout the whole experiment a hydraulic retention time hrt of 0 33 days was applied with a volume exchange ratio of 0 5 per cycle the solids retention time srt was maintained at 14 days by daily removal of 114 ml of mixed liquor the nutrient load was 55 mg l d of nitrogen 30 mg l d of phosphorus and 600 mg l d of cod 2 3 analytical methods during the experiment liquid samples were taken from the influent and the effluent of the bioreactors to study nutrient removal in addition a liquid sample was taken at the end of the anaerobic phase once a week one cycle on day 4 11 15 25 30 36 46 and 53 or two consecutive cycles on day 67 73 and 79 were sampled in 5 or 10 min intervals to gain more insight in conversion kinetics all liquid samples were filtered through 0 2 Âµm syringe filters pes membrane vwr and analyzed for ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n and phosphate po4 3 p with a skalar san autoanalyzer skalar analytical b v according to standard methods apha et al 2012 acetate was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc for more information see supplemental materials for rapid testing of the liquid samples for po4 3 p the phosver 3 kit hach lange was used total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss and sludge volume index svi were assessed according to standard methods apha et al 2012 2 4 biomass characteristics and morphology the elemental composition of homogenized freeze dried biomass was measured for c and n analyses an aliquot about 2 mg was folded into a tin cup and analyzed in an organic elemental analyzer flash 2000 interscience cellular p was analyzed by combusting an aliquot about 2 mg for 30 min at 550 c in pyrex glass tubes followed by a digestion step with 10 ml persulfate 2 5 for 30 min at 121 c the digested solution was measured for po4 3 p on the skalar san autoanalyzer skalar analytical b v chlorophyll was extracted with ethanol 100 from biomass samples from pg1 and pg2 according to the protocol of cuaresma franco et al 2012 the full extraction protocol can be found in the supplemental materials biomass samples were observed via a stereomicroscope leica m205c to assess granule morphology and the integration of photogranules and ags images were taken using the leica application suite v4 13 photogranule size was determined by analyzing multiple microscopic images per sample with a total of at least 400 particles using imagej milferstedt et al 2017 2 5 microbial community assessment and functional annotation the microbial community of day 0 8 15 31 53 67 and 79 was assessed using 16s and 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing according to trebuch et al 2020 the detailed dna extraction sequencing and processing of sequencing reads can be found in the supplemental materials the raw 16s and 18s rrna gene sequence data is available in the ebi database under project number prjeb54716 the 16s dataset was annotated with functions using the tool faprotax louca et al 2016 the default database of faprotax was extended with taxa functionally annotated within the midas database version 4 8 1 nierychlo et al 2020 it is important to note that several functions can be annotated to one single taxon and consequently sum of the functional distribution can exceed 100 3 results 3 1 assembly of pg photogranules enriched with polyphosphate accumulating organisms in this study we successfully combined photogranules pg with aerobic granular sludge ags enriched with polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos to form pg enriched with paos named pg pg were operated as a phototrophic enhanced biological phosphorus removal photoebpr system to investigate the assembly of pg two different inoculation strategies were tested 1 pg were mechanically homogenized and co cultivated with intact ags referred to as pg1 2 both pg and ags were kept intact and co cultivated referred to as pg2 the co cultivation phase lasted for 56 days and the assembly of the pg was followed via microscopic observations fig 1 the first pg appeared in both pg1 and pg2 after one week of cultivation they arose among intact native pg in pg2 and ags within 2 3 weeks of operation the bioreactors were completely dominated by pg most pg were in the range of 0 8 1 4 mm in diameter with a maximum of 1 8 mm the morphology of pg was characterized by an interwoven network of cyanobacteria with cauliflower shaped aggregates of ags in between white areas on surface fig 1 while the pg morphology of pg1 and pg2 was similar two modes of assembly could be identified depending on the size and morphology of the initial pg and ags in the first mode of assembly especially in the pg1 treatment ags were colonized by the homogenized microbial community of pg and were gradually overgrown by phototrophic organisms fig 1 upper path over time the phototrophs covered the whole surface and formed a thick mat with pao colonies protruding the surface this eventually resulted in the typical pg morphology the second mode of assembly was pg being colonized by small to medium sized ags fig 1 lower path over time the ags were incorporated into the pg and finally formed mature pg similar to the ones obtained via the first mode of assembly 3 2 bioreactor performance of pg and ags during the co cultivation phase all three bioreactors pg1 pg2 ags were operated with 6 cycles per day with 70 min of anaerobic dark and 150 min of aerobic light phase despite the different inoculation strategies of pg1 and pg2 their performance during steady state was similar reaching full removal of nitrogen phosphorus and cod already after one week of operation 53 1 mgn l d 29 9 0 5 mgp l d and 600 mgcod l d figure s4 phosphorus release and reuptake dynamics were similar in all three bioreactors with maximum release concentrations of about 60 mgp l fig 2 a c while ags showed the highest specific phosphorus release with 25 mgp gvss compared to 10 and 12 mgp gvss for pg1 and pg2 the acetate was quickly consumed in all three bioreactors at similar rates ammonium concentrations were relatively stable during the anaerobic phase and ammonium was primarily consumed during the aerobic phase all three bioreactors showed excellent settling properties with average svi values from day 10 to day 56 of 49 3 ml g pg1 52 3 ml g pg2 and 42 3 ml g ags figure s5 and average effluent concentrations of 24 15 mgtss l pg1 67 72 mgtss l pg2 and 15 3 mgtss l ags figure s6 both pg1 and pg2 showed full nitrogen removal while ags achieved 50 60 removal the phototrophs in pg1 and pg2 could make use of light energy and consequently had double the biomass productivity which resulted in 2 3x higher biomass concentration 5 9 0 5 gvss l in pg1 and 5 2 0 5 gvss l in pg2 compared to 2 2 0 2 gvss l in ags figure s6 due to the difference in biomass concentration despite similar bioreactor performance the specific removal rates for cod and p observed for pg1 and pg2 were 2 3x lower compared to ags figure s7 10 the phosphorus content in the biomass of ags was more than double 12 3 w w compared to in pg1 and pg2 4 6 w w fig 2d overall pg showed 4 5x higher phosphorus recovery potential than native pg which exhibited about 1 w w of phosphorus in their biomass ags showed nitrification activity of maximum 5 mgn l d 3 3 mgn gvss d which helped with ammonium removal but not with overall nitrogen removal denitrification may have occurred but was not investigated in this study the dissolved oxygen do concentration during the aerobic light phase increased for both pg1 and pg2 in a similar fashion and reached a maximum concentration of about 12 mg l at the end of the phase for ags the do increased over the course of the aerobic phase and peaked at around 6 mg l this was a clear difference due to the in situ oxygenation via phototrophs in pg1 and pg2 in all three bioreactors the do rose further once all phosphorus was taken up suggesting reduced respiration by paos and other heterotrophs 3 3 the effect of a 12 h anaerobic phase on pg and ags systems to test the pg performance under natural light conditions we extended one of the anaerobic cycles to 12 h thus simulating the night in a diurnal cycle the overall light input decreased by 47 because the inclusion of the 12 h anaerobic dark phase required shortening of the aerobic light phases to preserve the feast famine regime throughout the rest of the cycle the reduction of the light input resulted in an equivalent decrease in phototrophic biomass productivity and a decrease in the biomass concentration over time fig 3 d and s3 thereby the overall nitrogen assimilation also decreased and overall nitrogen removal in pg1 and pg2 was reduced by 12 16 fig 3f similar to ags pg1 established an active nitrifying community which contributed to full ammoniacal nitrogen removal the nitrifying activity was low and comparable to the one of ags with 5 mg l d turned over pg2 had only marginable conversion of ammonium into nitrite or nitrate and thereby did not show full ammoniacal nitrogen removal generally ags was not affected by the change in operation conditions and maintained similar biomass productivity biomass concentration and specific removal rates to that seen during the co cultivation phase fig 3 figure s7 10 phosphorus release and reuptake dynamics were almost identical for all three bioreactors and comparable to the co cultivation phase interestingly the release during the 12 h anaerobic phase max 62 mg l of phosphorus was higher than in the subsequent 40 min anaerobic phases max 54 mg l of phosphorus fig 3a c still the total phosphorus removal was complete in all three bioreactors the specific phosphorus release of ags stayed almost equal releasing 24 mgp gvss compared to 25 mgp gvss during the co cultivation phase the specific phosphorus release rate for pg1 and pg2 was lower releasing 7 and 8 mgp gvss compared to 10 and 12 mgp gvss during the co cultivation phase fig 2e and fig 3e the svi of pg1 and pg2 increased slightly to 52 5 ml g and 55 4 ml g while the svi of ags decreased to 36 1 ml g figure s5 average biomass concentrations in the effluent of all three bioreactors were similar at about 20 mg l figure s6 3 4 microbial community analysis and functional annotation during the co cultivation phase and the extension of the anaerobic phase to 12 h chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b were measured as an indication of the fraction of phototrophic biomass fig 4 pg1 and pg2 had different starting chlorophyll concentrations pg1 23 mg gvss and pg2 18 mg gvss but showed similar values at the end of the co cultivation phase to about 28 mg gvss the extension of one anaerobic phase to 12 h had a strong effect on the phototrophic community the light input was reduced by 47 and that led to a decrease of the phototrophic biomass fraction of 40 50 during the last 3 weeks of operation the microbial community of pg pg1 pg2 and ags was analyzed both with 16s and 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing when looking from the inoculum to the end of the experiment the prokaryotic community converged for pg1 and pg2 in the last three sampling points showing the strong selective effect of operating the bioreactors as photoebpr fig 5 the photogranular inoculum consisted of a diverse prokaryotic community of several cyanobacteria e g cephalothrix komarekiana alkalinema pantanalense leptolyngbya boryanum pseudanabaena biceps and chemoheterotrophic organisms e g thauera sp zoogloea sp prosthecobacter sp and shinella sp figure s14 at the end of the co cultivation phase day 53 and 12 h anaerobic phase the community was simplified day 67 and 79 figure s15 alkalinema pantanalense became the dominant filamentous cyanobacteria and most abundant prokaryotic organism in pg1 and pg2 while the abundance of chemoheterotrophs thauera sp and zoogloea sp were below 1 candidatus accumulibacter sp and tetrasphaera sp became the dominant paos making up about 52 in ags and 7 15 in pg1 and pg2 after enrichment other paos such as dechloromonas sp and halobacter sp were also present in all three bioreactors but in low abundance 1 3 nitrifiers candidatus nitrotoga and nitrosomonas sp were abundant in small amounts below 1 in all three bioreactors with ags and pg1 as the only two bioreactors showing nitrifying activity the eukaryotic community in pg1 and pg2 was characterized by green algae botryosphaerella sp chlorella sp chlorococcum sp and desmodesmus sp fig 5b figure s14 similar to the prokaryotic community the eukaryotic algal community started off more diverse and converged to a simplified community with chlorella sp and desmodesmus sp as dominant green algae at the end of the co cultivation phase fig 5d next to eukaryotic algae other organisms such as amoeba rotifers and fungi were detected in pg1 and pg2 2 11 the eukaryotic community of ags was characterized by only amoeba rotifers and fungi and an absence of eukaryotic algae the functional annotation of the 16s dataset revealed different distributions of functions for ags pg pg and pg 12 h ags was dominated by paos 54 nitrification 1 and denitrification 55 while pg was characterized by photosynthesis 48 chemoheterotrophy 52 nitrification 0 2 and denitrification 7 fig 6 and table 1 the hybrid granule pg showed photosynthesis 58 pao 10 chemoheterotrophy 36 nitrification 1 and denitrification 10 when extending one anaerobic phase to 12 h in pg 12 h photosynthesis was reduced by 4 and glycogen accumulating organisms gao activity started to appear with 21 of organisms performing glycogen accumulation 4 discussion 4 1 pg assembly and granule morphology biofilm structures such as granules are largely determined by substrate concentration gradients at the biofilm liquid interface the detachment forces working on the biofilm hydrodynamic shear the biomass yield and extracellular polymeric substance eps production loosdrecht et al 1997 the key for ags formation was the introduction of an anaerobic feeding phase followed by an aerobic reaction phase in this operation scheme paos and gaos incorporate cod anaerobically as storage polymers pha and grow on these aerobically that yields a lower aerobic growth rate compared to heterotrophic bacteria but results in dense and sturdy biofilms de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 the granulation further relies to some extent on hydrodynamic conditions in sequencing batch reactors or plug flow reactors where shear force can determine granule morphology nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 photogranules formation was proven to work differently and is not necessarily dependent on specific operation schemes motile filamentous cyanobacteria govern photogranulation by the generation of extracellular polymeric substances eps and locomotive entanglement milferstedt et al 2017 trebuch et al 2020 this has been shown to work both in hydrodynamic conditions in sequencing batch reactors and also in static incubations confirming that external drivers such as hydrodynamic shear washout and fluctuating chemical conditions are not necessary for photogranulation gikonyo et al 2021 milferstedt et al 2017 pg assembled rapidly from a diverse and species rich inoculum of pg and ags and showed full treatment capacity 1 2 weeks after inoculation the interplay of filamentous cyanobacteria i e alkalinema pantanalense forming a complex network and ags i e paos forming cauliflower shaped agglomerates were crucial for pg assembly on one hand the filamentous cyanobacteria formed mat like structures in photogranules that served as a harbor for other organisms to embed themselves in milferstedt et al 2017 on the other hand the motility of filamentous cyanobacteria could actively capture and incorporate microbial communities such as ags into the photogranules structure this locomotive entanglement of particles e g sand grains by cyanobacteria was previously observed in natural occurring photogranules such as cryoconites or microbialites brehm et al 2003 takeuchi et al 2001 further the cauliflower shaped agglomerates of ags provided the phototrophic organisms a rugged surface to attach to the early attachment of the pg microbial community on ags occurred especially in cracks and crevices these assembly mechanisms manifested in the two identified pg assembly modes described in fig 1 smaller homogenized pgs colonized the surface of larger ags fig 1 upper path or ags were incorporated by locomotive entanglement of intact pg fig 1 lower path the particle size ratio of pg intact or homogenized to ags might have been relevant in determining which assembly pathway predominates 4 2 pg functions and functional redundancy the desired functional groups in pg are 1 oxygenic photosynthesis 2 polyphosphate accumulation 3 chemoheterotrophy cod removal with 4 nitrification and 5 denitrification as optional functions to enhance overall nitrogen removal representatives of these functions were presented above figs 5 and 6 in complex and diverse microbial communities each function or metabolism can often be performed by multiple taxonomically distinct organisms louca et al 2016 due to the specific and selective operation conditions feast famine the microbial community was simplified figure s14 and s15 but still had at least 5 taxa per function that were capable of the same metabolism this established a functional redundancy that is important for the resilience of the microbial community and functions to biotic and abiotic influences environmental perturbations although the microbial community composition in the beginning of the co cultivation phase was still changing fig 5 the bioreactor performance was stable figure s4 10 confirming functional redundancy in the pg system functional stability during taxonomic fluctuations is a commonly observed phenomenon in natural ecosystems and biological wastewater treatment systems wang et al 2011 another example for functional redundancy is the taxonomic change in the functional group of chemoheterotrophs and denitrifiers during the assembly from pg to pg thauera and zoogloea are prominent representatives of these functional groups in photogranules trebuch et al 2020 in pg they were outcompeted by paos and gaos that consumed all acetate during the anaerobic phase leaving no organic carbon substrate in the bulk liquid for thauera zoogloea to grow during the aerobic phase besides the very specific polyphosphate metabolism of paos they can also perform chemoheterotrophy and denitrification that can replace the functions of thauera and zoogloea the high activity of polyphosphate cycling in ags and pg suggests that the actual abundance of paos might be higher than determined by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 5 and s14 the relative abundance might differ from actual biomass fractions due to dna extraction biases primer biases and variation in cell size and 16s 18s rrna gene copy number between species albertsen et al 2015 this issue of underrepresentation was especially evident for paos when investigating microbial communities in conventional wastewater treatment systems stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 other techniques such as staining paos with fluorescence in situ hybridization fish probes weissbrodt et al 2013 or a recently suggested de novo proteomics approach kleikamp et al 2021 might show a higher enrichment of paos in ags and pg 4 3 pg wastewater treatment performance compared to previous photogranules and non granular photoebpr systems abouhend et al 2018 ji et al 2020 mohamed et al 2021 cod and nitrogen removal were improved by 2 3x in pg expect for pg where similar n removal was found trebuch et al 2020 p removal was enhanced by 3 6x due to integration of paos into the pg the overall removal capacity and removal kinetics for phosphorus and cod of pg were consistent with other lab scale operated ags systems while showing higher rates of nitrogen assimilation into biomass de graaff et al 2020 de kreuk et al 2005 the introduction of photosynthesis led to a two fold increase in biomass productivity and nitrogen removal in pg while maintaining the same cod removal and phosphorus dynamics as ags generating metabolic energy from light also simultaneously produced oxygen for heterotrophic activities in situ oxygenation via photosynthesis increases the association of phototrophs and heterotrophs via the exchange of o2 and co2 further it can reduce or even remove the need for mechanical aeration which potentially could save up to 50 of the total energy costs currently needed in conventional wastewater treatment brockmann et al 2021 pg achieved full removal of cod n and p before the end of the cycles indicating that a larger removal capacity is surely attainable cod was already fully consumed after 20 min into the anaerobic feeding phase total 70 min fig 2 and 3 while p reuptake was completed 60 min into the aerobic phase total of 150 min and n was completely removed after 100 min the early n and p depletion during the aerobic phase possibly hindered phototrophs from functioning at maximum capacity and nitrifiers from fully establishing further paos would be able to cope with higher cod and p loads as demonstrated in previous studies de graaff et al 2020 de kreuk et al 2005 this suggests that the nutrient load in general can be increased increasing cod and p load would lead to an increased enrichment of paos and ease competition for p additionally an increased n load could facilitate simultaneous nitrification and denitrification which can occur in the aerobic and anoxic zones of granules with sizes of 1 5 mm de kreuk et al 2005 pronk et al 2015 combining phototrophs and paos in photoebpr systems can also have adverse effects cai et al 2019 observed an increase in nitrogen removal due to the growth of phototrophs but phosphorus removal by paos appeared to be hindered and consequently lowered a similar observation was reported previously by huang et al 2015 they concluded that light and phototrophs inhibited nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and nitrite accumulation in the bioreactor led to inhibition of paos which are sensitive to elevated nitrite concentrations pijuan et al 2010 nitrification is frequently observed in photogranules abouhend et al 2018 tiron et al 2015 trebuch et al 2020 but did not fully establish in pg this can be attributed to competition for co2 and ammonium risgaard petersen et al 2004 which was rapidly consumed in the pg systems however at elevated ammonium concentrations nitrite accumulation could become an issue and should be investigated 4 4 how to fit the pg process into a natural diurnal cycle light is a primary energy input for pg and will majorly constrain the treatment capacity of the system by using natural light instead of artificial light we maximize the utilization of the sun s energy with minimum energy losses making it more sustainable and economically feasible blanken et al 2013 high sunlight input throughput the year therefore will be crucial for the efficiency of the pg process this favorable condition can be found predominantly in lower latitude countries with higher light input year round slegers et al 2013 in a light driven wastewater treatment system operated under natural light conditions all daylight should be used as efficiently as possible when operating a pg system as sequencing batch reactor the culture must be temporarily shaded in the daytime during the anaerobic phases and consequently valuable light energy remains unused this was seen in the decrease of phototrophs and nitrogen removal in pg when accommodating 6 short cycles within the 12 h daytime and having a 12 h anaerobic phase fig 2 4 instead of operating in a time based manner in one reactor vessel sequencing batch reactor with defined phases in time it could be more advantageous to design the process in space recently the ags process was performed continuously as plug flow with defined reactor compartments for each phase li et al 2021 sun et al 2019 from these studies valuable insights can be gained about how to operate a pg system at large scale a plug flow system would allow the treatment process to run continuously and have an aerobic compartment illuminated throughout the entire day utilizing all light energy it is important that the continuous system is designed and operated in a way that photogranules formation and functioning at high rates are still facilitated although a 12 h anaerobic phase had no negative effect on phosphorus cycling of paos there was a proliferation of gaos towards the end of the 3 weeks experimental phase paos and gaos have a similar metabolism and compete anaerobically for the organic carbon source acetate in this study while gao can proliferate in the same feast famine conditions as paos they do not have the benefit of using polyphosphate as an intermediate energy storage and can only use glycogen chen et al 2020 this results in strongly decreased phosphorus removal in gao dominated systems lopez vazquez et al 2009 while phosphorus removal was not affected in the 3 weeks of operating at a 12 h anaerobic phase the proliferation of gaos in photogranular systems should be investigated in future studies 4 5 advantages and shortcomings of a pg wastewater treatment system the advantage of including phototrophic chemoautotrophic nitrifiers and heterotrophic paos denitrifiers processes in one system is that overall biomass productivity and thereby biomass assimilation of nutrients was increased currently high biomass productivity is not desired in conventional treatment systems since it can have a significant impact on the operational costs due to sludge disposal cieÅlik et al 2015 however using the produced biomass as a resource could transform wastewater treatment systems into valuable resource recovery facilities where besides the major elements c n p microelements e g fe mo zn cu are also reclaimed and transformed kehrein et al 2020 suleiman et al 2020 the whole biomass could be used either as fertilizer c n p and microelements or fractionated for extracellular polymeric substances eps or polyhydroxyalkanoates pha for biopolymer production kehrein et al 2020 including phototrophs into the treatment system can potentially extend the product range of the biomass by e g photopigments lipids proteins and antioxidants borowitzka 2013 pg rapidly assembled from pg and ags and showed resilience to a 12h anaerobic phase this suggests that the pg process can be quickly established and is suitable to be operate under a natural diel cycle a hurdle for pg application as for all light driven processes e g phototrophic microalgal production is the design of a full scale system photobioreactors need a high surface to volume ratio to harness light common designs are closed tubular systems or shallow 20 40 cm deep open raceway ponds consequently light driven wastewater treatment will have larger areal footprints compared to conventional wastewater treatment techniques such as cas or ags nevertheless this disadvantage of the pg system will be outweighed by its advantages using the sun s energy for lowering or eradicating mechanical aeration and producing valuable biomass for nutrient recovery and other raw materials eps bulk chemicals transitioning to light driven technologies i e pg will require us to rethink wastewater treatment systems and ideally align resource e g water nutrients consumption and recovery to the diurnal cycle of the sun constraining use and discharge of waste water predominantly to the light periods of the day could be an effective tool to increase resource use efficiency and reduce our ecological footprint this might be necessary to accommodate the needs of an ever growing population and ensure a sustainable future 5 conclusion in this study we successfully integrated paos i e candidatus accumulibacter tetrasphaera sp from ags into native pgs and created a hybrid granule named pg performing photoebpr thereby pg significantly improved phosphorus recovery by 3 6x compared to native pg used in this study photogranules from other studies and other microalgae based technologies photoautotrophs such as cyanobacteria and green algae additionally generated metabolic energy from light and led to 2 3x higher biomass productivity of pg compared to ags operating the pg system under a diurnal cycle of 12 h light and 12 h dark resulted in an 12 h anaerobic phase which had no adverse effect on polyphosphate cycling or phototrophic activity however the short anaerobic phases during the 12 h daytime resulted in an overall lower light availability due to shorter aerobic phases and consequently reduced phototrophic growth this decreased biomass productivity and nitrogen removal during operation under a natural diurnal cycle by around 30 therefore we suggest reconsidering the bioreactor operation in sequencing batch mode and developing a continuous operation mode with separate anaerobic dark and aerobic light compartments this would allow photogranules to maximally utilize the light input during daytime and optimize such a light driven wastewater treatment system

14869,phytoplankton is the essential primary producer in fresh surface water ecosystems however excessive phytoplankton growth due to eutrophication significantly threatens ecologic economic and public health therefore phytoplankton identification and quantification are essential to understanding the productivity and health of freshwater ecosystems as well as the impacts of phytoplankton overgrowth such as cyanobacterial blooms on public health microscopy is the gold standard for phytoplankton assessment but is time consuming has low throughput and requires rich experience in phytoplankton morphology quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr is accurate and straightforward with high throughput in addition qpcr does not require expertise in phytoplankton morphology therefore qpcr can be a useful alternative for molecular identification and enumeration of phytoplankton nonetheless a comprehensive study is missing which evaluates and compares the feasibility of using qpcr and microscopy to assess phytoplankton in fresh water this study 1 compared the performance of qpcr and microscopy in identifying and quantifying phytoplankton and 2 evaluated qpcr as a molecular tool to assess phytoplankton and indicate eutrophication we assessed phytoplankton using both qpcr and microscopy in twelve large freshwater rivers across the united states from early summer to late fall in 2017 2018 and 2019 qpcr and microscope based phytoplankton abundance had a significant positive linear correlation adjusted r 2 0 836 p value 0 001 phytoplankton abundance had limited temporal variation within each sampling season and over the three years studied the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers had higher phytoplankton abundance than those in the eastern and western rivers for instance the concentration geometric mean of bacillariophyta cyanobacteria chlorophyta and dinoflagellates at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was approximately three times that at the sampling sites in the western rivers and approximately 18 times that at the sampling sites in the eastern rivers welch s analysis of variance indicates that phytoplankton abundance at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was significantly higher than that at the sampling sites in the eastern rivers p value 0 013 but was comparable to that at the sampling sites in the western rivers p value 0 095 the higher phytoplankton abundance at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was presumably because these rivers were more eutrophic indeed low phytoplankton abundance occurred in oligotrophic or low trophic sites whereas eutrophic sites had greater phytoplankton abundance this study demonstrates that qpcr based phytoplankton abundance can be a useful numerical

cyanobacteria is the biological consequence of freshwater eutrophication duan et al 2022 lu et al 2020 wilhelm et al 2004 phytoplankton overgrowth deteriorates water quality threatens ecosystems e g aquatic organism mortality and biodiversity reduction and can limit recreational opportunities the overgrowth also poses public health risks and raises other issues by releasing harmful toxins mainly cyanotoxins and taste and odor compounds causing the water to be unsafe and or unpleasant for consumption and recreation chislock et al 2013 graham et al 2010 steffen et al 2017 wilhelm et al 2004 in addition the annual economic losses due to freshwater eutrophication are over 2 2 billion dollars in the u s dodds et al 2009 phytoplankton overgrowth e g algal and cyanobacterial blooms results from eutrophication and poses substantial risks to the environment and public health therefore evaluating phytoplankton is critical to understanding freshwater bodies ecological conditions and trophic

et al 2018 liu et al 2019 however it is time consuming labor intensive and less efficient dunker 2019 malkassian et al 2011 rivas villar et al 2021 yu et al 2021 microscopy also requires rich experience in phytoplankton morphology and is difficult to operate for high frequency spatial and or temporal sample analysis moreover microscopy is unable to identify cells with significant morphology changes e g broken and shrunk cells cannot discriminate cryptic species cannot determine if a strain can produce toxins and may be confounded by fixatives jeffrey and vesk 1997 xiao et al 2014 furthermore microscopic analysis of phytoplankton is prone to human error and bias e g misidentification of species and missing picoplanktonic taxa culverhouse 2007 luo et al 2006 paliÅska and surosz 2008 to overcome the limitations of microscopy researchers have developed alternatives to identify and quantify phytoplankton and study phytoplankton community structure those alternatives include pigment based approaches often via high performance liquid chromatography or spectrofluorometry lee et al 2020 pan et al 2020 srichandan et al 2020 stoyneva gÃ¤rtner et al 2020 yu et al 2021 fatty acid based procedures caÃ±avate et al 2019 canavate 2019 dijkman and kromkamp 2006 galloway and winder 2015 analytical and imaging flow cytometry dunker 2020 latasa et al 2021 liu et al 2021 moorhouse et al 2018 read et al 2014 and high throughput sequencing or next generation sequencing dos santos et al 2022 gong et al 2020 malashenkov et al 2021 yang et al 2021a these alternatives have limitations for instance pigments e g chlorophyll are a widely used proxy for algal biomass and an indicator of trophic status chen and chen 2022 dodds et al 1998 mineeva and makarova 2018 however pigment based approaches are insensitive and inaccurate i e unable to differentiate phytoplankton species accurately thereby providing little information on phytoplankton community composition catherine et al 2012 tian et al 2020 yu et al 2021 fatty acid based methods have similar limitations to the pigment based approaches because they also lack sufficient reference libraries caÃ±avate et al 2019 flow cytometry is less accurate requires complicated staining is bottlenecked by small sample volumes processed and has a low taxonomic resolution dashkova et al 2017 dubelaar and jonker 2000 markina 2019 even though high throughput sequencing is much better at evaluating phytoplankton community diversity compared to quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr it is poor at quantifying abundances is expensive could be disrupted by sequencing errors and requires extensive bioinformatic expertise to interpret the data poretsky et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 because of the shortcomings of microscopy and the alternative assays we propose using qpcr to screen phytoplankton in surface waterbodies qpcr is a rapid accurate sensitive robust reproducible high throughput and cost effective method galazzo et al 2020 smith and osborn 2009 qpcr instruments are more accessible than flow cytometers and high throughput sequencing platforms azat 2021 raso and biassoni 2014 qpcr also does not require knowledge of phytoplankton taxonomy or morphology but can reveal both the abundance and taxonomic identification of phytoplankton in addition unlike pigment based approaches and flow cytometry qpcr can be coupled with high throughput sequencing jian et al 2020 to assess phytoplankton community with a high accuracy large dynamic range and high processing capability i e simultaneous sequencing of millions of dna molecules churko et al 2013 reuter et al 2015 furthermore because of the rapid innovation in qpcr instrumentation and protocols we can upgrade qpcr to a high throughput assay pearson et al 2021 porter and hajibabaei 2018 wilcox et al 2020 most studies use qpcr to assess genes encoding cyanotoxins e g microcystins cylindrospermopsin anatoxin a and saxitoxin and cyanobacteria especially cyanotoxin producing cyanobacteria almuhtaram et al 2021 christensen et al 2019 eldridge et al 2017 kulabhusan and campbell 2021 otten et al 2015 pacheco et al 2016 sagova mareckova et al 2021 schweitzer natan et al 2019 tavakoli et al 2021 zupanÄiÄ et al 2021 however the feasibility of qpcr in identifying and quantifying phytoplankton especially non cyanobacterial phytoplankton in freshwater rivers has not been fully evaluated in a comparative study with microscopy this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using qpcr to assess phytoplankton by monitoring phytoplankton in twelve large freshwater rivers across the u s from early summer to late fall in 2017 2018 and 2019 because freshwater phytoplankton community dynamics are driven by local environmental factors stomp et al 2011 we assessed how environmental parameters such as nutrients shaped the phytoplankton community we hypothesized that qpcr and microscopy based phytoplankton abundance would be positively correlated supporting the use of qpcr as a numerical tool for phytoplankton assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and river water sampling this study included twelve large inland and coastal freshwater rivers in the western two midcontinent five and eastern five regions across the u s table 1 and fig 1 in this study the western region refers to the region in the west of the sierra nevada and cascade ranges and the eastern region refers to the region east of the appalachian range the midcontinent region refers to the region between the western and eastern regions we sampled river water in 2017 2018 and 2019 from one sampling site in each river according to the u s geological survey usgs national water quality assessment nawqa protocol usgs 2019 usgs 2022a we used appropriate sampling techniques to obtain representative river samples the sampling spanned early summer through late fall each year since phytoplankton does not grow well and has low abundance during cold seasons i e winter and spring especially in large streams savoy et al 2019 we did not sample during cold seasons two sets of river water samples were collected in parallel during each sampling event defined as river water collection from a site on a sampling day the first set was an isokinetic sample for physicochemical water quality assessment and microscopic analysis of phytoplankton the second set was a near surface grab sample collected at the centroid of a river for qpcr in this study we collected the samples for qpcr from the centroids to minimize microbial contamination of the sampling equipment in addition when a single sampling spot must be selected the centroid of a flow generally represents the cross section of the stream graham et al 2012 in total we included 166 sampling events for qpcr table s1 and a similar number of sampling events for physicochemical water quality assessment and microscopic analysis additional details on the sampling sites and sample collection are described elsewhere graham et al 2020 usgs 2022a zuellig et al 2021 2 2 microscopic assessment of phytoplankton and physicochemical water quality assessment the microscopic assay for phytoplankton identification and enumeration is described somewhere else graham et al 2020 2021 2022 king et al 2020a 2020b zuellig et al 2021 briefly we collected river water in 500 ml high density polyethylene bottles to shoulder full using teflon churns each river water sample was preserved with approximately 5 ml of acidified lugol s iodine in the same bottle in 2017 and 2018 we concentrated phytoplankton by settling and identified enumerated phytoplankton following established protocols komÃ¡rek 1999 2008 2013 2016 komÃ¡rek et al 2014 komÃ¡rek and anagnostidis 2007 rosen et al 2017 2018 wehr et al 2015 in 2019 we quantified phytoplankton using a permanent n 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylamide mounting technique phycotech com for all river samples we identified and enumerated phytoplankton using an olympus bx51 research grade microscope olympus corporation tokyo japan with variable magnifications depending on identified taxa we enumerated phytoplankton to the lowest possible taxonomic level typically genus or species via natural units all samples or cell counts 2018 and 2019 samples a natural unit is the natural growth form of phytoplankton such as an individual cell a colony or a filament the natural unit is commonly used for microscopic phytoplankton enumeration graham et al 2004a lehman et al 2021 onyema 2018 vuorio et al 2020 in this work the microscope based phytoplankton abundance is expressed in nu l 1 in which nu stands for natural units at least 400 natural units were counted per sample rosen et al 2018 phytoplankton identification and enumeration methods and data for the 2017 2018 and 2019 samples are available in king et al 2020a and king et al 2020b graham et al 2021 and graham et al 2022

using the usgs station numbers listed in table 1 usgs 2022b 2 3 qpcr assessment of phytoplankton we quantified nine critical phytoplankton groups via qpcr following established protocols lu et al 2016 2017 zhang et al 2021 the nine groups are 1 bacillariophyta division 2 cyanobacteria division 3 chlorophyta specific to three classes in the division chlorophyta chlorophyceae trebouxiophyceae and

bodies duan et al 2022 lu et al 2020 lueangthuwapranit et al 2011 marshall 2009 wilhelm et al 2004 this study was not to assess all phytoplankton in the twelve rivers using qpcr therefore the analysis of certain phytoplankton groups common in fresh water such as prochlorophyta and xanthophyceae two classes in the division ochrophyta was excluded we included 50 50 and 66 sampling events in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively 166 in total for qpcr table s1 we included biological duplicates for 25 of the 166 sampling events we sampled river water for qpcr in autoclaved and bleached 500 ml polypropylene bottles and filtered the samples using nuclepore polycarbonate filters whatman ge healthcare piscataway new jersey u s a graham et al 2020 the filters with captured biomass were stored in tubes

were used as qpcr templates assessing the dna of the phytoplankton in both the undiluted and the diluted dna samples helped detect qpcr inhibition and operation errors zhang et al 2021 the target genes were quantified relative to in house constructed standard series all qpcr standards were recombinant plasmid dna with the same backbone invitrogen pcr 4 topo ta vector thermo fisher scientific

ten fold serial dilution with plasmid concentration ranging from 101 to 106 copies per microliter 2017 and 2018 samples or from 100 to 106 copies per microliter 2019 samples the phytoplankton abundance in the river water samples is expressed in gene or genome copy number per liter gcn l 1 where one gcn is equal to one copy of the qpcr amplicon in most cases each qpcr amplicon has one copy in the genome of each phytoplankton group nine groups in total however each genome of microcystis has one or two copies of the qpcr amplicon and each genome of synechococcus has one two or three

1 gcn Î¼l 1 or undetermined i e no significant fluorescent signal after 40 qpcr cycles we assumed that the concentration of the corresponding phytoplankton group in the river water sample was 1 gcn l 1 the assumption was made because a zero value i e 0 gcn l 1 would complicate downstream data processing especially the calculation of a geometric mean or gm if the concentration of a qpcr target in a dna extract was below the lod 3 gcn Î¼l 1 but higher than 1 gcn Î¼l 1 we assumed that the concentration was accurate klymus et al 2020 kralik and ricchi 2017 we used microsoft office s excel

twelve rivers across the u s rivers are important representative freshwater ecosystems acting as a conveyor belt transporting nutrients and pollutants from the land to the oceans wang et al 2018 therefore we utilized freshwater rivers to represent freshwater bodies we strategically selected the twelve large freshwater rivers to include various geographic regions stream drainage areas and streamflow rates so that the selected rivers could suggest the streams in the regions graham et al 2020 zuellig et al 2021 those rivers are in three major regions in the u s the western region two rivers the midcontinent region five rivers and the eastern region five rivers table 1 and fig 1 the twelve rivers include both inland and coastal rivers the drainage areas arithmetic mean am standard deviation 175 953 361 458 km2 of the rivers ranged from 6 294 km2 the chattahoochee river to 1 353 269 km2 the missouri river from the water years of 2017 to 2019 the annual average volumetric flow rates 1 230 1 510 m3 s 1 at the sampling sites ranged from 54 m3 s 1 the trinity river 2017 to 5 870 m3 s 1 the ohio river 2019 the usgs defines a water year as 12 months from october 1st in any given calendar year through september 30th in the following calendar year the sampling sites in the twelve large rivers had distinct water quality conditions from water years 2017 to 2019 table 1 the annual average suspended solids ss concentrations 95 2 118 5 mg l 1 ranged from 14 5 mg l 1 the willamette river 2017 to 402 mg l 1 the missouri river 2017 the annual average tn concentrations 2 202 2 016 Î¼g l 1 ranged from 315 Î¼g l 1 the sacramento river 2019 to 8 040 Î¼g l 1 the trinity river 2017 from the water years of 2017 to 2019 the annual average tp concentrations 201 221 Î¼g l 1 ranged from 46 Î¼g l 1 the connecticut river 2019 to 833 Î¼g l 1 the trinity river 2017 the summer median concentrations of tn and tp for rivers in 14 ecoregions across the u s ranged from 248 to 3 372 Î¼g l 1 1 173 839 Î¼g l 1 and from 21 to 184 Î¼g l 1 89 52 Î¼g l 1 respectively dodds et al 2009 therefore the tn and tp concentrations at the sampling sites in the twelve rivers encompassed ranges of nutrient conditions of rivers in various ecoregions across the u s the sampling sites in the three regions had significantly different tn and tp concentrations one way anova p values 0 001 tukey post hoc tests reveal that tn and tp concentrations were significantly higher at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers than those in the eastern and western rivers p values 0 001 however both tn and tp concentrations were comparable at the sampling sites in the western and eastern rivers p values 0 05 nutrient concentration is a common indicator of the trophic status of natural surface waterbodies dai et al 2016 huo et al 2013 knoll et al 2015 yao et al 2019 therefore on the basis of nutrients the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers were more eutrophic than those in the eastern and western rivers by contrast the sampling sites in the eastern and western rivers had similar trophic statuses in addition the sampling sites in the three regions had significantly different ss concentrations one way anova p value 0 001 the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers had significantly higher ss concentrations than those in the western and eastern rivers turkey post hoc tests p values 0 011 by contrast the sampling sites in the western and eastern rivers had comparable ss concentrations turkey post hoc test p value 0 05 previous studies similarly found that rivers in the midcontinent region or the midwest region in the u s typically had higher nutrient concentrations and poorer water quality than rivers in the western and eastern regions graham et al 2020 smith et al 1997 stets et al 2015 zuellig et al 2021 the higher nutrient concentrations in the midcontinent rivers could be due to various reasons both natural and anthropogenic khatri and tyagi 2015 for instance the more intensive agricultural activities higher use of fertilizers in the midcontinent region might have contributed to the higher nutrient concentrations in river water in that region najwah and philip 2021 stets et al 2015 soils in the midcontinent region are also naturally nutrient rich omernik 1987 omernik and griffith 2014 u s epa 2022 in addition land use and climate changes are stronger in the midcontinent region chapin et al 1997 furthermore the sampling site in the trinity river in the midcontinent region had the highest nutrient concentrations in the current study which could be because the sampling site was downstream of a municipal wastewater treatment plant that site was built by the usgs and has been sampled for decades in addition no usgs sampling site upstream of the treatment plant exists other sampling sites were not strongly affected by wastewater further studies to explore more deeply the reasons for the higher nutrient concentrations in rivers in the midcontinent region would be beneficial this study used nutrient primarily tn and tp levels to surrogate eutrophication tn and tp are widely used indicators of eutrophication dai et al 2016 huo et al 2013 knoll et al 2015 yao et al 2019 widely accepted tn concentration boundaries for delineating oligotrophic from mesotrophic streams and mesotrophic from eutrophic streams are 700 and 1 500 Î¼g l 1 respectively dodds et al 1998 tp concentration boundaries for delineating oligotrophic from mesotrophic streams and mesotrophic from eutrophic streams are 25 and 75 Î¼g l 1 respectively on the basis of these boundaries trophic conditions varied among the sampling sites in the twelve rivers table 1 the sampling site in the chattahoochee river in the eastern region and all sampling sites in the midcontinent region were eutrophic the sampling site in the susquehanna river in the eastern region and the sampling site in the willamette river in the western region were mesotrophic in the eastern region the delaware river and the hudson river sampling sites were mesotrophic indicated by tn concentrations to eutrophic indicated by tp concentrations the sampling site in the connecticut river in the eastern region and the sampling site in the sacramento river in the western region were oligotrophic indicated by tn concentrations to mesotrophic indicated by tp concentrations because the sampling sites in the twelve rivers covered various geographical regions stream drainage areas streamflow rates nutrient concentrations and trophic conditions our study locations suggested broad freshwater river conditions therefore our findings can suggest the general conditions of freshwater rivers in the u s 3 2 qpcr as a useful numerical tool to assess phytoplankton we compared the qpcr and microscope based abundance graham et al 2020 graham et al 2021 graham et al 2022 king et al 2020a for eight phytoplankton groups at the sampling sites in the twelve rivers in 2017 2018 and 2019 fig 2 bacillariophyta cyanobacteria chlorophyta dinoflagellates dolichospermum microcystis planktothrix and synechococcus c raciborskii was excluded from this analysis because it was not identified by microscopy in this comparison the microscope based phytoplankton abundance is in natural units because the abundance in cell counts is available for only the 2018 and 2019 samples the qpcr and microscope based phytoplankton abundance had a significant positive linear correlation adjusted r 2 0 836 p value 0 001 n 815 eq 1 1 a qpcr 1 176 a micriscopy 0 803 where a qpcr is the qpcr based phytoplankton abundance log10 gcn l 1 and a microscopy is the microscope based phytoplankton abundance log10 nu l 1 for each of the eight phytoplankton groups the linear correlation between qpcr and microscope based abundance was also statistically significant with a relatively large adjusted r squared average adjusted r squared 0 556 table 2 these results suggest that qpcr is feasible for assessing phytoplankton abundance and community composition in the twelve rivers and presumably general natural surface waterbodies in the future more studies to evaluate and confirm the feasibility of qpcr for phytoplankton assessment in other waterbodies would be beneficial for most sampling events the qpcr based phytoplankton abundance was equal to or higher than the microscope based abundance table 2 and fig 2 indeed the overall linear regression between qpcr and microscope based phytoplankton abundance shows higher qpcr based abundance eq 1 four reasons can explain the higher qpcr based abundance first qpcr could overestimate phytoplankton abundance by detecting extracellular dna in the river water samples bairoliya et al 2021 liang and keeley 2013 nagler et al 2018 nielsen et al 2007 second phytoplankton cells with significant morphology changes are challenging to pick up during microscopic analysis whereas qpcr accurately enumerates those cells similarly small phytoplankton cells sizes less than 3 Î¼m and rare phytoplankton taxa can escape microscopic detection but are quantified by qpcr brewin et al 2014 graham et al 2020 malashenkov et al 2021 xiao et al 2014 for instance synechococcus cells are small and the linear correlation between qpcr and microscope based synechococcus abundance is the weakest i e having the smallest adjusted r squared among the eight phytoplankton groups therefore microscopy might underestimate phytoplankton abundance for example we generated 1 304 pairs of data points for the qpcr and microscope based phytoplankton abundance from 163 sampling events in 2017 2018 and 2019 for 477 of the 1 304 pairs of data points qpcr detected phytoplankton while microscopy did not fig 2 by contrast in only 12 of the 1 304 pairs of data points microscopy detected phytoplankton while qpcr did not interestingly 11 of those 12 pairs of data points were for planktothrix where the microscope based planktothrix abundance was in the range from 2 31 to 3 91 log10 nu l 1 this finding indicates that the qpcr assay targeting planktothrix table s2 often underestimates the abundance and an updated more accurate qpcr assay is needed third we assessed phytoplankton using microscopy and qpcr in single composite and near surface grab samples respectively the different samples for microscopic and qpcr analyses could be another reason for the higher qpcr based phytoplankton abundance lastly in the current study we quantified phytoplankton in natural units using microscopy graham et al 2020 in the cases of colonies and filaments multiple cells comprise a natural unit therefore for colonies and filaments the number of natural units would be lower than the number of gene or genome copies determined by qpcr fig 2 table 2 and eq 1 for the 2019 samples we estimated the number of cells in colonies and filaments and calculated the number of cells in each natural unit of phytoplankton we then compared the qpcr based phytoplankton abundance gcn l 1 and microscope based phytoplankton abundance cells l 1 the abundance showed a strong positive linear correlation with comparable unstandardized coefficient and constant values to the ones in eq 1 data not shown as a result the first three explanations would be more important for the higher qpcr based phytoplankton abundance microscopy and qpcr both have strengths and shortcomings pacheco et al 2016 xiao et al 2014 for instance a microscope is easy to operate i e a low technology threshold and describes phytoplankton morphology however microscopic analysis is time consuming has low throughput and requires taxonomic or morphology experience qpcr has high throughput and requires no taxonomic knowledge however qpcr fails to describe phytoplankton morphology and viability and does not cover all phytoplankton taxa in addition the sensitivity efficiency and accuracy of qpcr are compromised by dna isolation bias dna amplification bias and inhibitors such as humic acid in environmental samples acharya et al 2017 dechesne et al 2016 lima et al 2022 opel et al 2010 furthermore a qpcr assay i e a specific primer set and a specific thermocycling condition can detect only one phytoplankton group or closely related groups to detect multiple phytoplankton groups one needs to use multiple qpcr assays therefore abandoning microscopy and adopting qpcr as the sole method for phytoplankton assessment is inadequate instead combining qpcr and microscopy would more comprehensively reveal phytoplankton abundance and community structure and provide deeper insights into phytoplankton dynamics in freshwater bodies malashenkov et al 2021 3 3 limited temporal variation in phytoplankton abundance phytoplankton abundance had limited temporal variation at the twelve sampling sites within each sampling season at each sampling site the qpcr based phytoplankton abundance fluctuated within each sampling season figs s1 and s2 no universal trend in the temporal variation of phytoplankton abundance across the twelve sampling sites is observed in addition at some sampling sites the patterns of the temporal variation of phytoplankton abundance changed substantially across the three years studied 2017 2018 and 2019 for instance the phytoplankton abundance at the kansas river sampling site increased during the 2017 sampling season decreased during the 2018 sampling season and was relatively stable during the 2019 sampling season figs s1d and s2d even though phytoplankton abundance fluctuated within each sampling season it was generally stable figs s1 and s2 the stable phytoplankton abundance over time within each sampling season was presumably because the sampling period was from early summer to late fall covering primarily the warm seasons when phytoplankton abundance is high in the future it would be beneficial if studies extend the sampling period to assess the seasonal variation in phytoplankton abundance in these twelve rivers phytoplankton abundance also had limited temporal variation throughout the three years studied 2017 2018 and 2019 the qpcr based phytoplankton abundance was comparable over the three years fig 3 indeed repeated measures anova indicates that the annual gm concentrations were comparable for most phytoplankton groups across the three years at the sampling sites in eleven rivers table s3 the sampling site in the hudson river was excluded from the analysis because the microscope based phytoplankton abundance for that site is available for only 2019 therefore phytoplankton at the sampling sites in the eleven rivers occurred from early summer to late fall at comparable annual abundance the comparable annual phytoplankton abundance indicates that the environmental conditions i e drivers of phytoplankton community dynamics for these sampling sites were stable from 2017 to 2019 stomp et al 2011 other factors might also contribute to the comparable annual phytoplankton abundance over the three years and it would be beneficial to explore those factors in future studies in other freshwater bodies clear temporal interannual trends in phytoplankton abundance and community dynamics existed which could be due to the substantial changes in local and global environmental conditions such as nutrient input water regime and global warming alvarez cobelas et al 2019 chen et al 2003 hardenbicker et al 2014 verasztÃ³ et al 2010 znachor et al 2020 to assess the sustained responses of phytoplankton community dynamics to changes in local and global environmental conditions such as eutrophication management e g nutrient loading reduction efforts and global climate change we need to conduct decadal or even multidecadal studies duarte et al 2009 gallegos et al 2010 3 4 higher phytoplankton abundance at the midcontinent river sampling sites the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers had higher phytoplankton abundance than the sites in the eastern and western rivers figs 1 4 and s3 to s6 for instance the gm concentration of bacillariophyta cyanobacteria chlorophyta and dinoflagellates at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers 7 31 log10 gcn l 1 was approximately three times that at the sampling sites in the western rivers 6 81 log10 gcn l 1 and approximately 18 times that at the sampling sites in the eastern rivers 6 06 log10 gcn l 1 welch s anova indicates that the log10 transformed gm abundance of phytoplankton at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was significantly higher than that at the sampling sites in the eastern rivers p value 0 013 but was comparable to that at the sampling sites in the western rivers p value 0 095 table s4 additionally the log10 transformed gm abundance of phytoplankton at the sampling sites in the eastern and western rivers was comparable p value 0 949 in conclusion the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers had higher phytoplankton abundance than the sampling sites in the western rivers and especially the sampling sites in the eastern rivers a study similarly found that midcontinent lakes in the u s had higher phytoplankton species richness than other regions stomp et al 2011 the higher phytoplankton abundance at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was presumably due to the higher tn and tp concentrations at those sites table 1 rivers in the midcontinent region typically have higher nutrient levels because soils in that region are naturally rich in nutrients and that region has more intensive agricultural activities omernik 1987 omernik and griffith 2014 stets et al 2015 u s epa 2022 3 5 the positive correlations between nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton abundance we investigated how critical physicochemical parameters mainly nutrients shaped the phytoplankton community at the sampling sites in the twelve large freshwater rivers across the u s fig s7 phytoplankton abundance often had significant positive linear correlations with nutrient concentrations water temperature and water ph p values 0 05 table s5 in addition a constrained cca map shows that phytoplankton except for planktothrix abundance was associated with intermediate or high nutrient concentrations and water temperatures fig 5 for instance bacillariophyta cyanobacteria chlorophyta and dinoflagellates were associated with intermediate levels of ammonium ammonia nitrite nitrate dissolved organic nitrogen and orthophosphate similarly phytoplankton abundance in 540 freshwater lakes and reservoirs across the u s had significant positive linear correlations with both tn and tp concentrations p values 0 001 stomp et al 2011 for comparsion water temperature had a significant positive linear correlation with phytoplankton richness p value 0 001 additionally the constrained cca map shows that the streamflow rates at the sampling sites were a driver for planktothrix therefore the phytoplankton community at the sampling sites in the twelve rivers was shaped by the critical physicochemical parameters mainly nutrients indicating local environmental conditions are the main drivers for phytoplankton community dynamics in rivers the correlations between phytoplankton abundance and the tested physicochemical parameters were weak as indicated by the small r squared values table s5 the low degrees of correlations indicate that the tested physicochemical parameters explained a small portion of the variation in phytoplankton abundance indeed the first and second axes in the constrained cca map explain only 23 52 and 5 96 of the total inertia respectively fig 5 therefore some environmental parameters not tested might have more significantly affected phytoplankton abundance such as light intensity wind intensity precipitation stormwater runoff and biological agents predators and competitors cao et al 2018 elser and hassett 1994 feng et al 2021 hunt and matveev 2005 jones and redfield 1984 kiefer and cullen 1991 reichwaldt et al 2004 rhee and gotham 1981 schelske et al 1995 silva et al 2019 striebel et al 2008 webster 1990 in the future it would be beneficial if studies include more physicochemical parameters when determining how environmental conditions shape phytoplankton communities the low degrees of correlations could also be because those critical physicochemical parameters were determined only several times during each sampling season table s1 and thus might not reflect the overall water quality e g trophic conditions at the sampling sites the annual average tn and tp concentrations numerous sampling events included at the sampling sites could be more representative indeed phytoplankton abundance had positive linear correlations with the twelve sampling sites annual average tn and tp concentrations fig 6 compared with tn tp explained more variation in phytoplankton abundance specifically tn and tp explained 26 1 and 38 9 of the variation in the log10 transformed gm abundance of phytoplankton respectively in a multiple linear regression model tn and tp significantly predicted the log10 transformed gm abundance of phytoplankton adjusted r 2 0 385 p value 0 001 n 34 at the sampling sites eq 2 2 log 10 a gm 0 266 lo g 10 c tn 0 766 lo g 10 c tp 4 268 where a gm is the annual gm of the qpcr based abundance of four major phytoplankton groups bacillariophyta cyanobacteria chlorophyta and dinoflagellates for individual sampling sites gcn l 1 c tn is the annual am of tn concentrations for individual sampling sites Î¼g l 1 and c tp is the annual am of tp concentrations for individual sampling sites Î¼g l 1 the large multiple correlation coefficient r of 0 650 indicates a good level of prediction the significant positive correlations between phytoplankton abundance and nutrient concentrations further suggest that qpcr based phytoplankton abundance can indicate freshwater river trophic conditions even though nutrients explain much variation in phytoplankton abundance they are not the only factors affecting phytoplankton growth for instance the constrained cca map fig 5 indicates that phytoplankton abundance was affected by multiple other environmental variables such as streamflow rates water temperature and water ph 3 6 qpcr as a numerical tool for assessing phytoplankton abundance and the trophic conditions of freshwater rivers qpcr is a useful numerical tool for assessing phytoplankton and the trophic conditions of freshwater rivers first as stated above microscopy and other approaches such as pigment based assays for phytoplankton assessment have multiple shortcomings qpcr a widely used molecular technique has many advantages over microscopy and other phytoplankton evaluation assays this study demonstrates that qpcr and microscope based phytoplankton abundance had a strong positive linear correlation fig 2 table 2 and eq 1 even though qpcr cannot replace microscopy for phytoplankton assessment it is a proper alternative to microscopy for identifying and quantifying phytoplankton second phytoplankton abundance indicates river trophic conditions trophic state index tsi is a common indicator of the trophic status of natural surface waterbodies bilgin 2020 hu et al 2021 kiersztyn et al 2002 tsi can be based on transparency i e carlson s tsi carlson 1977 chlorophyll a concentration i e the modified carlson s tsi aizaki et al 1981 and other biological chemical and physical indicators such as cod tn concentration and tp concentration lopes et al 2019 primpas et al 2010 xu et al 2001 no matter how tsi is determined it is a numerical indicator of surface water trophic status lopes et al 2019 neverova dziopak et al 2023 yang et al 2016 overgrowth of phytoplankton such as cyanobacteria and algae is the distinctive biological consequence of eutrophication gonzÃ¡lez and roldÃ¡n 2020 qin et al 2013 sari et al 2022 xu et al 2010 yang et al 2021b therefore phytoplankton abundance and tsi have an inherent positive correlation adamovich et al 2016 caputo et al 2008 dembowska et al 2015 altogether phytoplankton abundance which can be feasibly determined via qpcr is a useful indicator of the trophic conditions of natural surface waterbodies third qpcr is a promising molecular tool for assessing phytoplankton and thus the trophic conditions of natural surface waterbodies the overgrowth of phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria is the most direct and significant biological consequence of eutrophication in freshwater bodies wilhelm et al 2004 multiple assays are available to assess phytoplankton in fresh water these assays mainly include chlorophyll a concentration determination chlorophyll a is a photosynthetic pigment in all phytoplankton chew and bryant 2007 gregor and marÅ¡Ã¡lek 2004 patel 2011 and a good proxy for phytoplankton biomass water quality and eutrophication boyer et al 2009 chen and chen 2022 filazzola et al 2020 guo et al 2018 xia and zeng 2021 nonetheless chlorophyll a assessment as a first tier tool fails to reveal phytoplankton composition almuhtaram et al 2021 garmendia et al 2013 other common approaches for phytoplankton assessment such as microscopy fatty acid based procedures flow cytometry and next generation sequencing also have limitations therefore a more feasible approach for assessing phytoplankton and freshwater trophic status is highly needed qpcr determines not only the abundance but also the community structure of phytoplankton qpcr is also powerful in monitoring potential cyanotoxin producers and predicting cyanotoxin production duan et al 2022 lu et al 2020 pacheco et al 2016 moreover the qpcr based phytoplankton abundance was significantly correlated with nutrient i e tn and tp levels figs 5 and 6 and eq 2 as a result qpcr based phytoplankton abundance is a useful indicator of the trophic conditions and health of freshwater bodies however caution should be taken for waterbodies with very high nutrient concentrations because hyper eutrophication could inhibit phytoplankton s growth and primary production filstrup and downing 2017 graham et al 2004b parker et al 2012 yoshiyama and sharp 2006 in addition nutrient concentrations are a common surrogate for freshwater trophic conditions but the correlation between phytoplankton abundance and nutrient concentrations was weak fig 6 the weak correlation was mainly because other environmental parameters besides nutrients played an essential role in shaping the phytoplankton community fig 5 therefore the use of qpcr to assess the trophic conditions and health of freshwater bodies should be more comprehensively evaluated in future studies phytoplankton community structure is complex and quantifying all phytoplankton taxa using qpcr is labor intensive time consuming and perhaps impossible supposedly a selected phytoplankton taxon can indicate other phytoplankton in this case one may use qpcr to assess the selected taxon to represent the phytoplankton community and to indicate freshwater trophic status reducing the workload and increasing the feasibility of qpcr cyanobacteria are a common and frequently dominant phytoplankton division in freshwater bodies and often form harmful blooms during warm seasons duan et al 2022 lu et al 2020 o neil et al 2012 paerl et al 2001 the high abundance of cyanobacteria makes their detection through either microscopy or qpcr feasible we thus hypothesized that cyanobacteria can indicate the phytoplankton community to test this hypothesis we first tested whether cyanobacterial abundance was comparable to that of other phytoplankton statistical analysis indicates that the qpcr based cyanobacterial abundance was significantly higher than the other three major phytoplankton groups bacillariophyta chlorophyta and dinoflagellates table s6a therefore cyanobacteria were a dominant phytoplankton group at the sampling sites in the twelve freshwater rivers figs 3a and 4a in addition cyanobacterial abundance had a significant positive linear correlation with other tested phytoplankton groups except for c raciborskii which might have a different growth pattern than other common cyanobacterial species table s7 therefore a high or low abundance of cyanobacteria suggests that the abundance of other phytoplankton is high or low respectively as a result as a representative and common phytoplankton division cyanobacteria can indicate the occurrence and abundance of other important phytoplankton using qpcr to detect and quantify cyanobacteria could be a simple fast and effective way to assess phytoplankton community and the trophic conditions of freshwater bodies however cyanobacterial assessment is a rough way to indicate the phytoplankton community with time and resources permitting other phytoplankton groups should also be assessed 3 7 limitations and future work we sampled twelve large freshwater rivers throughout the u s to capture a wide range of streamflow water quality and phytoplankton community conditions our study demonstrates that qpcr works well to assess phytoplankton abundance and to indicate river trophic status across a wide range of conditions our study design leveraged an ongoing sampling effort within the usgs national water quality network nwqn usgs 2022a while this study design was adequate for method i e qpcr validation it fails to determine reach level or ecosystem level trophic status future studies aiming to evaluate river trophic status need to compare traditional metrics with qpcr qpcr cannot be incorporated into trophic status evaluations until further research and comparisons have been completed there are three limitations of this study that can hopefully be addressed by future research first we sampled from two five and five rivers in the western midcontinent and eastern regions of the u s respectively table 1 and fig 1 results based on the low number of rivers especially in the western region might need to be more representative it would be beneficial to include more rivers in each region to better represent the stream conditions second we sampled from one site in each river the ecosystem of each river is highly dynamic longitudinally water quality parameters environmental conditions and phytoplankton community composition vary significantly along each river therefore one sampling site cannot represent the entire river ecosystem phytoplankton abundance and community composition determined in the current work thus represent only the sampling sites rather than the entire rivers future studies aiming to assess the spatial variation of phytoplankton in these rivers should include multiple sampling sites along each river third we leveraged an ongoing usgs nwqn sampling effort usgs 2022a to conduct this study and added additional analyses to routinely collected samples within the nwqn in the nwqn the sampling effort differed for the regions or rivers therefore the number of samples in the current work was unequal across the different regions or rivers future studies comparing phytoplankton abundance and composition in different regions and or rivers need to ensure an equal sampling effort 4 conclusions this work is the first qpcr based large scale multi year comprehensive study on the abundance of phytoplankton in multiple freshwater rivers across the u s this study demonstrates that qpcr is a useful molecular tool to quantify phytoplankton and assess eutrophication in freshwater rivers using qpcr and microscopy we assessed dominant phytoplankton at the sampling sites in twelve large freshwater rivers across the u s from early summer to late fall in 2017 2018 and 2019 phytoplankton abundance varied little within each sampling season and over the three years studied the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers had higher phytoplankton abundance than the sites in the eastern and western rivers primarily because the sites in the midcontinent rivers were more eutrophic i e having higher tn and tp concentrations phytoplankton abundance was comparable at the sampling sites in the eastern and western rivers the qpcr and microscope based phytoplankton abundance had a significant positive linear correlation in addition qpcr based phytoplankton abundance had significant positive correlations with nutrient levels a surrogate of trophic status of natural surface waterbodies therefore qpcr is a useful molecular tool to determine phytoplankton abundance and indicate freshwater rivers trophic conditions and quality finally cyanobacteria had a much higher abundance and significant positive linear correlations with other phytoplankton therefore cyanobacteria as a dominant phytoplankton group can potentially represent the phytoplankton community and infer the trophic conditions of

14869,phytoplankton is the essential primary producer in fresh surface water ecosystems however excessive phytoplankton growth due to eutrophication significantly threatens ecologic economic and public health therefore phytoplankton identification and quantification are essential to understanding the productivity and health of freshwater ecosystems as well as the impacts of phytoplankton overgrowth such as cyanobacterial blooms on public health microscopy is the gold standard for phytoplankton assessment but is time consuming has low throughput and requires rich experience in phytoplankton morphology quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr is accurate and straightforward with high throughput in addition qpcr does not require expertise in phytoplankton morphology therefore qpcr can be a useful alternative for molecular identification and enumeration of phytoplankton nonetheless a comprehensive study is missing which evaluates and compares the feasibility of using qpcr and microscopy to assess phytoplankton in fresh water this study 1 compared the performance of qpcr and microscopy in identifying and quantifying phytoplankton and 2 evaluated qpcr as a molecular tool to assess phytoplankton and indicate eutrophication we assessed phytoplankton using both qpcr and microscopy in twelve large freshwater rivers across the united states from early summer to late fall in 2017 2018 and 2019 qpcr and microscope based phytoplankton abundance had a significant positive linear correlation adjusted r 2 0 836 p value 0 001 phytoplankton abundance had limited temporal variation within each sampling season and over the three years studied the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers had higher phytoplankton abundance than those in the eastern and western rivers for instance the concentration geometric mean of bacillariophyta cyanobacteria chlorophyta and dinoflagellates at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was approximately three times that at the sampling sites in the western rivers and approximately 18 times that at the sampling sites in the eastern rivers welch s analysis of variance indicates that phytoplankton abundance at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was significantly higher than that at the sampling sites in the eastern rivers p value 0 013 but was comparable to that at the sampling sites in the western rivers p value 0 095 the higher phytoplankton abundance at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was presumably because these rivers were more eutrophic indeed low phytoplankton abundance occurred in oligotrophic or low trophic sites whereas eutrophic sites had greater phytoplankton abundance this study demonstrates that qpcr based phytoplankton abundance can be a useful numerical

cyanobacteria is the biological consequence of freshwater eutrophication duan et al 2022 lu et al 2020 wilhelm et al 2004 phytoplankton overgrowth deteriorates water quality threatens ecosystems e g aquatic organism mortality and biodiversity reduction and can limit recreational opportunities the overgrowth also poses public health risks and raises other issues by releasing harmful toxins mainly cyanotoxins and taste and odor compounds causing the water to be unsafe and or unpleasant for consumption and recreation chislock et al 2013 graham et al 2010 steffen et al 2017 wilhelm et al 2004 in addition the annual economic losses due to freshwater eutrophication are over 2 2 billion dollars in the u s dodds et al 2009 phytoplankton overgrowth e g algal and cyanobacterial blooms results from eutrophication and poses substantial risks to the environment and public health therefore evaluating phytoplankton is critical to understanding freshwater bodies ecological conditions and trophic status aboim et al 2020 dembowska et al 2018 li et al 2020 sayers et al 2021 microscopy is the gold standard for assessing phytoplankton clementson et al 2021 ding et al 2022 dugdale et al 2012 hoang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 however it is time consuming labor intensive and less efficient dunker 2019 malkassian et al 2011 rivas villar et al 2021 yu et al 2021 microscopy also requires rich experience in phytoplankton morphology and is difficult to operate for high frequency spatial and or temporal sample analysis moreover microscopy is unable to identify cells with significant morphology changes e g broken and shrunk cells cannot discriminate cryptic species cannot determine if a strain can produce toxins and may be confounded by fixatives jeffrey and vesk 1997 xiao et al 2014 furthermore microscopic analysis of phytoplankton is prone to human error and bias e g misidentification of species and missing picoplanktonic taxa culverhouse 2007 luo et al 2006 paliÅska and surosz 2008 to overcome the limitations of microscopy researchers have developed alternatives to identify and quantify phytoplankton and study phytoplankton community structure those alternatives include pigment based approaches often via high performance liquid chromatography or spectrofluorometry lee et al 2020 pan et al 2020 srichandan et al 2020 stoyneva gÃ¤rtner et al 2020 yu et al 2021 fatty acid based procedures caÃ±avate et al 2019 canavate 2019 dijkman and kromkamp 2006 galloway and winder 2015 analytical and imaging flow cytometry dunker 2020 latasa et al 2021 liu et al 2021 moorhouse et al 2018 read et al 2014 and high throughput sequencing or next generation sequencing dos santos et al 2022 gong et al 2020 malashenkov et al 2021 yang et al 2021a these alternatives have limitations for instance pigments e g chlorophyll are a widely used proxy for algal biomass and an indicator of trophic status chen and chen 2022 dodds et al 1998 mineeva and makarova 2018 however pigment based approaches are insensitive and inaccurate i e unable to differentiate phytoplankton species accurately thereby providing little information on phytoplankton community composition catherine et al 2012 tian et al 2020 yu et al 2021 fatty acid based methods have similar limitations to the pigment based approaches because they also lack sufficient reference libraries caÃ±avate et al 2019 flow cytometry is less accurate requires complicated staining is bottlenecked by small sample volumes processed and has a low taxonomic resolution dashkova et al 2017 dubelaar and jonker 2000 markina 2019 even though high throughput sequencing is much better at evaluating phytoplankton community diversity compared to quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr it is poor at quantifying abundances is expensive could be disrupted by sequencing errors and requires extensive bioinformatic expertise to interpret the data poretsky et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 because of the shortcomings of microscopy and the alternative assays we propose using qpcr to screen phytoplankton in surface waterbodies qpcr is a rapid accurate sensitive robust reproducible high throughput and cost effective method galazzo et al 2020 smith and osborn 2009 qpcr instruments are more accessible than flow cytometers and high throughput sequencing platforms azat 2021 raso and biassoni 2014 qpcr also does not require knowledge of phytoplankton taxonomy or morphology but can reveal both the abundance and taxonomic identification of phytoplankton in addition unlike pigment based approaches and flow cytometry qpcr can be coupled with high throughput sequencing jian et al 2020 to assess phytoplankton community with a high accuracy large dynamic range and high processing capability i e simultaneous sequencing of millions of dna molecules churko et al 2013 reuter et al 2015 furthermore because of the rapid innovation in qpcr instrumentation and protocols we can upgrade qpcr to a high throughput assay pearson et al 2021 porter and hajibabaei 2018 wilcox et al 2020 most studies use qpcr to assess genes encoding cyanotoxins e g microcystins cylindrospermopsin anatoxin a and saxitoxin and cyanobacteria especially cyanotoxin producing cyanobacteria almuhtaram et al 2021 christensen et al 2019 eldridge et al 2017 kulabhusan and campbell 2021 otten et al 2015 pacheco et al 2016 sagova mareckova et al 2021 schweitzer natan et al 2019 tavakoli et al 2021 zupanÄiÄ et al 2021 however the feasibility of qpcr in identifying and quantifying phytoplankton especially non cyanobacterial phytoplankton in freshwater rivers has not been fully evaluated in a comparative study with microscopy this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using qpcr to assess phytoplankton by monitoring phytoplankton in twelve large freshwater rivers across the u s from early summer to late fall in 2017 2018 and 2019 because freshwater phytoplankton community dynamics are driven by local environmental factors stomp et al 2011 we assessed how environmental parameters such as nutrients shaped the phytoplankton community we hypothesized that qpcr and microscopy based phytoplankton abundance would be positively correlated supporting the use of qpcr as a numerical tool for phytoplankton assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and river water sampling this study included twelve large inland and coastal freshwater rivers in the western two midcontinent five and eastern five regions across the u s table 1 and fig 1 in this study the western region refers to the region in the west of the sierra nevada and cascade ranges and the eastern region refers to the region east of the appalachian range the midcontinent region refers to the region between the western and eastern regions we sampled river water in 2017 2018 and 2019 from one sampling site in each river according to the u s geological survey usgs national water quality assessment nawqa protocol usgs 2019 usgs 2022a we used appropriate sampling techniques to obtain representative river samples the sampling spanned early summer through late fall each year since phytoplankton does not grow well and has low abundance during cold seasons i e winter and spring especially in large streams savoy et al 2019 we did not sample during cold seasons two sets of river water samples were collected in parallel during each sampling event defined as river water collection from a site on a sampling day the first set was an isokinetic sample for physicochemical water quality assessment and microscopic analysis of phytoplankton the second set was a near surface grab sample collected at the centroid of a river for qpcr in this study we collected the samples for qpcr from the centroids to minimize microbial contamination of the sampling equipment in addition when a single sampling spot must be selected the centroid of a flow generally represents the cross section of the stream graham et al 2012 in total we included 166 sampling events for qpcr table s1 and a similar number of sampling events for physicochemical water quality assessment and microscopic analysis additional details on the sampling sites and sample collection are described elsewhere graham et al 2020 usgs 2022a zuellig et al 2021 2 2 microscopic assessment of phytoplankton and physicochemical water quality assessment the microscopic assay for phytoplankton identification and enumeration is described somewhere else graham et al 2020 2021 2022 king et al 2020a 2020b zuellig et al 2021 briefly we collected river water in 500 ml high density polyethylene bottles to shoulder full using teflon churns each river water sample was preserved with approximately 5 ml of acidified lugol s iodine in the same bottle in 2017 and 2018 we concentrated phytoplankton by settling and identified enumerated phytoplankton following established protocols komÃ¡rek 1999 2008 2013 2016 komÃ¡rek et al 2014 komÃ¡rek and anagnostidis 2007 rosen et al 2017 2018 wehr et al 2015 in 2019 we quantified phytoplankton using a permanent n 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylamide mounting technique phycotech com for all river samples we identified and enumerated phytoplankton using an olympus bx51 research grade microscope olympus corporation tokyo japan with variable magnifications depending on identified taxa we enumerated phytoplankton to the lowest possible taxonomic level typically genus or species via natural units all samples or cell counts 2018 and 2019 samples a natural unit is the natural growth form of phytoplankton such as an individual cell a colony or a filament the natural unit is commonly used for microscopic phytoplankton enumeration graham et al 2004a lehman et al 2021 onyema 2018 vuorio et al 2020 in this work the microscope based phytoplankton abundance is expressed in nu l 1 in which nu stands for natural units at least 400 natural units were counted per sample rosen et al 2018 phytoplankton identification and enumeration methods and data for the 2017 2018 and 2019 samples are available in king et al 2020a and king et al 2020b graham et al 2021 and graham et al 2022 respectively we also determined multiple physicochemical water quality parameters graham et al 2020 usgs 2022a zuellig et al 2021 we analyzed how 21 critical physicochemical parameters affected the

using the usgs station numbers listed in table 1 usgs 2022b 2 3 qpcr assessment of phytoplankton we quantified nine critical phytoplankton groups via qpcr following established protocols lu et al 2016 2017 zhang et al 2021 the nine groups are 1 bacillariophyta division 2 cyanobacteria division 3 chlorophyta specific to three classes in the division chlorophyta chlorophyceae trebouxiophyceae and klebsormidiophyceae 4 dinoflagellates class 5 dolichospermum genus 6 microcystis genus 7 planktothrix genus 8 synechococcus genus and 9 cylindrospermopsis raciborskii species updated name raphidiopsis raciborskii dolichospermum microcystis planktothrix synechococcus and c raciborskii are cyanobacteria we selected these nine groups because they are common and dominant phytoplankton in freshwater bodies duan et al 2022 lu et al 2020 lueangthuwapranit et al 2011 marshall 2009 wilhelm et al 2004 this study was not to assess all phytoplankton in the twelve rivers using qpcr therefore the analysis of certain phytoplankton groups common in fresh water such as prochlorophyta and xanthophyceae two classes in the division ochrophyta was excluded we included 50 50 and 66 sampling events in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively 166 in total for qpcr table s1 we included biological duplicates for 25 of the 166 sampling events we sampled river water for qpcr in autoclaved and bleached 500 ml polypropylene bottles and filtered the samples using nuclepore polycarbonate filters whatman ge healthcare piscataway new jersey u s a graham et al 2020 the filters with captured biomass were stored in tubes containing acid washed glass beads i e bead tubes and shipped to our u s environmental protection agency u s epa laboratory in cincinnati ohio u s a for qpcr we added 400 Î¼l of 1 tissue cell lysis solution epicenter technologies corp madison wisconsin u s a into each bead tube and stored the bead tubes at 20 c before genomic dna extraction we lysed the stored cells by shaking the bead tubes for 1 min with a mini beadbeater 16 biospec products inc bartlesville oklahoma u s a we then centrifuged the tubes at 12 000 g for 3 min at room temperature and transferred the supernatant containing dna to sterile 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tubes one microliter of proteinase k 50 Î¼g Î¼l 1 epicenter technologies corp was mixed with the supernatant of each sample and the mixture was incubated at 65 c for 15 min subsequently 1 Î¼l of rnase a 5 ng Î¼l 1 epicenter technologies corp was added to each supernatant sample and the mixture was incubated at 37 c for 30 min before 200 Î¼l of mpc protein epicenter technologies corp was added the final mixture was incubated on ice for 5 min before being centrifuged at 15 000 g for 10 min at room temperature we then purified total genomic dna from the supernatant using a zymobiomics dna miniprep kit zymo research irvine california u s a the dna samples were quantified with a qubit fluorometer thermo fisher scientific inc waltham massachusetts u s a and stored at 20 c until use we determined the abundance of the nine phytoplankton groups via sybr green qpcr assays on a quantstudio 6 flex real time pcr system applied biosystems waltham

Î¼l 1 life technologies co and 5 Î¼l of nuclease free water we diluted the dna extract for each sample ten times with molecular grade water both the undiluted and the ten fold diluted dna extracts were used as qpcr templates assessing the dna of the phytoplankton in both the undiluted and the diluted dna samples helped detect qpcr inhibition and operation errors zhang et al 2021 the target genes were quantified relative to in house constructed standard series all qpcr standards were recombinant plasmid dna with the same backbone invitrogen pcr 4 topo ta vector thermo fisher scientific inc the insert for each qpcr standard was a conventional pcr product amplified with the same primer set for the corresponding qpcr assay table s2 each qpcr plate contained a triplicate standard series ten fold serial dilution with plasmid concentration ranging from 101 to 106 copies per microliter 2017 and 2018 samples or from 100 to 106 copies per microliter 2019 samples the phytoplankton abundance in the river water samples is expressed in gene or genome copy number per liter gcn l 1 where one gcn is equal to one copy of the qpcr amplicon in most cases each qpcr amplicon has one copy in the genome of each phytoplankton group nine groups in total however each genome of microcystis has one or two copies of the qpcr amplicon and each genome of synechococcus has one two or three copies of the qpcr amplicon the limit of detection lod in the dna extracts was 3 gcn Î¼l 1 for each qpcr assay 2 4 data filtering analysis and reporting we processed the physicochemical water quality data and microscope based phytoplankton abundance according to graham et al 2020 zuellig et al 2021 and usgs 2022a we filtered qpcr results e g removal of data points with significant pcr inhibition incorrect melt curves and other issues following zhang et al 2021 if the concentrations of a qpcr target in the undiluted and the ten fold diluted dna extracts for a river water sample were both below 1 gcn Î¼l 1 or undetermined i e no significant fluorescent signal after 40 qpcr cycles we assumed that the concentration of the corresponding phytoplankton group in the river water sample was 1 gcn l 1 the assumption was made because a zero value i e 0 gcn l 1 would complicate downstream data processing especially the calculation of a geometric mean or gm if the concentration of a qpcr target in a dna extract was below the lod 3 gcn Î¼l 1 but higher than 1 gcn Î¼l 1 we assumed that the concentration was accurate klymus et al 2020 kralik and ricchi 2017 we used microsoft office s excel professional plus 2021 version 2112 microsoft corporation redmond washington u s a for data management and figure plotting we used spss statistics version 26 0 the international business machines corporation armonk new york u s a for statistical analysis such as analysis of variance anova the major assumptions for anova such as normal distributions were also checked a constrained canonical correspondence analysis cca map was generated with an excel add in xlstat version 2019 2 2 addinsoft 2022 the significance level was 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality conditions of the twelve rivers across the u s rivers are important representative freshwater ecosystems acting as a conveyor belt transporting nutrients and pollutants from the land to the oceans wang et al 2018 therefore we utilized freshwater rivers to represent freshwater bodies we strategically selected the twelve large freshwater rivers to include various geographic regions stream drainage areas and streamflow rates so that the selected rivers could suggest the streams in the regions graham et al 2020 zuellig et al 2021 those rivers are in three major regions in the u s the western region two rivers the midcontinent region five rivers and the eastern region five rivers table 1 and fig 1 the twelve rivers include both inland and coastal rivers the drainage areas arithmetic mean am standard deviation 175 953 361 458 km2 of the rivers ranged from 6 294 km2 the chattahoochee river to 1 353 269 km2 the missouri river from the water years of 2017 to 2019 the annual average volumetric flow rates 1 230 1 510 m3 s 1 at the sampling sites ranged from 54 m3 s 1 the trinity river 2017 to 5 870 m3 s 1 the ohio river 2019 the usgs defines a water year as 12 months from october 1st in any given calendar year through september 30th in the following calendar year the sampling sites in the twelve large rivers had distinct water quality conditions from water years 2017 to 2019 table 1 the annual average suspended solids ss concentrations 95 2 118 5 mg l 1 ranged from 14 5 mg l 1 the willamette river 2017 to 402 mg l 1 the missouri river 2017 the annual average tn concentrations 2 202 2 016 Î¼g l 1 ranged from 315 Î¼g l 1 the sacramento river 2019 to 8 040 Î¼g l 1 the trinity river 2017 from the water years of 2017 to 2019 the annual average tp concentrations 201 221 Î¼g l 1 ranged from 46 Î¼g l 1 the connecticut river 2019 to 833 Î¼g l 1 the trinity river 2017 the summer median concentrations of tn and tp for rivers in 14 ecoregions across the u s ranged from 248 to 3 372 Î¼g l 1 1 173 839 Î¼g l 1 and from 21 to 184 Î¼g l 1 89 52 Î¼g l 1 respectively dodds et al 2009 therefore the tn and tp concentrations at the sampling sites in the twelve rivers encompassed ranges of nutrient conditions of rivers in various ecoregions across the u s the sampling sites in the three regions had significantly different tn and tp concentrations one way anova p values 0 001 tukey post hoc tests reveal that tn and tp concentrations were significantly higher at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers than those in the eastern and western rivers p values 0 001 however both tn and tp concentrations were comparable at the sampling sites in the western and eastern rivers p values 0 05 nutrient concentration is a common indicator of the trophic status of natural surface waterbodies dai et al 2016 huo et al 2013 knoll et al 2015 yao et al 2019 therefore on the basis of nutrients the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers were more eutrophic than those in the eastern and western rivers by contrast the sampling sites in the eastern and western rivers had similar trophic statuses in addition the sampling sites in the three regions had significantly different ss concentrations one way anova p value 0 001 the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers had significantly higher ss concentrations than those in the western and eastern rivers turkey post hoc tests p values 0 011 by contrast the sampling sites in the western and eastern rivers had comparable ss concentrations turkey post hoc test p value 0 05 previous studies similarly found that rivers in the midcontinent region or the midwest region in the u s typically had higher nutrient concentrations and poorer water quality than rivers in the western and eastern regions graham et al 2020 smith et al 1997 stets et al 2015 zuellig et al 2021 the higher nutrient concentrations in the midcontinent rivers could be due to various reasons both natural and anthropogenic khatri and tyagi 2015 for instance the more intensive agricultural activities higher use of fertilizers in the midcontinent region might have contributed to the higher nutrient concentrations in river water in that region najwah and philip 2021 stets et al 2015 soils in the midcontinent region are also naturally nutrient rich omernik 1987 omernik and griffith 2014 u s epa 2022 in addition land use and climate changes are stronger in the midcontinent region chapin et al 1997 furthermore the sampling site in the trinity river in the midcontinent region had the highest nutrient concentrations in the current study which could be because the sampling site was downstream of a municipal wastewater treatment plant that site was built by the usgs and has been sampled for decades in addition no usgs sampling site upstream of the treatment plant exists other sampling sites were not strongly affected by wastewater further studies to explore more deeply the reasons for the higher nutrient concentrations in rivers in the midcontinent region would be beneficial this study used nutrient primarily tn and tp levels to surrogate eutrophication tn and tp are widely used indicators of eutrophication dai et al 2016 huo et al 2013 knoll et al 2015 yao et al 2019 widely accepted tn concentration boundaries for delineating oligotrophic from mesotrophic streams and mesotrophic from eutrophic streams are 700 and 1 500 Î¼g l 1 respectively dodds et al 1998 tp concentration boundaries for delineating oligotrophic from mesotrophic streams and mesotrophic from eutrophic streams are 25 and 75 Î¼g l 1 respectively on the basis of these boundaries trophic conditions varied among the sampling sites in the twelve rivers table 1 the sampling site in the chattahoochee river in the eastern region and all sampling sites in the midcontinent region were eutrophic the sampling site in the susquehanna river in the eastern region and the sampling site in the willamette river in the western region were mesotrophic in the eastern region the delaware river and the hudson river sampling sites were mesotrophic indicated by tn concentrations to eutrophic indicated by tp concentrations the sampling site in the connecticut river in the eastern region and the sampling site in the sacramento river in the western region were oligotrophic indicated by tn concentrations to mesotrophic indicated by tp concentrations because the sampling sites in the twelve rivers covered various geographical regions stream drainage areas streamflow rates nutrient concentrations and trophic conditions our study locations suggested broad freshwater river conditions therefore our findings can suggest the general conditions of freshwater rivers in the u s 3 2 qpcr as a useful numerical tool to assess phytoplankton we compared the qpcr and microscope based abundance graham et al 2020 graham et al 2021 graham et al 2022 king et al 2020a for eight phytoplankton groups at the sampling sites in the twelve rivers in 2017 2018 and 2019 fig 2 bacillariophyta cyanobacteria chlorophyta dinoflagellates dolichospermum microcystis planktothrix and synechococcus c raciborskii was excluded from this analysis because it was not identified by microscopy in this comparison the microscope based phytoplankton abundance is in natural units because the abundance in cell counts is available for only the 2018 and 2019 samples the qpcr and microscope based phytoplankton abundance had a significant positive linear correlation adjusted r 2 0 836 p value 0 001 n 815 eq 1 1 a qpcr 1 176 a micriscopy 0 803 where a qpcr is the qpcr based phytoplankton abundance log10 gcn l 1 and a microscopy is the microscope based phytoplankton abundance log10 nu l 1 for each of the eight phytoplankton groups the linear correlation between qpcr and microscope based abundance was also statistically significant with a relatively large adjusted r squared average adjusted r squared 0 556 table 2 these results suggest that qpcr is feasible for assessing phytoplankton abundance and community composition in the twelve rivers and presumably general natural surface waterbodies in the future more studies to evaluate and confirm the feasibility of qpcr for phytoplankton assessment in other waterbodies would be beneficial for most sampling events the qpcr based phytoplankton abundance was equal to or higher than the microscope based abundance table 2 and fig 2 indeed the overall linear regression between qpcr and microscope based phytoplankton abundance shows higher qpcr based abundance eq 1 four reasons can explain the higher qpcr based abundance first qpcr could overestimate phytoplankton abundance by detecting extracellular dna in the river water samples bairoliya et al 2021 liang and keeley 2013 nagler et al 2018 nielsen et al 2007 second phytoplankton cells with significant morphology changes are challenging to pick up during microscopic analysis whereas qpcr accurately enumerates those cells similarly small phytoplankton cells sizes less than 3 Î¼m and rare phytoplankton taxa can escape microscopic detection but are quantified by qpcr brewin et al 2014 graham et al 2020 malashenkov et al 2021 xiao et al 2014 for instance synechococcus cells are small and the linear correlation between qpcr and microscope based synechococcus abundance is the weakest i e having the smallest adjusted r squared among the eight phytoplankton groups therefore microscopy might underestimate phytoplankton abundance for example we generated 1 304 pairs of data points for the qpcr and microscope based phytoplankton abundance from 163 sampling events in 2017 2018 and 2019 for 477 of the 1 304 pairs of data points qpcr detected phytoplankton while microscopy did not fig 2 by contrast in only 12 of the 1 304 pairs of data points microscopy detected phytoplankton while qpcr did not interestingly 11 of those 12 pairs of data points were for planktothrix where the microscope based planktothrix abundance was in the range from 2 31 to 3 91 log10 nu l 1 this finding indicates that the qpcr assay targeting planktothrix table s2 often underestimates the abundance and an updated more accurate qpcr assay is needed third we assessed phytoplankton using microscopy and qpcr in single composite and near surface grab samples respectively the different samples for microscopic and qpcr analyses could be another reason for the higher qpcr based phytoplankton abundance lastly in the current study we quantified phytoplankton in natural units using microscopy graham et al 2020 in the cases of colonies and filaments multiple cells comprise a natural unit therefore for colonies and filaments the number of natural units would be lower than the number of gene or genome copies determined by qpcr fig 2 table 2 and eq 1 for the 2019 samples we estimated the number of cells in colonies and filaments and calculated the number of cells in each natural unit of phytoplankton we then compared the qpcr based phytoplankton abundance gcn l 1 and microscope based phytoplankton abundance cells l 1 the abundance showed a strong positive linear correlation with comparable unstandardized coefficient and constant values to the ones in eq 1 data not shown as a result the first three explanations would be more important for the higher qpcr based phytoplankton abundance microscopy and qpcr both have strengths and shortcomings pacheco et al 2016 xiao et al 2014 for instance a microscope is easy to operate i e a low technology threshold and describes phytoplankton morphology however microscopic analysis is time consuming has low throughput and requires taxonomic or morphology experience qpcr has high throughput and requires no taxonomic knowledge however qpcr fails to describe phytoplankton morphology and viability and does not cover all phytoplankton taxa in addition the sensitivity efficiency and accuracy of qpcr are compromised by dna isolation bias dna amplification bias and inhibitors such as humic acid in environmental samples acharya et al 2017 dechesne et al 2016 lima et al 2022 opel et al 2010 furthermore a qpcr assay i e a specific primer set and a specific thermocycling condition can detect only one phytoplankton group or closely related groups to detect multiple phytoplankton groups one needs to use multiple qpcr assays therefore abandoning microscopy and adopting qpcr as the sole method for phytoplankton assessment is inadequate instead combining qpcr and microscopy would more comprehensively reveal phytoplankton abundance and community structure and provide deeper insights into phytoplankton dynamics in freshwater bodies malashenkov et al 2021 3 3 limited temporal variation in phytoplankton abundance phytoplankton abundance had limited temporal variation at the twelve sampling sites within each sampling season at each sampling site the qpcr based phytoplankton abundance fluctuated within each sampling season figs s1 and s2 no universal trend in the temporal variation of phytoplankton abundance across the twelve sampling sites is observed in addition at some sampling sites the patterns of the temporal variation of phytoplankton abundance changed substantially across the three years studied 2017 2018 and 2019 for instance the phytoplankton abundance at the kansas river sampling site increased during the 2017 sampling season decreased during the 2018 sampling season and was relatively stable during the 2019 sampling season figs s1d and s2d even though phytoplankton abundance fluctuated within each sampling season it was generally stable figs s1 and s2 the stable phytoplankton abundance over time within each sampling season was presumably because the sampling period was from early summer to late fall covering primarily the warm seasons when phytoplankton abundance is high in the future it would be beneficial if studies extend the sampling period to assess the seasonal variation in phytoplankton abundance in these twelve rivers phytoplankton abundance also had limited temporal variation throughout the three years studied 2017 2018 and 2019 the qpcr based phytoplankton abundance was comparable over the three years fig 3 indeed repeated measures anova indicates that the annual gm concentrations were comparable for most phytoplankton groups across the three years at the sampling sites in eleven rivers table s3 the sampling site in the hudson river was excluded from the analysis because the microscope based phytoplankton abundance for that site is available for only 2019 therefore phytoplankton at the sampling sites in the eleven rivers occurred from early summer to late fall at comparable annual abundance the comparable annual phytoplankton abundance indicates that the environmental conditions i e drivers of phytoplankton community dynamics for these sampling sites were stable from 2017 to 2019 stomp et al 2011 other factors might also contribute to the comparable annual phytoplankton abundance over the three years and it would be beneficial to explore those factors in future studies in other freshwater bodies clear temporal interannual trends in phytoplankton abundance and community dynamics existed which could be due to the substantial changes in local and global environmental conditions such as nutrient input water regime and global warming alvarez cobelas et al 2019 chen et al 2003 hardenbicker et al 2014 verasztÃ³ et al 2010 znachor et al 2020 to assess the sustained responses of phytoplankton community dynamics to changes in local and global environmental conditions such as eutrophication management e g nutrient loading reduction efforts and global climate change we need to conduct decadal or even multidecadal studies duarte et al 2009 gallegos et al 2010 3 4 higher phytoplankton abundance at the midcontinent river sampling sites the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers had higher phytoplankton abundance than the sites in the eastern and western rivers figs 1 4 and s3 to s6 for instance the gm concentration of bacillariophyta cyanobacteria chlorophyta and dinoflagellates at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers 7 31 log10 gcn l 1 was approximately three times that at the sampling sites in the western rivers 6 81 log10 gcn l 1 and approximately 18 times that at the sampling sites in the eastern rivers 6 06 log10 gcn l 1 welch s anova indicates that the log10 transformed gm abundance of phytoplankton at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was significantly higher than that at the sampling sites in the eastern rivers p value 0 013 but was comparable to that at the sampling sites in the western rivers p value 0 095 table s4 additionally the log10 transformed gm abundance of phytoplankton at the sampling sites in the eastern and western rivers was comparable p value 0 949 in conclusion the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers had higher phytoplankton abundance than the sampling sites in the western rivers and especially the sampling sites in the eastern rivers a study similarly found that midcontinent lakes in the u s had higher phytoplankton species richness than other regions stomp et al 2011 the higher phytoplankton abundance at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was presumably due to the higher tn and tp concentrations at those sites table 1 rivers in the midcontinent region typically have higher nutrient levels because soils in that region are naturally rich in nutrients and that region has more intensive agricultural activities omernik 1987 omernik and griffith 2014 stets et al 2015 u s epa 2022 3 5 the positive correlations between nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton abundance we investigated how critical physicochemical parameters mainly nutrients shaped the phytoplankton community at the sampling sites in the twelve large freshwater rivers across the u s fig s7 phytoplankton abundance often had significant positive linear correlations with nutrient concentrations water temperature and water ph p values 0 05 table s5 in addition a constrained cca map shows that phytoplankton except for planktothrix abundance was associated with intermediate or high nutrient concentrations and water temperatures fig 5 for instance bacillariophyta cyanobacteria chlorophyta and dinoflagellates were associated with intermediate levels of ammonium ammonia nitrite nitrate dissolved organic nitrogen and orthophosphate similarly phytoplankton abundance in 540 freshwater lakes and reservoirs across the u s had significant positive linear correlations with both tn and tp concentrations p values 0 001 stomp et al 2011 for comparsion water temperature had a significant positive linear correlation with phytoplankton richness p value 0 001 additionally the constrained cca map shows that the streamflow rates at the sampling sites were a driver for planktothrix therefore the phytoplankton community at the sampling sites in the twelve rivers was shaped by the critical physicochemical parameters mainly nutrients indicating local environmental conditions are the main drivers for phytoplankton community dynamics in rivers the correlations between phytoplankton abundance and the tested physicochemical parameters were weak as indicated by the small r squared values table s5 the low degrees of correlations indicate that the tested physicochemical parameters explained a small portion of the variation in phytoplankton abundance indeed the first and second axes in the constrained cca map explain only 23 52 and 5 96 of the total inertia respectively fig 5 therefore some environmental parameters not tested might have more significantly affected phytoplankton abundance such as light intensity wind intensity precipitation stormwater runoff and biological agents predators and competitors cao et al 2018 elser and hassett 1994 feng et al 2021 hunt and matveev 2005 jones and redfield 1984 kiefer and cullen 1991 reichwaldt et al 2004 rhee and gotham 1981 schelske et al 1995 silva et al 2019 striebel et al 2008 webster 1990 in the future it would be beneficial if studies include more physicochemical parameters when determining how environmental conditions shape phytoplankton communities the low degrees of correlations could also be because those critical physicochemical parameters were determined only several times during each sampling season table s1 and thus might not reflect the overall water quality e g trophic conditions at the sampling sites the annual average tn and tp concentrations numerous sampling events included at the sampling sites could be more representative indeed phytoplankton abundance had positive linear correlations with the twelve sampling sites annual average tn and tp concentrations fig 6 compared with tn tp explained more variation in phytoplankton abundance specifically tn and tp explained 26 1 and 38 9 of the variation in the log10 transformed gm abundance of phytoplankton respectively in a multiple linear regression model tn and tp significantly predicted the log10 transformed gm abundance of phytoplankton adjusted r 2 0 385 p value 0 001 n 34 at the sampling sites eq 2 2 log 10 a gm 0 266 lo g 10 c tn 0 766 lo g 10 c tp 4 268 where a gm is the annual gm of the qpcr based abundance of four major phytoplankton groups bacillariophyta cyanobacteria chlorophyta and dinoflagellates for individual sampling sites gcn l 1 c tn is the annual am of tn concentrations for individual sampling sites Î¼g l 1 and c tp is the annual am of tp concentrations for individual sampling sites Î¼g l 1 the large multiple correlation coefficient r of 0 650 indicates a good level of prediction the significant positive correlations between phytoplankton abundance and nutrient concentrations further suggest that qpcr based phytoplankton abundance can indicate freshwater river trophic conditions even though nutrients explain much variation in phytoplankton abundance they are not the only factors affecting phytoplankton growth for instance the constrained cca map fig 5 indicates that phytoplankton abundance was affected by multiple other environmental variables such as streamflow rates water temperature and water ph 3 6 qpcr as a numerical tool for assessing phytoplankton abundance and the trophic conditions of freshwater rivers qpcr is a useful numerical tool for assessing phytoplankton and the trophic conditions of freshwater rivers first as stated above microscopy and other approaches such as pigment based assays for phytoplankton assessment have multiple shortcomings qpcr a widely used molecular technique has many advantages over microscopy and other phytoplankton evaluation assays this study demonstrates that qpcr and microscope based phytoplankton abundance had a strong positive linear correlation fig 2 table 2 and eq 1 even though qpcr cannot replace microscopy for phytoplankton assessment it is a proper alternative to microscopy for identifying and quantifying phytoplankton second phytoplankton abundance indicates river trophic conditions trophic state index tsi is a common indicator of the trophic status of natural surface waterbodies bilgin 2020 hu et al 2021 kiersztyn et al 2002 tsi can be based on transparency i e carlson s tsi carlson 1977 chlorophyll a concentration i e the modified carlson s tsi aizaki et al 1981 and other biological chemical and physical indicators such as cod tn concentration and tp concentration lopes et al 2019 primpas et al 2010 xu et al 2001 no matter how tsi is determined it is a numerical indicator of surface water trophic status lopes et al 2019 neverova dziopak et al 2023 yang et al 2016 overgrowth of phytoplankton such as cyanobacteria and algae is the distinctive biological consequence of eutrophication gonzÃ¡lez and roldÃ¡n 2020 qin et al 2013 sari et al 2022 xu et al 2010 yang et al 2021b therefore phytoplankton abundance and tsi have an inherent positive correlation adamovich et al 2016 caputo et al 2008 dembowska et al 2015 altogether phytoplankton abundance which can be feasibly determined via qpcr is a useful indicator of the trophic conditions of natural surface waterbodies third qpcr is a promising molecular tool for assessing phytoplankton and thus the trophic conditions of natural surface waterbodies the overgrowth of phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria is the most direct and significant biological consequence of eutrophication in freshwater bodies wilhelm et al 2004 multiple assays are available to assess phytoplankton in fresh water these assays mainly include chlorophyll a concentration determination chlorophyll a is a photosynthetic pigment in all phytoplankton chew and bryant 2007 gregor and marÅ¡Ã¡lek 2004 patel 2011 and a good proxy for phytoplankton biomass water quality and eutrophication boyer et al 2009 chen and chen 2022 filazzola et al 2020 guo et al 2018 xia and zeng 2021 nonetheless chlorophyll a assessment as a first tier tool fails to reveal phytoplankton composition almuhtaram et al 2021 garmendia et al 2013 other common approaches for phytoplankton assessment such as microscopy fatty acid based procedures flow cytometry and next generation sequencing also have limitations therefore a more feasible approach for assessing phytoplankton and freshwater trophic status is highly needed qpcr determines not only the abundance but also the community structure of phytoplankton qpcr is also powerful in monitoring potential cyanotoxin producers and predicting cyanotoxin production duan et al 2022 lu et al 2020 pacheco et al 2016 moreover the qpcr based phytoplankton abundance was significantly correlated with nutrient i e tn and tp levels figs 5 and 6 and eq 2 as a result qpcr based phytoplankton abundance is a useful indicator of the trophic conditions and health of freshwater bodies however caution should be taken for waterbodies with very high nutrient concentrations because hyper eutrophication could inhibit phytoplankton s growth and primary production filstrup and downing 2017 graham et al 2004b parker et al 2012 yoshiyama and sharp 2006 in addition nutrient concentrations are a common surrogate for freshwater trophic conditions but the correlation between phytoplankton abundance and nutrient concentrations was weak fig 6 the weak correlation was mainly because other environmental parameters besides nutrients played an essential role in shaping the phytoplankton community fig 5 therefore the use of qpcr to assess the trophic conditions and health of freshwater bodies should be more comprehensively evaluated in future studies phytoplankton community structure is complex and quantifying all phytoplankton taxa using qpcr is labor intensive time consuming and perhaps impossible supposedly a selected phytoplankton taxon can indicate other phytoplankton in this case one may use qpcr to assess the selected taxon to represent the phytoplankton community and to indicate freshwater trophic status reducing the workload and increasing the feasibility of qpcr cyanobacteria are a common and frequently dominant phytoplankton division in freshwater bodies and often form harmful blooms during warm seasons duan et al 2022 lu et al 2020 o neil et al 2012 paerl et al 2001 the high abundance of cyanobacteria makes their detection through either microscopy or qpcr feasible we thus hypothesized that cyanobacteria can indicate the phytoplankton community to test this hypothesis we first tested whether cyanobacterial abundance was comparable to that of other phytoplankton statistical analysis indicates that the qpcr based cyanobacterial abundance was significantly higher than the other three major phytoplankton groups bacillariophyta chlorophyta and dinoflagellates table s6a therefore cyanobacteria were a dominant phytoplankton group at the sampling sites in the twelve freshwater rivers figs 3a and 4a in addition cyanobacterial abundance had a significant positive linear correlation with other tested phytoplankton groups except for c raciborskii which might have a different growth pattern than other common cyanobacterial species table s7 therefore a high or low abundance of cyanobacteria suggests that the abundance of other phytoplankton is high or low respectively as a result as a representative and common phytoplankton division cyanobacteria can indicate the occurrence and abundance of other important phytoplankton using qpcr to detect and quantify cyanobacteria could be a simple fast and effective way to assess phytoplankton community and the trophic conditions of freshwater bodies however cyanobacterial assessment is a rough way to indicate the phytoplankton community with time and resources permitting other phytoplankton groups should also be assessed 3 7 limitations and future work we sampled twelve large freshwater rivers throughout the u s to capture a wide range of streamflow water quality and phytoplankton community conditions our study demonstrates that qpcr works well to assess phytoplankton abundance and to indicate river trophic status across a wide range of conditions our study design leveraged an ongoing sampling effort within the usgs national water quality network nwqn usgs 2022a while this study design was adequate for method i e qpcr validation it fails to determine reach level or ecosystem level trophic status future studies aiming to evaluate river trophic status need to compare traditional metrics with qpcr qpcr cannot be incorporated into trophic status evaluations until further research and comparisons have been completed there are three limitations of this study that can hopefully be addressed by future research first we sampled from two five and five rivers in the western midcontinent and eastern regions of the u s respectively table 1 and fig 1 results based on the low number of rivers especially in the western region might need to be more representative it would be beneficial to include more rivers in each region to better represent the stream conditions second we sampled from one site in each river the ecosystem of each river is highly dynamic longitudinally water quality parameters environmental conditions and phytoplankton community composition vary significantly along each river therefore one sampling site cannot represent the entire river ecosystem phytoplankton abundance and community composition determined in the current work thus represent only the sampling sites rather than the entire rivers future studies aiming to assess the spatial variation of phytoplankton in these rivers should include multiple sampling sites along each river third we leveraged an ongoing usgs nwqn sampling effort usgs 2022a to conduct this study and added additional analyses to routinely collected samples within the nwqn in the nwqn the sampling effort differed for the regions or rivers therefore the number of samples in the current work was unequal across the different regions or rivers future studies comparing phytoplankton abundance and composition in different regions and or rivers need to ensure an equal sampling effort 4 conclusions this work is the first qpcr based large scale multi year comprehensive study on the abundance of phytoplankton in multiple freshwater rivers across the u s this study demonstrates that qpcr is a useful molecular tool to quantify phytoplankton and assess eutrophication in freshwater rivers using qpcr and microscopy we assessed dominant phytoplankton at the sampling sites in twelve large freshwater rivers across the u s from early summer to late fall in 2017 2018 and 2019 phytoplankton abundance varied little within each sampling season and over the three years studied the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers had higher phytoplankton abundance than the sites in the eastern and western rivers primarily because the sites in the midcontinent rivers were more eutrophic i e having higher tn and tp concentrations phytoplankton abundance was comparable at the sampling sites in the eastern and western rivers the qpcr and microscope based phytoplankton abundance had a significant positive linear correlation in addition qpcr based phytoplankton abundance had significant positive correlations with nutrient levels a surrogate of trophic status of natural surface waterbodies therefore qpcr is a useful molecular tool to determine phytoplankton abundance and indicate freshwater rivers trophic conditions and quality finally cyanobacteria had a much higher abundance and significant positive linear correlations with other phytoplankton therefore cyanobacteria as a dominant phytoplankton group can potentially represent the phytoplankton community and infer the trophic conditions of
