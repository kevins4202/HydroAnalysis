10460,in large parts of the netherlands surface water quality does not meet the chemical and ecological standards as indicated by the eu water framework directive wfd the largest exceedances were found in areas with greenhouse horticulture flower bulbs fruit trees and ornamental trees several regulations have been implemented to improve water quality in greenhouse areas leading finally to a target for zero emission of nutrients by 2027 in soilless cultivation and rules to minimise losses in soil bound cultivation in addition to that an obligation exists to remove plant protection products ppps from drain water by 2018 onwards for soilless cultivation a zero liquid discharge zld system gives the best options to reach these goals for soil bound cultivation the situation is more complicated and a combination of tools and measurements to help the farmer to tune irrigation to crop demand is most promising these approaches will lead to a substantial decrease in losses of nutrients and ppps to surface water however it is uncertain whether this will lead to the desired reduction in emissions and the water quality standards of the wfd in 2027 obstacles might be problems

nutrients pesticides plant protection products recirculation soil grown soil moisture sensor substrate water framework directive 1 introduction 1 1 greenhouse horticulture in north western europe greenhouse horticulture in the netherlands covers an area of nearly 10 000 ha raaphorst 2017 mainly in the western part of the country compared to other northwest european countries the area and the concentration of greenhouses is much larger surrounding countries have 500 3 500 ha of greenhouses scattered over a larger area germany 3 500 ha belgium 2 000 ha sweden 500 ha denmark 500 ha uk 500 ha the sector is characterised by high production rates and accordingly a high input of nutrients sonneveld 1995 2000 and plant protection products ppps per ha compared to other agricultural use tiktak et al 2019 these high inputs of nutrients and ppps induce emissions to ground and surface water by leaching from soil bound cultivation and by discharge and leakage from soilless cultivation systems 1 2 legislation on emission of nutrients and plant protection products in large parts of the netherlands surface water quality does not meet the chemical and ecological standards as indicated by the eu water framework directive eu wfd 2000 in 2014 concentrations for both nitrogen n and phosphorous p were exceeded in 45 of the water bodies and exceedances of ppps were found at 60 of the locations van gaalen et al 2016 this is amongst others caused by the combination of intensive agriculture shallow groundwater tables and intensive drainage systems the largest exceedances were found in areas with greenhouse horticulture and cultivation of flower bulbs fruit trees and ornamental trees the first legislation to reduce pollution of surface waters came into effect in 1994 within the water pollution act roos schalij et al 1994 following the eu nitrate directive eu nd 1991 enforcement of this regulation was assigned to the water authorities regional semi governmental bodies responsible for water quantity and quality however due to the large number of enterprises local conditions as well as the impracticability of the control the operation was unsuccessful in 2002 this resulted in an official agreement besluit glastuinbouw 2002 with controllable obligations for greenhouse growers 1 obligatory collection and reuse of drain water 2 obligatory collection and storage of rain water for irrigation with a minimum size of 500 m3 ha 1 or use of water from a source with comparable quality and 3 permission to discharge drain water only if crop specific sodium na levels in drain water are exceeded or in case of emergencies outbreak of diseases incidental technical failures for soil bound greenhouse horticulture the reuse of drainage water became obligatory depending on the hydrological situation absence of seepage implementation of the eu water framework directive eu wfd 2000 detailed programme by 2009 and disappointing results from monitoring of surface water quality baltus and volkers verboom 2005 teunissen 2005 kruger 2008 beerling 2011 created an incentive for the central government to tighten the regulations again previous legislation appeared inadequate because growers had too many reasons to discharge drain water next to na accumulation van paassen and welles 2010 summarised by beerling et al 2014 this led to a whole new approach focusing more on the targets to be reached and less on how these targets are realised van paassen and welles 2010 this new regulation was based on an agreement between authorities and the growers organisation new rules were set with a final target of nearly zero emission for soilless greenhouse horticulture in 2027 and crop and company specific norms for the emission of n which will be gradually decreased until 2027 it is assumed that a reduction in n emission will be mainly achieved by a reduction in the discharge of water and will thus also reduce the emissions of p and ppps the first step standard 2015 table 1 was set in such a way that at least 70 of the companies should be able to comply and was based on a survey of n emission carried out by the growers organisation van paassen and welles 2010 in table 1 the nitrogen emission standards for 2015 are presented as well as the conversion to an equivalent discharge volume the latter is based on an average nitrate level per crop and gives the growers practical guidance to formulate a discharge strategy for soil grown greenhouse crops a different approach was chosen since emission standards were not feasible the solutions were directed towards optimising irrigation and a sustainable use of fertilisers together with the former regulations on crop specific maximal nutrient usage however the nitrogen emission standards were not expected to lead to a sufficient and rapid improvement of the water quality with respect to ppps before 2027 van eerdt et al 2012 therefore authorities and the growers organisations developed an additional approach for ppps resulting in a purification decree hoofdlijnenakkoord glastuinbouw 2015 for greenhouse discharge water from 2018 onwards this urgency was initiated by the growers organisation because of expected stricter approval and renewal registration demands for ppps which would drastically decrease the availability of ppps for growers the purification decree states that at least 95 of the ppps have to be removed from discharge water by using purification equipment rules apply for both soilless and soil bound greenhouse cultivation van ruijven et al 2020b and for discharge to surface water and sewer systems as ppps are normally not removed in sewage treatment plants and might even damage these systems stowa 2010 the uk and germany have no specific legislation or action for emissions from greenhouse horticulture in denmark recommendations are being prepared for how to manage wastewater and other waste from greenhouses with respect to ppps the horticulture industry has drawn up a voluntary action plan to promote a broad basis for follow up initiatives danish nap on pesticides 2017 also in sweden the focus is on voluntary information and training campaigns with respect to safe handling and application of ppps to solve problems with diffuse leakage sweden s nap on ppps 2019 because it is believed that excessively detailed legislation would not be efficient but sweden is also considering measures to reduce ppp pollution in surface water coming from greenhouses pers comm k l√∂fkvist 2018 in belgium greenhouses are not allowed to discharge water containing nutrients since 2006 berckmoes et al 2013 2014 exception is that it is allowed to bring the discharged solution to a nearby agricultural field as fertiliser during the outdoor growing season this is similar to the netherlands however the density of greenhouses in a large part of the netherlands is that high that a neighbouring field is not available this paper gives an overview of approaches implemented by dutch greenhouse growers to comply with the above regulations although the majority of crops are grown soilless still about 10 12 raaphorst 2017 of the crops are grown in soil these growing systems strongly differ in the issues and the nature of the problem of emissions which necessitates to deal with them separately a number of examples are given and the bottlenecks are discussed finally we will discuss a number of options to tackle these bottlenecks 2 approaches to reduce emissions 2 1 soil grown crops soilless culture is nowadays by far the main cropping system in dutch greenhouse horticulture nevertheless a reasonable area is still used for soil grown crops the majority is used for growing cut flowers whereas the area of soil grown vegetables is relatively small enlisting leafy vegetables like lettuce types and radish 250 ha and organically grown crops which include mainly tomato sweet pepper and cucumber 100 ha voogt 2015 as the mechanisms and processes behind the leaching problem of nutrients and ppps are applicable for all soil bound crops and the approaches for fertigation are similar for flowers and vegetables as well many studies and observations from soil bound flower production systems are highly relevant to vegetable production to fully understand the approaches that may contribute to reduce emissions for soil grown greenhouse crops in the netherlands it is necessary to consider the different hydrological situations in greenhouses voogt 2015 as well as the dutch approach of greenhouse fertilisation sonneveld 1995 there are roughly two major hydrologically different situations 1 greenhouses located on soils with relatively deep ground water 1 5 m in which the leaching will be primarily to groundwater 2 greenhouses situated in areas with shallow ground water levels often 1 m in the latter situation greenhouses are equipped with active and closed drainage systems connected to a drainage pit with a pump to enforce lowering of the groundwater inside the greenhouse the water pumped off is discharged to surrounding surface water the enforced lower groundwater level may cause seepage from surrounding plots triggered by the difference in hydraulic pressure the rate of seepage depends mainly on the difference in hydraulic pressure the soil characteristics saturated permeability and the distance in some cases the hydrological situation varies throughout the year and in some periods of the growing season the groundwater level around the greenhouse will be lower than inside whereas opposite situations may occur in other periods thus depending on the hydrological situation leaching resulting from irrigation surpluses will be drained off into the drainage system or will seep into the groundwater seepage into the greenhouse drainage system may also be due to the natural geographical location of the greenhouse for example a location in a valley or a deep polder thus the net inflow into the drainage system in a greenhouse will be the result of the irrigation surplus percolating through the soil the sideward seepage from surrounding plots upward seepage from further away and leaching to the groundwater the approach of fertilisation of greenhouse crops differs substantially from that of field vegetables and can be characterised by targeting the ec level and nutrient concentrations in the soil solution except for p in the root environment rather than applying certain amounts per unit area this is driven by i the high growth rates and the corresponding high nutrient demands ii the almost year round cropping cycles fruit vegetables or even continuous cropping radish leafy vegetables iii the use of fertigation as a way to control plant growth and development particularly in autumn and winter with poor light conditions high osmotic potentials in the soil solution are maintained to prevent too lush growth lettuce radish promoting flowering and fruit set tomato or to improve fruit quality fruit vegetables the current dutch fertiliser recommendation system is therefore based on the concept of fertigation with target values for nutrient concentrations in the soil solution managed by regular sampling and analysing using the 1 2 vol extract sonneveld and van den ende 1971 generally spoken the approach to minimise emissions can be divided in four main directions i changeover to soilless cultivation ii reuse of drainage water analogue to soilless systems iii tune irrigation to crop demand and thus reduce leaching of water containing nutrients and ppps and iv tune n and p fertilisation to crop demand 2 1 1 change to soilless an obvious solution for soil grown crops would be a switch to soilless however for various technical and economic reasons this is not always feasible most of the crops grown in soil are characterised by a relatively short growing period weeks or months and a high planting density with almost full coverage of the surface to grow these crops in a soilless system a full surface coverage of a substrate or hydroponic system is needed these modifications of the current system in combination with harvesting mechanisation necessitate high investments as a result a yield increase of at least 15 for these crop types is needed to make soilless cultivation economically feasible ruijs 1995 although a change from soil to soilless usually leads to higher yields this required increase could not be achieved for all crops 2 1 2 reuse of drainage water reuse of drainage water can only be implemented if it can be collected hydrological situation 2 described above even in that situation local hydrological conditions high seepage may limit implementation moreover other than in soilless systems soil bound systems can never be completely closed due to losses to groundwater nevertheless reuse of drainage water has been successfully implemented in many soil grown crop situations since the nineties baltus and volkers verboom 2005 reported that 50 of the greenhouses with soil grown crops reused drainage water which resulted in serious reduction in the quantity of discharged drainage water and strong improvement of the water and nutrient use efficiency voogt and korsten 1996 voogt et al 2000 2 1 3 tuning irrigation to crop demand the most effective way to reduce leaching is to reduce the inputs of water and fertilisers voogt 2005 although a certain over irrigation is the common strategy for soil grown crops to avoid salt accumulation voogt et al 2000 demonstrated in a number of experiments with chrysanthemum in a dutch commercial greenhouse on a light clay soil with a drainage system at 90 cm hence the groundwater level that the irrigation could be safely reduced to approach zero leaching however the heterogeneity of stem length and weight was increased if the irrigation went below the point of zero leaching where capillary rise contributed to the water supply of the crops the approach of tuning to crop demand as it is named has been advocated by many stakeholders water authorities local governments growers organisations as the most effective and potent approach to minimise emissions however for the majority of the growers the crop water demand as well as important parameters as soil moisture conditions and water holding capacities are rather elusive in fact most growers are unaware of the crop water demand and do not know if and how much water is leaching from the topsoil accordingly from the first regulations onwards the focus was put on revealing the unknown and develop and implement tools to provide the growers with insight in the irrigation demand of crops the soil moisture conditions and the processes of leaching voogt et al 2000 there have been three approaches to this subject 1 models 2 sensors and 3 the use of lysimeters examples will be discussed in section 3 1 2 1 4 tuning fertilisation to crop demand the concept of fertigation solutions and target values for the soil solution was developed in the seventies and eighties and was aiming at optimum production and quality for obvious reasons there is room for reduction of the levels of no3 and p without compromising yield or quality however this system is well established and widely accepted in the dutch greenhouse industry nevertheless several experiments in this direction have been conducted as well as demonstrations at farms this was carried out in close cooperation with the growers to investigate the possibilities of reduction of the n no3 concentrations as well as lowering the p buffer voogt 2005 some examples will be shown in section 3 2 2 2 soilless grown crops reduction of emissions is relatively easy in soilless cultivation compared to soil grown crops as water flows can be controlled the first approach that has been studied is reduction of the irrigation surplus however simply reducing irrigation has severe limitations as soilless systems are characterised by a small rooting volume this requires a very accurate supply of water and nutrients as the storage of water and nutrients in the substrate is very low and theoretically only sufficient for one or two days sonneveld 1995 in practice a drain fraction of at least 0 2 is recommended to prevent problems of heterogeneity in release of drippers transpiration and uptake vegetable growers mostly use a fraction of 0 3 flower growers 0 5 as these crops tend to be more heterogenous as dutch growers have fully climatised and computerised greenhouses including measurement of global radiation the irrigation is strictly related to the amount of solar and artificial radiation in the eighties hardly anybody was aware of the polluting effects of emissions on the aquatic environment and the price of water and fertilisers was low compared to energy or labour raaphorst 2017 growers preferred an open system as it was cheaper lower investments no pipework control equipment or disinfection and easier as adjustment of the applied fertilisers over time could be avoided changes in legislation as was described in section 1 2 and along with that the development of new knowledge and dissemination programmes stepwise changed this behaviour over the years to reduce emissions of nutrients and ppps to the environment and to comply with the increasingly stricter legislation growers took the following two steps and are now considering the third 1 recirculation of drain water to reduce emission of both nutrients and ppps 2 purification of discharge water for the removal of ppps to reduce emission of ppps 3 zero liquid discharge zld cultivation to avoid emission of nutrients and ppps 2 2 1 recirculation of drain water to change the habit of leaching and discharging drain water recirculation of the nutrient solution became obligatory for soilless cultivation systems together with the use of rainwater as main source for irrigation water see section 1 2 the stricter legislation made growers change from open to semi closed systems fig 1 van os 1998 a semi closed system requires a change in the infrastructure and control of the cultivation system drain water needs to be collected transported and stored in the early open systems drain water flowed from the slabs directly into the soil a first step was to make troughs to collect the drain water from the slabs and to bring it to a central place in the greenhouse the troughs lie on a slope around 0 2 0 5 drain water flows on gravity to a sub surface drain tank 1 m3 ha 1 from here it is pumped to a central place to be collected in a dirty water tank with a recommended size of about 35 m3 ha 1 the water is treated by a disinfection unit see section 3 2 1 and stored in a tank for disinfected drain water with a size of 70 m3 ha 1 the irrigation solution is prepared by a substrate unit a small tank 1 2 m3 ha 1 with computer controlled equipment to add fertilisers and fresh water boesten et al 2019 often there is a day storage tank of 40 50 m3 ha 1 from which irrigation to the plants takes place next to controlling ec ph and irrigation regimes the irrigation computer shows the realised data for further adjustments supply water and drain water are generally analysed at least once every two weeks on nutrient composition in an open system analysis of the nutrient solution is less important as growers always supply the standard solution only control on the volume given to the plants is important enough drain water with this semi closed system the grower is always in control of the timing and the amount of water discharged water is periodically discharged for several reasons but all reasons are related to actual or assumed insufficient water quality na accumulation imbalances in the nutrient solution inadequate hardware too small storage tanks discharge of filter rinsing water calamities or cultivation measures first drain water after draining the slabs risk of diseases just after planting see beerling et al 2014 van os et al 2019 2 2 2 purification of discharge water the water discharged from a semi closed cultivation system still contains nutrients and ppps if applied in the cultivation and needs to be treated to remove 95 of ppps purification decree see section 1 2 fig 2 left gives a schematic overview of the water flows in a greenhouse in which purification of discharge water is included to be able to treat the water it has to be stored separately in general growers will attempt to reduce the amount of discharge water as much as possible to lower the required capacity of treatment equipment and thereby to lower costs the water needs to be treated with approved purification equipment see section 1 2 this could be done with dedicated equipment option 1 or with an installation with a dual function for purification of discharged water and disinfection of recirculation water option 2 contractors can also bring an approved mobile treatment installation to a grower to treat stored discharge water option 3 regional collection of discharge water from neighbouring horticultural enterprises with treatment at a central location option 4 can be a relevant solution but only in concentrated greenhouse areas as the infrastructure for transport of water is expensive a complicating factor is that collectivity requires a strong commitment from all growers collective treatment of waste water flows including nutrients from these semi closed systems has already been studied van der velde et al 2008 but implementation appeared to be rather expensive extensive investigations to the effectiveness of various available equipment is done by van ruijven et al 2014 and is shortly summarised in section 3 2 1 2 2 3 zero liquid discharge cultivation to simultaneously solve emission problems for nutrients and ppps a next step is to look for options to avoid periodical discharge in a so called zero liquid discharge system zld fig 2 right beerling et al 2017 van os et al 2019 2020 therefore the cultivation systems and practices have been evaluated for reasons to discharge followed by the development of solutions and the redesign of the soilless cropping system prerequisites for such a system are 1 good quality irrigation water almost free of na see section 3 2 4 2 optimal control of the quality of the recirculating nutrient solution using an adequate water treatment technique and filters see section 3 2 1 which produce less or no rinsing water 3 prevent unbalances in nutrients by fertigation based on plant needs and 4 sufficient storage volumes and adequate piping for irrigation and drain water reuse zld systems solve the issues for discharge of nutrients and ppps in semi closed cultivation systems the above mentioned systems are for substrate grown crops for lettuce and similar crops grown in nft or dft the principles are slightly different from the beginning lettuce was grown in a closed system at which the surplus of water was recirculated however hardly any water treatment took place in nft dft but also at sub irrigation ebb flow recirculating water volumes are very high and are often not disinfected for economic reasons ruijs et al 1995 3 examples and bottlenecks 3 1 soil grown crops the water balances of several commercial greenhouses table 2 illustrate the variability in situations due to the complexity of the hydrological conditions at individual greenhouses voogt and korsten 1996 voogt et al 2006 greenhouses gh 1 and 5 are typical for the hydrological situation with high groundwater and seepage and a resulting high input of water by capillary rise the drainage quantity is very high gh1 to extreme gh5 although the irrigation surplus is negative as seepage quantities are high in gh5 some drainage water is used for irrigation in fact this cannot be considered as reuse since there is virtually no irrigation surplus but this is only 16 for gh1 the grower decided not to use the drainage as he feared salinity built up due to the high ec value of the drainage water high ec is also the reason that gh3 did not use all its drainage water and discharged one third gh4 and 6 did not have drainage as the groundwater table is more than 5 m below surface for gh4 the irrigation surplus is rather limited compared to the other chrysanthemum growers which is not the case with gh6 with the highest irrigation of all radish growers gh7 and 9 both had a high drainage much more than the irrigation surpluses indicating substantial seepage both growers reused part of the irrigation surplus and the seepage but a substantial part is still discharged in both cases as well for gh5 the seepage occurs during the autumn and winter seasons when groundwater levels and the water levels in surrounding ditches rise due to rainfall in this period only little irrigation is needed only for gh2 and gh8 all the drainage water could be reused and this resulted in almost zero losses however even in these situations there is no guarantee that the amount of water drained derives only from the irrigation surplus the overall annual balance might be just the net result of an irrigation surplus and downward seepage at one hand and upward seepage at the other hand which occur at different moments in time hence periods of upward seepage will cause leaching of nutrients and ppps to the environment such an effect can be illustrated by fig 3 showing the water fluxes total drainage irrigation surplus over time these data show that an average or a total value of these water fluxes over time can easily be misinterpreted as there are huge peaks in the actual fluxes all by all it can be concluded that reuse of drainage water only in some cases will contribute to minimising emissions 3 1 1 tuning irrigation to crop demand 3 1 1 1 models to enable growers to tune irrigation to crop demand tools have been developed to estimate the crop water demand basically these dss models calculate the cumulative uptake of water by the crop over a certain period which is understandable since irrigation is primarily intended to replenish the soil water content one of the first initiatives was the fertigation model which was based on calculation of the crop evapotranspiration etc over time and included even an estimation of the nutrient demand to tune also nutrient uptake voogt et al 2000 this model was tested in experimental greenhouses voogt 2001 and in commercial practice at three year round chrysanthemum growers voogt et al 2006 these three growers with modern greenhouses were situated in a typical dutch polder with heavy clay soils with approximately 5 organic matter in the topsoil and very low salinity levels in soil and groundwater the growers had a drainage system between 0 8 and 0 9 m below the surface irrigation was done by modern rotating overhead sprinklers and using 100 stored rainwater for fertigation although the results differed among the growers this dss model showed to be applicable by growers and to lead to a serious reduction in the input of water and fertilisers table 3 without any effect on yield or quality however a disadvantage is that the model requires actual data from the greenhouse e g radiation temperature heating pipes use of screens as well as basic soil physical parameters and data on crop and greenhouse construction the latter values were not always available or easy to obtain 3 1 1 2 sensors initially with the first attempts to tune irrigation to crop demand the focus was on sensors measuring soil matric potential tensiometers these sensors were used to monitor the soil moisture conditions as well as to initiate irrigation using start stop signalling this methodology was tested in a large number of crops soils and hydrological situations during a number of years de veld 1995 in some situations the results were successful in terms of adoption by growers for others the adoption was pretty low other strong disadvantages of these sensors were maintenance complicated sensor installation and the need for specific calibration next to these sensors volumetric soil water content sensors like frequency domain reflectometry fdr sensors became popular they did not need maintenance were easier to install and the data were easier to interpret nevertheless the same disadvantages as for tensiometers apply calibration and application of the data is not straightforward however the most important disadvantage of using soil moisture sensors for irrigation management aiming at zero emission is that one cannot visualise or predict leaching with soil moisture sensors one can only get a rough impression of soil water fluxes when sensors are installed at several depths and by observing the trends in graphs voogt et al 2018 studied the behaviour of soil moisture measurements by fdr sensors in combination with a lysimeter in chrysanthemum fig 4 the sensors showed a typical and expected response at 15 cm depth the moisture content showed short peaks with irrigation events irrigation by sprinklers events of 6 15 mm indicating water flow from the top to deeper levels the sensor at 25 cm responded delayed with small fluctuations and at 60 cm there was no response at all intensification of irrigation events like the first weeks in august and in november show wetting at all three depths but without a clear increase in the drain in the lysimeter on the contrary periods with relative decreasing soil moisture levels early september and early october had high peaks in drainage due to the vicinity to the saturated zone as well as the dispersion of the water flows sensors at depths will lack dynamic changes and are therefore not useful as indicators for leaching balendonck et al 2012 3 1 1 3 lysimeters the only method by which the real leaching can be uncovered is by using lysimeters these devices have demonstrated their functionality in scientific research for decades titus and mahendrappa 1996 but have never been used as such as a tool for irrigation control basic requirement of a lysimeter is that it represents as much as possible the conditions for crop growth and development hydrology and thus etc in the greenhouse outside the lysimeter in essence the lysimeter is only applicable in situations with no substantial contribution of capillary rise since in almost all dutch greenhouses a smaller or larger irrigation surplus is the case when considering periods of a week or longer this is not a hindrance for using this tool however when growers are moving towards the point of zero leaching this will become increasingly problematic to prevent this situation the lysimeter was modified by installing additional drippers inside the lysimeter surface area with a known capacity to increase the input with 10 or the like which enforces some deliberate small drainage flow in the lysimeter which then clearly can give the grower the indications he needs for aiming at zero leaching for his entire greenhouse surely relying on capillary rise as a source of additional water supply is not recommendable due to salinity build up in the soil voogt et al 2014 designed a practical lysimeter for use in commercial crops which either manually or automatically measures the drainage application in a number of successive and various crops demonstrated that these lysimeters make leaching tangible fig 5 this contributed highly to the awareness of growers with respect to the occurrence of emission and their options to control it this can be illustrated by the results of the water balance data of four organic growers where lysimeters were installed fig 6 each of the greenhouses had long term 10 months crop cycles with tomato cucumber or sweet pepper in rotation growers used the lysimeter to adjust their irrigation strategies to aim leaching reduction during five successive years the irrigation and lysimeter drainage was monitored and etc was calculated from crop and greenhouse climate data irrigation and etc differed substantially among growers due to differences in cropping cycle local conditions as well as the grower s own judgements for some growers the maximum irrigation was even lower than the maximum evapotranspiration which is likely due to additional supply through capillary rise for others peak irrigations were higher than etc all by all this resulted in differences of and 15 in the calculated irrigation surplus the calculated positive surplus corresponded quite well with the real drainage in the lysimeter obviously negative surpluses cannot be measured by a lysimeter fig 5 despite these large annual differences the average measured leaching was low with values between 2 and 12 for all years and growers these relatively low values demonstrate the intention of these growers to tune the irrigation to crop demand nevertheless these data also show that even for motivated growers in this case organic growers that deliberately strive to zero emission it is hardly possible to tune irrigation to crop demand without any leaching a serious bottleneck for the use of lysimeters for direct irrigation control is the time delay between the occurrence of irrigation events and the moment of registration of leaching in the lysimeter data analysis has revealed that this is at least several days and makes it complicated for direct irrigation control 3 1 1 4 combination of tools in an approach to overcome the various bottlenecks of the above mentioned three approaches a modular system was developed consisting of a combination of an irrigation model soil moisture sensors and a lysimeter voogt et al 2012 balendonck et al 2012 heinen et al 2012 in this model eman3g irrigation events and quantity were predicted by the fertigation model the lysimeter drainage data were used for feed back control on the fertigation model then soil moisture sensors were used as a safe guard to check both the irrigation events and to prevent that the lysimeter would dry out in case of less irrigation than etc and even modify some of the parameters settings automatically like soil or crop parameters this approach was initially tested in an experimental greenhouse followed by implementation at thirteen different commercial greenhouses with a variety of cut flower and vegetable crops implementation was guided by intensive data collection by research staff as well as exchange of results by automatic data uploading to an internet platform with access to all participants and through regular discussions of the results in small groups of growers voogt et al 2012 results of one of the chrysanthemum growers in this project fig 7 showed that initially the irrigation surplus i minus etc was 25 for a cropping cycle but gradually it decreased to around 10 and finally even went down to almost zero this illustrates the learning process of this grower in this particular case he learned to adjust the irrigation by watching the reaction of the sensors and learned under which conditions the lysimeter starts to produce drainage fig 7 however the approach as described above was only adopted by few growers the majority qualified the systems as too complicated moreover many of them were too much dedicated to their own experience and common irrigation strategies therefore it was not easy to convince them to use these alternative approaches 3 1 1 5 adoption of technology reusing drainage water has been adopted widely in commercial soil grown greenhouses if applicable given the quality electrical conductivity ec and the hydrological conditions application of this methodology is rather easy and inexpensive the adoption of other technologies to obtain the goals for emission reduction was not entirely successful generally spoken the lack of incentives and the increased risks of yield losses and loss of quality can be mentioned as the main reasons for the low adoption by farmers moreover all of these technologies require investments and operational costs including additional labour which are perhaps only compensated by some small savings on water and fertilisers eventually only a handful of growers made use of the dss model for tuning fertigation to crop demand apart from the consideration mentioned above growers have quite some reservations against model calculations in general and rely more on their own experience this was in particular the case when the recommended values for irrigation were below their own expectations and judgements of crop demand the same or even more hesitation was observed when more sophisticated dss models with a combination of tools were introduced the adoption of soil moisture sensors was more successful initially both sensors for soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content were installed by many growers after introduction however after a while it appeared that only few of them actually used the sensors for steering irrigation next to some technical issues like maintenance failures with limited service by supplying companies the complicated sensor installation and the need for specific calibration was seen as an important drawback a disadvantage was also the time needed for adequate use of these sensors i e to learn about soil moisture behaviour in response to irrigation events and evapotranspiration however the most important disadvantage of using soil moisture sensors for irrigation management aiming at zero emission is that one cannot visualise or predict leaching with soil moisture sensors one can only get a rough impression of soil water fluxes when sensors are installed at several depths and by observing the trends in graphs although the lysimeter was appraised by growers as a very useful tool for feedback on the irrigation strategy and a means to aim at zero leaching the system was considered as not applicable in commercial practice the main reasons were the high costs estimated at 7 000 per unit for the simple version and over 10 000 for a fully automated version voogt et al 2015 as well as that the lysimeter was too much an obstacle in the course of harvesting soil tillage and planting cycles of crops for commercial practice 3 1 2 tuning fertilisation to crop demand the current dutch fertiliser recommendation system is based on the concept of targeting the nutrient concentrations in the soil solution section 2 1 which is managed by regular sampling and analysing by the 1 2 vol extract sonneveld and van den ende 1971 control of the osmotic potential using the ec as parameter is considered as a key factor to control crop development and also fruit quality sonneveld and voogt 2009 since this concept is well established and widely accepted in the dutch greenhouse industry it would not be easy to convince growers to reduce no3 levels to obtain reduction in the emission of nutrients experiments and demonstrations at farms have been conducted in close cooperation with the growers to investigate the possibilities of reduction of the n and p supply voogt 2005 for example van den bos 2003 showed clearly that neither yield nor quality of lettuce was negatively affected by substantial reduction of the n target values and consequently the n supply table 4 as a result the n target values were reduced substantially in other trials with several crops reduction in the no3 concentration was also shown to be possible without causing any problems voogt et al 2002 although the effects on leaching could not be determined in these experiments logically a reduction of the no3 concentration in the soil solution would at least reduce the risk of no3 leaching in specific crops for which the ec value is important for quality the reduction in n supply must be compensated by application of other salts for instance van den bos pers comm has reported fertiliser trials with radish in which n was successfully partly replaced by so4 and cl seasonal effects related to the change in irradiation should be taken into account sonneveld and van den bos 1995 clearly showed with radish that the uptake concentrations of all nutrients in winter under poor light condition were four to five times higher than in summer under abundant light conditions for phosphate the p buffer of the soil is much more important than the concentration van der paauw 1969 roorda van eysinga 1971 sonneveld and voogt 2009 a long term experiment was therefore set up with p buffer levels with lettuce and with chrysanthemum for five and three years respectively voogt and van den bos 2016 found that even with zero p treatments no significant effect on crop yield could be established table 5 this shows that the vast buffer of p built up in the soils during many years of over fertilisation in most greenhouse soils could deliver sufficient p however reduction in the p fertilisation will hardly contribute to improvement of the environment since the leaching of p from greenhouse soils is already very limited voogt and bloemhard 1995 voogt and korsten 1996 this is likely caused by the high content of either fe and al or else caco3 in the subsoil causing sorption to fe al oxides or precipitation as ca phosphates geelhoed et al 1988 reduction of the high concentrations of nutrients no3 in the soil solution will certainly contribute to a potential reduction in the nutrient emission nevertheless the vertical water flow through the soil due to irrigation and subsequent net over irrigation will affect not only the emission of no3 but of other nutrients and ppps as well moreover precise control over the no3 concentrations is much more complex due to less predictable processes of the soil n cycle mineralisation denitrification immobilisation and plant n uptake rates than the evapotranspiration on top of that the control over ppp emission requires also a reduction in the water flow from the soil which leads to the conclusion that focussing on managing the water balance will be a preferable first step 3 2 soilless cultivation 3 2 1 water treatment soilless cultivation requires a high and constant quality of water to avoid any problems with clogging leaking or leaching filters are used to eliminate large particles in the water before disinfection fig 1 and 2 mostly another filter is used before the water is supplied to the drippers to eliminate substances from the fertilisers which may block the drippers sometimes additional small filters are used for special equipment disinfection fertiliser supply other water sources sand filters used to be common to eliminate the coarse particles coming from the plants and substrate and they still meet the demands for disinfection equipment however these filters have to be automatically rinsed if clogging appears the water used for rinsing the filters by changing the direction of the flow was automatically discharged leading to a discharge of about 200 500 m3 ha 1 yr 1 to minimise this amount other filter types were investigated metal screen filters use only 25 filter rinsing water compared to a sand filter and flatbed filters eliminate particles 10 to 40 Œºm depending on the cloth which is used and use no rinsing water at all van os et al 2020 the cloth and the dirt can be removed as solid waste and composted recirculation of drain water means that the risk of spreading root borne pathogens increases dramatically disinfection of the drainwater is a good solution van os 2009 spreading of pathogens within rows gutter can be minimised by separation of individual slabs troughs and using gutter systems with sideward collection and transport of drainage to prevent contact with other slabs or root system heat treatment is very efficient by use of heat exchangers but still requires additional energy runia et al 1988 best performance was found with 95 c during 30 s or 85 c during 3 min a newer alternative is uv light by means of high pressure or low pressure lamps both perform well if a dosage of 100 mj cm 2 is given against fungi and bacteria or 250 mj cm 2 against viruses runia 1995 ehret et al 2001 ozone treatment now makes a comeback it was used in the 90 s runia 1995 disappeared because of safety issues and high investment costs recently new and safer technology was introduced dosing of ozone is controlled using redox sensors measuring the oxidisable load of the water with a redox potential of 750 mv the nutrient solution is disinfected for bacteria fungi and viruses van os et al 2020 for small farms slow sand filtration might be a cheaper solution it combines a good effectivity with low investments and a high space requirement van os et al 1998 much cheaper but also less effective are chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide bleach chlorine dioxide to eliminate pathogens mentioned products are meant for cleaning pipework and not for eliminating pathogens for which a much higher dosage of the product is required stijger et al 2020 these products may be well suitable to eliminate biofilm in the pipework van ruijven et al 2020a 3 2 2 fertigation control in an open system with concentrated stock solutions a and b tank fig 1 the irrigation computer always supplies the correct solution to the plants when recirculation takes place disinfected drain water has to be mixed with fresh water mostly the irrigation solution is composed in such a way that 30 of ec in the irrigation water is derived from drain water and additional fresh water and fertilisers from a and b tank are supplied to achieve the setpoint ec alternatively mixing can take place on a volume basis in the latter case all the drain water of the last day is used this is not the case when the irrigation solution is mixed on ec basis as ec of the drain water varies this method may thus lead to unneeded overflow of storage tanks 3 2 3 purification of discharge water when the biological or chemical quality of the recirculating nutrient solution is no longer sufficient growers can decide to discharge within the limits of the nitrogen emission standards but ppps need to be removed from the discharge water several techniques have been developed for the removal of ppps from discharge water van ruijven et al 2014 that could be applied either at the scale of an individual company or a group of companies adding an additional treatment to a sewage treatment plant could also be a collective solution but water volumes to be treated will increase drastically techniques can be divided in three groups 1 oxidative technology to breakdown organic ppp molecules chiron et al 1999 2 separation technology to selectively filter ppps from discharge water cougnaud et al 2005 jiang and adams 2006 or 3 biological treatment debaer and jaeken 2006 de wilde et al 2007 oxidative technology makes use of either ozone or advanced oxidation by combinations of hydrogen peroxide uv or ozone to breakdown ppp molecules into smaller molecules removal of ppps by separation could be done effectively by either activated carbon or membrane filtration however saturated activated carbon needs to be handled as chemical waste after its lifespan but in general can be regenerated with 80 recovery https activated carbon com the filtered residue from membrane filtration containing the ppps needs further treatment before discharge is possible biological treatment is difficult for some of the organic molecules as long treatment times are required to reach 95 efficacy which translates to large installations next to that conditions need to be controlled very carefully for biological treatment to be effective at all koeman et al 2020 in press equipment used for the removal of ppps needs approval from a special governmental committee a standardised efficacy test is performed by an independent research institution to check the efficacy of the installation for the removal of ppps from standardised water van ruijven et al 2020b the committee checks the test results as well as the implementation strategy for the installation before approval is granted or not enforcement municipality and water authorities checks whether approved technology is used and maintained correctly in 2019 47 of the growers used according to interviews an individual system for purification 29 joined a collective purification initiative 14 used a mobile system leendertse et al 2019 the remaining 10 does not need any system for various reasons for example use of zld or plans to close down the implementation of the regulation has not yet led to a reduction in the number of locations with exceedances of the water quality standards in 2018 de weert et al 2019 this is not surprising as purification systems are not yet implemented at all companies for example companies that have opted for a collective system can postpone the implementation to the end of 2020 next to the implementation and enforcement of purification techniques intensive local measurement and communication campaigns in close cooperation with growers have been started by water authorities this has led to a reduction in unconscious leaching and a decrease in concentration and number of ppps in surface water in some polders waterkwaliteitsrapportage delfland 2019 the implementation of the obligation to remove ppps from discharge water will theoretically lead to a considerable reduction in concentrations of ppps in surface water as soon as measures are completely implemented leakages in the piping system or leaching via soil may still lead to unexpected losses moreover at the moment only drainage water from soil grown crops or drain water from soilless cultivation and filter rinsing water containing nutrients have to be purified other water flows like filter rinsing water without nutrients or water used for cleaning at the end of the cultivation do not have to be treated besides it remains to be seen how efficient the purification equipment will work in practice as efficacy depends on the maintenance and proper use of the equipment finally there is a risk that a removal rate of 95 will not be enough to reduce the concentrations of ppps with very low water quality standards such as spinosad abamectine methiocarb and teflubenzuron to an acceptable level for imidacloprid this was foreseen hence the obligation to use equipment with a 99 5 purification rate 3 2 4 zero liquid discharge zero liquid discharge zld is a solution that both meets the regulations for ppps 2018 and nutrients 2027 and also improves the water use efficiency of greenhouse cultivation it is therefore an interesting option for growers to consider before they decide on investing in ppp purification equipment however as the nutrient solution is no longer refreshed quality of inputs into the irrigation system becomes more important fig 8 if the uptake of a substance by the crop is lower than the input into the irrigation system the concentration in water will increase if it is not actively removed from the system increased concentrations of na voogt and van os 2012 and heavy metals have been reported to affect the crop a zld cultivation system therefore requires even more attention to the quality of inputs and the recirculating nutrient solution compared to a semi closed system zld was investigated during a four year period for cucumber and sweet pepper beerling et al 2017 van os et al 2019 2020 and crop yield and water flows were measured to achieve zld fig 2 the following steps were taken use of water low in na 0 1 mmol l 1 supplied by rainwater or brackish well water treated with reverse osmosis use of a flatbed filter no rinsing or a fibre filter with reuse of rinsing water before disinfection disinfection of the recirculating nutrient solution using ozone a quick response irrigation system with 3 l h 1 pressure compensated drippers in combination with a 16 mm pipe and a low pressure recirculation system to bring added substances immediately at all drippers recirculation of the first drain after start of the cultivation weekly analysis of the nutrient solution and adjustment of concentrated nutrient stocks end of cultivation strategy to avoid drain and prevent water losses via removal of the substrate leyh et al 2020 yields in the reference situation were generally comparable to the zld greenhouse table 6 slight differences occurred in 2016 due to the fact that the growth was more vegetative on coir compared to stone wool there was no clear explanation for the difference in yield in 2017 zero drain water discharge could not be completely achieved in all zld experiments in the 2016 crop the nutrient solution had to be discharged during a few days due to a broken disinfection installation and limited storage facility in the experiments with coir some water was lost as the coir was washed with calcium nitrate before use the rinsing water was discharged in 2017 the rinsing water from the coir was not discarded and the calcium concentration in the nutrient solution was increased to compensate for the higher na data showed that this worked well and further accumulation of na during the experiment did not take place 3 2 5 bottlenecks of zero liquid discharge the above mentioned experiments showed that zld is a serious option to prevent or at least strongly reduce emissions of nutrients and ppps to surface waters however there are a number of bottlenecks that might restrain growers to use a zld approach such as substrate quality technical failure losses during and after crop interchange leyh et al 2020 crops susceptible for na accumulation or certain substances leading to an inhibition of growth probably the most serious impediment for zld is na accumulation in the recirculating water even when using the most optimal water sources available some background concentration of na via water sources is unavoidable as well as some input through fertilisers voogt and van os 2012 since na is only taken up by crops in low amounts na accumulation in the recirculating solution will occur eventually this may result in unbalanced nutrient solutions due to lower concentrations of other nutrients compared to na voogt and sonneveld 1997 and or increase in the total salt concentration which may reduce growth and yield or induce physiological disorders sonneveld 2000 since the uptake of na by plants is a linear function of the prevailing na concentration in the root environment it is recommended to let na accumulate to the maximum acceptable concentration recent studies with sweet pepper tomato and gerbera have shown that na may accumulate much higher than the prevailing opinion among growers kierkels 2018 van staalduinen 2020 without causing problems nevertheless based on previous work it is to be expected that for crops with a very low tolerance for na or crops with a low na uptake capacity like rose cymbidium and other orchids na accumulation will remain an important bottleneck the experiments showed that zld is possible both with relatively inert substrates like stone wool but also with more challenging substrates like coir the first drain of the stone wool slabs could be reused without any problems in pepper and cucumber crops also the coir could be used without discharging the rinsing water at the start of cultivation however coir can differ substantially in quality and growers have to be careful and ask for information from the supplier technical failure may cause a need to discharge water as most growers do not have additional capacity to store the nutrient solution for a couple of days to solve problems moreover a frequent and careful analyses of the nutrient solution is needed to avoid nutrient imbalances in combination with a fertigation strategy tuned to plant needs and prevailing climate radiation losses of water nutrients and ppps still occur at the end of the cultivation when the remaining drain solution is discarded to minimise these losses an end of cultivation strategy was developed blok et al 2017 van os et al 2019 leyh et al 2020 the strategy aims at reducing the water content in the slab from 80 v v to 30 v v by reducing irrigation in the last weeks of cultivation this results in less drain water to be reused and empty drain tanks for the start of a new growing season it also lowers the amount of nutrients and ppps emitted from the company by removal of the substrate slabs furthermore the n and p concentration in the irrigation solution are gradually reduced to almost zero and replaced by cl to further reduce these losses this strategy led to reduction in discharge from 36 8 kg n ha 1 to 11 6 kg n ha 1 the strategy can still be improved to further reduce discharge and to be resilient to changes in weather conditions during the last weeks of cultivation moreover the knowledge has to be translated to guidelines to help growers to implement such a strategy another argument to discharge water is the accumulation of growth inhibitors either originating from the crop the cropping system zinc rest products silver or metabolites of disinfection products like chlorate or perchlorate van os et al 2014 demonstrated that root exudates in rose can be broken down with advanced oxidation uv with peroxide yet the discharge at the start of a new cultivation especially in fruit vegetables is related to the fear for growth inhibition the young crop is very sensitive and therefore during the first months the water is often not re used although it has been shown there may be no scientific ground for that lee 2011 the presence of growth inhibitors in drain water can be detected with a bioassay phytotox kit blok et al 2014 this is a useful tool when doubting the quality of their recirculation water in combination with the application of advanced oxidation this may decrease the amount of discharge significantly as has been demonstrated in practice for several crops raaphorst et al 2014 4 conclusions and way forward the above mentioned approaches have and will lead to a substantial decrease in losses of nutrients and ppps to ground and surface water bodies however it is uncertain whether this is sufficient to reach the goals set for the dutch greenhouse industry zero emission by 2027 and eventually to achieve the water quality standards of the nd and wfd for soil bound greenhouses the goal of zero emission will most probably not be reached for those greenhouses where seepage is limited drainage collection and reuse is an option but still diffuse leaching of nutrients and ppps may occur this solution is not feasible in areas with high seepage quantity or input of undesired salts into the drainage through seepage for those greenhouses growers either have to change over to soilless or stop with greenhouse cultivation in the current regulation this is also foreseen tuning irrigation to crop demand is the best option to minimise losses from soil grown crops various methods are available such as models and various sensors a combination of tools for example a virtual lysimeter combined with sensors seems currently the most promising approach this approach combines technical feasibility and acceptance by growers with achievable goals for soilless cultivation systems the emission goals set for the greenhouse industry are within reach by adoption of zld potential obstacles are leakages and accumulation of undesired salts and other growth inhibiting compounds in the water systems leakages in soilless cultivation groen 2015 is one of the causes of ongoing emissions to water bodies even within a zld strategy greenhouses contain extended and complex piping for irrigation and furthermore gutters and piping for drainage collection and transport most growers lack a good documentation of the piping and changes renovation may cause unexpected pathways to surface water moreover small defects or clogging of irrigation lines loose hanging drippers overflowing drain gutters easily lead to undetected spills currently a standard leakage rate of 1 5 vermeulen et al 2010 is assumed but adequate data to support this value is missing to prevent discharge due to accumulated na in the recycling solution growers should learn to deal with increasing na accepting higher na concentrations and to make use of the space in ion concentrations between the recommended ec level in the root environment and the minimum required nutrient concentrations to feed the plant voogt 2020 declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest 
10460,in large parts of the netherlands surface water quality does not meet the chemical and ecological standards as indicated by the eu water framework directive wfd the largest exceedances were found in areas with greenhouse horticulture flower bulbs fruit trees and ornamental trees several regulations have been implemented to improve water quality in greenhouse areas leading finally to a target for zero emission of nutrients by 2027 in soilless cultivation and rules to minimise losses in soil bound cultivation in addition to that an obligation exists to remove plant protection products ppps from drain water by 2018 onwards for soilless cultivation a zero liquid discharge zld system gives the best options to reach these goals for soil bound cultivation the situation is more complicated and a combination of tools and measurements to help the farmer to tune irrigation to crop demand is most promising these approaches will lead to a substantial decrease in losses of nutrients and ppps to surface water however it is uncertain whether this will lead to the desired reduction in emissions and the water quality standards of the wfd in 2027 obstacles might be problems

greenhouse horticulture in the netherlands covers an area of nearly 10 000 ha raaphorst 2017 mainly in the western part of the country compared to other northwest european countries the area and the concentration of greenhouses is much larger surrounding countries have 500 3 500 ha of greenhouses scattered over a larger area germany 3 500 ha belgium 2 000 ha sweden 500 ha denmark 500 ha uk 500 ha the sector is characterised by high production rates and accordingly a high input of nutrients sonneveld 1995 2000 and plant protection products ppps per ha compared to other agricultural use tiktak et al 2019 these high inputs of nutrients and ppps induce emissions to ground and surface water by leaching from soil bound cultivation and by discharge and leakage from soilless cultivation systems 1 2 legislation on emission of nutrients and plant protection products in large parts of the netherlands surface water quality does not meet the chemical and ecological standards as indicated by the eu water framework directive eu wfd 2000 in 2014 concentrations for both nitrogen n and phosphorous p were exceeded in 45 of the water bodies and exceedances of ppps were found at 60 of the locations van gaalen et al 2016 this is amongst others caused by the combination of intensive agriculture shallow groundwater tables and intensive drainage systems the largest exceedances were found in areas with greenhouse horticulture and cultivation of flower bulbs fruit trees and ornamental trees the first legislation to reduce pollution of surface waters came into effect in 1994 within the water pollution act roos schalij et al 1994 following the eu nitrate directive eu nd 1991 enforcement of this regulation was assigned to the water authorities regional semi governmental bodies responsible for water quantity and quality however due to the large number of enterprises local conditions as well as the impracticability of the control the operation was unsuccessful in 2002 this resulted in an official agreement besluit glastuinbouw 2002 with controllable obligations for greenhouse growers 1 obligatory collection and reuse of drain water 2 obligatory collection and storage of rain water for irrigation with a minimum size of 500 m3 ha 1 or use of water from a source with comparable quality and 3 permission to discharge drain water only if crop specific sodium na levels in drain water are exceeded or in case of emergencies outbreak of diseases incidental technical failures for soil bound greenhouse horticulture the reuse of drainage water became obligatory depending on the hydrological situation absence of seepage implementation of the eu water framework directive eu wfd 2000 detailed programme by 2009 and disappointing results from monitoring of surface water quality baltus and volkers verboom 2005 teunissen 2005 kruger 2008 beerling 2011 created an incentive for the central government to tighten the regulations again previous legislation appeared inadequate because growers had too many reasons to discharge drain water next to na accumulation van paassen and welles 2010 summarised by beerling et al 2014 this led to a whole new approach focusing more on the targets to be reached and less on how these targets are realised van paassen and welles 2010 this new regulation was based on an agreement between authorities and the growers organisation new rules were set with a final target of nearly zero emission for soilless greenhouse horticulture in 2027 and crop and company specific norms for the emission of n which will be gradually decreased until 2027 it is assumed that a reduction in n emission will be mainly achieved by a reduction in the discharge of water and will thus also reduce the emissions of p and ppps the first step standard 2015 table 1 was set in such a way that at least 70 of the companies should be able to comply and was based on a survey of n emission carried out by the growers organisation van paassen and welles 2010 in table 1 the nitrogen emission standards for 2015 are presented as well as the conversion to an equivalent discharge volume the latter is based on an average nitrate level per crop and gives the growers practical guidance to formulate a discharge strategy for soil grown greenhouse crops a different approach was chosen since emission standards were not feasible the solutions were directed towards optimising irrigation and a sustainable use of fertilisers together with the former regulations on crop specific maximal nutrient usage however the nitrogen emission standards were not expected to lead to a sufficient and rapid improvement of the water quality with respect to ppps before 2027 van eerdt et al 2012 therefore authorities and the growers organisations developed an additional approach for ppps resulting in a purification decree hoofdlijnenakkoord glastuinbouw 2015 for greenhouse discharge water from 2018 onwards this urgency was initiated by the growers organisation because of expected stricter approval and renewal registration demands for ppps which would drastically decrease the availability of ppps for growers the purification decree states that at least 95 of the ppps have to be removed from discharge water by using purification equipment rules apply for both soilless and soil bound greenhouse cultivation van ruijven et al 2020b and for discharge to surface water and sewer systems as ppps are normally not removed in sewage treatment plants and might even damage these systems stowa 2010 the uk and germany have no specific legislation or action for emissions from greenhouse horticulture in denmark recommendations are being prepared for how to manage wastewater and other waste from greenhouses with respect to ppps the horticulture industry has drawn up a voluntary action plan to promote a broad basis for follow up initiatives danish nap on pesticides 2017 also in sweden the focus is on voluntary information and training campaigns with respect to safe handling and application of ppps to solve problems with diffuse leakage sweden s nap on ppps 2019 because it is believed that excessively detailed legislation would not be efficient but sweden is also considering measures to reduce ppp pollution in surface water coming from greenhouses pers comm k l√∂fkvist 2018 in belgium greenhouses are not allowed to discharge water containing nutrients since 2006 berckmoes et al 2013 2014 exception is that it is allowed to bring the discharged solution to a nearby agricultural field as fertiliser during the outdoor growing season this is similar to the netherlands however the density of greenhouses in a large part of the netherlands is that high that a neighbouring field is not available this paper gives an overview of approaches implemented by dutch greenhouse growers to comply with the above regulations although the majority of crops are grown soilless still about 10 12 raaphorst 2017 of the crops are grown in soil these growing systems strongly differ in the issues and the nature of the problem of emissions which necessitates to deal with them separately a number of examples are given and the bottlenecks are discussed finally we will discuss a number of options to tackle these bottlenecks 2 approaches to reduce emissions 2 1 soil grown crops soilless culture is nowadays by far the main cropping system in dutch greenhouse horticulture nevertheless a reasonable area is still used for soil grown crops the majority is used for growing cut flowers whereas the area of soil grown vegetables is relatively small enlisting leafy vegetables like lettuce types and radish 250 ha and organically grown crops which include mainly tomato sweet pepper and cucumber 100 ha voogt 2015 as the mechanisms and processes behind the leaching problem of nutrients and ppps are applicable for all soil bound crops and the approaches for fertigation are similar for flowers and vegetables as well many studies and observations from soil bound flower production systems are highly relevant to vegetable production to fully understand the approaches that may contribute to reduce emissions for soil grown greenhouse crops in the netherlands it is necessary to consider the different hydrological situations in greenhouses voogt 2015 as well as the dutch approach of greenhouse fertilisation sonneveld 1995 there are roughly two major hydrologically different situations 1 greenhouses located on soils with relatively deep ground water 1 5 m in which the leaching will be primarily to groundwater 2 greenhouses situated in areas with shallow ground water levels often 1 m in the latter situation greenhouses are equipped with active and closed drainage systems connected to a drainage pit with a pump to enforce lowering of the groundwater inside the greenhouse the water pumped off is discharged to surrounding surface water the enforced lower groundwater level may cause seepage from surrounding plots triggered by the difference in hydraulic pressure the rate of seepage depends mainly on the difference in hydraulic pressure the soil characteristics saturated permeability and the distance in some cases the hydrological situation varies throughout the year and in some periods of the growing season the groundwater level around the greenhouse will be lower than inside whereas opposite situations may occur in other periods thus depending on the hydrological situation leaching resulting from irrigation surpluses will be drained off into the drainage system or will seep into the groundwater seepage into the greenhouse drainage system may also be due to the natural geographical location of the greenhouse for example a location in a valley or a deep polder thus the net inflow into the drainage system in a greenhouse will be the result of the irrigation surplus percolating through the soil the sideward seepage from surrounding plots upward seepage from further away and leaching to the groundwater the approach of fertilisation of greenhouse crops differs substantially from that of field vegetables and can be characterised by targeting the ec level and nutrient concentrations in the soil solution except for p in the root environment rather than applying certain amounts per unit area this is driven by i the high growth rates and the corresponding high nutrient demands ii the almost year round cropping cycles fruit vegetables or even continuous cropping radish leafy vegetables iii the use of fertigation as a way to control plant growth and development particularly in autumn and winter with poor light conditions high osmotic potentials in the soil solution are maintained to prevent too lush growth lettuce radish promoting flowering and fruit set tomato or to improve fruit quality fruit vegetables the current dutch fertiliser recommendation system is therefore based on the concept of fertigation with target values for nutrient concentrations in the soil solution managed by regular sampling and analysing using the 1 2 vol extract sonneveld and van den ende 1971 generally spoken the approach to minimise emissions can be divided in four main directions i changeover to soilless cultivation ii reuse of drainage water analogue to soilless systems iii tune irrigation to crop demand and thus reduce leaching of water containing nutrients and ppps and iv tune n and p fertilisation to crop demand 2 1 1 change to soilless an obvious solution for soil grown crops would be a switch to soilless however for various technical and economic reasons this is not always feasible most of the crops grown in soil are characterised by a relatively short growing period weeks or months and a high planting density with almost full coverage of the surface to grow these crops in a soilless system a full surface coverage of a substrate or hydroponic system is needed these modifications of the current system in combination with harvesting mechanisation necessitate high investments as a result a yield increase of at least 15 for these crop types is needed to make soilless cultivation economically feasible ruijs 1995 although a change from soil to soilless usually leads to higher yields this required increase could not be achieved for all crops 2 1 2 reuse of drainage water reuse of drainage water can only be implemented if it can be collected hydrological situation 2 described above even in that situation local hydrological conditions high seepage may limit implementation moreover other than in soilless systems soil bound systems can never be completely closed due to losses to groundwater nevertheless reuse of drainage water has been successfully implemented in many soil grown crop situations since the nineties baltus and volkers verboom 2005 reported that 50 of the greenhouses with soil grown crops reused drainage water which resulted in serious reduction in the quantity of discharged drainage water and strong improvement of the water and nutrient use efficiency voogt and korsten 1996 voogt et al 2000 2 1 3 tuning irrigation to crop demand the most effective way to reduce leaching is to reduce the inputs of water and fertilisers voogt 2005 although a certain over irrigation is the common strategy for soil grown crops to avoid salt accumulation voogt et al 2000 demonstrated in a number of experiments with chrysanthemum in a dutch commercial greenhouse on a light clay soil with a drainage system at 90 cm hence the groundwater level that the irrigation could be safely reduced to approach zero leaching however the heterogeneity of stem length and weight was increased if the irrigation went below the point of zero leaching where capillary rise contributed to the water supply of the crops the approach of tuning to crop demand as it is named has been advocated by many stakeholders water authorities local governments growers organisations as the most effective and potent approach to minimise emissions however for the majority of the growers the crop water demand as well as important parameters as soil moisture conditions and water holding capacities are rather elusive in fact most growers are unaware of the crop water demand and do not know if and how much water is leaching from the topsoil accordingly from the first regulations onwards the focus was put on revealing the unknown and develop and implement tools to provide the growers with insight in the irrigation demand of crops the soil moisture conditions and the processes of leaching voogt et al 2000 there have been three approaches to this subject 1 models 2 sensors and 3 the use of lysimeters examples will be discussed in section 3 1 2 1 4 tuning fertilisation to crop demand the concept of fertigation solutions and target values for the soil solution was developed in the seventies and eighties and was aiming at optimum production and quality for obvious reasons there is room for reduction of the levels of no3 and p without compromising yield or quality however this system is well established and widely accepted in the dutch greenhouse industry nevertheless several experiments in this direction have been conducted as well as demonstrations at farms this was carried out in close cooperation with the growers to investigate the possibilities of reduction of the n no3 concentrations as well as lowering the p buffer voogt 2005 some examples will be shown in section 3 2 2 2 soilless grown crops reduction of emissions is relatively easy in soilless cultivation compared to soil grown crops as water flows can be controlled the first approach that has been studied is reduction of the irrigation surplus however simply reducing irrigation has severe limitations as soilless systems are characterised by a small rooting volume this requires a very accurate supply of water and nutrients as the storage of water and nutrients in the substrate is very low and theoretically only sufficient for one or two days sonneveld 1995 in practice a drain fraction of at least 0 2 is recommended to prevent problems of heterogeneity in release of drippers transpiration and uptake vegetable growers mostly use a fraction of 0 3 flower growers 0 5 as these crops tend to be more heterogenous as dutch growers have fully climatised and computerised greenhouses including measurement of global radiation the irrigation is strictly related to the amount of solar and artificial radiation in the eighties hardly anybody was aware of the polluting effects of emissions on the aquatic environment and the price of water and fertilisers was low compared to energy or labour raaphorst 2017 growers preferred an open system as it was cheaper lower investments no pipework control equipment or disinfection and easier as adjustment of the applied fertilisers over time could be avoided changes in legislation as was described in section 1 2 and along with that the development of new knowledge and dissemination programmes stepwise changed this behaviour over the years to reduce emissions of nutrients and ppps to the environment and to comply with the increasingly stricter legislation growers took the following two steps and are now considering the third 1 recirculation of drain water to reduce emission of both nutrients and ppps 2 purification of discharge water for the removal of ppps to reduce emission of ppps 3 zero liquid discharge zld cultivation to avoid emission of nutrients and ppps 2 2 1 recirculation of drain water to change the habit of leaching and discharging drain water recirculation of the nutrient solution became obligatory for soilless cultivation systems together with the use of rainwater as main source for irrigation water see section 1 2 the stricter legislation made growers change from open to semi closed systems fig 1 van os 1998 a semi closed system requires a change in the infrastructure and control of the cultivation system drain water needs to be collected transported and stored in the early open systems drain water flowed from the slabs directly into the soil a first step was to make troughs to collect the drain water from the slabs and to bring it to a central place in the greenhouse the troughs lie on a slope around 0 2 0 5 drain water flows on gravity to a sub surface drain tank 1 m3 ha 1 from here it is pumped to a central place to be collected in a dirty water tank with a recommended size of about 35 m3 ha 1 the water is treated by a disinfection unit see section 3 2 1 and stored in a tank for disinfected drain water with a size of 70 m3 ha 1 the irrigation solution is prepared by a substrate unit a small tank 1 2 m3 ha 1 with computer controlled equipment to add fertilisers and fresh water boesten et al 2019 often there is a day storage tank of 40 50 m3 ha 1 from which irrigation to the plants takes place next to controlling ec ph and irrigation regimes the irrigation computer shows the realised data for further adjustments supply water and drain water are generally analysed at least once every two weeks on nutrient composition in an open system analysis of the nutrient solution is less important as growers always supply the standard solution only control on the volume given to the plants is important enough drain water with this semi closed system the grower is always in control of the timing and the amount of water discharged water is periodically discharged for several reasons but all reasons are related to actual or assumed insufficient water quality na accumulation imbalances in the nutrient solution inadequate hardware too small storage tanks discharge of filter rinsing water calamities or cultivation measures first drain water after draining the slabs risk of diseases just after planting see beerling et al 2014 van os et al 2019 2 2 2 purification of discharge water the water discharged from a semi closed cultivation system still contains nutrients and ppps if applied in the cultivation and needs to be treated to remove 95 of ppps purification decree see section 1 2 fig 2 left gives a schematic overview of the water flows in a greenhouse in which purification of discharge water is included to be able to treat the water it has to be stored separately in general growers will attempt to reduce the amount of discharge water as much as possible to lower the required capacity of treatment equipment and thereby to lower costs the water needs to be treated with approved purification equipment see section 1 2 this could be done with dedicated equipment option 1 or with an installation with a dual function for purification of discharged water and disinfection of recirculation water option 2 contractors can also bring an approved mobile treatment installation to a grower to treat stored discharge water option 3 regional collection of discharge water from neighbouring horticultural enterprises with treatment at a central location option 4 can be a relevant solution but only in concentrated greenhouse areas as the infrastructure for transport of water is expensive a complicating factor is that collectivity requires a strong commitment from all growers collective treatment of waste water flows including nutrients from these semi closed systems has already been studied van der velde et al 2008 but implementation appeared to be rather expensive extensive investigations to the effectiveness of various available equipment is done by van ruijven et al 2014 and is shortly summarised in section 3 2 1 2 2 3 zero liquid discharge cultivation to simultaneously solve emission problems for nutrients and ppps a next step is to look for options to avoid periodical discharge in a so called zero liquid discharge system zld fig 2 right beerling et al 2017 van os et al 2019 2020 therefore the cultivation systems and practices have been evaluated for reasons to discharge followed by the development of solutions and the redesign of the soilless cropping system prerequisites for such a system are 1 good quality irrigation water almost free of na see section 3 2 4 2 optimal control of the quality of the recirculating nutrient solution using an adequate water treatment technique and filters see section 3 2 1 which produce less or no rinsing water 3 prevent unbalances in nutrients by fertigation based on plant needs and 4 sufficient storage volumes and adequate piping for irrigation and drain water reuse zld systems solve the issues for discharge of nutrients and ppps in semi closed cultivation systems the above mentioned systems are for substrate grown crops for lettuce and similar crops grown in nft or dft the principles are slightly different from the beginning lettuce was grown in a closed system at which the surplus of water was recirculated however hardly any water treatment took place in nft dft but also at sub irrigation ebb flow recirculating water volumes are very high and are often not disinfected for economic reasons ruijs et al 1995 3 examples and bottlenecks 3 1 soil grown crops the water balances of several commercial greenhouses table 2 illustrate the variability in situations due to the complexity of the hydrological conditions at individual greenhouses voogt and korsten 1996 voogt et al 2006 greenhouses gh 1 and 5 are typical for the hydrological situation with high groundwater and seepage and a resulting high input of water by capillary rise the drainage quantity is very high gh1 to extreme gh5 although the irrigation surplus is negative as seepage quantities are high in gh5 some drainage water is used for irrigation in fact this cannot be considered as reuse since there is virtually no irrigation surplus but this is only 16 for gh1 the grower decided not to use the drainage as he feared salinity built up due to the high ec value of the drainage water high ec is also the reason that gh3 did not use all its drainage water and discharged one third gh4 and 6 did not have drainage as the groundwater table is more than 5 m below surface for gh4 the irrigation surplus is rather limited compared to the other chrysanthemum growers which is not the case with gh6 with the highest irrigation of all radish growers gh7 and 9 both had a high drainage much more than the irrigation surpluses indicating substantial seepage both growers reused part of the irrigation surplus and the seepage but a substantial part is still discharged in both cases as well for gh5 the seepage occurs during the autumn and winter seasons when groundwater levels and the water levels in surrounding ditches rise due to rainfall in this period only little irrigation is needed only for gh2 and gh8 all the drainage water could be reused and this resulted in almost zero losses however even in these situations there is no guarantee that the amount of water drained derives only from the irrigation surplus the overall annual balance might be just the net result of an irrigation surplus and downward seepage at one hand and upward seepage at the other hand which occur at different moments in time hence periods of upward seepage will cause leaching of nutrients and ppps to the environment such an effect can be illustrated by fig 3 showing the water fluxes total drainage irrigation surplus over time these data show that an average or a total value of these water fluxes over time can easily be misinterpreted as there are huge peaks in the actual fluxes all by all it can be concluded that reuse of drainage water only in some cases will contribute to minimising emissions 3 1 1 tuning irrigation to crop demand 3 1 1 1 models to enable growers to tune irrigation to crop demand tools have been developed to estimate the crop water demand basically these dss models calculate the cumulative uptake of water by the crop over a certain period which is understandable since irrigation is primarily intended to replenish the soil water content one of the first initiatives was the fertigation model which was based on calculation of the crop evapotranspiration etc over time and included even an estimation of the nutrient demand to tune also nutrient uptake voogt et al 2000 this model was tested in experimental greenhouses voogt 2001 and in commercial practice at three year round chrysanthemum growers voogt et al 2006 these three growers with modern greenhouses were situated in a typical dutch polder with heavy clay soils with approximately 5 organic matter in the topsoil and very low salinity levels in soil and groundwater the growers had a drainage system between 0 8 and 0 9 m below the surface irrigation was done by modern rotating overhead sprinklers and using 100 stored rainwater for fertigation although the results differed among the growers this dss model showed to be applicable by growers and to lead to a serious reduction in the input of water and fertilisers table 3 without any effect on yield or quality however a disadvantage is that the model requires actual data from the greenhouse e g radiation temperature heating pipes use of screens as well as basic soil physical parameters and data on crop and greenhouse construction the latter values were not always available or easy to obtain 3 1 1 2 sensors initially with the first attempts to tune irrigation to crop demand the focus was on sensors measuring soil matric potential tensiometers these sensors were used to monitor the soil moisture conditions as well as to initiate irrigation using start stop signalling this methodology was tested in a large number of crops soils and hydrological situations during a number of years de veld 1995 in some situations the results were successful in terms of adoption by growers for others the adoption was pretty low other strong disadvantages of these sensors were maintenance complicated sensor installation and the need for specific calibration next to these sensors volumetric soil water content sensors like frequency domain reflectometry fdr sensors became popular they did not need maintenance were easier to install and the data were easier to interpret nevertheless the same disadvantages as for tensiometers apply calibration and application of the data is not straightforward however the most important disadvantage of using soil moisture sensors for irrigation management aiming at zero emission is that one cannot visualise or predict leaching with soil moisture sensors one can only get a rough impression of soil water fluxes when sensors are installed at several depths and by observing the trends in graphs voogt et al 2018 studied the behaviour of soil moisture measurements by fdr sensors in combination with a lysimeter in chrysanthemum fig 4 the sensors showed a typical and expected response at 15 cm depth the moisture content showed short peaks with irrigation events irrigation by sprinklers events of 6 15 mm indicating water flow from the top to deeper levels the sensor at 25 cm responded delayed with small fluctuations and at 60 cm there was no response at all intensification of irrigation events like the first weeks in august and in november show wetting at all three depths but without a clear increase in the drain in the lysimeter on the contrary periods with relative decreasing soil moisture levels early september and early october had high peaks in drainage due to the vicinity to the saturated zone as well as the dispersion of the water flows sensors at depths will lack dynamic changes and are therefore not useful as indicators for leaching balendonck et al 2012 3 1 1 3 lysimeters the only method by which the real leaching can be uncovered is by using lysimeters these devices have demonstrated their functionality in scientific research for decades titus and mahendrappa 1996 but have never been used as such as a tool for irrigation control basic requirement of a lysimeter is that it represents as much as possible the conditions for crop growth and development hydrology and thus etc in the greenhouse outside the lysimeter in essence the lysimeter is only applicable in situations with no substantial contribution of capillary rise since in almost all dutch greenhouses a smaller or larger irrigation surplus is the case when considering periods of a week or longer this is not a hindrance for using this tool however when growers are moving towards the point of zero leaching this will become increasingly problematic to prevent this situation the lysimeter was modified by installing additional drippers inside the lysimeter surface area with a known capacity to increase the input with 10 or the like which enforces some deliberate small drainage flow in the lysimeter which then clearly can give the grower the indications he needs for aiming at zero leaching for his entire greenhouse surely relying on capillary rise as a source of additional water supply is not recommendable due to salinity build up in the soil voogt et al 2014 designed a practical lysimeter for use in commercial crops which either manually or automatically measures the drainage application in a number of successive and various crops demonstrated that these lysimeters make leaching tangible fig 5 this contributed highly to the awareness of growers with respect to the occurrence of emission and their options to control it this can be illustrated by the results of the water balance data of four organic growers where lysimeters were installed fig 6 each of the greenhouses had long term 10 months crop cycles with tomato cucumber or sweet pepper in rotation growers used the lysimeter to adjust their irrigation strategies to aim leaching reduction during five successive years the irrigation and lysimeter drainage was monitored and etc was calculated from crop and greenhouse climate data irrigation and etc differed substantially among growers due to differences in cropping cycle local conditions as well as the grower s own judgements for some growers the maximum irrigation was even lower than the maximum evapotranspiration which is likely due to additional supply through capillary rise for others peak irrigations were higher than etc all by all this resulted in differences of and 15 in the calculated irrigation surplus the calculated positive surplus corresponded quite well with the real drainage in the lysimeter obviously negative surpluses cannot be measured by a lysimeter fig 5 despite these large annual differences the average measured leaching was low with values between 2 and 12 for all years and growers these relatively low values demonstrate the intention of these growers to tune the irrigation to crop demand nevertheless these data also show that even for motivated growers in this case organic growers that deliberately strive to zero emission it is hardly possible to tune irrigation to crop demand without any leaching a serious bottleneck for the use of lysimeters for direct irrigation control is the time delay between the occurrence of irrigation events and the moment of registration of leaching in the lysimeter data analysis has revealed that this is at least several days and makes it complicated for direct irrigation control 3 1 1 4 combination of tools in an approach to overcome the various bottlenecks of the above mentioned three approaches a modular system was developed consisting of a combination of an irrigation model soil moisture sensors and a lysimeter voogt et al 2012 balendonck et al 2012 heinen et al 2012 in this model eman3g irrigation events and quantity were predicted by the fertigation model the lysimeter drainage data were used for feed back control on the fertigation model then soil moisture sensors were used as a safe guard to check both the irrigation events and to prevent that the lysimeter would dry out in case of less irrigation than etc and even modify some of the parameters settings automatically like soil or crop parameters this approach was initially tested in an experimental greenhouse followed by implementation at thirteen different commercial greenhouses with a variety of cut flower and vegetable crops implementation was guided by intensive data collection by research staff as well as exchange of results by automatic data uploading to an internet platform with access to all participants and through regular discussions of the results in small groups of growers voogt et al 2012 results of one of the chrysanthemum growers in this project fig 7 showed that initially the irrigation surplus i minus etc was 25 for a cropping cycle but gradually it decreased to around 10 and finally even went down to almost zero this illustrates the learning process of this grower in this particular case he learned to adjust the irrigation by watching the reaction of the sensors and learned under which conditions the lysimeter starts to produce drainage fig 7 however the approach as described above was only adopted by few growers the majority qualified the systems as too complicated moreover many of them were too much dedicated to their own experience and common irrigation strategies therefore it was not easy to convince them to use these alternative approaches 3 1 1 5 adoption of technology reusing drainage water has been adopted widely in commercial soil grown greenhouses if applicable given the quality electrical conductivity ec and the hydrological conditions application of this methodology is rather easy and inexpensive the adoption of other technologies to obtain the goals for emission reduction was not entirely successful generally spoken the lack of incentives and the increased risks of yield losses and loss of quality can be mentioned as the main reasons for the low adoption by farmers moreover all of these technologies require investments and operational costs including additional labour which are perhaps only compensated by some small savings on water and fertilisers eventually only a handful of growers made use of the dss model for tuning fertigation to crop demand apart from the consideration mentioned above growers have quite some reservations against model calculations in general and rely more on their own experience this was in particular the case when the recommended values for irrigation were below their own expectations and judgements of crop demand the same or even more hesitation was observed when more sophisticated dss models with a combination of tools were introduced the adoption of soil moisture sensors was more successful initially both sensors for soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content were installed by many growers after introduction however after a while it appeared that only few of them actually used the sensors for steering irrigation next to some technical issues like maintenance failures with limited service by supplying companies the complicated sensor installation and the need for specific calibration was seen as an important drawback a disadvantage was also the time needed for adequate use of these sensors i e to learn about soil moisture behaviour in response to irrigation events and evapotranspiration however the most important disadvantage of using soil moisture sensors for irrigation management aiming at zero emission is that one cannot visualise or predict leaching with soil moisture sensors one can only get a rough impression of soil water fluxes when sensors are installed at several depths and by observing the trends in graphs although the lysimeter was appraised by growers as a very useful tool for feedback on the irrigation strategy and a means to aim at zero leaching the system was considered as not applicable in commercial practice the main reasons were the high costs estimated at 7 000 per unit for the simple version and over 10 000 for a fully automated version voogt et al 2015 as well as that the lysimeter was too much an obstacle in the course of harvesting soil tillage and planting cycles of crops for commercial practice 3 1 2 tuning fertilisation to crop demand the current dutch fertiliser recommendation system is based on the concept of targeting the nutrient concentrations in the soil solution section 2 1 which is managed by regular sampling and analysing by the 1 2 vol extract sonneveld and van den ende 1971 control of the osmotic potential using the ec as parameter is considered as a key factor to control crop development and also fruit quality sonneveld and voogt 2009 since this concept is well established and widely accepted in the dutch greenhouse industry it would not be easy to convince growers to reduce no3 levels to obtain reduction in the emission of nutrients experiments and demonstrations at farms have been conducted in close cooperation with the growers to investigate the possibilities of reduction of the n and p supply voogt 2005 for example van den bos 2003 showed clearly that neither yield nor quality of lettuce was negatively affected by substantial reduction of the n target values and consequently the n supply table 4 as a result the n target values were reduced substantially in other trials with several crops reduction in the no3 concentration was also shown to be possible without causing any problems voogt et al 2002 although the effects on leaching could not be determined in these experiments logically a reduction of the no3 concentration in the soil solution would at least reduce the risk of no3 leaching in specific crops for which the ec value is important for quality the reduction in n supply must be compensated by application of other salts for instance van den bos pers comm has reported fertiliser trials with radish in which n was successfully partly replaced by so4 and cl seasonal effects related to the change in irradiation should be taken into account sonneveld and van den bos 1995 clearly showed with radish that the uptake concentrations of all nutrients in winter under poor light condition were four to five times higher than in summer under abundant light conditions for phosphate the p buffer of the soil is much more important than the concentration van der paauw 1969 roorda van eysinga 1971 sonneveld and voogt 2009 a long term experiment was therefore set up with p buffer levels with lettuce and with chrysanthemum for five and three years respectively voogt and van den bos 2016 found that even with zero p treatments no significant effect on crop yield could be established table 5 this shows that the vast buffer of p built up in the soils during many years of over fertilisation in most greenhouse soils could deliver sufficient p however reduction in the p fertilisation will hardly contribute to improvement of the environment since the leaching of p from greenhouse soils is already very limited voogt and bloemhard 1995 voogt and korsten 1996 this is likely caused by the high content of either fe and al or else caco3 in the subsoil causing sorption to fe al oxides or precipitation as ca phosphates geelhoed et al 1988 reduction of the high concentrations of nutrients no3 in the soil solution will certainly contribute to a potential reduction in the nutrient emission nevertheless the vertical water flow through the soil due to irrigation and subsequent net over irrigation will affect not only the emission of no3 but of other nutrients and ppps as well moreover precise control over the no3 concentrations is much more complex due to less predictable processes of the soil n cycle mineralisation denitrification immobilisation and plant n uptake rates than the evapotranspiration on top of that the control over ppp emission requires also a reduction in the water flow from the soil which leads to the conclusion that focussing on managing the water balance will be a preferable first step 3 2 soilless cultivation 3 2 1 water treatment soilless cultivation requires a high and constant quality of water to avoid any problems with clogging leaking or leaching filters are used to eliminate large particles in the water before disinfection fig 1 and 2 mostly another filter is used before the water is supplied to the drippers to eliminate substances from the fertilisers which may block the drippers sometimes additional small filters are used for special equipment disinfection fertiliser supply other water sources sand filters used to be common to eliminate the coarse particles coming from the plants and substrate and they still meet the demands for disinfection equipment however these filters have to be automatically rinsed if clogging appears the water used for rinsing the filters by changing the direction of the flow was automatically discharged leading to a discharge of about 200 500 m3 ha 1 yr 1 to minimise this amount other filter types were investigated metal screen filters use only 25 filter rinsing water compared to a sand filter and flatbed filters eliminate particles 10 to 40 Œºm depending on the cloth which is used and use no rinsing water at all van os et al 2020 the cloth and the dirt can be removed as solid waste and composted recirculation of drain water means that the risk of spreading root borne pathogens increases dramatically disinfection of the drainwater is a good solution van os 2009 spreading of pathogens within rows gutter can be minimised by separation of individual slabs troughs and using gutter systems with sideward collection and transport of drainage to prevent contact with other slabs or root system heat treatment is very efficient by use of heat exchangers but still requires additional energy runia et al 1988 best performance was found with 95 c during 30 s or 85 c during 3 min a newer alternative is uv light by means of high pressure or low pressure lamps both perform well if a dosage of 100 mj cm 2 is given against fungi and bacteria or 250 mj cm 2 against viruses runia 1995 ehret et al 2001 ozone treatment now makes a comeback it was used in the 90 s runia 1995 disappeared because of safety issues and high investment costs recently new and safer technology was introduced dosing of ozone is controlled using redox sensors measuring the oxidisable load of the water with a redox potential of 750 mv the nutrient solution is disinfected for bacteria fungi and viruses van os et al 2020 for small farms slow sand filtration might be a cheaper solution it combines a good effectivity with low investments and a high space requirement van os et al 1998 much cheaper but also less effective are chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide bleach chlorine dioxide to eliminate pathogens mentioned products are meant for cleaning pipework and not for eliminating pathogens for which a much higher dosage of the product is required stijger et al 2020 these products may be well suitable to eliminate biofilm in the pipework van ruijven et al 2020a 3 2 2 fertigation control in an open system with concentrated stock solutions a and b tank fig 1 the irrigation computer always supplies the correct solution to the plants when recirculation takes place disinfected drain water has to be mixed with fresh water mostly the irrigation solution is composed in such a way that 30 of ec in the irrigation water is derived from drain water and additional fresh water and fertilisers from a and b tank are supplied to achieve the setpoint ec alternatively mixing can take place on a volume basis in the latter case all the drain water of the last day is used this is not the case when the irrigation solution is mixed on ec basis as ec of the drain water varies this method may thus lead to unneeded overflow of storage tanks 3 2 3 purification of discharge water when the biological or chemical quality of the recirculating nutrient solution is no longer sufficient growers can decide to discharge within the limits of the nitrogen emission standards but ppps need to be removed from the discharge water several techniques have been developed for the removal of ppps from discharge water van ruijven et al 2014 that could be applied either at the scale of an individual company or a group of companies adding an additional treatment to a sewage treatment plant could also be a collective solution but water volumes to be treated will increase drastically techniques can be divided in three groups 1 oxidative technology to breakdown organic ppp molecules chiron et al 1999 2 separation technology to selectively filter ppps from discharge water cougnaud et al 2005 jiang and adams 2006 or 3 biological treatment debaer and jaeken 2006 de wilde et al 2007 oxidative technology makes use of either ozone or advanced oxidation by combinations of hydrogen peroxide uv or ozone to breakdown ppp molecules into smaller molecules removal of ppps by separation could be done effectively by either activated carbon or membrane filtration however saturated activated carbon needs to be handled as chemical waste after its lifespan but in general can be regenerated with 80 recovery https activated carbon com the filtered residue from membrane filtration containing the ppps needs further treatment before discharge is possible biological treatment is difficult for some of the organic molecules as long treatment times are required to reach 95 efficacy which translates to large installations next to that conditions need to be controlled very carefully for biological treatment to be effective at all koeman et al 2020 in press equipment used for the removal of ppps needs approval from a special governmental committee a standardised efficacy test is performed by an independent research institution to check the efficacy of the installation for the removal of ppps from standardised water van ruijven et al 2020b the committee checks the test results as well as the implementation strategy for the installation before approval is granted or not enforcement municipality and water authorities checks whether approved technology is used and maintained correctly in 2019 47 of the growers used according to interviews an individual system for purification 29 joined a collective purification initiative 14 used a mobile system leendertse et al 2019 the remaining 10 does not need any system for various reasons for example use of zld or plans to close down the implementation of the regulation has not yet led to a reduction in the number of locations with exceedances of the water quality standards in 2018 de weert et al 2019 this is not surprising as purification systems are not yet implemented at all companies for example companies that have opted for a collective system can postpone the implementation to the end of 2020 next to the implementation and enforcement of purification techniques intensive local measurement and communication campaigns in close cooperation with growers have been started by water authorities this has led to a reduction in unconscious leaching and a decrease in concentration and number of ppps in surface water in some polders waterkwaliteitsrapportage delfland 2019 the implementation of the obligation to remove ppps from discharge water will theoretically lead to a considerable reduction in concentrations of ppps in surface water as soon as measures are completely implemented leakages in the piping system or leaching via soil may still lead to unexpected losses moreover at the moment only drainage water from soil grown crops or drain water from soilless cultivation and filter rinsing water containing nutrients have to be purified other water flows like filter rinsing water without nutrients or water used for cleaning at the end of the cultivation do not have to be treated besides it remains to be seen how efficient the purification equipment will work in practice as efficacy depends on the maintenance and proper use of the equipment finally there is a risk that a removal rate of 95 will not be enough to reduce the concentrations of ppps with very low water quality standards such as spinosad abamectine methiocarb and teflubenzuron to an acceptable level for imidacloprid this was foreseen hence the obligation to use equipment with a 99 5 purification rate 3 2 4 zero liquid discharge zero liquid discharge zld is a solution that both meets the regulations for ppps 2018 and nutrients 2027 and also improves the water use efficiency of greenhouse cultivation it is therefore an interesting option for growers to consider before they decide on investing in ppp purification equipment however as the nutrient solution is no longer refreshed quality of inputs into the irrigation system becomes more important fig 8 if the uptake of a substance by the crop is lower than the input into the irrigation system the concentration in water will increase if it is not actively removed from the system increased concentrations of na voogt and van os 2012 and heavy metals have been reported to affect the crop a zld cultivation system therefore requires even more attention to the quality of inputs and the recirculating nutrient solution compared to a semi closed system zld was investigated during a four year period for cucumber and sweet pepper beerling et al 2017 van os et al 2019 2020 and crop yield and water flows were measured to achieve zld fig 2 the following steps were taken use of water low in na 0 1 mmol l 1 supplied by rainwater or brackish well water treated with reverse osmosis use of a flatbed filter no rinsing or a fibre filter with reuse of rinsing water before disinfection disinfection of the recirculating nutrient solution using ozone a quick response irrigation system with 3 l h 1 pressure compensated drippers in combination with a 16 mm pipe and a low pressure recirculation system to bring added substances immediately at all drippers recirculation of the first drain after start of the cultivation weekly analysis of the nutrient solution and adjustment of concentrated nutrient stocks end of cultivation strategy to avoid drain and prevent water losses via removal of the substrate leyh et al 2020 yields in the reference situation were generally comparable to the zld greenhouse table 6 slight differences occurred in 2016 due to the fact that the growth was more vegetative on coir compared to stone wool there was no clear explanation for the difference in yield in 2017 zero drain water discharge could not be completely achieved in all zld experiments in the 2016 crop the nutrient solution had to be discharged during a few days due to a broken disinfection installation and limited storage facility in the experiments with coir some water was lost as the coir was washed with calcium nitrate before use the rinsing water was discharged in 2017 the rinsing water from the coir was not discarded and the calcium concentration in the nutrient solution was increased to compensate for the higher na data showed that this worked well and further accumulation of na during the experiment did not take place 3 2 5 bottlenecks of zero liquid discharge the above mentioned experiments showed that zld is a serious option to prevent or at least strongly reduce emissions of nutrients and ppps to surface waters however there are a number of bottlenecks that might restrain growers to use a zld approach such as substrate quality technical failure losses during and after crop interchange leyh et al 2020 crops susceptible for na accumulation or certain substances leading to an inhibition of growth probably the most serious impediment for zld is na accumulation in the recirculating water even when using the most optimal water sources available some background concentration of na via water sources is unavoidable as well as some input through fertilisers voogt and van os 2012 since na is only taken up by crops in low amounts na accumulation in the recirculating solution will occur eventually this may result in unbalanced nutrient solutions due to lower concentrations of other nutrients compared to na voogt and sonneveld 1997 and or increase in the total salt concentration which may reduce growth and yield or induce physiological disorders sonneveld 2000 since the uptake of na by plants is a linear function of the prevailing na concentration in the root environment it is recommended to let na accumulate to the maximum acceptable concentration recent studies with sweet pepper tomato and gerbera have shown that na may accumulate much higher than the prevailing opinion among growers kierkels 2018 van staalduinen 2020 without causing problems nevertheless based on previous work it is to be expected that for crops with a very low tolerance for na or crops with a low na uptake capacity like rose cymbidium and other orchids na accumulation will remain an important bottleneck the experiments showed that zld is possible both with relatively inert substrates like stone wool but also with more challenging substrates like coir the first drain of the stone wool slabs could be reused without any problems in pepper and cucumber crops also the coir could be used without discharging the rinsing water at the start of cultivation however coir can differ substantially in quality and growers have to be careful and ask for information from the supplier technical failure may cause a need to discharge water as most growers do not have additional capacity to store the nutrient solution for a couple of days to solve problems moreover a frequent and careful analyses of the nutrient solution is needed to avoid nutrient imbalances in combination with a fertigation strategy tuned to plant needs and prevailing climate radiation losses of water nutrients and ppps still occur at the end of the cultivation when the remaining drain solution is discarded to minimise these losses an end of cultivation strategy was developed blok et al 2017 van os et al 2019 leyh et al 2020 the strategy aims at reducing the water content in the slab from 80 v v to 30 v v by reducing irrigation in the last weeks of cultivation this results in less drain water to be reused and empty drain tanks for the start of a new growing season it also lowers the amount of nutrients and ppps emitted from the company by removal of the substrate slabs furthermore the n and p concentration in the irrigation solution are gradually reduced to almost zero and replaced by cl to further reduce these losses this strategy led to reduction in discharge from 36 8 kg n ha 1 to 11 6 kg n ha 1 the strategy can still be improved to further reduce discharge and to be resilient to changes in weather conditions during the last weeks of cultivation moreover the knowledge has to be translated to guidelines to help growers to implement such a strategy another argument to discharge water is the accumulation of growth inhibitors either originating from the crop the cropping system zinc rest products silver or metabolites of disinfection products like chlorate or perchlorate van os et al 2014 demonstrated that root exudates in rose can be broken down with advanced oxidation uv with peroxide yet the discharge at the start of a new cultivation especially in fruit vegetables is related to the fear for growth inhibition the young crop is very sensitive and therefore during the first months the water is often not re used although it has been shown there may be no scientific ground for that lee 2011 the presence of growth inhibitors in drain water can be detected with a bioassay phytotox kit blok et al 2014 this is a useful tool when doubting the quality of their recirculation water in combination with the application of advanced oxidation this may decrease the amount of discharge significantly as has been demonstrated in practice for several crops raaphorst et al 2014 4 conclusions and way forward the above mentioned approaches have and will lead to a substantial decrease in losses of nutrients and ppps to ground and surface water bodies however it is uncertain whether this is sufficient to reach the goals set for the dutch greenhouse industry zero emission by 2027 and eventually to achieve the water quality standards of the nd and wfd for soil bound greenhouses the goal of zero emission will most probably not be reached for those greenhouses where seepage is limited drainage collection and reuse is an option but still diffuse leaching of nutrients and ppps may occur this solution is not feasible in areas with high seepage quantity or input of undesired salts into the drainage through seepage for those greenhouses growers either have to change over to soilless or stop with greenhouse cultivation in the current regulation this is also foreseen tuning irrigation to crop demand is the best option to minimise losses from soil grown crops various methods are available such as models and various sensors a combination of tools for example a virtual lysimeter combined with sensors seems currently the most promising approach this approach combines technical feasibility and acceptance by growers with achievable goals for soilless cultivation systems the emission goals set for the greenhouse industry are within reach by adoption of zld potential obstacles are leakages and accumulation of undesired salts and other growth inhibiting compounds in the water systems leakages in soilless cultivation groen 2015 is one of the causes of ongoing emissions to water bodies even within a zld strategy greenhouses contain extended and complex piping for irrigation and furthermore gutters and piping for drainage collection and transport most growers lack a good documentation of the piping and changes renovation may cause unexpected pathways to surface water moreover small defects or clogging of irrigation lines loose hanging drippers overflowing drain gutters easily lead to undetected spills currently a standard leakage rate of 1 5 vermeulen et al 2010 is assumed but adequate data to support this value is missing to prevent discharge due to accumulated na in the

10461,water scarcity in dry areas is driving agriculture towards increased utilization of marginal to poor quality water sources for irrigation this includes groundwater and recycled wastewater that tend to be characterized by high levels of minerals and commonly of problematic salts israel has been a global leader in irrigation application efficiency use of groundwater with relatively high concentrations of salts and recycled municipal wastewater and recently in the use of large scale seawater desalination for human consumption and irrigation irrigation with water high in salts has been shown to be unsustainable in many dry regions mostly due to increasing salinity of soil subsoil and groundwater resulting from the application and leaching of salts we present a summary of the direct effects of salinity on crop production of its management in vegetable crops and of the environmental consequences of different salinity management practices the objective of this review is to provide a fundamental understanding of the advantages and limitations of irrigating vegetable crops as a function of water quality considering good quality surface and groundwater saline brackish water treated wastewater and desalinated water the long term experience of irrigation of annual vegetable and other horticultural crops with diverse water qualities in israel is reviewed the environmental implications of irrigation as a function of water salinity both on a national scale and using a local case study of irrigation with brackish groundwater of vegetables in israel s arava valley are discussed finally possible management strategies are suggested to reduce environmental consequences of irrigation with water containing salts and address the fundamental question can irrigated arid zone vegetable production be sustainable keywords salinity nitrate pollution irrigation management leaching desalination 1 introduction crop water and nutrient management are critically dependent on water quality particularly salinity scarcity has led to waters of diverse quality to be used for irrigation particularly in arid and semi arid regions irrigation with water having a relatively high concentration of salts has negative repercussions on crop production and the soil intensive vegetable production in these dry areas is particularly sensitive to irrigation induced salinity ions such as sodium na calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 chloride cl sulfate so4 2 and carbonate co3 can accumulate in the soil to levels that inhibit plant function and growth k√∂ster et al 2019 z√∂rb et al 2019 soil salinity is a double edged sword stressing plants first by lowering the osmotic potential of soil water solution and making it harder for roots to extract water and secondly by causing toxic responses to ions accumulating in plant tissues and organs munns and tester 2008 soil salinity can be due to primary or secondary causes primary or dryland salinity is caused by the natural accumulation of soluble salts in soils originating from weathered parental rocks or capillary rise from saline ground water munns and tester 2008 butcher et al 2016 dryland salinity generally occurs in semiarid and arid regions where rainfall is low and evapotranspiration is high secondary irrigation induced salinity is the result of accumulation of salts applied with irrigation water soil salinity is typically classified in terms of the electrical conductivity ec of the soil solution measured as the ec of the saturation extract ece and by the soil s relative na content measured by na adsorption ratio sar or percent exchangeable sodium esp butcher et al 2016 soils are often classified as saline when the ece reaches or exceeds 4 ds m 1 which would be equivalent to approximately 40 mmol l 1 nacl or 0 2 mpa osmotic potential munns and tester 2008 k√∂ster et al 2019 sodium plays an important role in saline soils as high relative sodicity can lead to degradation of soil structure martinez alvarez et al 2016 salt stress is one of the major abiotic factors affecting plant growth and limiting crop yield k√∂ster et al 2019 z√∂rb et al 2019 with the exception of the more tolerant halophytes the majority of plants including most important commercial crops are relatively salt sensitive vegetable crops tend to have a particularly low salinity threshold with decreases in growth and yields starting with exposure of approximately 1 2 5 ds m 1 in ece in the most sensitive vegetable species z√∂rb et al 2019 minhas et al 2020 osmotic reactions of plants occur within seconds to hours upon exposure to salt stress munns and tester 2008 julkowska and testerink 2015 toxic responses are initiated when na ions enter plant root epidermal and cortical cells through non selective cation channels na and cl at high amounts are toxic to plants especially if they increase in the cytosol ion toxicities have diverse consequences for example excessive na disturbs uptake of cationic elements such as potassium k ca2 and mg2 leading to nutrient imbalances z√∂rb et al 2019 large ionic alterations can accelerate the senescence of transpiring leaves sodium has a particularly considerable negative impact on plant growth and development compared to other cations due to its ability to induce ca and k deficiencies butcher et al 2016 in addition na and cl can lead to nutrient imbalances mainly due interaction with nitrate no3 yasuor et al 2017 a high level of cl in irrigation water causes alteration of no3 uptake and utilization by plants which can affect plant growth and yield this review presents a summary of the consequences of salinity and its management on vegetable crops and the environment we have aimed to provide a fundamental understanding of the advantages and limitations of irrigating vegetable crops as a consideration of water quality ranging from freshwater saline brackish water treated wastewater to desalinated water the long term experience of irrigation of both annual and perennial horticultural crops with diverse water qualities in israel is used as an example of lessons learned the environmental implications of irrigation as a function of water salinity using a case study of long term irrigation of vegetables with brackish water in israel s arava valley are discussed 2 water quality summary and characterization israel has a historic policy of providing marginal quality water containing relatively high concentrations of salts to agriculture for irrigation substantial utilization of recycled wastewater for irrigation and precise efficient field scale irrigation application technologies caused a steady increase in exposure of irrigated soils and crops throughout israel to salinity from the 1970s until the middle of the second decade of the 21st century raveh and ben gal 2016 tal 2016 despite the fact that the recycled wastewater has relatively high concentrations of salts its utilization allowed economically competitive intensive and productive crop cultivation in dry areas and minimized competition for fresh water with municipal and industrial consumers this came though with a known weighty price mostly to the environment due to the need to leach salts from the root zone with relatively sensitive crops and water of relatively high salinity the additional fraction of irrigation water used to transport salts out of the root zone can reach more than 50 of the total volume applied shani et al 2007 ben gal et al 2008 2009 consideration of water quality for irrigation of vegetable crops begins with characterizing and understanding the various sources of water available freshwater saline brackish water recycled wastewater and desalinated water 2 1 freshwater groundwater surface water the composition of surface and underground waters is dependent on natural factors geological topographical meteorological hydrological and biological in the drainage basin and varies with seasonal differences in runoff volumes weather conditions and water levels large natural variations in water quality may be observed even where only a single watercourse is involved human intervention also has appreciable effects on water quality some of these effects are the result of hydrological changes such as the building of dams draining of wetlands and diversion of flow more obvious are polluting activities such as the discharge of domestic industrial urban and other wastewaters into the watercourse whether intentional or accidental and the spreading of pollutants e g organic agricultural and industrial wastes on agricultural land meybeck et al 1996 freshwater in israel originates from two main sources the first is surface water originating in the north of the country and stored in the sea of galilee this water is pumped and transferred to other regions of israel and serves both municipal and agricultural uses the other fresh source is groundwater from eastern mountain and coastal aquifers table 1 shows current typical chemical composition of irrigation water in israel according to source the values of the parameters will vary over time according to rainfall levels and other environmental effects the fact that groundwater in israel is less salty than surface water a phenomenon not typically found elsewhere is due to the tendency for the sea of galilee israel s sole freshwater lake to be influenced by saline groundwater influxes while commonly having ec levels above 1 ds m 1 both sources are locally considered to be good quality water for crop irrigation 2 2 saline brackish water brackish water is water higher in salts than freshwater and lower than seawater for agricultural purposes brackish water can be characterized by ec ranging from 1 6 ds m 1 table 1 usually originating as groundwater the major soluble mineral salts in brackish water are the cations na ca2 and mg2 and the anions cl and so4 2 the composition and concentration of these ions in groundwater can vary widely and are often site specific an example of chemical composition of high salinity groundwater used for vegetable cropping in the northern arava valley in israel is presented in table 1 2 3 recycled treated wastewater effluent a rapidly expanding alternative source for irrigation in regions with limited freshwater resources is treated wastewater or effluents tww assouline et al 2015 the chemical characteristics of tww depend on the quality of the raw sewage water and on the level of treatment and type of storage assouline and narkis 2011 a typical chemical composition of tww used for crops irrigation in israel is presented in table 1 effluents are generally characterized by relatively high loads of dissolved organic matter dom 28 40 mg l 1 suspended solids 21 25 mg l 1 sar and salinity assouline et al 2016 the primary risks associated with tww irrigation involves high concentrations of salts especially na and of organic compounds effluent treated to a sufficient level usually including tertiary removal of much of the nutrients and disease causing components can be used for the irrigation of vegetables there do appear to be risks of tww irrigation to the soil recent studies have shown that long term irrigation with tww resulted in significant degradation of soil structure and hydraulic properties due to increased esp assouline et al 2015 bardhan et al 2016 suarez and gonzalez rubio 2017 paudel et al 2018 2 3 1 nitrogen raw sewage water contains high concentrations of organic and mineral nitrogen n bar tal 2011 the total n concentration in raw municipal sewage water can range from 20 to 100 mg l 1 1 42 to 7 14 mmol l 1 depending on the community s standard of living wastewater treatment in all its stages removes n and commonly tww has an n concentration of 5 60 mg l 1 0 36 4 28 mmol l 1 for example the average concentration of total n organic and mineral in tww used for irrigation of citrus in israel is about 30 mg l 1 with the concentration of ammonium nh4 n being approximately 23 mg l 1 1 64 mmol l 1 while n as nitrate no3 n concentration is usually below 2 mg l 1 0 14 mmol l 1 bar tal 2011 for perennial crops n added to soils through tww irrigation can be similar to or even exceed the amount commonly applied via fertilization with freshwater therefore tww can be used as the sole source of n however for vegetable crops tww n will not meet crop demands and additional mineral n fertilizer will be needed when the n concentration in the tww is below 10 mg l 1 0 71 mmol l 1 the amount applied is insufficient for a majority of crops even when well irrigated 2 3 2 phosphorus phosphorus p sources in sewage sludge are human excretion and detergent residues resulting in high concentrations of p between 4 12 mg l 1 0 13 0 38 mmol l 1 bar yosef 2011 about 70 90 of total p in sewage sludge is in its inorganic form and the rest as organic p secondary biological treatment of effluents does not usually affect the total p concentration in the solution phosphorus concentration is reduced however by tertiary treatment due to the addition of alum or lime resulting in total p concentration of 0 2 1 0 mg l 1 0 006 0 03 mmol l 1 depending on solution ph dominant cations and reaction time in addition microbial p consumption might lead to a reduction in total p concentration therefore the total p concentration in tww is expected to change according to its source the level and kind of treatment and microbial activity 2 3 3 boron and other secondary nutrients the concentration of secondary nutrients such as ca2 mg2 and bicarbonate hco3 in effluents is typically 60 80 higher than in low quality freshwater commonly found in arid zones table 1 bar yosef 2011 boron b is a special case an essential microelement for normal growth of most plants b becomes markedly toxic to plants at high concentrations for many crop species there is a relatively small different between soil solution b concentrations that are deficient and those that are toxic yermiyahu et al 2011 landi et al 2019 boron is often present in freshwater in dry areas and accumulates and concentrates in tww as a consequence of domestic industrial and agricultural water use yermiyahu et al 2011 potential sources of b in sewage and tww include human and animal excretion detergents effluents from paper mills and metal coating processes and desalination of seawater boron is similar to other elements including na cl and k in that primary or secondary treatment processes do not affect it therefore its concentration in tww is correlated to that of the source sewage water in 1997 b concentration found in israeli tww ranged from 0 46 to 1 41 mg l 1 0 04 to 0 78 mmol l 1 yermiyahu et al 2011 further in 2001 55 of the tww reservoirs in israel were found to have b concentration exceeding 0 6 mg l 1 0 055 mmol l 1 tarchitzky and chen 2004 a level determined to have growth limiting toxic effects on a number of crops removing b from sewage as part of tertiary treatment is also very expensive tagliabue et al 2014 an alternative approach to reduce b level in tww which has been adapted in israel is to decrease the b added by both industrial and domestic processes through policy by first eliminating b allowed in detergents and second by requiring secondary treatment of desalinated water to remove b these actions reduced b concentration from the higher concentrations mentioned previously to under 0 2 mg l 1 0 018 mmol l 1 yermiyahu et al 2011 issues regarding excess concentrations of b are not exclusively related to tww as described above or to seawater desalination described below groundwater can also contain high levels of b as in the case of cyprus where an increase in the average b concentration was observed over the last decade nikolaou et al 2020 2 4 desalinated water desalinated seawater can provide a continuous and abundant source of water mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 desalination is a growing technology worldwide that over the last 12 years doubled its annual production capacity from 52 m m3 to almost 100 m m3 the global desalination plant capacity is expected to grow at a rate of more than 9 each year until 2030 proskynitopoulou and katsoyiannis 2018 with 54 of this growth expected to occur in the regions of the middle east and north africa the ec of desalinated seawater leaving large reverse osmosis ro plants is usually less than 0 5 ds m 1 such water reaching agriculture as an alternative to low quality saline or brackish water will improve crop productivity due to reduced salinity stress seawater desalination for crop irrigation is not problem free its high energy consumption results in it being more expensive than other water sources which limits its use to the most profitable crops mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2017 kaner et al 2017 water from ro processes usually has a total dissolved solids concentration of less than 250 mg l 1 an acidic ph a very low hardness and low buffering capacity yermiyahu et al 2007 such water is generally not suitable for domestic industrial or direct agricultural use generally post treatment to re mineralize and ionically balance the ro water is required before distribution buffering capacity of water is especially relevant for intensive high tech agriculture where fertigation cultivation on soil less substrates or hydroponics are very sensitive to changes in ph the addition of liquid fertilizer to desalinated water can cause rapid and appreciable changes in ph that can affect nutrient availability to crops and consequently crop production mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2017 the chemical composition of desalinated water is highly variable depending on ro technology and the type and intensity of post treatment processes mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 water produced in israeli seawater desalination plants is characterized by overall low concentrations of minerals table 1 with the exception of ca2 and so4 2 which are added back at the desalinization plants in order to satisfy world health organization who criteria for minimal ca concentration needed for human health and to provide buffering capacity and stability to protect distribution systems the addition of so4 2 is sometimes a by product of ca compound dissolving processes dissolving caco3 with sulfuric acid with resulting different concentrations found in israeli desalinated water reflecting different post treatment processes table 1 in contrast in a majority of spanish desalinization plants the mineral composition of desalinated of the desalinated seawater is characterized by generally high na and cl ion concentrations while other minerals ca2 mg2 and so4 2 are present only in low concentrations mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 2017 it is important to mention that if minerals required for agriculture are not added at the desalination plant farmers will need to fertilize them which will likely require sophisticated independent fertigation systems able to cope with the water quality that may change over time yermiyahu et al 2007 the sar in seawater is above 10 the resultant ro desalinated water generally has relatively high na concentrations with very low or no ca2 and mg2 and with sar values of 9 10 post treatment processes may add ca2 and mg2 decreasing the sar value depending on their intensity a sar value of less than 3 is recommended for irrigation water with a low total dissolved solids concentration mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 for example in spanish desalinated water sar was reported to be approximately 6 with an ec of approximately 0 5 ds m 1 implying moderate soil sodicity risk over time israeli desalinated water is regulated to ensure low na concentrations and therefore have sar values close to zero minimizing the soil sodicity risk table 1 from the experience accumulated in israel of irrigation with diverse water qualities it appears that irrigating with sar values between 4 and 5 5 is probably acceptable although not ideal especially when the ec of the water is not very low long term use of sar above 6 has the potential to result in deterioration of soil properties mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 furthermore in a spanish case mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 2017 b was reported to occur at high phytotoxic concentrations as compared to the concentration in desalinated water from israeli desalination plants table 1 boron in natural and acidic environments readily passes through ro membranes without additional treatment b concentration in desalinated mediterranean seawater can reach 2 mg l 1 which is toxic for many crops yermiyahu et al 2007 it is therefore necessary to consider specific technologies for reducing b level in water from ro desalinization process for agricultural use mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 3 irrigation and fertilization management under diverse water qualities 3 1 leaching fraction requirements management of water containing salts for irrigation involves application of excess water beyond crop evapotranspiration etc needs designed to maintain root zone salinity that avoids or minimizes salinity caused yield reduction the amount of additional water required to maintain a target salinity level the leaching requirement lr is a function of crop sensitivity and irrigation water salinity ayers and westcot 1985 traditional irrigation management strategy under conditions where water is not limiting is to provide water such that the ratio of the actual volume of drainage to the volume of irrigation the leaching fraction lf satisfies the lr a variety of formulations have been proposed for estimating the lr all of which are based on a functional relationship between irrigation water salinity and crop yield the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao recommends computing lr as ayers and westcot 1985 1 l r e c i w 5 e c e e c i w where eciw denotes ec of the irrigation water ece is the ec of the soil saturated paste extract corresponding to the soil salinity tolerated by the crop values of ece used to determine lr are usually either ece of the threshold value ece 0 meaning 0 yield decrease due to salinity or ece 10 reflecting a 10 yield loss it has been suggested meiri and plaut 1985 corwin et al 2007 letey and feng 2007 dudley et al 2008a ben gal et al 2008 that calculating lr with formulas such as eq 1 is imprecise because of lack of consideration of soil type climate or salinity induced reduction in plant transpiration such omissions and disregard for the feedback mechanisms in soil water plant systems could possibly result in underestimation of actual leaching and overestimation of lr dudley et al 2008a there are a number of approaches based on our understanding of the response of crops to water salt tolerance and soil processes including leaching used to evaluate plant response to both amount of applied water and salinity these approaches have led to semi empirical production functions for specific crops letey et al 1985 letey and dinar 1986 and to physically based conceptual models of water uptake as reviewed by hopmans and bristow 2002 and feddes and raats 2004 such models allow consideration of environmental factors and dynamic interactions within the soil water plant system and enable prediction of crop response to various irrigation regimes calculation of lfs and evaluation of lrs typically the models calculate water uptake or transpiration and their reduction due to insufficient amount of soil water and excess soil water salinity these present more robust and appropriate tools for decision making regarding leaching requirements and crop factors than the historically used semi empirical models such as ayers and westcot 1985 examples of numerical and analytical models applied to vegetable cultivation irrigated with different water salinity and degrees of leaching include melons peppers tomato cucumber peas maize onions and eggplant dudley and shani 2003 shani et al 2007 ben gal et al 2008 2009 skaggs et al 2014 barnard et al 2015 phogat et al 2020 fig 1 demonstrates the complexity of minimizing lf because of the effects of plant feedback mechanisms dudley et al 2008a target or maximum yields can be reached by increasing irrigation rate to a certain extent while actual lfs do not reach zero and are sensitive to crop response to both water and salt there is a maximum amount of salt that can be stored in the root zone because increasing salinity reduces water uptake by roots causing lowered growth and yields once the maximum amount of salt accumulates in the root zone leaching begins and further yield loss does not result from repeating the irrigation schedule the lf increases as transpiration decreases due to salinity making the crop irrigation drainage relationships self regulating from fig 1 it can also be seen that for any given salinity of irrigation water there is a minimum possible lf if irrigating for example with water of ec 3 ds m 1 the lowest possible lf is approximately 0 2 and can be reached by either irrigating below or above potential et levels at low irrigation rates when attempting deficit strategies the lf is increased because of yield loss caused by water and salt stress at irrigation levels greater than crop water requirements for et the lf is increased by yield loss from salt accumulation and over irrigation dudley et al 2008a these results suggest that there is a minimum lf for every combination of crop soil water quality and irrigation volume that limits both salt storage and the amount of drainage 3 2 blending water of different qualities for irrigation of vegetables together with the problematic low osmotic potential and high levels of unwanted na and cl ions irrigation with water high in salts can often supply crops with ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in ro desalinated water these minerals can be totally removed yermiyahu et al 2007 the nutrients can be re introduced alternatively by fertilizer addition or by blending desalinated water with saline groundwater ben gal et al 2009 evaluated blending strategies for supplying ca2 mg2 and so4 2 for bell pepper irrigated in an arid environment in israel reducing salinity from ec 3 20 to ec 0 40 ds m 1 by ro desalination increased yields by almost 50 irrigation was reduced by half but there was an appreciable extra cost for the addition of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 irrigation with blended water containing 70 desalinated and 30 saline water provided pepper yields that were more than 90 of those with fully desalinated water however it was necessary to increase irrigation rates by at least 50 the environmental cost of the increase in irrigation water salinity from an ec of 0 4 ds m 1 desalinated water to an ec of 1 35 ds m 1 blended water in the ben gal et al 2009 study while significantly lower than irrigation with the original brackish ec 3 2 ds m 1 water was still substantial loading the soil and leaching beyond the root zone five times more salt ben gal et al 2009 long term 2018 2050 predictions of soil chemical changes under different protected vegetable crops tomato cucumber capsicum and eggplant different irrigation water qualities blending and quantities lf in australia indicate a constant increase of soil ec sar and esp phogat et al 2020 the different crops significantly affect these soil chemical alterations mainly due to associated differences in irrigation water volume and season length increasing leaching and gypsum additions can assist in controlling soil salinity and sodicity however they also increase the environmental impact of salts leaching toward groundwater 3 3 environmental consequences of irrigating vegetables with water high in salts salts leached from the root zone do not disappear leached salts make their way into both subsurface and surface water often degrading water resources used for agriculture downstream in arid and semi arid areas where large volumes of irrigation water are applied salts accumulate in the groundwater beneath the root zone even when aquifers are deep the leached salts eventually make their way to groundwater examples of irrigation induced groundwater salinization are found in aquifers of south eastern spain pulido bosch et al 2018 in india s indo gangetic basin singh 2005 in the murray basin of south east australia pulido bosch et al 2018 and in california s san joaquin valley hanak et al 2017 2019 schoups et al 2005 groundwater quality in se spain has significantly declined to such a level that some aquifers are currently no longer suitable for irrigation of most crops pulido bosch et al 2018 reports from california suggest that salinization can lead to retirement of impacted agricultural lands hanak et al 2017 in addition to reducing water quality salinization of groundwater increases the damage caused should a rising saline water table intrude into the root zone beltr√°n 1999 an increasingly important issue whenever fertilization is combined with water high in salts is the paradox between nutrients especially n and salinity control libutti and monteleone 2017 showed that since soil salinity control is destined to increase n leaching best management should optimize the amount of water needed to reduce salinity and that required to avoid or minimize no3 contamination of groundwater their solution was to decouple the processes by applying n only when necessary and to avoid n application during sensitive times for example during periods of rainfall and to concentrate salt leaching during periods when n fertilization is less important libutti and monteleone 2017 minimizing this salinity n paradox with such coupled nutrient salt management will require site crop and salinity specific considerations a recent numerical study suggested that no3 leaching can be reduced when irrigating with low salinity water due not only to reduced leaching but also due to the effect of salinity or lack of on root distribution and water uptake by root russo and kurtzman 2019 while cl no3 interactions played a strong role in the root zone itself they had little effect on no3 mass fluxes to deeper soil depths 4 salinity and nitrate pollution a case study from israel s arava valley nitrogen leaching namely the downward transport of nitrate nitrogen no3 n out of the root zone by water percolating through the soil profile is among the most common forms of groundwater contamination libutti and monteleone 2017 nitrate is highly soluble easily mobile within soil water solution and poorly absorbed on soil particles the detrimental consequences of no3 leaching affecting groundwater quality are much evident in intensive agricultural areas and particularly in arid and semi arid regions no3 pollution occurs when the n supply appreciably exceeds the n requirement yasuor et al 2013 in peppers grown during the winter season in greenhouses in the western negev in israel n concentrations of 102 3 and 158 5 mg l 1 7 3 and 11 3 mmol l 1 in the irrigation solution resulted in 400 and 800 kg ha 1 n respectively being leached below the root zone yasuor et al 2013 at lower n concentration of 56 2 mg l 1 n 4 01 mmol l 1 n was almost completely taken up and used by the pepper plants yasuor et al 2013 the common concentration of n used by farmers in this region is approximately100 mg l 1 n mainly as no3 yasuor et al 2013 it is important to mention that these high n contamination levels occurred under a background of high quality irrigation water desalinated water similar high n loading to the groundwater was reported in the san joaquin valley as a result of fertilization with inorganic nitrogen fertilizers and dairy manure hanak et al 2019 under irrigated conditions where water high in salts is used soil salinity leaching management increases the risk of n losses from the active soil profile and enhances groundwater contamination nitrate leaching and contamination of groundwater are even more problematic when relatively salt sensitive vegetables are irrigated with water containing salts and applied with particularly high leaching factors ben gal et al 2008 the arava valley growing area is in an arid region with annual precipitation of 20 50 mm a year and annual potential et approaching 3000 mm goldreich and karni 2001 the irrigation water in this area comes mainly from brackish groundwater characterized by ec values of 2 5 4 ds m 1 depending on the well location and aquifer characterization due to the low annual rainfall in this area the chief processes that affect groundwater quality are related to human activity mainly crop irrigation in the central and northern parts of the arava valley the main crops are soil grown vegetables in protected cultivation greenhouse and net houses as described above in order to satisfy crop water requirements and to wash the salts from the root zone farmers need to irrigate with high water volumes throughout the growing season july until may vegetable crops are irrigated using drip irrigation and fertilizers are applied via the irrigation system fertigation the high irrigation volumes due to the high lf combined with continuous fertigation have led to the accumulation of salts and fertilizers in the groundwater fig 2 twenty five years of data from wells located in vegetable growing areas in the arava valley demonstrates that intense vegetable production in these areas has led to a rapid increase in groundwater salinity furthermore these salinization processes were accompanied by increases in no3 concentration of the groundwater the ec in 1995 was around 2 ds m 1 in a well located in ein yahav fig 2 and the no3 concentration was close to zero within 10 years the no3 concentration reached 50 mg l 1 0 80 mmol l 1 according the who water with nitrate concentration exceeding 50 mg l 1 is not suitable for human consumption and can cause health problems world health organization 2011 libutti and monteleone 2017 by 2018 the no3 concentration in the groundwater had almost doubled reaching more than 80 mg l 1 1 29 mmol l 1 this demonstrated that local practices led to severe no3 contamination of the aquifer rendering its water unfit for human consumption the high no3 concentrations additionally threaten continued agricultural use of the groundwater as they become a limiting factor to crop developmental stages such as fruit set in pepper h yasuor un published data the salinization and no3 contamination of the arava valley aquifers presented in fig 2 is in agreement with previous research conducted in this region oren et al 2004 shalev et al 2015 these previous studies clearly demonstrate that the major source of no3 contamination is fertilizer n in excess irrigation water nitrate contamination of groundwater is not unique to the environmental conditions of the arava valley increased no3 concentrations have been reported in aquifers in arid and semi arid areas throughout the world over the past several decades as a result of human activity guti√©rrez et al 2018 for example in tunisia a majority of shallow aquifers 50 100 m deep similar to arava valley have high no3 concentrations 67 515 mg l 1 more concerning high concentrations were also detected in deep aquifers re et al 2017 similar reports of groundwater contamination have come out of southeastern spain where aquifers have been found with no3 level as high as 200 400 mg l 1 pulido bosch et al 2018 there the dramatic increase in aquifer no3 concentration is the result of the rapid development of greenhouse horticulture in almer√≠a this region and other intense vegetable production areas are now classified as nitrate vulnerable zones in accordance with the european union directive thompson et al 2007 garcia caparros et al 2017 although no systematic correlation consistently exists between salinization and no3 contamination irrigation of intensive agriculture vegetable crops with saline water is likely to accelerate no3 contamination of aquifers as seen in the arava valley in recent years fig 2 a similar correlation between groundwater salinization and nitrate contamination was detected in california hanak et al 2017 2019 where the process was seen to intensify in dry years and as a function of irrigation with low quality water therefore no3 contamination management practices are urgently needed thompson et al 2020a b 5 management strategies to reduce environmental consequences of irrigation with water high in salts 5 1 irrigation frequency leaching of salts from crop root zone soils may or may not benefit from frequent application of relatively small quantities of water one school of thought holds that the small root volumes and the small root to shoot ratios observed under high frequency irrigation are problematic for salinity management shalhevet 1992 this view considers that a larger deeper root zone would facilitate more efficient leaching and allow longer periods of time to pass before root zone salinity rises to problematic levels meiri and plaut 1985 less frequent irrigation would also lead to lower evaporation losses translating into lower irrigation requirements and slower salt build up shalhevet 1992 intermittent leaching and less frequent irrigation have been promoted by meiri and plaut 1985 caballero et al 2001 and feng et al 2003 with the reasoning that a sufficiently large root zone allows maintenance of upper soil layers that are relatively well leached an intermittent non steady state leaching strategy would then utilize rainfall and would potentially leach more efficiently than constant steady state regimes several field studies support this theory e g hoffman et al 1990 shalhevet 1994 but they may be compromised by the fact that their frequency regimes were reflected in different water application quantities and that they did not utilize the irrigation for fertigation silber 2005 alternatively it has been suggested that increased irrigation frequency maintains a relatively leached zone for root activity with few or no compounding effects due to drying and wetting cycles hillel 2000 hanson and ayars 2002 small frequent irrigations would therefore allow reduced deep percolation regardless of application method hanson and ayars 2002 infrequent regimes present plants with stress due to decreases in both osmotic and matric potential occurring between irrigations frequent regimes would eliminate the matric potential decrease and minimize the osmotic stress hillel 2000 for drip irrigation the low salinity zone around and below drippers promotes high yields while controlling minimizing the lf phene 1986 hillel 2000 a number of studies support this theory assouline et al 2006 reported identical yield and less salt removal when comparing pulsed 10 applications per day to daily irrigation of bell pepper with saline 4 2 ds m 1 water daily irrigation with brackish water lowered average salinity in the soil profile compared to twice weekly irrigation ayars et al 1985 five pulses a day of saline ec 6 2 ds m 1 water was found to overcome the detrimental effects of salinity observed in daily irrigation by pasternak and malach de 1995 these authors measured reduced midday salt concentration in the rhizosphere as a function of increased irrigation frequency dehghanisanij et al 2006 also showed that timing drip irrigation with saline water to match maximum et demand maintained maximum moisture and minimized salinity in the immediate area of the roots dudley et al 2008b investigated the potential for high frequency drip irrigation to minimize drainage using the hydrus 2d numerical model ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 for water flow and solute transport in a sandy loam soil actual salt distribution is dependent on soil type irrigation quantity irrigation salinity root distribution plant uptake irrigation method and drying and wetting cycles associated with frequency regimes mmolawa and or 2000 dudley et al 2008b showed that drip irrigation with three dimensional wetting solute transport and accumulation can essentially reduce salt load in drainage as salts are stored in the upper root zone but beyond the plant s zone of active uptake for the specific case tested by dudley et al 2008b drip methodology and increased frequency of irrigation both reduced drainage water salt load without affecting transpiration the ability to store salts in this way is likely to be temporary because they are liable to be subsequently mobilized by precipitation or management changes 5 2 blending or conjunctive use of multiple sources of water waters from different sources can either be blended or applied separately in a cyclic or sequential manner combining different salinity waters serves to increase the total water supply available for irrigation and to make irrigation more affordable since lower quality waters are often cheaper blending involves combining two or more water sources to reach a targeted salinity for a particular crop the allowable salinity of a blend depends on the salt tolerance of the crop to be irrigated the acceptable level of yield loss soil type climate and the long term management plan for irrigation and crop production grattan et al 2012 minhas 2012 grattan and oster 2003 suggested that if the saline portion of the blend cannot contribute at least 25 of the total volume of water to be irrigated the potential costs and risks of crop damage outweigh the potential benefits of using the low quality water examples of blending have been reported for tomato in egypt and syria malash et al 2002 flowers et al 2005 and sweet bell pepper in israel ben gal et al 2008 2009 these studies reported intermediate yields with blended water that were less than with non saline water and greater than with only brackish water and that leaching of salts and issues of sub soil and groundwater pollution could not be eliminated blending requires infrastructure to mix the water sources either within the water delivery system or by diverting water of different sources into a storage reservoir to consequently be applied to fields different salinity water sources can also be applied one at a time cyclically or sequentially minhas and gupta 1993a 1993b the selection of which water source to apply depends on crop growth stage different water can also be applied to crops in separate fields within a farm or according to seasons in order to minimize crop exposure to salinity at sensitive stages minhas and gupta 1993a 1993b for example since germination and seedling establishment are recognized as sensitive stages in vegetable crops a possible cyclic strategy would be to utilize low salinity waters for pre sowing irrigation and early stages of crop growth and to switch to higher salinity waters at later stages when crop tolerance is expected to be greater rhoades et al 1992 advocated seasonal cyclic irrigation with good quality water applied to salt sensitive crops initial stages of tolerant crops particularly to facilitate leaching of previously accumulated salts studies by minhas and gupta 1993a 1993b and minhas 2012 additionally suggest that cyclical use where better quality water is applied at early stages and the use of salty waters is limited to later stages leads to higher overall water use efficiency more recent numerical modeling studies have suggested that sensor based triggered alternate irrigation of fresh and higher salinity treated wastewater within crop growing seasons can minimize negative effects on crops and reduce loading of deep soils and groundwater by salts and accompanied contaminants for example nitrates russo et al 2015 russo 2016 5 3 approaches to water and salinity management can irrigated arid zone vegetable production be sustainable a variety of strategies have emerged to address the negative phenomena associated with salinization due to irrigation one method is to reduce leaching as discussed and illustrated in fig 1 actual lf is highly sensitive to the self regulating nature of the crop irrigation salinity drainage relationships and calculation of leaching requirements and fractions must consider soil crop and climate combinations in addition to salinity level and take into account the costs to crop production that comes with reduction of lf a second method is to collect and dispose of the leachate drainage collection facilitates field scale salinity management but the collected saline water must be dealt with the consequences of leaching and collecting salts in order to allow irrigation with low quality water are larger than the simple cost and loss of water and movement of the salts themselves sustainable management can utilize drainage water collection systems and disposal schemes to avoid environmental degradation examples include regional interception of saline water before it enters the murray river in victoria and south australia alexander 1990 large scale off and on farm drainage collection in the indus river valley of pakistan aslam and prathapar 2006 and farm scale drainage systems and local containment and treatment of leachate in california where such practices have become more prevalent tanji et al 2002 common to all of these cases is the problem of final disposal of the collected saline leachate the leachate water will contain soluble minerals added as fertilizers and can contain other contaminants which can originate from the agricultural system or be naturally occurring evaporation and water treatment can concentrate them into brines or solids reducing the volume of the waste sea ocean disposal occurs but may not be environmentally sound or sustainable depending on the specific chemical composition of the wastewater and on the way in which the water is distributed to the sea a third and maybe more practical strategy for salinity management is to reduce input of the salts by limiting irrigation with high salinity water sources and providing irrigated agriculture with low salinity options water resource conservation and salinity management issues can both be addressed by salt reduction reduction of water application when conditions are saline is impractical for productive agriculture where maximization of yields is imperative reduction therefore must concern the salts in the irrigation water use of lower salinity water promotes more efficient use of water as a greater percentage of the applied water is directed at plant consumption and less is directed at leaching salts irrigation may also be reduced by increasing plant uptake from shallow groundwater where water tables are sufficiently close to the root zone to permit significant upward flux reducing irrigation in these cases decreases the salt load from the irrigation water but also risks salinization of the root zone by increasing utilization of more saline groundwater an example of repercussion from movement from more to less saline irrigation water is found in the history of large scale use of tww for irrigation together with a move to large scale desalination to provide israel s municipal water supply around a third of all irrigation water in israel is tww until 2007 8 israel s tww was characterized by high salinity with average cl concentration greater than 250 mg l 1 in 2007 israel began the introduction of large seawater desalination plants which by the middle of the following decade would supply approximately half of its municipal water needs the low salinity water provided to cities led to a decrease in salinity of tww in 2006 more than 65 of israel s tww reservoirs had cl concentrations greater than 250 mg l 1 by 2016 only 20 of the reservoirs had such high cl concentrations raveh and ben gal 2016 2018 presented a macro data study of salinity trends in israeli agriculture in which the adoption of desalination had a remarkable effect on remediating irrigation induced salinity and reversing troublesome trends of high and rising salt content in israel s crops and produce policies of providing agriculture with water containing salts and nutrients are not sustainable improved sustainability can be achieved by providing agriculture with good quality water promoting high productivity and thereby low environmental consequences yermiyahu et al 2007 ben gal et al 2009 raveh and ben gal 2018 the strategy to desalinate water prior to distribution and thus have well contained concentrated salt waste and allow greater irrigation efficiency minimal field scale leaching and minimal contamination with nutrients soil contaminants e g selenium b and various agrochemicals is emerging as the preferable alternative to irrigating copiously to leach salts and then finding solutions for drainage water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10461,water scarcity in dry areas is driving agriculture towards increased utilization of marginal to poor quality water sources for irrigation this includes groundwater and recycled wastewater that tend to be characterized by high levels of minerals and commonly of problematic salts israel has been a global leader in irrigation application efficiency use of groundwater with relatively high concentrations of salts and recycled municipal wastewater and recently in the use of large scale seawater desalination for human consumption and irrigation irrigation with water high in salts has been shown to be unsustainable in many dry regions mostly due to increasing salinity of soil subsoil and groundwater resulting from the application and leaching of salts we present a summary of the direct effects of salinity on crop production of its management in vegetable crops and of the environmental consequences of different salinity management practices the objective of this review is to provide a fundamental understanding of the advantages and limitations of irrigating vegetable crops as a function of water quality considering good quality surface and groundwater saline brackish water treated wastewater and desalinated water the long term experience of irrigation of annual vegetable and other horticultural crops with diverse water qualities in israel is reviewed the environmental implications of irrigation as a function of water salinity both on a national scale and using a local case study of irrigation with brackish groundwater of vegetables in israel s arava valley are discussed finally possible management strategies are suggested to reduce environmental consequences of irrigation with water containing salts and address the fundamental question can irrigated arid zone vegetable production be sustainable keywords salinity nitrate pollution irrigation management leaching desalination 1 introduction crop water and nutrient management are critically dependent on water quality particularly salinity scarcity has led to waters of diverse quality to be used for irrigation particularly in arid and semi arid regions irrigation with water having a relatively high concentration of salts has negative repercussions on crop production and the soil intensive vegetable production in these dry areas is particularly sensitive to irrigation induced salinity ions such as sodium na calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 chloride cl sulfate so4 2 and carbonate co3 can accumulate in the soil to levels that inhibit plant function and growth k√∂ster et al 2019 z√∂rb et al 2019 soil salinity is a double edged sword stressing plants first by lowering the osmotic potential of soil water solution and making it harder for roots to extract water and secondly by causing toxic responses to ions accumulating in plant tissues and organs munns and tester 2008 soil salinity can be due to primary or secondary causes primary or dryland salinity is caused by the natural accumulation of soluble salts in soils originating from weathered parental rocks or capillary rise from saline ground water munns and tester 2008 butcher et al 2016 dryland salinity generally occurs in semiarid and arid regions where rainfall is low and evapotranspiration is high secondary irrigation induced salinity is the result of accumulation of salts applied with irrigation water soil salinity is typically classified in terms of the electrical conductivity ec of the soil solution measured as the ec of the saturation extract ece and by the soil s relative na content measured by na adsorption ratio sar or percent exchangeable sodium esp butcher et al 2016 soils are often classified as saline when the ece reaches or exceeds 4 ds m 1 which would be equivalent to approximately 40 mmol l 1 nacl or 0 2 mpa osmotic potential munns and tester 2008 k√∂ster et al 2019 sodium plays an important role in saline soils as high relative sodicity can lead to degradation of soil structure martinez alvarez et al 2016 salt stress is one of the major abiotic factors affecting plant growth and limiting crop yield k√∂ster et al 2019 z√∂rb et al 2019 with the exception of the more tolerant halophytes the majority of plants including most important commercial crops are relatively salt sensitive vegetable crops tend to have a particularly low salinity threshold with decreases in growth and yields starting with exposure of approximately 1 2 5 ds m 1 in ece in the most sensitive vegetable species z√∂rb et al 2019 minhas et al 2020 osmotic reactions of plants occur within seconds to hours upon exposure to salt stress munns and tester 2008 julkowska and testerink 2015 toxic responses are initiated when na ions enter plant root epidermal and cortical cells through non selective cation channels na and cl at high amounts are toxic to plants especially if they increase in the cytosol ion toxicities have diverse consequences for example excessive na disturbs uptake of cationic elements such as potassium k ca2 and mg2 leading to nutrient imbalances z√∂rb et al 2019 large ionic alterations can accelerate the senescence of transpiring leaves sodium has a particularly considerable negative impact on plant growth and development compared to other cations due to its ability to induce ca and k deficiencies butcher et al 2016 in addition na and cl can lead to nutrient imbalances mainly due interaction with nitrate no3 yasuor et al 2017 a high level of cl in irrigation water causes alteration of no3 uptake and utilization by plants which can affect plant growth and yield this review presents a summary of the consequences of salinity and its management on vegetable crops and the environment we have aimed to provide a fundamental understanding of the advantages and limitations of irrigating vegetable crops as a consideration of water quality ranging from freshwater saline brackish water treated wastewater to desalinated water the long term experience of irrigation of both annual and perennial horticultural crops with diverse water qualities in israel is used as an example of lessons learned the environmental implications of irrigation as a function of water salinity using a case study of long term irrigation of vegetables with brackish water in israel s arava valley are discussed 2 water quality summary and characterization israel has a historic policy of providing marginal quality water containing relatively high concentrations of salts to agriculture for irrigation substantial utilization of recycled wastewater for irrigation and precise efficient field scale irrigation application technologies caused a steady increase in exposure of irrigated soils and crops throughout israel to salinity from the 1970s until the middle of the second decade of the 21st century raveh and ben gal 2016 tal 2016 despite the fact that the recycled wastewater has relatively high concentrations of salts its utilization allowed economically competitive intensive and productive crop cultivation in dry areas and minimized competition for fresh water with municipal and industrial consumers this came though with a known weighty price mostly to the environment due to the need to leach salts from the root zone with relatively sensitive crops and water of relatively high salinity the additional fraction of irrigation water used to transport salts out of the root zone can reach more than 50 of the total volume applied shani et al 2007 ben gal et al 2008 2009 consideration of water quality for irrigation of vegetable crops begins with characterizing and understanding the various sources of water available freshwater saline brackish water recycled wastewater and desalinated water 2 1 freshwater groundwater surface water the composition of surface and underground waters is dependent on natural factors geological topographical meteorological hydrological and biological in the drainage basin and varies with seasonal differences in runoff volumes weather conditions and water levels large natural variations in water quality may be observed even where only a single watercourse is involved human intervention also has appreciable effects on water quality some of these effects are the result of hydrological changes such as the building of dams draining of wetlands and diversion of flow more obvious are polluting activities such as the discharge of domestic industrial urban and other wastewaters into the watercourse whether intentional or accidental and the spreading of pollutants e g organic agricultural and industrial wastes on agricultural land meybeck et al 1996 freshwater in israel originates from two main sources the first is surface water originating in the north of the country and stored in the sea of galilee this water is pumped and transferred to other regions of israel and serves both municipal and agricultural uses the other fresh source is groundwater from eastern mountain and coastal aquifers table 1 shows current typical chemical composition of irrigation water in israel according to source the values of the parameters will vary over time according to rainfall levels and other environmental effects the fact that groundwater in israel is less salty than surface water a phenomenon not typically found elsewhere is due to the tendency for the sea of galilee israel s sole freshwater lake to be influenced by saline groundwater influxes while commonly having ec levels above 1 ds m 1 both sources are locally considered to be good quality water for crop irrigation 2 2 saline brackish water brackish water is water higher in salts than freshwater and lower than seawater for agricultural purposes brackish water can be characterized by ec ranging from 1 6 ds m 1 table 1 usually originating as groundwater the major soluble mineral salts in brackish water are the cations na ca2 and mg2 and the anions cl and so4 2 the composition and concentration of these ions in groundwater can vary widely and are often site specific an example of chemical composition of high salinity groundwater used for vegetable cropping in the northern arava valley in israel is presented in table 1 2 3 recycled treated wastewater effluent a rapidly expanding alternative source for irrigation in regions with limited freshwater resources is treated wastewater or effluents tww assouline et al 2015 the chemical characteristics of tww depend on the quality of the raw sewage water and on the level of treatment and type of storage assouline and narkis 2011 a typical chemical composition of tww used for crops irrigation in israel is presented in table 1 effluents are generally characterized by relatively high loads of dissolved organic matter dom 28 40 mg l 1 suspended solids 21 25 mg l 1 sar and salinity assouline et al 2016 the primary risks associated with tww irrigation involves high concentrations of salts especially na and of organic compounds effluent treated to a sufficient level usually including tertiary removal of much of the nutrients and disease causing components can be used for the irrigation of vegetables there do appear to be risks of tww irrigation to the soil recent studies have shown that long term irrigation with tww resulted in significant degradation of soil structure and hydraulic properties due to increased esp assouline et al 2015 bardhan et al 2016 suarez and gonzalez rubio 2017 paudel et al 2018 2 3 1 nitrogen raw sewage water contains high concentrations of organic and mineral nitrogen n bar tal 2011 the total n concentration in raw municipal sewage water can range from 20 to 100 mg l 1 1 42 to 7 14 mmol l 1 depending on the community s standard of living wastewater treatment in all its stages removes n and commonly tww has an n concentration of 5 60 mg l 1 0 36 4 28 mmol l 1 for example the average concentration of total n organic and mineral in tww used for irrigation of citrus in israel is about 30 mg l 1 with the concentration of ammonium nh4 n being approximately 23 mg l 1 1 64 mmol l 1 while n as nitrate no3 n concentration is usually below 2 mg l 1 0 14 mmol l 1 bar tal 2011 for perennial crops n added to soils through tww irrigation can be similar to or even exceed the amount commonly applied via fertilization with freshwater therefore tww can be used as the sole source of n however for vegetable crops tww n will not meet crop demands and additional mineral n fertilizer will be needed when the n concentration in the tww is below 10 mg l 1 0 71 mmol l 1 the amount applied is insufficient for a majority of crops even when well irrigated 2 3 2 phosphorus phosphorus p sources in sewage sludge are human excretion and detergent residues resulting in high concentrations of p between 4 12 mg l 1 0 13 0 38 mmol l 1 bar yosef 2011 about 70 90 of total p in sewage sludge is in its inorganic form and the rest as organic p secondary biological treatment of effluents does not usually affect the total p concentration in the solution phosphorus concentration is reduced however by tertiary treatment due to the addition of alum or lime resulting in total p concentration of 0 2 1 0 mg l 1 0 006 0 03 mmol l 1 depending on solution ph dominant cations and reaction time in addition microbial p consumption might lead to a reduction in total p concentration therefore the total p concentration in tww is expected to change according to its source the level and kind of treatment and microbial activity 2 3 3 boron and other secondary nutrients the concentration of secondary nutrients such as ca2 mg2 and bicarbonate hco3 in effluents is typically 60 80 higher than in low quality freshwater commonly found in arid zones table 1 bar yosef 2011 boron b is a special case an essential microelement for normal growth of most plants b becomes markedly toxic to plants at high concentrations for many crop species there is a relatively small different between soil solution b concentrations that are deficient and those that are toxic yermiyahu et al 2011 landi et al 2019 boron is often present in freshwater in dry areas and accumulates and concentrates in tww as a consequence of domestic industrial and agricultural water use yermiyahu et al 2011 potential sources of b in sewage and tww include human and animal excretion detergents effluents from paper mills and metal coating processes and desalination of seawater boron is similar to other elements including na cl and k in that primary or secondary treatment processes do not affect it therefore its concentration in tww is correlated to that of the source sewage water in 1997 b concentration found in israeli tww ranged from 0 46 to 1 41 mg l 1 0 04 to 0 78 mmol l 1 yermiyahu et al 2011 further in 2001 55 of the tww reservoirs in israel were found to have b concentration exceeding 0 6 mg l 1 0 055 mmol l 1 tarchitzky and chen 2004 a level determined to have growth limiting toxic effects on a number of crops removing b from sewage as part of tertiary treatment is also very expensive tagliabue et al 2014 an alternative approach to reduce b level in tww which has been adapted in israel is to decrease the b added by both industrial and domestic processes through policy by first eliminating b allowed in detergents and second by requiring secondary treatment of desalinated water to remove b these actions reduced b concentration from the higher concentrations mentioned previously to under 0 2 mg l 1 0 018 mmol l 1 yermiyahu et al 2011 issues regarding excess concentrations of b are not exclusively related to tww as described above or to seawater desalination described below groundwater can also contain high levels of b as in the case of cyprus where an increase in the average b concentration was observed over the last decade nikolaou et al 2020 2 4 desalinated water desalinated seawater can provide a continuous and abundant source of water mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 desalination is a growing technology worldwide that over the last 12 years doubled its annual production capacity from 52 m m3 to almost 100 m m3 the global desalination plant capacity is expected to grow at a rate of more than 9 each year until 2030 proskynitopoulou and katsoyiannis 2018 with 54 of this growth expected to occur in the regions of the middle east and north africa the ec of desalinated seawater leaving large reverse osmosis ro plants is usually less than 0 5 ds m 1 such water reaching agriculture as an alternative to low quality saline or brackish water will improve crop productivity due to reduced salinity stress seawater desalination for crop irrigation is not problem free its high energy consumption results in it being more expensive than other water sources which limits its use to the most profitable crops mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2017 kaner et al 2017 water from ro processes usually has a total dissolved solids concentration of less than 250 mg l 1 an acidic ph a very low hardness and low buffering capacity yermiyahu et al 2007 such water is generally not suitable for domestic industrial or direct agricultural use generally post treatment to re mineralize and ionically balance the ro water is required before distribution buffering capacity of water is especially relevant for intensive high tech agriculture where fertigation cultivation on soil less substrates or hydroponics are very sensitive to changes in ph the addition of liquid fertilizer to desalinated water can cause rapid and appreciable changes in ph that can affect nutrient availability to crops and consequently crop production mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2017 the chemical composition of desalinated water is highly variable depending on ro technology and the type and intensity of post treatment processes mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 water produced in israeli seawater desalination plants is characterized by overall low concentrations of minerals table 1 with the exception of ca2 and so4 2 which are added back at the desalinization plants in order to satisfy world health organization who criteria for minimal ca concentration needed for human health and to provide buffering capacity and stability to protect distribution systems the addition of so4 2 is sometimes a by product of ca compound dissolving processes dissolving caco3 with sulfuric acid with resulting different concentrations found in israeli desalinated water reflecting different post treatment processes table 1 in contrast in a majority of spanish desalinization plants the mineral composition of desalinated of the desalinated seawater is characterized by generally high na and cl ion concentrations while other minerals ca2 mg2 and so4 2 are present only in low concentrations mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 2017 it is important to mention that if minerals required for agriculture are not added at the desalination plant farmers will need to fertilize them which will likely require sophisticated independent fertigation systems able to cope with the water quality that may change over time yermiyahu et al 2007 the sar in seawater is above 10 the resultant ro desalinated water generally has relatively high na concentrations with very low or no ca2 and mg2 and with sar values of 9 10 post treatment processes may add ca2 and mg2 decreasing the sar value depending on their intensity a sar value of less than 3 is recommended for irrigation water with a low total dissolved solids concentration mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 for example in spanish desalinated water sar was reported to be approximately 6 with an ec of approximately 0 5 ds m 1 implying moderate soil sodicity risk over time israeli desalinated water is regulated to ensure low na concentrations and therefore have sar values close to zero minimizing the soil sodicity risk table 1 from the experience accumulated in israel of irrigation with diverse water qualities it appears that irrigating with sar values between 4 and 5 5 is probably acceptable although not ideal especially when the ec of the water is not very low long term use of sar above 6 has the potential to result in deterioration of soil properties mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 furthermore in a spanish case mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 2017 b was reported to occur at high phytotoxic concentrations as compared to the concentration in desalinated water from israeli desalination plants table 1 boron in natural and acidic environments readily passes through ro membranes without additional treatment b concentration in desalinated mediterranean seawater can reach 2 mg l 1 which is toxic for many crops yermiyahu et al 2007 it is therefore necessary to consider specific technologies for reducing b level in water from ro desalinization process for agricultural use mart√≠nez alvarez et al 2016 3 irrigation and fertilization management under diverse water qualities 3 1 leaching fraction requirements management of water containing salts for irrigation involves application of excess water beyond crop evapotranspiration etc needs designed to maintain root zone salinity that avoids or minimizes salinity caused yield reduction the amount of additional water required to maintain a target salinity level the leaching requirement lr is a function of crop sensitivity and irrigation water salinity ayers and westcot 1985 traditional irrigation management strategy under conditions where water is not limiting is to provide water such that the ratio of the actual volume of drainage to the volume of irrigation the leaching fraction lf satisfies the lr a variety of formulations have been proposed for estimating the lr all of which are based on a functional relationship between irrigation water salinity and crop yield the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao recommends computing lr as ayers and westcot 1985 1 l r e c i w 5 e c e e c i w where eciw denotes ec of the irrigation water ece is the ec of the soil saturated paste extract corresponding to the soil salinity tolerated by the crop values of ece used to determine lr are usually either ece of the threshold value ece 0 meaning 0 yield decrease due to salinity or ece 10 reflecting a 10 yield loss it has been suggested meiri and plaut 1985 corwin et al 2007 letey and feng 2007 dudley et al 2008a ben gal et al 2008 that calculating lr with formulas such as eq 1 is imprecise because of lack of consideration of soil type climate or salinity induced reduction in plant transpiration such omissions and disregard for the feedback mechanisms in soil water plant systems could possibly result in underestimation of actual leaching and overestimation of lr dudley et al 2008a there are a number of approaches based on our understanding of the response of crops to water salt tolerance and soil processes including leaching used to evaluate plant response to both amount of applied water and salinity these approaches have led to semi empirical production functions for specific crops letey et al 1985 letey and dinar 1986 and to physically based conceptual models of water uptake as reviewed by hopmans and bristow 2002 and feddes and raats 2004 such models allow consideration of environmental factors and dynamic interactions within the soil water plant system and enable prediction of crop response to various irrigation regimes calculation of lfs and evaluation of lrs typically the models calculate water uptake or transpiration and their reduction due to insufficient amount of soil water and excess soil water salinity these present more robust and appropriate tools for decision making regarding leaching requirements and crop factors than the historically used semi empirical models such as ayers and westcot 1985 examples of numerical and analytical models applied to vegetable cultivation irrigated with different water salinity and degrees of leaching include melons peppers tomato cucumber peas maize onions and eggplant dudley and shani 2003 shani et al 2007 ben gal et al 2008 2009 skaggs et al 2014 barnard et al 2015 phogat et al 2020 fig 1 demonstrates the complexity of minimizing lf because of the effects of plant feedback mechanisms dudley et al 2008a target or maximum yields can be reached by increasing irrigation rate to a certain extent while actual lfs do not reach zero and are sensitive to crop response to both water and salt there is a maximum amount of salt that can be stored in the root zone because increasing salinity reduces water uptake by roots causing lowered growth and yields once the maximum amount of salt accumulates in the root zone leaching begins and further yield loss does not result from repeating the irrigation schedule the lf increases as transpiration decreases due to salinity making the crop irrigation drainage relationships self regulating from fig 1 it can also be seen that for any given salinity of irrigation water there is a minimum possible lf if irrigating for example with water of ec 3 ds m 1 the lowest possible lf is approximately 0 2 and can be reached by either irrigating below or above potential et levels at low irrigation rates when attempting deficit strategies the lf is increased because of yield loss caused by water and salt stress at irrigation levels greater than crop water requirements for et the lf is increased by yield loss from salt accumulation and over irrigation dudley et al 2008a these results suggest that there is a minimum lf for every combination of crop soil water quality and irrigation volume that limits both salt storage and the amount of drainage 3 2 blending water of different qualities for irrigation of vegetables together with the problematic low osmotic potential and high levels of unwanted na and cl ions irrigation with water high in salts can often supply crops with ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in ro desalinated water these minerals can be totally removed yermiyahu et al 2007 the nutrients can be re introduced alternatively by fertilizer addition or by blending desalinated water with saline groundwater ben gal et al 2009 evaluated blending strategies for supplying ca2 mg2 and so4 2 for bell pepper irrigated in an arid environment in israel reducing salinity from ec 3 20 to ec 0 40 ds m 1 by ro desalination increased yields by almost 50 irrigation was reduced by half but there was an appreciable extra cost for the addition of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 irrigation with blended water containing 70 desalinated and 30 saline water provided pepper yields that were more than 90 of those with fully desalinated water however it was necessary to increase irrigation rates by at least 50 the environmental cost of the increase in irrigation water salinity from an ec of 0 4 ds m 1 desalinated water to an ec of 1 35 ds m 1 blended water in the ben gal et al 2009 study while significantly lower than irrigation with the original brackish ec 3 2 ds m 1 water was still substantial loading the soil and leaching beyond the root zone five times more salt ben gal et al 2009 long term 2018 2050 predictions of soil chemical changes under different protected vegetable crops tomato cucumber capsicum and eggplant different irrigation water qualities blending and quantities lf in australia indicate a constant increase of soil ec sar and esp phogat et al 2020 the different crops significantly affect these soil chemical alterations mainly due to associated differences in irrigation water volume and season length increasing leaching and gypsum additions can assist in controlling soil salinity and sodicity however they also increase the environmental impact of salts leaching toward groundwater 3 3 environmental consequences of irrigating vegetables with water high in salts salts leached from the root zone do not disappear leached salts make their way into both subsurface and surface water often degrading water resources used for agriculture downstream in arid and semi arid areas where large volumes of irrigation water are applied salts accumulate in the groundwater beneath the root zone even when aquifers are deep the leached salts eventually make their way to groundwater examples of irrigation induced groundwater salinization are found in aquifers of south eastern spain pulido bosch et al 2018 in india s indo gangetic basin singh 2005 in the murray basin of south east australia pulido bosch et al 2018 and in california s san joaquin valley hanak et al 2017 2019 schoups et al 2005 groundwater quality in se spain has significantly declined to such a level that some aquifers are currently no longer suitable for irrigation of most crops pulido bosch et al 2018 reports from california suggest that salinization can lead to retirement of impacted agricultural lands hanak et al 2017 in addition to reducing water quality salinization of groundwater increases the damage caused should a rising saline water table intrude into the root zone beltr√°n 1999 an increasingly important issue whenever fertilization is combined with water high in salts is the paradox between nutrients especially n and salinity control libutti and monteleone 2017 showed that since soil salinity control is destined to increase n leaching best management should optimize the amount of water needed to reduce salinity and that required to avoid or minimize no3 contamination of groundwater their solution was to decouple the processes by applying n only when necessary and to avoid n application during sensitive times for example during periods of rainfall and to concentrate salt leaching during periods when n fertilization is less important libutti and monteleone 2017 minimizing this salinity n paradox with such coupled nutrient salt management will require site crop and salinity specific considerations a recent numerical study suggested that no3 leaching can be reduced when irrigating with low salinity water due not only to reduced leaching but also due to the effect of salinity or lack of on root distribution and water uptake by root russo and kurtzman 2019 while cl no3 interactions played a strong role in the root zone itself they had little effect on no3 mass fluxes to deeper soil depths 4 salinity and nitrate pollution a case study from israel s arava valley nitrogen leaching namely the downward transport of nitrate nitrogen no3 n out of the root zone by water percolating through the soil profile is among the most common forms of groundwater contamination libutti and monteleone 2017 nitrate is highly soluble easily mobile within soil water solution and poorly absorbed on soil particles the detrimental consequences of no3 leaching affecting groundwater quality are much evident in intensive agricultural areas and particularly in arid and semi arid regions no3 pollution occurs when the n supply appreciably exceeds the n requirement yasuor et al 2013 in peppers grown during the winter season in greenhouses in the western negev in israel n concentrations of 102 3 and 158 5 mg l 1 7 3 and 11 3 mmol l 1 in the irrigation solution resulted in 400 and 800 kg ha 1 n respectively being leached below the root zone yasuor et al 2013 at lower n concentration of 56 2 mg l 1 n 4 01 mmol l 1 n was almost completely taken up and used by the pepper plants yasuor et al 2013 the common concentration of n used by farmers in this region is approximately100 mg l 1 n mainly as no3 yasuor et al 2013 it is important to mention that these high n contamination levels occurred under a background of high quality irrigation water desalinated water similar high n loading to the groundwater was reported in the san joaquin valley as a result of fertilization with inorganic nitrogen fertilizers and dairy manure hanak et al 2019 under irrigated conditions where water high in salts is used soil salinity leaching management increases the risk of n losses from the active soil profile and enhances groundwater contamination nitrate leaching and contamination of groundwater are even more problematic when relatively salt sensitive vegetables are irrigated with water containing salts and applied with particularly high leaching factors ben gal et al 2008 the arava valley growing area is in an arid region with annual precipitation of 20 50 mm a year and annual potential et approaching 3000 mm goldreich and karni 2001 the irrigation water in this area comes mainly from brackish groundwater characterized by ec values of 2 5 4 ds m 1 depending on the well location and aquifer characterization due to the low annual rainfall in this area the chief processes that affect groundwater quality are related to human activity mainly crop irrigation in the central and northern parts of the arava valley the main crops are soil grown vegetables in protected cultivation greenhouse and net houses as described above in order to satisfy crop water requirements and to wash the salts from the root zone farmers need to irrigate with high water volumes throughout the growing season july until may vegetable crops are irrigated using drip irrigation and fertilizers are applied via the irrigation system fertigation the high irrigation volumes due to the high lf combined with continuous fertigation have led to the accumulation of salts and fertilizers in the groundwater fig 2 twenty five years of data from wells located in vegetable growing areas in the arava valley demonstrates that intense vegetable production in these areas has led to a rapid increase in groundwater salinity furthermore these salinization processes were accompanied by increases in no3 concentration of the groundwater the ec in 1995 was around 2 ds m 1 in a well located in ein yahav fig 2 and the no3 concentration was close to zero within 10 years the no3 concentration reached 50 mg l 1 0 80 mmol l 1 according the who water with nitrate concentration exceeding 50 mg l 1 is not suitable for human consumption and can cause health problems world health organization 2011 libutti and monteleone 2017 by 2018 the no3 concentration in the groundwater had almost doubled reaching more than 80 mg l 1 1 29 mmol l 1 this demonstrated that local practices led to severe no3 contamination of the aquifer rendering its water unfit for human consumption the high no3 concentrations additionally threaten continued agricultural use of the groundwater as they become a limiting factor to crop developmental stages such as fruit set in pepper h yasuor un published data the salinization and no3 contamination of the arava valley aquifers presented in fig 2 is in agreement with previous research conducted in this region oren et al 2004 shalev et al 2015 these previous studies clearly demonstrate that the major source of no3 contamination is fertilizer n in excess irrigation water nitrate contamination of groundwater is not unique to the environmental conditions of the arava valley increased no3 concentrations have been reported in aquifers in arid and semi arid areas throughout the world over the past several decades as a result of human activity guti√©rrez et al 2018 for example in tunisia a majority of shallow aquifers 50 100 m deep similar to arava valley have high no3 concentrations 67 515 mg l 1 more concerning high concentrations were also detected in deep aquifers re et al 2017 similar reports of groundwater contamination have come out of southeastern spain where aquifers have been found with no3 level as high as 200 400 mg l 1 pulido bosch et al 2018 there the dramatic increase in aquifer no3 concentration is the result of the rapid development of greenhouse horticulture in almer√≠a this region and other intense vegetable production areas are now classified as nitrate vulnerable zones in accordance with the european union directive thompson et al 2007 garcia caparros et al 2017 although no systematic correlation consistently exists between salinization and no3 contamination irrigation of intensive agriculture vegetable crops with saline water is likely to accelerate no3 contamination of aquifers as seen in the arava valley in recent years fig 2 a similar correlation between groundwater salinization and nitrate contamination was detected in california hanak et al 2017 2019 where the process was seen to intensify in dry years and as a function of irrigation with low quality water therefore no3 contamination management practices are urgently needed thompson et al 2020a b 5 management strategies to reduce environmental consequences of irrigation with water high in salts 5 1 irrigation frequency leaching of salts from crop root zone soils may or may not benefit from frequent application of relatively small quantities of water one school of thought holds that the small root volumes and the small root to shoot ratios observed under high frequency irrigation are problematic for salinity management shalhevet 1992 this view considers that a larger deeper root zone would facilitate more efficient leaching and allow longer periods of time to pass before root zone salinity rises to problematic levels meiri and plaut 1985 less frequent irrigation would also lead to lower evaporation losses translating into lower irrigation requirements and slower salt build up shalhevet 1992 intermittent leaching and less frequent irrigation have been promoted by meiri and plaut 1985 caballero et al 2001 and feng et al 2003 with the reasoning that a sufficiently large root zone allows maintenance of upper soil layers that are relatively well leached an intermittent non steady state leaching strategy would then utilize rainfall and would potentially leach more efficiently than constant steady state regimes several field studies support this theory e g hoffman et al 1990 shalhevet 1994 but they may be compromised by the fact that their frequency regimes were reflected in different water application quantities and that they did not utilize the irrigation for fertigation silber 2005 alternatively it has been suggested that increased irrigation frequency maintains a relatively leached zone for root activity with few or no compounding effects due to drying and wetting cycles hillel 2000 hanson and ayars 2002 small frequent irrigations would therefore allow reduced deep percolation regardless of application method hanson and ayars 2002 infrequent regimes present plants with stress due to decreases in both osmotic and matric potential occurring between irrigations frequent regimes would eliminate the matric potential decrease and minimize the osmotic stress hillel 2000 for drip irrigation the low salinity zone around and below drippers promotes high yields while controlling minimizing the lf phene 1986 hillel 2000 a number of studies support this theory assouline et al 2006 reported identical yield and less salt removal when comparing pulsed 10 applications per day to daily irrigation of bell pepper with saline 4 2 ds m 1 water daily irrigation with brackish water lowered average salinity in the soil profile compared to twice weekly irrigation ayars et al 1985 five pulses a day of saline ec 6 2 ds m 1 water was found to overcome the detrimental effects of salinity observed in daily irrigation by pasternak and malach de 1995 these authors measured reduced midday salt concentration in the rhizosphere as a function of increased irrigation frequency dehghanisanij et al 2006 also showed that timing drip irrigation with saline water to match maximum et demand maintained maximum moisture and minimized salinity in the immediate area of the roots dudley et al 2008b investigated the potential for high frequency drip irrigation to minimize drainage using the hydrus 2d numerical model ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 for water flow and solute transport in a sandy loam soil actual salt distribution is dependent on soil type irrigation quantity irrigation salinity root distribution plant uptake irrigation method and drying and wetting cycles associated with frequency regimes mmolawa and or 2000 dudley et al 2008b showed that drip irrigation with three dimensional wetting solute transport and accumulation can essentially reduce salt load in drainage as salts are stored in the upper root zone but beyond the plant s zone of active uptake for the specific case tested by dudley et al 2008b drip methodology and increased frequency of irrigation both reduced drainage water salt load without affecting transpiration the ability to store salts in this way is likely to be temporary because they are liable to be subsequently mobilized by precipitation or management changes 5 2 blending or conjunctive use of multiple sources of water waters from different sources can either be blended or applied separately in a cyclic or sequential manner combining different salinity waters serves to increase the total water supply available for irrigation and to make irrigation more affordable since lower quality waters are often cheaper blending involves combining two or more water sources to reach a targeted salinity for a particular crop the allowable salinity of a blend depends on the salt tolerance of the crop to be irrigated the acceptable level of yield loss soil type climate and the long term management plan for irrigation and crop production grattan et al 2012 minhas 2012 grattan and oster 2003 suggested that if the saline portion of the blend cannot contribute at least 25 of the total volume of water to be irrigated the potential costs and risks of crop damage outweigh the potential benefits of using the low quality water examples of blending have been reported for tomato in egypt and syria malash et al 2002 flowers et al 2005 and sweet bell pepper in israel ben gal et al 2008 2009 these studies reported intermediate yields with blended water that were less than with non saline water and greater than with only brackish water and that leaching of salts and issues of sub soil and groundwater pollution could not be eliminated blending requires infrastructure to mix the water sources either within the water delivery system or by diverting water of different sources into a storage reservoir to consequently be applied to fields different salinity water sources can also be applied one at a time cyclically or sequentially minhas and gupta 1993a 1993b the selection of which water source to apply depends on crop growth stage different water can also be applied to crops in separate fields within a farm or according to seasons in order to minimize crop exposure to salinity at sensitive stages minhas and gupta 1993a 1993b for example since germination and seedling establishment are recognized as sensitive stages in vegetable crops a possible cyclic strategy would be to utilize low salinity waters for pre sowing irrigation and early stages of crop growth and to switch to higher salinity waters at later stages when crop tolerance is expected to be greater rhoades et al 1992 advocated seasonal cyclic irrigation with good quality water applied to salt sensitive crops initial stages of tolerant crops particularly to facilitate leaching of previously accumulated salts studies by minhas and gupta 1993a 1993b and minhas 2012 additionally suggest that cyclical use where better quality water is applied at early stages and the use of salty waters is limited to later stages leads to higher overall water use efficiency more recent numerical modeling studies have suggested that sensor based triggered alternate irrigation of fresh and higher salinity treated wastewater within crop growing seasons can minimize negative effects on crops and reduce loading of deep soils and groundwater by salts and accompanied contaminants for example nitrates russo et al 2015 russo 2016 5 3 approaches to water and salinity management can irrigated arid zone vegetable production be sustainable a variety of strategies have emerged to address the negative phenomena associated with salinization due to irrigation one method is to reduce leaching as discussed and illustrated in fig 1 actual lf is highly sensitive to the self regulating nature of the crop irrigation salinity drainage relationships and calculation of leaching requirements and fractions must consider soil crop and climate combinations in addition to salinity level and take into account the costs to crop production that comes with reduction of lf a second method is to collect and dispose of the leachate drainage collection facilitates field scale salinity management but the collected saline water must be dealt with the consequences of leaching and collecting salts in order to allow irrigation with low quality water are larger than the simple cost and loss of water and movement of the salts themselves sustainable management can utilize drainage water collection systems and disposal schemes to avoid environmental degradation examples include regional interception of saline water before it enters the murray river in victoria and south australia alexander 1990 large scale off and on farm drainage collection in the indus river valley of pakistan aslam and prathapar 2006 and farm scale drainage systems and local containment and treatment of leachate in california where such practices have become more prevalent tanji et al 2002 common to all of these cases is the problem of final disposal of the collected saline leachate the leachate water will contain soluble minerals added as fertilizers and can contain other contaminants which can originate from the agricultural system or be naturally occurring evaporation and water treatment can concentrate them into brines or solids reducing the volume of the waste sea ocean disposal occurs but may not be environmentally sound or sustainable depending on the specific chemical composition of the wastewater and on the way in which the water is distributed to the sea a third and maybe more practical strategy for salinity management is to reduce input of the salts by limiting irrigation with high salinity water sources and providing irrigated agriculture with low salinity options water resource conservation and salinity management issues can both be addressed by salt reduction reduction of water application when conditions are saline is impractical for productive agriculture where maximization of yields is imperative reduction therefore must concern the salts in the irrigation water use of lower salinity water promotes more efficient use of water as a greater percentage of the applied water is directed at plant consumption and less is directed at leaching salts irrigation may also be reduced by increasing plant uptake from shallow groundwater where water tables are sufficiently close to the root zone to permit significant upward flux reducing irrigation in these cases decreases the salt load from the irrigation water but also risks salinization of the root zone by increasing utilization of more saline groundwater an example of repercussion from movement from more to less saline irrigation water is found in the history of large scale use of tww for irrigation together with a move to large scale desalination to provide israel s municipal water supply around a third of all irrigation water in israel is tww until 2007 8 israel s tww was characterized by high salinity with average cl concentration greater than 250 mg l 1 in 2007 israel began the introduction of large seawater desalination plants which by the middle of the following decade would supply approximately half of its municipal water needs the low salinity water provided to cities led to a decrease in salinity of tww in 2006 more than 65 of israel s tww reservoirs had cl concentrations greater than 250 mg l 1 by 2016 only 20 of the reservoirs had such high cl concentrations raveh and ben gal 2016 2018 presented a macro data study of salinity trends in israeli agriculture in which the adoption of desalination had a remarkable effect on remediating irrigation induced salinity and reversing troublesome trends of high and rising salt content in israel s crops and produce policies of providing agriculture with water containing salts and nutrients are not sustainable improved sustainability can be achieved by providing agriculture with good quality water promoting high productivity and thereby low environmental consequences yermiyahu et al 2007 ben gal et al 2009 raveh and ben gal 2018 the strategy to desalinate water prior to distribution and thus have well contained concentrated salt waste and allow greater irrigation efficiency minimal field scale leaching and minimal contamination with nutrients soil contaminants e g selenium b and various agrochemicals is emerging as the preferable alternative to irrigating copiously to leach salts and then finding solutions for drainage water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10462,the cash crop industry has been developed extensively around the world but in some cases high yields are obtained at the expense of large water and fertilizer input although the yield is higher under these practices it may not be a high efficient approach from the perspective of crop quality economical revenue and sustainability in a long term to solve this problem an integrated high efficient irrigation strategy for water saving and quality improving of cash crops wsqi has to be proposed here we review the research frontiers in this field and the findings of our research group aiming to expound wsqi with the following perspectives 1 deficit irrigation under certain conditions and reasonable fertilization can significantly improve the quality of cash crops based on the screening of water nutrient sensitive quality traits comprehensive evaluation methods combining the determination of weight for single quality attributes can be used to evaluate and compare comprehensive fruit quality index 2 statistical models of water yield quality for cash crops were developed that consider the compromise between crop yield and quality the exploration of biophysical models revealed the mechanisms underlying crop quality formation 3 linear non linear dynamic and multi objective programming models can be powerful tools for supporting irrigation decision making while considering crop water yield quality relationships market supply and demand consumer preferences crop price and resource availability the integrated high efficient irrigation strategy proposed in this review would motivate the transition of irrigation strategies from the conventional field irrigation theory to a new chapter of irrigation management for water conservation and quality improvement in cash crops the first one is based on water balance and water yield models while the second one is based on the information of crop water demand and comprehensive consideration of the water yield quality relationship in addition this review will provide a theoretical basis and decision making guidance for research innovation and agricultural production keywords cash crop water deficit comprehensive quality index model decision making 1 introduction in recent decades the development of the cash crop industry has become an expanding global phenomenon which supports rural livelihoods and accelerates economic progress in production areas li et al 2008 su et al 2016 the global cash crop area harvested is more than 11 billion ha and the yield exceeds 1755 million hg ha in 2018 fao stat 2019 china is a major fruit and vegetable producer and consumer orchards covered 11 135 million ha in china in 2017 national bureau of statistics of china 2017 accounting for approximately 8 3 of the country s total cultivated land area statistical bulletin of land mineral and marine resources in china 2017 the total fruit production of china has consistently ranked first in the world since 1994 dou and shao 2018 and the total fruit output in 2018 reached 257 million tons national bureau of statistics of china 2018 although the internal fruit market of china is close to saturated the impact of imported high grade fruit and vegetables is becoming increasingly intense dou and shao 2018 mainly because of the consumers attention to agricultural product quality further many arid and semi arid regions such as the northwest of china are facing water shortages kang et al 2017 however the production of cash crops still depends excessively on large amount of irrigation and fertilization to obtain high yields resulting in relatively high yields but no so as high crop quality and income in some cases du et al 2015 together with massive wastes of water resources and pollution due to excessive fertilization munoz et al 2008 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017b in order to enhance the competitiveness of cash crop production in the market and maintain sustainable development of the regional cash crop industry the key solution is to consider cash crop yield and quality comprehensively aiming to improve crop quality in a high efficient and environment friendly way scientifically based and reasonable water and fertilizer management for cash crops are essential for addressing these practical problems and urgently need to be developed to achieve agricultural sustainable development in recent years the influence of irrigation and fertilization on fruit and vegetable quality has become a hot spot for international research numerous studies have shown that moderate deficit irrigation sustainable deficit irrigation regulated deficit irrigation and alternate partial root zone irrigation may decrease fruit size and yield but can significantly improve fruit quality by for example increasing tss ssc sar vc fn etc the symbols are listed in table 1 bertin and g√©nard 2018 chen et al 2013 favati et al 2009 johnstone et al 2005 patan√® and cosentino 2010 understanding the response patterns of fruits to mild or moderate water deficit and their underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms are the basis for optimizing deficit irrigation management further quantifying the relationship among water yield quality is important for implementing an optimal irrigation strategy that takes into account the balance between yield and quality du and kang 2011 empirical statistical models or mechanistic models based on mathematical equations are effective tools to address this question chen et al 2014 favati et al 2009 studies have attempted to quantitatively describe the dynamics of fruit quality via mechanistic models since the 1990s the water and carbon flux between plants and fruits is the crucial factor affecting fruit quality fishman and g√©nard 1998 established a biophysical model of fruit growth that can simulate the accumulation of water and dry mass in peach fruits liu et al 2007 and dai et al 2009 used this model to simulate the responses of tomato and grape fruit growth to different external environmental conditions and source sink relationships respectively zhu et al 2018 developed a 3d functional structural grapevine model that couples water transport dynamics with gas exchange zhu et al 2019 with regard to the sugar content of the fruit a peach sugar mechanistic model was established and developed by g√©nard et al 2003 this modeling concept was based on the fruit carbon balance and states that the conversion rate of carbon between two metabolites is proportional to the total carbon of the source material currently researches on the impacts of irrigation and fertilization on cash crop quality is mainly focused on the responses of individual quality trait to water and nutrient stress but not to guide sustainable agricultural development through an integrated consideration of crop yield quality and environment few studies have been conducted to quantify the effects of water nutrients on quality to comprehensively assess the relationships among water yield and quality and to optimize regional water resources allocation and irrigation strategy decision making shang and mao 2006 singh 2012 2014 kang 2009 proposed a theoretical framework for improving crop quality and saving irrigation water du and kang 2011 specifically expounded on the physiological biological and engineering basis for this framework and discussed research progress and existing problems in water quality relationship studies the integrated high efficient irrigation strategy for water saving and quality improving in cash crops wsqi proposed in this paper grows from previous deficit irrigation theory and includes the following 1 the effect of different water and nutrient treatments on crop quality is analyzed in a global scope based on that a comprehensive quality index evaluation system is constructed 2 wsqi develops statistical water yield quality models for cash crops studies on biophysical models lay solid foundation for quality modeling 3 irrigation decision making systems in wsqi are improved considering water yield quality relations and widely application has been conducted aiming to realize the sustainable utilization of regional water resources and the goal of water saving high quality and high efficient production in agriculture fig 1 after more than a dozen years work by our research group this scientific framework has been refined and developed this article describes this high efficient irrigation strategy wsqi from the theory to the models and decision making process 2 experiments and analysis of water and nutrient effects on cash crop quality appropriate irrigation and fertilization management can ensure the fruit quality acceptance and market grade of cash crops dorais et al 2001 to explore the effects of different water and nutrient treatments on crop quality many studies have conducted corresponding experiments and analysis as shown in fig 2 in terms of water studies have considered factors such as irrigation amount timing method and technology in terms of nutrients factors such as type amount and method of fertilization have been considered quality traits such as appearance flavour nutrition storage and processing traits are measured as well as the related enzyme activities the studied crops include tomato grape pepper melon jujube etc this study summarizes the impacts of deficit irrigation levels timing technology and fertilization treatments on the quality traits of cash crops as shown in tables 2 5 2 1 water deficit impacts 2 1 1 water deficit intensity studies have shown that reducing the irrigation amount by 20 50 can improve the quality of cash crops without significantly affecting the single fruit weight or volume table 2 mahajan and singh 2006 treeby et al 2007 wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 fig 3 shows how fruit quality fw tss ssc and acid can be affected with the increase of water deficit extent more intuitively water deficit can significantly improve fruit quality such as tss ssc and sar fig 3 favati et al 2009 guizani et al 2019 mahajan and singh 2006 patan√® and cosentino 2010 treeby et al 2007 wang et al 2015 zegbe et al 2003 but the acid content can be reduced guizani et al 2019 wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 or increased favati et al 2009 lopez et al 2010 mahajan and singh 2006 patan√® and cosentino 2010 in different cases fig 3 carotenoid substance and vitamin such as lycopene and vc have also been improved to varying degrees under deficit irrigation favati et al 2009 guizani et al 2019 patan√® and cosentino 2010 wang et al 2015 however there are some contrary results showing that light or moderate water restriction can t lead to increase of fruit quality only sever water restriction can improve fruit quality but together with yield reduction mercier et al 2009 further water deficit may have negative effects on fruit quality zamljen et al 2020 2 1 2 water deficit timing to regulate fruit quality most studies chose to conduct deficit irrigation in the reproductive growth stage rather than the vegetative growth stage table 3 for example studies on tomato have shown that reducing the irrigation amount by 33 3 66 6 in the middle and late stages of fruit development can significantly improve flavour traits such as tss ssc and oa chen et al 2013 2014 and other traits such as total carotenoids phenols and vc coyago cruz et al 2019 gucci et al 2019 jiang et al 2016 kuscu et al 2014 in addition si and fn can be affected when the water deficit occurs in the fruit setting stage these traits would influence consumers behavior coyago cruz et al 2019 zheng et al 2016 cui et al 2008 found that water deficit during the fruit growth stage can improve the flavour and nutritional quality of jujube while reducing the proportion of rotten fruit and improving the quality of fruit storage and transportation further regulated deficit irrigation could also improve fruit growth in some case due to better water utilization higher uptake and use efficiency of nutrient and excellent soil water air relationship with higher oxygen concentration in the root zone mahajan and singh 2006 besides the water deficit during the stage of vegetative growth could inhibit the growth of vegetative organs facilitate the transfer of carbohydrates to fruits promoting fruit growth and yield consoli et al 2017 gucci et al 2019 2 1 3 irrigation technology with the development of irrigation technology and the modernization of irrigation concepts many studies have emerged in recent decades that focus on the impact of different irrigation technologies or irrigation methods on the quality of cash crops table 4 among them alternate partial root zone irrigation is widely used in china kang and cai 2002 in this method irrigation is applied alternatively to different parts of the root zone keeping some parts dry and the remaining parts wet studies of tomato found that alternate partial root zone irrigation can significantly increase fruit tss ssc and sar consoli et al 2017 zegbe et al 2003 zhang et al 2014a b and obtain more vivid fruits bogale et al 2016 romero et al 2015 zegbe et al 2003 in studies on grape it was found alternate partial root zone irrigation drip irrigation furrow irrigation not only increased the fruit fresh weight by 2 28 but also significantly increased the fruit vc 15 42 and the percentage of edible fruit 3 7 while reducing irrigation water use by 33 3 50 du et al 2008 du et al 2013 however there are some studies showing that partial root zone irrigation can not bring significant improvement on grape fruit tss and acid content romero et al 2015 but some other traits such as total phenolic anthocyanin and amino acid concentrations can be enhanced bogale et al 2016 romero et al 2015 in addition compared with traditional surface irrigation drip irrigation and side seam drip irrigation can also reduce water usage by 50 64 while increasing ssc and vc in cash crops such as jujube and lettuce ren et al 2012 xu et al 2017 compared to drip irrigation sub irrigation can improve zucchini sugar contents and carbohydrate accumulation which are due to the super optimal electrical conductivity recorded on sub irrigation plants rouphael and colla 2005 2 2 mechanisms of water deficit impacts the improvement in cash crop quality due to water deficit can be ascribed to the modulation of the underlying physiological mechanisms of the plant from the following four perspectives 1 many studies hold the view that under water deficit conditions the reduction of water flux into the fruit decreases fruit volume ranƒçiƒá et al 2010 and increases the concentration of carbohydrates and related quality traits in fruit ho et al 1987 hou et al 2020 zhang et al 2017a 2 water deficit regulates the distribution of photosynthetic assimilates by reducing vegetative growth and increasing the vigor of the fruit as a sink therefore the carbohydrates that would normally be allocated to side branches are transferred to the fruit which increases the accumulation of assimilates in the fruit davies et al 2000 patan√® and cosentino 2010 3 moderate deficit irrigation increases the starch accumulation in the early fruit development stage so a larger proportion of starch will be converted to sugar during the fruit ripening stage thereby improving fruit quality zegbe et al 2003 in addition vegetative reproduction is reduced and plant light transmittance is increased which is beneficial to fruit colour and the corresponding nutrient element synthesis b√©nard et al 2009 4 under water stress plants will up regulate the expression of mrna related to glucose metabolism and increase the contents of abscisic acid aba ethylene and other substances deluc et al 2007 these substances are related to the initiation and promotion of fruit maturity zaharah et al 2013 can regulate the activities of carbohydrate and vacuolar metabolic enzymes and play an important role in regulating the sugar concentration in fruits deluc et al 2009 downie et al 2003 johnston et al 2009 therefore water deficit at fruit ripening stage triggers significant taste and nutritional quality improvements chen et al 2013 2014 through the abovementioned physiological material transformation and signal regulation effects crop quality traits can be improved under water deficit 2 3 fertilization impacts there is some controversy about the effects of fertilization on the quality of cash crops according to table 5 compared with non or very low fertilization treatments fertilization application can increase the tss ssc and vc content of cash crops such as tomato water melon and blueberry and increase sar jiang et al 2009 khayyat et al 2012 wang et al 2007a b yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 since nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus potassium and zinc are essential for crop growth and fruit development further in the study of pineapple it was found that soil application of potassium can decrease internal browning since it would lower polyphenoloxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase activities soares et al 2005 however some studies have shown that reducing the amount of fertilization by 25 50 based on the local recommended fertilization level can effectively increase fruit quality such as fruit firmness vc and ssc in tomato apple and hot pepper b√©nard et al 2009 li et al 2011 raese et al 2007 xiang et al 2018 taking nitrogen n application as an example different conclusions have been drawn from many studies on the effects of n application on crop quality these differences may have been caused by the different experimental conditions and the inconsistent sink source ratio of plants b√©nard et al 2009 when a plant is relatively small n deficit will seriously affect its vegetative growth fruit carbon input and metabolism and will adversely affect quality formation in its later stages moderate n application at a proper stage can promote root zone development crop growth and dry matter accumulation thereby improving fruit quality huett and dettmann 1988 flores et al 2003 kuscu et al 2014 however excessive n application which is a common phenomenon worldwide munoz et al 2008 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017b might have a disadvantageous effect on crop quality wei et al 2018 noted that a lack of n fertilizer can reduce vegetative growth in the leaf canopy increase fruit received radiation and temperature and cause changes in fruit secondary metabolism these processes promote the synthesis and decomposition of assimilates in fruits which in turn increases the contents of tss ssc and oa in fruits b√©nard et al 2009 wang et al 2007a 2 4 screening for sensitive qualities table 2 5 show that some crop qualities are not sensitive to water or nutrient treatment in the wsqi high efficient strategy proposed in this article water and nutrient sensitive quality traits are screened based on the above analysis fig 2 which lays a foundation for the comprehensive fruit quality analysis and the following strategy decision making progress wang 2011 carried out a sensitivity analysis to identify the responses of individual quality to water deficit and screened out the water sensitive quality of tomato as well as the growth stages of fruit in which fruit quality is water sensitive the sensitivity calculation formula is as follows 1 s j 1 m k 1 m Œ¥ q k Œ¥ e t k j 1 2 n where sj is the sensitivity coefficient of trait j m is the number of water treatments n is the number of quality traits Œ¥ q k is the normalized variation in a single quality trait between two water treatments when the quality variation between the two treatments is not significant Œ¥ q k 0 and Œ¥ e t k is the normalized variation in crop evapotranspiration between the two water treatments sensitivity analysis can screen water sensitive quality traits for specific crop genotype and also water stress timing in a study of water stress on grape berry quality ssc and ta were very sensitive to water stress following by tannin but anthocyanin was not sensitive in this case chen 2010 in a study of tomato fruit chen 2009 pointed that fw pr and ssc were sensitive to water stress during fruit ripening tss and fn were sensitive to water stress during fruit setting and ripening vc was sensitive to water stress in all stages however wei 2018 showed that fruit quality was more sensitive to water stress during fruit color changing stage and was more sensitive under irrigation method of adi than cfi results in cui 2009 showed that water stress improved jujube fruit quality during fruit expanding and ripening stages but the sensitive period of field and greenhouse experiments was slightly different since rainfall is ignorable in greenhouse but not in field case numerous studies on fruit quality highlight the variable responses of plants to water and nutrient treatments due to their different experiment locations crop species genotypes etc besides the water quality such as salt content of the irrigation water may influence plant growth and fruit quality yang et al 2019 reviews by bertin and g√©nard 2018 and by ripoll et al 2014 also emphasized the complexity of quality traits underling mechanisms it is difficult to predict the specific responses of quality traits to different water and nutrient stresses therefore based on the selection of water and nutrient sensitive quality traits further evaluation for comprehensive quality index should be performed to reflect farmers comprehensive consideration of cash crop quality and provide clearer guidance for agricultural irrigation and fertilization management 3 comprehensive quality index evaluation for cash crops the concept of quality in fruits and vegetables is comprehensive it not only includes objective quantifiable traits such as sugar acid and vitamin contents but also involves subjective traits such as taste and other fuzzy indicators such as fruit shape index si and size which might influence consumer preference therefore it is difficult for a single quality indicator to accurately represent the comprehensive quality of cash crops in order to meet the quality expectations for agricultural products from different consumers using scientific methods to develop a comprehensive quality index will be an important breakthrough in the study of water quality response relationships in wsqi strategy comprehensive evaluation methods have been introduced into the evaluation of comprehensive fruit quality index the evaluation process includes two main steps the determination of weights for individual quality attributes and the calculation of a comprehensive quality rank using the evaluation methods 3 1 weight determination and comprehensive evaluation methods first for the determination of the weights of individual quality attributes the commonly used methods can be divided into two categories subjective valuation methods and objective valuation methods subjective valuation methods include the expert survey method the analytic hierarchy process ahp saaty 1980 and the fuzzy statistical method objective valuation methods include the standard deviation method principal component analysis pca the entropy weight method and the critic method etc wang et al 2011b among these ahp is a multi criteria decision making method that addresses how to determine the relative importance of a set of factors in wsqi strategy wang et al 2011b introduced this method to evaluated tomato fruit comprehensive quality the evaluation hierarchy can be divided into three levels fig 4 the objective level on the top is the determination of the comprehensive quality q of tomato the criteria indicating quality are in the middle level and the individual quality attributes are located at the lowest level in their study 1000 customers and 25 horticultural experts participated in the comparisons for the criteria and attribute levels respectively after the weights are determined multiple traits are integrated into a comprehensive quality index for evaluation and ranking commonly used comprehensive evaluation methods include pca lan et al 2014 technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis hwang and yoon 1981 the grey relational analysis method gra lu et al 2009 the aggregative index method and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method etc wang et al 2011b topsis is a classical method for multiple attribute decision making by defining the positive and negative ideal solutions alternatives can be ranked in topsis based on their relative similarity to the positive ideal solution since there are many traits in multiple attribute decision making information from observations might overlap due to traits correlation the gra method is a powerful tool analyzing processes with multiple performance characteristics lu et al 2009 pca is a useful method for feature extraction and data reduction that can accurately identify the sources of variance after reducing the dimensionality of data lu et al 2009 lan et al 2014 3 2 applications of comprehensive quality evaluations table 6 lists our team studies on the evaluation of cash crops comprehensive quality in china under different agronomic treatments and the quality traits which were taking into account wang et al 2011a used pca to evaluate the comprehensive quality of tomato the ratio of the actual product output to the total yield of each harvest was assumed as the weight in the pca evaluation process further they used this method to evaluate tomato comprehensive quality performance under different irrigation treatments wang et al 2011b validated the effectiveness of the tomato comprehensive quality index established by ahp and topsis and recorded the responses of the tomato comprehensive quality index to different irrigation management treatments chen 2009 found that the comprehensive quality of tomato fruit decreased with increasing irrigation using ahp and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation in the study of wang et al 2015 after the determination of the weights of individual quality traits with ahp the comprehensive quality of tomato fruit under different irrigation and n conditions was assessed using gra and pca furthermore the treatment with the best comprehensive quality ranking was the same under both evaluation methods considering the relationship between yield and quality they suggested an optimal regime irrigated at 63 of et0 and n fertilization at the typical level for local agronomic practices 574 35 kg ha 1 in spring summer season and 272 85 kg ha 1 in winter spring season wei et al 2018 found via pca that under high n conditions and elevated co2 conditions deficit irrigation especially alternate partial root zone irrigation can significantly improve the comprehensive quality of tomato the above summary shows that by screening for an individual fruit quality of interest researchers can conduct evaluation for cash crops comprehensive quality under different agronomic treatments this evaluation process provides a certain theoretical basis and some methodological guidance for wsqi 4 statistical models of water yield quality relationships studies have shown that the improvement in cash crop quality caused by water deficit is often accompanied by a decline in yield bertin and g√©nard 2018 chen et al 2013 cui et al 2008 favati et al 2009 patan√® et al 2011 yang et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 in addition the effects of deficit irrigation on crop yield and quality are closely related to the timing and extent of the water deficit occurrence du et al 2008 johnstone et al 2005 patan√® and cosentino 2010 wang et al 2015 and depend on the crops dai et al 2010 yang et al 2017 therefore acceptable yield and high quality in cash crops may be possible if the intensity and timing of water deficit are proper to balance crop yield and fruit quality that is to improve fruit quality while ensuring yield some studies explored the correlation of cash crop yield and quality with water supply during the full or parts of the growth stages different degrees of deficit irrigation were set to obtain an optimal irrigation strategy for processing tomato production favati et al 2009 many studies were performed aiming to explore the water yield relations and built several water yield models jensen 1968 minhas et al 1974 stewart et al 2016 unfortunately there are currently few developed models for evaluating water quality relationship in wsqi strategy water quality models were developed through the adaptation from the water yield models and they were calibrated and validated with 4 years of experimental data 4 1 water yield statistical models water yield models i e crop water production functions are mathematical models that describe the quantitative relationships of crop yield to water consumption during the whole growing season or at some specific growth stages they include the effects of the timing and intensity of water deficit chen et al 2014 rao et al 1988 these models can be roughly divided into two categories one is additive models which add the effect of the phase effect on the final relative crop yield such as models proposed by blank 1975 stewart et al 2016 and singh et al 1987 another is multiplicative water yield models which use multiplicative ways to describe the effect of the relative water consumption or the stage water deficit on the final relative crop yield typical examples of multiplicative models are the models by jensen 1968 minhas et al 1974 and rao 1974 in wsqi strategy chen et al 2014 estimated the parameters of water yield models stewart jensen minhas based on four year greenhouse deficit irrigation experiment data and then compared the performance of each model the minhas model was recommended for simulating the greenhouse tomato water yield relationship with an rmse of 0 031 r2 of 0 94 and a modeling efficiency of 0 90 4 2 water quality statistical models compared to the numerous studies on the water yield relationship there is a knowledge gap in water quality models for evaluating the effects of different degrees of water deficit at various growth stages on crop quality in wsqi strategy after analyzing the relationships between quality traits and the relative water consumption and the relative water deficit degree at each growth stage six water quality models additive multiplicative exponential q singn q minhas q rao were developed adapted from water yield models to simulate the relationships of tomato fruit quality with water deficit at various growth stages chen et al 2014 multiplicative model was recommended for simulating the relationships of fruit quality such as tss rs sar and fn with water deficit at various growth stages with rmse values in the range of 0 037 0 054 and r2 values in the range of 0 63 0 88 meanwhile additive model was recommended for simulating the effects of water deficit at different stages on tomato fruit quality such as oa vc ci and comprehensive quality index with rmse values in the range of 0 027 0 065 and r2 values in the range of 0 64 0 90 in the study of shan et al 2019 a comparison was conducted among additive multiplicative and exponential models simulating the relationship between water and comprehensive quality index of greenhouse tomato among them the additive model performed best with an r2 of 0 91 and tomato comprehensive quality was the most sensitive to water deficit at the fruit ripening stage although current statistical models can reach a certain degree of prediction accuracy they cannot explain the underlying mechanisms of the relationships among crop yield quality and water consumption in depth research is needed to further reveal the mechanisms of the quality response to water nutrient in terms of gas exchange water nutrient absorption assimilate accumulation and distribution and source sink relations between plants and fruits more physiological models of the crop water yield quality relationship need to be explored in addition to empirical and semi empirical models 5 primary exploration of models related to fruit quality in the 1990s studies attempted to quantitatively describe crop quality characteristics through process based models fishman and g√©nard 1998 g√©nard and huguet 1996 biophysical dynamic growth models and semi mechanism sugar models were developed to simulate fruit growth and sugar accumulation responses to genetic variability environmental fluctuations and agronomic management combining biophysical and physiological processes via mathematical framework these models provide a prospective way to designe innovative horticultural practices facing the challenge of water shortage and future climate changing beauvoit et al 2018 bertin et al 2006 fishman and g√©nard 1998 g√©nard et al 2007 rahmati et al 2018 struik et al 2005 5 1 process based models related to fruit quality lescourret and g√©nard 2005 proposed the virtual fruit model applied to peach fruits this model reorganized and integrated three process based models they had previously proposed which respectively described the fruit growth of dry mass lescourret et al 1998 fresh mass fishman and g√©nard 1998 and the accumulation of sugar in the flesh sugar model g√©nard et al 2003 the integrated model is an important breakthrough for understanding the response of fruit quality traits to environmental fluctuations at the plants and fruits scales and this progress has promoted further research perspectives in quality trait modeling in the carbon sub model simulation of dry mass it calculates leaf carbon assimilation fruit carbon assimilation carbon coordination of other storage organs so as to define the carbon allocation and the dry mass of fruits lescourret et al 1998 in the sugar sub model sugar model the main principle is carbon balance and the conversion rate of carbon between two compounds is proportional to the total carbon of the source material g√©nard et al 2003 in the water sub model fruit is virtualized into a big cell connecting with the plant through phloem and xylem vessels water enters the fruit from xylem and phloem and is lost through transpiration sugar is unloaded from phloem through active transport mass flow and passive diffusion bertin et al 2006 fishman and g√©nard 1998 the model has proven to be quite robust and generic and been applied on many species e g grape blueberry tomato pear to simulate fruit sugars dynamics under different genotypes water conditions and fruit loadings dai et al 2009 jorquera fontena et al 2017 liu et al 2007 prudent et al 2011 quilot et al 2004 an integrated view of plant functioning is essiencial to predict fruit growth and composition since the plant is the main source of water carbohydrates and minerals for the fruit functional structural models explicitly descibe the architecture of the plant and formalize the processes of decelopment growth acquisition and allocation of rescources carbon and water at the level of organ qualitree a virtual fruit tree model is one of the functional structural models linking fruit and plant growth of peach lescourret et al 2011 mir√°s avalos et al 2011 and was applied to simulate peach fruit quality and size under changing water stress degree mir√°s avalos et al 2013 qualitree model allows to disentangle the effects of water stresses on carbon aqauision vegetative growth and fruit quality of peach rahmati et al 2018 another functional structural model was developed for tomato baldazzi et al 2013 which can estimate the resource acquisition transpiration carbonhydrate laoding and leakage along the phloem pathway and transfer within the plant such formalization enables to simulate the within plant variability of water and carbonhydrate further leaf gas exchenge was also coupled with the dynamics of water transport to simulate grape fruit growth and quality under different climate scenarios zhu et al 2018 2019 5 2 tom sugar model based on the sugar metabolisms and feedback loops of tomato fruits in wsqi chen et al 2020 adapted the sugar model g√©nard et al 2003 and established a tomato fruit sugar mechanism model tom sugar model in tom sugar carbon supply is mainly the sucrose unloaded from the phloem and carbon is depleted by respiration the carbon is divided into three pools soluble sugars starch and the other carbon compounds like organic acids amino acids proteins cell wall compounds etc starch as a transient reserve pool interconverts with the soluble sugars the soluble sugars provide the raw material for the biosynthesis of the other carbon compounds the metabolic activities involved in carbohydrate metabolism were reflected by the reaction rates k values which regulate the carbon fluxes among the pools fruit water content was introduced to modify the sugar metabolism related reaction rates in the model assuming that fruit water content imposes an influence on carbohydrate metabolism in fruit the model better simulated the dynamics of carbohydrate accumulation in the tomato fruit growing under different conditions by considering the influence of fruit water content on sugar metabolism further chen 2016 coupled fruit sugar and fruit growth model soluble sugar content simulated from tom sugar model was used to be the input of tomato fruit growth model the coupled model was applied to simulate tomato fruit growth and sugar dynamics under different water conditions which showed good fittings however this type of model also has certain limitations first the model involves many physiological and biochemical parameters which can not be directly obtained and validated through experiments thus a large amount of input data is required for parameter calibration which increases the threshold for model application besides although the rationality of parameters variation was analyzed in their studies the self correlation between parameters made the calibration process quite difficult further more attention can be paid to simulate some other important fruit compounds such as antioxidants and vitamins and influencing factors can be included as model variables such as fertilization or atmospheric co2 concentration 6 decision making methods of irrigation and applications in the conventional theory of deficit irrigation the optimal irrigation schedule is set based on water balance and water production functions with the maximization of yield or the minimization of economic losses as the objective function shang and mao 2006 shangguan et al 2002 singh 2012 2014 this kind of optimization method which only aims to maximize yield or regards income as only related to production yield is not suitable for cash crops since stress in certain stages can increase marketable produce performance by improving or keeping crop quality carvalho et al 2014 pardo et al 2020 in the new high efficient irrigation strategy for wsqi of cash crops irrigation decisions should be supportted by comprehensive consideration of the relationships between water yield and water quality through methods such as linear non linear programming dynamic programming genetic algorithms and multi objective programming singh 2012 2014 or some improved methods based on those programmings brown et al 2010 paul et al 2000 vedula and kumar 1996 yang et al 2009 to allocate limited agricultual irrigation water resource while maintaining high yields improving quality and increasing high efficiency fig 5 6 1 decision making methods of irrigation in wsqi non linear programming is one of the most commonly used methods for the optimization of irrigation schedules in non linear programming first the objective function needs to be determined for example maximizing farmers income second the effect of water fertilization management on the income to be maximized is determined through water yield water quality or quality price functions further economical aspect is also invoved in wsqi the relatoinship of price to crop quality and the relationship between fruit price and fruit quality varied with economic and social development to consider the different economic conditions in different regions a flexible price coefficient was used to determine the quantitative relations between crop price and its quality chen 2016 then the economic revenue was obtained by multiplying the crop yield and the quality related price the optimal irrigation strategies were designed by maximizing the economic revenue through linear nonlinear programming methods chen 2016 shan et al 2019 in addition constraints can be set according to the local available water resources soil water status upper and lower irrigation limits and the optimization can be performed for different scenarios in linear non linear and dynamic programming models there is usually only one objective function in wsqi strategy the optimization of water fertilization management considers crop yield quality and final income multiple conflicting targets are involved with multiple constraints the multi objective programming model is an effective tool for addressing this situation ghahraman and sepaskhah 2002 lachhwani 2012 liu et al 2019 singh 2012 zeng et al 2010 in the studies of wsqi the optimal irrigation schedule for greenhouse tomato water saving and quality improvement was determined to be 100 of et0 at the seedling stage 90 of et0 at the fruit setting stage and 63 of et0 at the fruit ripening stage chen 2009 theses levels were determined based on the crop water production and water quality functions and the production practice through dynamic programming with the goal of maximizing the total economic benefit in a non linear case of chen 2016 compared with full irrigation although the optimized irrigation schedule reduced the yield by 10 the comprehensive fruit quality index and income increased by 14 0 and 11 7 respectively with an irrigation water savings of 26 9 in a multi objective programming model that comprehensively considers tomato yield and fruit quality traits chen 2016 the minimum deviation between the actual value of each optimization target and the target value for each is set as the objective function based on the priority for each objectives a sequential algorithm is used to solve the multi objective programming further this study obtained the optimal irrigation amount and the corresponding optimal relative yield relative quality traits and comprehensive quality index under different scenarios agricultural production decision makers with the help of the new proposed high efficient irrigation strategy can determine optimal irrigation schedules based on market supply and demand consumer preferences for various quality traits fruit prices available irrigation water resources and future water prices with the expected goals and the definition of priority levels for cash crop yield quality and irrigation amount multi objective programming can be a powerful tool for optimizing irrigation schedules and achieving customized and diversified irrigation management 6 2 cultural practices high efficient production technology modes for saving water and improving the quality of cash crops have been widely promoted and applied in china given the paritcular climatic conditions of the early frost stage in the arid inland river basins of northwesr china and the requirements for improving crop quality we propose a joint irrigation control technology for field grown cash crops reasonably delaying early irrigation optimally allocating limited water and appropriately advancing the end of irrigation can promote root growth control redundancies creat a stimulus compensation effect and improve fruit quality with an irrigation water savings of 20 this result has been demonstrated in gansu shaanxi shanxi xinjiang and other provinces based on the water quality yield relationships in greenhouse tomato a high efficient mode of less irrigation at the seedlings moderate irrigation at flowering no irrigation at harvesting was developed this method maintained tomato yields at 181 01 t ha and 280 12 t ha in two seasons no significant reduction saved 12 40 and 7 53 respectively of water consumption and improved the tomato quality traits such as ssc and vc wang 2011 research findings of high efficient irrigation strategy for cash crops have been widely used in greenhouses and orchards in the shiyang river basin gansu province more than 2500 government staff in charge of agriculture forestry and technology promotion from cities to villages participated in the training and demonstrations of this strategy at the wuwei experimental station these events are essential in guiding local farmers to perform scientific agricultural water and fertilizer management and promoting the sustainable development of the cash crop industry 7 conclusion to improve the current situation of cash crop industry combining the findings of international research frontiers and our team research results in recent decades this article proposed the integrated high efficient irrigation strategy for water saving and quality improving of cash crops wsqi based on the analysis of the effects of different water and nutrient treatments on the quality of cash crops water and nutrient sensitive quality traits were screened the comprehensive evaluation method was used to scientifically evaluate the comprehensive quality of cash crops and then to build statistical models of water yield quality for cash crops combined with biophysical models quantitative simulations of key crop qualities were conducted which offers more information of quality formation mechanisms with all the above analysis and simulation irrigation decision making can proceed considering crop water yield quality relationships to achieve the sustainable use of regional water resources and high efficient agricultural production this research has helped the conventional agricultural irrigation strategy based on water balance and crop water yield functions to move forward to high efficient irrigation strategy aiming for water saving and quality improving in cash crops this development has important scientific and practical significance for promoting the sustainable development of the regional economy declaration of competing interest the authors

10462,the cash crop industry has been developed extensively around the world but in some cases high yields are obtained at the expense of large water and fertilizer input although the yield is higher under these practices it may not be a high efficient approach from the perspective of crop quality economical revenue and sustainability in a long term to solve this problem an integrated high efficient irrigation strategy for water saving and quality improving of cash crops wsqi has to be proposed here we review the research frontiers in this field and the findings of our research group aiming to expound wsqi with the following perspectives 1 deficit irrigation under certain conditions and reasonable fertilization can significantly improve the quality of cash crops based on the screening of water nutrient sensitive quality traits comprehensive evaluation methods combining the determination of weight for single quality attributes can be used to evaluate and compare comprehensive fruit quality index 2 statistical models of water yield quality for cash crops were developed that consider the compromise between crop yield and quality the exploration of biophysical models revealed the mechanisms underlying crop quality formation 3 linear non linear dynamic and multi objective programming models can be powerful tools for supporting irrigation decision making while considering crop water yield quality relationships market supply and demand consumer preferences crop price and resource availability the integrated high efficient irrigation strategy proposed in this review would motivate the transition of irrigation strategies from the conventional field irrigation theory to a new chapter of irrigation management for water conservation and quality improvement in cash crops the first one is based on water balance and water yield models while the second one is based on the information of crop water demand and comprehensive consideration of the water yield quality relationship in addition this review will provide a theoretical basis and decision making guidance for research innovation and agricultural production keywords cash crop water deficit comprehensive quality index model decision making 1 introduction in recent decades the development of the cash crop industry has become an expanding global phenomenon which supports rural livelihoods and accelerates economic progress in production areas li et al 2008 su et al 2016 the global cash crop area harvested is more than 11 billion ha and the yield exceeds 1755 million hg ha in 2018 fao stat 2019 china is a major fruit and vegetable producer and consumer orchards covered 11 135 million ha in china in 2017 national bureau of statistics of china 2017 accounting for approximately 8 3 of the country s total cultivated land area statistical bulletin of land mineral and marine resources in china 2017 the total fruit production of china has consistently ranked first in the world since 1994 dou and shao 2018 and the total fruit output in 2018 reached 257 million tons national bureau of statistics of china 2018 although the internal fruit market of china is close to saturated the impact of imported high grade fruit and vegetables is becoming increasingly intense dou and shao 2018 mainly because of the consumers attention to agricultural product quality further many arid and semi arid regions such as the northwest of china are facing water shortages kang et al 2017 however the production of cash crops still depends excessively on large amount of irrigation and fertilization to obtain high yields resulting in relatively high yields but no so as high crop quality and income in some cases du et al 2015 together with massive wastes of water resources and pollution due to excessive fertilization munoz et al 2008 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017b in order to enhance the competitiveness of cash crop production in the market and maintain sustainable development of the regional cash crop industry the key solution is to consider cash crop yield and quality comprehensively aiming to improve crop quality in a high efficient and environment friendly way scientifically based and reasonable water and fertilizer management for cash crops are essential for addressing these practical problems and urgently need to be developed to achieve agricultural sustainable development in recent years the influence of irrigation and fertilization on fruit and vegetable quality has become a hot spot for international research numerous studies have shown that moderate deficit irrigation sustainable deficit irrigation regulated deficit irrigation and alternate partial root zone irrigation may decrease fruit size and yield but can significantly improve fruit quality by for example increasing tss ssc sar vc fn etc the symbols are listed in table 1 bertin and g√©nard 2018 chen et al 2013 favati et al 2009 johnstone et al 2005 patan√® and cosentino 2010 understanding the response patterns of fruits to mild or moderate water deficit and their underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms are the basis for optimizing deficit irrigation management further quantifying the relationship among water yield quality is important for implementing an optimal irrigation strategy that takes into account the balance between yield and quality du and kang 2011 empirical statistical models or mechanistic models based on mathematical equations are effective tools to address this question chen et al 2014 favati et al 2009 studies have attempted to quantitatively describe the dynamics of fruit quality via mechanistic models since the 1990s the water and carbon flux between plants and fruits is the crucial factor affecting fruit quality fishman and g√©nard 1998 established a biophysical model of fruit growth that can simulate the accumulation of water and dry mass in peach fruits liu et al 2007 and dai et al 2009 used this model to simulate the responses of tomato and grape fruit growth to different external environmental conditions and source sink relationships respectively zhu et al 2018 developed a 3d functional structural grapevine model that couples water transport dynamics with gas exchange zhu et al 2019 with regard to the sugar content of the fruit a peach sugar mechanistic model was established and developed by g√©nard et al 2003 this modeling concept was based on the fruit carbon balance and states that the conversion rate of carbon between two metabolites is proportional to the total carbon of the source material currently researches on the impacts of irrigation and fertilization on cash crop quality is mainly focused on the responses of individual quality trait to water and nutrient stress but not to guide sustainable agricultural development through an integrated consideration of crop yield quality and environment few studies have been conducted to quantify the effects of water nutrients on quality to comprehensively assess the relationships among water yield and quality and to optimize regional water resources allocation and irrigation strategy decision making shang and mao 2006 singh 2012 2014 kang 2009 proposed a theoretical framework for improving crop quality and saving irrigation water du and kang 2011 specifically expounded on the physiological biological and engineering basis for this framework and discussed research progress and existing problems in water quality relationship studies the integrated high efficient irrigation strategy for water saving and quality improving in cash crops wsqi proposed in this paper grows from previous deficit irrigation theory and includes the following 1 the effect of different water and nutrient treatments on crop quality is analyzed in a global scope based on that a comprehensive quality index evaluation system is constructed 2 wsqi develops statistical water yield quality models for cash crops studies on biophysical models lay solid foundation for quality modeling 3 irrigation decision making systems in wsqi are improved considering water yield quality relations and widely application has been conducted aiming to realize the sustainable utilization of regional water resources and the goal of water saving high quality and high efficient production in agriculture fig 1 after more than a dozen years work by our research group this scientific framework has been refined and developed this article describes this high efficient irrigation strategy wsqi from the theory to the models and decision making process 2 experiments and analysis of water and nutrient effects on cash crop quality appropriate irrigation and fertilization management can ensure the fruit quality acceptance and market grade of cash crops dorais et al 2001 to explore the effects of different water and nutrient treatments on crop quality many studies have conducted corresponding experiments and analysis as shown in fig 2 in terms of water studies have considered factors such as irrigation amount timing method and technology in terms of nutrients factors such as type amount and method of fertilization have been considered quality traits such as appearance flavour nutrition storage and processing traits are measured as well as the related enzyme activities the studied crops include tomato grape pepper melon jujube etc this study summarizes the impacts of deficit irrigation levels timing technology and fertilization treatments on the quality traits of cash crops as shown in tables 2 5 2 1 water deficit impacts 2 1 1 water deficit intensity studies have shown that reducing the irrigation amount by 20 50 can improve the quality of cash crops without significantly affecting the single fruit weight or volume table 2 mahajan and singh 2006 treeby et al 2007 wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 fig 3 shows how fruit quality fw tss ssc and acid can be affected with the increase of water deficit extent more intuitively water deficit can significantly improve fruit quality such as tss ssc and sar fig 3 favati et al 2009 guizani et al 2019 mahajan and singh 2006 patan√® and cosentino 2010 treeby et al 2007 wang et al 2015 zegbe et al 2003 but the acid content can be reduced guizani et al 2019 wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 or increased favati et al 2009 lopez et al 2010 mahajan and singh 2006 patan√® and cosentino 2010 in different cases fig 3 carotenoid substance and vitamin such as lycopene and vc have also been improved to varying degrees under deficit irrigation favati et al 2009 guizani et al 2019 patan√® and cosentino 2010 wang et al 2015 however there are some contrary results showing that light or moderate water restriction can t lead to increase of fruit quality only sever water restriction can improve fruit quality but together with yield reduction mercier et al 2009 further water deficit may have negative effects on fruit quality zamljen et al 2020 2 1 2 water deficit timing to regulate fruit quality most studies chose to conduct deficit irrigation in the reproductive growth stage rather than the vegetative growth stage table 3 for example studies on tomato have shown that reducing the irrigation amount by 33 3 66 6 in the middle and late stages of fruit development can significantly improve flavour traits such as tss ssc and oa chen et al 2013 2014 and other traits such as total carotenoids phenols and vc coyago cruz et al 2019 gucci et al 2019 jiang et al 2016 kuscu et al 2014 in addition si and fn can be affected when the water deficit occurs in the fruit setting stage these traits would influence consumers behavior coyago cruz et al 2019 zheng et al 2016 cui et al 2008 found that water deficit during the fruit growth stage can improve the flavour and nutritional quality of jujube while reducing the proportion of rotten fruit and improving the quality of fruit storage and transportation further regulated deficit irrigation could also improve fruit growth in some case due to better water utilization higher uptake and use efficiency of nutrient and excellent soil water air relationship with higher oxygen concentration in the root zone mahajan and singh 2006 besides the water deficit during the stage of vegetative growth could inhibit the growth of vegetative organs facilitate the transfer of carbohydrates to fruits promoting fruit growth and yield consoli et al 2017 gucci et al 2019 2 1 3 irrigation technology with the development of irrigation technology and the modernization of irrigation concepts many studies have emerged in recent decades that focus on the impact of different irrigation technologies or irrigation methods on the quality of cash crops table 4 among them alternate partial root zone irrigation is widely used in china kang and cai 2002 in this method irrigation is applied alternatively to different parts of the root zone keeping some parts dry and the remaining parts wet studies of tomato found that alternate partial root zone irrigation can significantly increase fruit tss ssc and sar consoli et al 2017 zegbe et al 2003 zhang et al 2014a b and obtain more vivid fruits bogale et al 2016 romero et al 2015 zegbe et al 2003 in studies on grape it was found alternate partial root zone irrigation drip irrigation furrow irrigation not only increased the fruit fresh weight by 2 28 but also significantly increased the fruit vc 15 42 and the percentage of edible fruit 3 7 while reducing irrigation water use by 33 3 50 du et al 2008 du et al 2013 however there are some studies showing that partial root zone irrigation can not bring significant improvement on grape fruit tss and acid content romero et al 2015 but some other traits such as total phenolic anthocyanin and amino acid concentrations can be enhanced bogale et al 2016 romero et al 2015 in addition compared with traditional surface irrigation drip irrigation and side seam drip irrigation can also reduce water usage by 50 64 while increasing ssc and vc in cash crops such as jujube and lettuce ren et al 2012 xu et al 2017 compared to drip irrigation sub irrigation can improve zucchini sugar contents and carbohydrate accumulation which are due to the super optimal electrical conductivity recorded on sub irrigation plants rouphael and colla 2005 2 2 mechanisms of water deficit impacts the improvement in cash crop quality due to water deficit can be ascribed to the modulation of the underlying physiological mechanisms of the plant from the following four perspectives 1 many studies hold the view that under water deficit conditions the reduction of water flux into the fruit decreases fruit volume ranƒçiƒá et al 2010 and increases the concentration of carbohydrates and related quality traits in fruit ho et al 1987 hou et al 2020 zhang et al 2017a 2 water deficit regulates the distribution of photosynthetic assimilates by reducing vegetative growth and increasing the vigor of the fruit as a sink therefore the carbohydrates that would normally be allocated to side branches are transferred to the fruit which increases the accumulation of assimilates in the fruit davies et al 2000 patan√® and cosentino 2010 3 moderate deficit irrigation increases the starch accumulation in the early fruit development stage so a larger proportion of starch will be converted to sugar during the fruit ripening stage thereby improving fruit quality zegbe et al 2003 in addition vegetative reproduction is reduced and plant light transmittance is increased which is beneficial to fruit colour and the corresponding nutrient element synthesis b√©nard et al 2009 4 under water stress plants will up regulate the expression of mrna related to glucose metabolism and increase the contents of abscisic acid aba ethylene and other substances deluc et al 2007 these substances are related to the initiation and promotion of fruit maturity zaharah et al 2013 can regulate the activities of carbohydrate and vacuolar metabolic enzymes and play an important role in regulating the sugar concentration in fruits deluc et al 2009 downie et al 2003 johnston et al 2009 therefore water deficit at fruit ripening stage triggers significant taste and nutritional quality improvements chen et al 2013 2014 through the abovementioned physiological material transformation and signal regulation effects crop quality traits can be improved under water deficit 2 3 fertilization impacts there is some controversy about the effects of fertilization on the quality of cash crops according to table 5 compared with non or very low fertilization treatments fertilization application can increase the tss ssc and vc content of cash crops such as tomato water melon and blueberry and increase sar jiang et al 2009 khayyat et al 2012 wang et al 2007a b yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 since nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus potassium and zinc are essential for crop growth and fruit development further in the study of pineapple it was found that soil application of potassium can decrease internal browning since it would lower polyphenoloxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase activities soares et al 2005 however some studies have shown that reducing the amount of fertilization by 25 50 based on the local recommended fertilization level can effectively increase fruit quality such as fruit firmness vc and ssc in tomato apple and hot pepper b√©nard et al 2009 li et al 2011 raese et al 2007 xiang et al 2018 taking nitrogen n application as an example different conclusions have been drawn from many studies on the effects of n application on crop quality these differences may have been caused by the different experimental conditions and the inconsistent sink source ratio of plants b√©nard et al 2009 when a plant is relatively small n deficit will seriously affect its vegetative growth fruit carbon input and metabolism and will adversely affect quality formation in its later stages moderate n application at a proper stage can promote root zone development crop growth and dry matter accumulation thereby improving fruit quality huett and dettmann 1988 flores et al 2003 kuscu et al 2014 however excessive n application which is a common phenomenon worldwide munoz et al 2008 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017b might have a disadvantageous effect on crop quality wei et al 2018 noted that a lack of n fertilizer can reduce vegetative growth in the leaf canopy increase fruit received radiation and temperature and cause changes in fruit secondary metabolism these processes promote the synthesis and decomposition of assimilates in fruits which in turn increases the contents of tss ssc and oa in fruits b√©nard et al 2009 wang et al 2007a 2 4 screening for sensitive qualities table 2 5 show that some crop qualities are not sensitive to water or nutrient treatment in the wsqi high efficient strategy proposed in this article water and nutrient sensitive quality traits are screened based on the above analysis fig 2 which lays a foundation for the comprehensive fruit quality analysis and the following strategy decision making progress wang 2011 carried out a sensitivity analysis to identify the responses of individual quality to water deficit and screened out the water sensitive quality of tomato as well as the growth stages of fruit in which fruit quality is water sensitive the sensitivity calculation formula is as follows 1 s j 1 m k 1 m Œ¥ q k Œ¥ e t k j 1 2 n where sj is the sensitivity coefficient of trait j m is the number of water treatments n is the number of quality traits Œ¥ q k is the normalized variation in a single quality trait between two water treatments when the quality variation between the two treatments is not significant Œ¥ q k 0 and Œ¥ e t k is the normalized variation in crop evapotranspiration between the two water treatments sensitivity analysis can screen water sensitive quality traits for specific crop genotype and also water stress timing in a study of water stress on grape berry quality ssc and ta were very sensitive to water stress following by tannin but anthocyanin was not sensitive in this case chen 2010 in a study of tomato fruit chen 2009 pointed that fw pr and ssc were sensitive to water stress during fruit ripening tss and fn were sensitive to water stress during fruit setting and ripening vc was sensitive to water stress in all stages however wei 2018 showed that fruit quality was more sensitive to water stress during fruit color changing stage and was more sensitive under irrigation method of adi than cfi results in cui 2009 showed that water stress improved jujube fruit quality during fruit expanding and ripening stages but the sensitive period of field and greenhouse experiments was slightly different since rainfall is ignorable in greenhouse but not in field case numerous studies on fruit quality highlight the variable responses of plants to water and nutrient treatments due to their different experiment locations crop species genotypes etc besides the water quality such as salt content of the irrigation water may influence plant growth and fruit quality yang et al 2019 reviews by bertin and g√©nard 2018 and by ripoll et al 2014 also emphasized the complexity of quality traits underling mechanisms it is difficult to predict the specific responses of quality traits to different water and nutrient stresses therefore based on the selection of water and nutrient sensitive quality traits further evaluation for comprehensive quality index should be performed to reflect farmers comprehensive consideration of cash crop quality and provide clearer guidance for agricultural irrigation and fertilization management 3 comprehensive quality index evaluation for cash crops the concept of quality in fruits and vegetables is comprehensive it not only includes objective quantifiable traits such as sugar acid and vitamin contents but also involves subjective traits such as taste and other fuzzy indicators such as fruit shape index si and size which might influence consumer preference therefore it is difficult for a single quality indicator to accurately represent the comprehensive quality of cash crops in order to meet the quality expectations for agricultural products from different consumers using scientific methods to develop a comprehensive quality index will be an important breakthrough in the study of water quality response relationships in wsqi strategy comprehensive evaluation methods have been introduced into the evaluation of comprehensive fruit quality index the evaluation process includes two main steps the determination of weights for individual quality attributes and the calculation of a comprehensive quality rank using the evaluation methods 3 1 weight determination and comprehensive evaluation methods first for the determination of the weights of individual quality attributes the commonly used methods can be divided into two categories subjective valuation methods and objective valuation methods subjective valuation methods include the expert survey method the analytic hierarchy process ahp saaty 1980 and the fuzzy statistical method objective valuation methods include the standard deviation method principal component analysis pca the entropy weight method and the critic method etc wang et al 2011b among these ahp is a multi criteria decision making method that addresses how to determine the relative importance of a set of factors in wsqi strategy wang et al 2011b introduced this method to evaluated tomato fruit comprehensive quality the evaluation hierarchy can be divided into three levels fig 4 the objective level on the top is the determination of the comprehensive quality q of tomato the criteria indicating quality are in the middle level and the individual quality attributes are located at the lowest level in their study 1000 customers and 25 horticultural experts participated in the comparisons for the criteria and attribute levels respectively after the weights are determined multiple traits are integrated into a comprehensive quality index for evaluation and ranking commonly used comprehensive evaluation methods include pca lan et al 2014 technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis hwang and yoon 1981 the grey relational analysis method gra lu et al 2009 the aggregative index method and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method etc wang et al 2011b topsis is a classical method for multiple attribute decision making by defining the positive and negative ideal solutions alternatives can be ranked in topsis based on their relative similarity to the positive ideal solution since there are many traits in multiple attribute decision making information from observations might overlap due to traits correlation the gra method is a powerful tool analyzing processes with multiple performance characteristics lu et al 2009 pca is a useful method for feature extraction and data reduction that can accurately identify the sources of variance after reducing the dimensionality of data lu et al 2009 lan et al 2014 3 2 applications of comprehensive quality evaluations table 6 lists our team studies on the evaluation of cash crops comprehensive quality in china under different agronomic treatments and the quality traits which were taking into account wang et al 2011a used pca to evaluate the comprehensive quality of tomato the ratio of the actual product output to the total yield of each harvest was assumed as the weight in the pca evaluation process further they used this method to evaluate tomato comprehensive quality performance under different irrigation treatments wang et al 2011b validated the effectiveness of the tomato comprehensive quality index established by ahp and topsis and recorded the responses of the tomato comprehensive quality index to different irrigation management treatments chen 2009 found that the comprehensive quality of tomato fruit decreased with increasing irrigation using ahp and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation in the study of wang et al 2015 after the determination of the weights of individual quality traits with ahp the comprehensive quality of tomato fruit under different irrigation and n conditions was assessed using gra and pca furthermore the treatment with the best comprehensive quality ranking was the same under both evaluation methods considering the relationship between yield and quality they suggested an optimal regime irrigated at 63 of et0 and n fertilization at the typical level for local agronomic practices 574 35 kg ha 1 in spring summer season and 272 85 kg ha 1 in winter spring season wei et al 2018 found via pca that under high n conditions and elevated co2 conditions deficit irrigation especially alternate partial root zone irrigation can significantly improve the comprehensive quality of tomato the above summary shows that by screening for an individual fruit quality of interest researchers can conduct evaluation for cash crops comprehensive quality under different agronomic treatments this evaluation process provides a certain theoretical basis and some methodological guidance for wsqi 4 statistical models of water yield quality relationships studies have shown that the improvement in cash crop quality caused by water deficit is often accompanied by a decline in yield bertin and g√©nard 2018 chen et al 2013 cui et al 2008 favati et al 2009 patan√® et al 2011 yang et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 in addition the effects of deficit irrigation on crop yield and quality are closely related to the timing and extent of the water deficit occurrence du et al 2008 johnstone et al 2005 patan√® and cosentino 2010 wang et al 2015 and depend on the crops dai et al 2010 yang et al 2017 therefore acceptable yield and high quality in cash crops may be possible if the intensity and timing of water deficit are proper to balance crop yield and fruit quality that is to improve fruit quality while ensuring yield some studies explored the correlation of cash crop yield and quality with water supply during the full or parts of the growth stages different degrees of deficit irrigation were set to obtain an optimal irrigation strategy for processing tomato production favati et al 2009 many studies were performed aiming to explore the water yield relations and built several water yield models jensen 1968 minhas et al 1974 stewart et al 2016 unfortunately there are currently few developed models for evaluating water quality relationship in wsqi strategy water quality models were developed through the adaptation from the water yield models and they were calibrated and validated with 4 years of experimental data 4 1 water yield statistical models water yield models i e crop water production functions are mathematical models that describe the quantitative relationships of crop yield to water consumption during the whole growing season or at some specific growth stages they include the effects of the timing and intensity of water deficit chen et al 2014 rao et al 1988 these models can be roughly divided into two categories one is additive models which add the effect of the phase effect on the final relative crop yield such as models proposed by blank 1975 stewart et al 2016 and singh et al 1987 another is multiplicative water yield models which use multiplicative ways to describe the effect of the relative water consumption or the stage water deficit on the final relative crop yield typical examples of multiplicative models are the models by jensen 1968 minhas et al 1974 and rao 1974 in wsqi strategy chen et al 2014 estimated the parameters of water yield models stewart jensen minhas based on four year greenhouse deficit irrigation experiment data and then compared the performance of each model the minhas model was recommended for simulating the greenhouse tomato water yield relationship with an rmse of 0 031 r2 of 0 94 and a modeling efficiency of 0 90 4 2 water quality statistical models compared to the numerous studies on the water yield relationship there is a knowledge gap in water quality models for evaluating the effects of different degrees of water deficit at various growth stages on crop quality in wsqi strategy after analyzing the relationships between quality traits and the relative water consumption and the relative water deficit degree at each growth stage six water quality models additive multiplicative exponential q singn q minhas q rao were developed adapted from water yield models to simulate the relationships of tomato fruit quality with water deficit at various growth stages chen et al 2014 multiplicative model was recommended for simulating the relationships of fruit quality such as tss rs sar and fn with water deficit at various growth stages with rmse values in the range of 0 037 0 054 and r2 values in the range of 0 63 0 88 meanwhile additive model was recommended for simulating the effects of water deficit at different stages on tomato fruit quality such as oa vc ci and comprehensive quality index with rmse values in the range of 0 027 0 065 and r2 values in the range of 0 64 0 90 in the study of shan et al 2019 a comparison was conducted among additive multiplicative and exponential models simulating the relationship between water and comprehensive quality index of greenhouse tomato among them the additive model performed best with an r2 of 0 91 and tomato comprehensive quality was the most sensitive to water deficit at the fruit ripening stage although current statistical models can reach a certain degree of prediction accuracy they cannot explain the underlying mechanisms of the relationships among crop yield quality and water consumption in depth research is needed to further reveal the mechanisms of the quality response to water nutrient in terms of gas exchange water nutrient absorption assimilate accumulation and distribution and source sink relations between plants and fruits more physiological models of the crop water yield quality relationship need to be explored in addition to empirical and semi empirical models 5 primary exploration of models related to fruit quality in the 1990s studies attempted to quantitatively describe crop quality characteristics through process based models fishman and g√©nard 1998 g√©nard and huguet 1996 biophysical dynamic growth models and semi mechanism sugar models were developed to simulate fruit growth and sugar accumulation responses to genetic variability environmental fluctuations and agronomic management combining biophysical and physiological processes via mathematical framework these models provide a prospective way to designe innovative horticultural practices facing the challenge of water shortage and future climate changing beauvoit et al 2018 bertin et al 2006 fishman and g√©nard 1998 g√©nard et al 2007 rahmati et al 2018 struik et al 2005 5 1 process based models related to fruit quality lescourret and g√©nard 2005 proposed the virtual fruit model applied to peach fruits this model reorganized and integrated three process based models they had previously proposed which respectively described the fruit growth of dry mass lescourret et al 1998 fresh mass fishman and g√©nard 1998 and the accumulation of sugar in the flesh sugar model g√©nard et al 2003 the integrated model is an important breakthrough for understanding the response of fruit quality traits to environmental fluctuations at the plants and fruits scales and this progress has promoted further research perspectives in quality trait modeling in the carbon sub model simulation of dry mass it calculates leaf carbon assimilation fruit carbon assimilation carbon coordination of other storage organs so as to define the carbon allocation and the dry mass of fruits lescourret et al 1998 in the sugar sub model sugar model the main principle is carbon balance and the conversion rate of carbon between two compounds is proportional to the total carbon of the source material g√©nard et al 2003 in the water sub model fruit is virtualized into a big cell connecting with the plant through phloem and xylem vessels water enters the fruit from xylem and phloem and is lost through transpiration sugar is unloaded from phloem through active transport mass flow and passive diffusion bertin et al 2006 fishman and g√©nard 1998 the model has proven to be quite robust and generic and been applied on many species e g grape blueberry tomato pear to simulate fruit sugars dynamics under different genotypes water conditions and fruit loadings dai et al 2009 jorquera fontena et al 2017 liu et al 2007 prudent et al 2011 quilot et al 2004 an integrated view of plant functioning is essiencial to predict fruit growth and composition since the plant is the main source of water carbohydrates and minerals for the fruit functional structural models explicitly descibe the architecture of the plant and formalize the processes of decelopment growth acquisition and allocation of rescources carbon and water at the level of organ qualitree a virtual fruit tree model is one of the functional structural models linking fruit and plant growth of peach lescourret et al 2011 mir√°s avalos et al 2011 and was applied to simulate peach fruit quality and size under changing water stress degree mir√°s avalos et al 2013 qualitree model allows to disentangle the effects of water stresses on carbon aqauision vegetative growth and fruit quality of peach rahmati et al 2018 another functional structural model was developed for tomato baldazzi et al 2013 which can estimate the resource acquisition transpiration carbonhydrate laoding and leakage along the phloem pathway and transfer within the plant such formalization enables to simulate the within plant variability of water and carbonhydrate further leaf gas exchenge was also coupled with the dynamics of water transport to simulate grape fruit growth and quality under different climate scenarios zhu et al 2018 2019 5 2 tom sugar model based on the sugar metabolisms and feedback loops of tomato fruits in wsqi chen et al 2020 adapted the sugar model g√©nard et al 2003 and established a tomato fruit sugar mechanism model tom sugar model in tom sugar carbon supply is mainly the sucrose unloaded from the phloem and carbon is depleted by respiration the carbon is divided into three pools soluble sugars starch and the other carbon compounds like organic acids amino acids proteins cell wall compounds etc starch as a transient reserve pool interconverts with the soluble sugars the soluble sugars provide the raw material for the biosynthesis of the other carbon compounds the metabolic activities involved in carbohydrate metabolism were reflected by the reaction rates k values which regulate the carbon fluxes among the pools fruit water content was introduced to modify the sugar metabolism related reaction rates in the model assuming that fruit water content imposes an influence on carbohydrate metabolism in fruit the model better simulated the dynamics of carbohydrate accumulation in the tomato fruit growing under different conditions by considering the influence of fruit water content on sugar metabolism further chen 2016 coupled fruit sugar and fruit growth model soluble sugar content simulated from tom sugar model was used to be the input of tomato fruit growth model the coupled model was applied to simulate tomato fruit growth and sugar dynamics under different water conditions which showed good fittings however this type of model also has certain limitations first the model involves many physiological and biochemical parameters which can not be directly obtained and validated through experiments thus a large amount of input data is required for parameter calibration which increases the threshold for model application besides although the rationality of parameters variation was analyzed in their studies the self correlation between parameters made the calibration process quite difficult further more attention can be paid to simulate some other important fruit compounds such as antioxidants and vitamins and influencing factors can be included as model variables such as fertilization or atmospheric co2 concentration 6 decision making methods of irrigation and applications in the conventional theory of deficit irrigation the optimal irrigation schedule is set based on water balance and water production functions with the maximization of yield or the minimization of economic losses as the objective function shang and mao 2006 shangguan et al 2002 singh 2012 2014 this kind of optimization method which only aims to maximize yield or regards income as only related to production yield is not suitable for cash crops since stress in certain stages can increase marketable produce performance by improving or keeping crop quality carvalho et al 2014 pardo et al 2020 in the new high efficient irrigation strategy for wsqi of cash crops irrigation decisions should be supportted by comprehensive consideration of the relationships between water yield and water quality through methods such as linear non linear programming dynamic programming genetic algorithms and multi objective programming singh 2012 2014 or some improved methods based on those programmings brown et al 2010 paul et al 2000 vedula and kumar 1996 yang et al 2009 to allocate limited agricultual irrigation water resource while maintaining high yields improving quality and increasing high efficiency fig 5 6 1 decision making methods of irrigation in wsqi non linear programming is one of the most commonly used methods for the optimization of irrigation schedules in non linear programming first the objective function needs to be determined for example maximizing farmers income second the effect of water fertilization management on the income to be maximized is determined through water yield water quality or quality price functions further economical aspect is also invoved in wsqi the relatoinship of price to crop quality and the relationship between fruit price and fruit quality varied with economic and social development to consider the different economic conditions in different regions a flexible price coefficient was used to determine the quantitative relations between crop price and its quality chen 2016 then the economic revenue was obtained by multiplying the crop yield and the quality related price the optimal irrigation strategies were designed by maximizing the economic revenue through linear nonlinear programming methods chen 2016 shan et al 2019 in addition constraints can be set according to the local available water resources soil water status upper and lower irrigation limits and the optimization can be performed for different scenarios in linear non linear and dynamic programming models there is usually only one objective function in wsqi strategy the optimization of water fertilization management considers crop yield quality and final income multiple conflicting targets are involved with multiple constraints the multi objective programming model is an effective tool for addressing this situation ghahraman and sepaskhah 2002 lachhwani 2012 liu et al 2019 singh 2012 zeng et al 2010 in the studies of wsqi the optimal irrigation schedule for greenhouse tomato water saving and quality improvement was determined to be 100 of et0 at the seedling stage 90 of et0 at the fruit setting stage and 63 of et0 at the fruit ripening stage chen 2009 theses levels were determined based on the crop water production and water quality functions and the production practice through dynamic programming with the goal of maximizing the total economic benefit in a non linear case of chen 2016 compared with full irrigation although the optimized irrigation schedule reduced the yield by 10 the comprehensive fruit quality index and income increased by 14 0 and 11 7 respectively with an irrigation water savings of 26 9 in a multi objective programming model that comprehensively considers tomato yield and fruit quality traits chen 2016 the minimum deviation between the actual value of each optimization target and the target value for each is set as the objective function based on the priority for each objectives a sequential algorithm is used to solve the multi objective programming further this study obtained the optimal irrigation amount and the corresponding optimal relative yield relative quality traits and comprehensive quality index under different scenarios agricultural production decision makers with the help of the new proposed high efficient irrigation strategy can determine optimal irrigation schedules based on market supply and demand consumer preferences for various quality traits fruit prices available irrigation water resources and future water prices with the expected goals and the definition of priority levels for cash crop yield quality and irrigation amount multi objective programming can be a powerful tool for optimizing irrigation schedules and achieving customized and diversified irrigation management 6 2 cultural practices high efficient production technology modes for saving water and improving the quality of cash crops have been widely promoted and applied in china given the paritcular climatic conditions of the early frost stage in the arid inland river basins of northwesr china and the requirements for improving crop quality we propose a joint irrigation control technology for field grown cash crops reasonably delaying early irrigation optimally allocating limited water and appropriately advancing the end of irrigation can promote root growth control redundancies creat a stimulus compensation effect and improve fruit quality with an irrigation water savings of 20 this result has been demonstrated in gansu shaanxi shanxi xinjiang and other provinces based on the water quality yield relationships in greenhouse tomato a high efficient mode of less irrigation at the seedlings moderate irrigation at flowering no irrigation at harvesting was developed this method maintained tomato yields at 181 01 t ha and 280 12 t ha in two seasons no significant reduction saved 12 40 and 7 53 respectively of water consumption and improved the tomato quality traits such as ssc and vc wang 2011 research findings of high efficient irrigation strategy for cash crops have been widely used in greenhouses and orchards in the shiyang river basin gansu province more than 2500 government staff in charge of agriculture forestry and technology promotion from cities to villages participated in the training and demonstrations of this strategy at the wuwei experimental station these events are essential in guiding local farmers to perform scientific agricultural water and fertilizer management and promoting the sustainable development of the cash crop industry 7 conclusion to improve the current situation of cash crop industry combining the findings of international research frontiers and our team research results in recent decades this article proposed the integrated high efficient irrigation strategy for water saving and quality improving of cash crops wsqi based on the analysis of the effects of different water and nutrient treatments on the quality of cash crops water and nutrient sensitive quality traits were screened the comprehensive evaluation method was used to scientifically evaluate the comprehensive quality of cash crops and then to build statistical models of water yield quality for cash crops combined with biophysical models quantitative simulations of key crop qualities were conducted which offers more information of quality formation mechanisms with all the above analysis and simulation irrigation decision making can proceed considering crop water yield quality relationships to achieve the sustainable use of regional water resources and high efficient agricultural production this research has helped the conventional agricultural irrigation strategy based on water balance and crop water yield functions to move forward to high efficient irrigation strategy aiming for water saving and quality improving

10463,strip intercropping has been widely applied in arid and semi arid regions due to high and stable productivity and efficient utilization of resources intercropping can increase water use efficiency wue of crops and optimize the soil moisture environment for crop development competition and complementarity are two aspects of the same interspecific relationship between crops and a quantitative understanding of the competition and complementary effects of intercrops on soil resources is important for advancement of intercropping systems the characteristics and mechanisms of water utilization and interspecies relationships in intercropping are reviewed in this paper the main regulation approaches for efficient water utilization in intercropping are based on interspecific competition and complementarity include crop species irrigation and fertilization regimes plant density spatial arrangement tillage and mulching practices and environmental factors interspecific competition and complementarity are leading factors influencing water utilization of intercrops and studies on synergistic effects of competition and complementarity in intercropping systems are of importance for water utilization future research should investigate the relationship between water competition and complementation between different intercrops and inter zone water migration integrating results from different studies could provide a basis for enhancing wue of intercropping through advanced understanding of approaches for regulating interspecific interactions this would provide support for the development and adoption of intercropping systems in water deficient areas keywords intercropping water use interspecific interaction niche differentiation crop productivity 1 overview of intercropping the advantages of intercropping in improving the efficiency of resource utilization have been demonstrated across the world ma et al 2017 martin guay et al 2017 intercropping is widely used as an important means to provide food security diversify cropping systems promote sustainable agricultural development and efficiently utilize limited labor on smallholder farms george and jeruto 2010 intercropping can increase the utilization efficiency of resources such as light heat water and fertilizer to effectively improve the primary production of land per unit area thereby making a significant contribution to global food security foley et al 2011 steen et al 2015 and increasing water production efficiency and economic benefit for farmers agegnehu et al 2008 yin et al 2018a with the gradual transformation of agricultural production from resource consuming to technology efficient improving the utilization efficiency of resources has become the top priority of intercropping research table 1 many researchers have explored the theory and practice of optimizing resource utilization efficiency from the perspectives of intercrop strip widths nurbakhsh et al 2015 intercrop species osunlaja et al 2010 spatial layout hauggaard nielsen et al 2006 morais et al 2018 sowing density and time ahmed et al 2018 fan et al 2020 nandy et al 2013 water and fertilizer regulation sawyer et al 2010 yang et al 2011 interspecific relationships hu et al 2016 allelopathy g√≥mez rodrƒ± guez et al 2003 and tillage and mulching practices yin et al 2018b a series of theoretical systems to guide intercropping application can be constructed from the interaction of heterogeneous individuals in a composite population to provide a solid support for the wide application of intercropping in recent years with increasing shortage of resources intercropping use has declined in water scarce areas due to its high water demand which can reduce the yield per unit of cultivated land chai et al 2014a therefore researchers should continue to focus on how to maximize the advantages of intercropping system and achieve stable yields while saving water this paper reviews the development of theory and technology of efficient water utilization of intercropping from across several paleoclimatic areas from the world in order to provide a basis for the optimization of highly efficient intercropping production technology 2 water use characteristics of intercropping 2 1 water consumption of intercropping the water consumption of intercropping during the entire growth period is greater than that of monoculture but the difference is smaller than the weighted mean value of corresponding water consumption in sole cropping morris and garrity 1993 researchers summarized previous research results and concluded that the water consumption of intercropping systems vary greatly due to environmental conditions and crop types morris and garrity 1993 however there is little difference compared to the weighted average of water consumption for the corresponding sole cropping systems morris and garrity 1993 therefore the development of intercropping has great potential in areas with sufficient water resources to meet the water requirements of high yielding sole cropping systems however in irrigated areas water consumption of intercropping is not a simple accumulation of water consumption of component crops and is less than the accumulation value due to water competition and complementary utilization effects during the growing season yin et al 2018b at present research on water consumption of intercropping mainly focuses on spatial distribution mao et al 2012 fertilization system teng et al 2016 irrigation method and system manjunatha et al 2000 and tillage and mulching practices yin et al 2018b optimal spatial layout of intercrop strips can reduce water consumption of intercropping for example maize zea mays l pea pisum sativum l strip intercropping with 4 4 model four rows of maize and four rows of pea reduced water consumption by 10 2 13 7 compared to sole cropping but maize pea strip intercropping with 2 4 model two rows of maize and four rows of pea increased water consumption by 12 5 19 8 compared to sole cropping mao et al 2012 it was found that the water consumption of maize pea intercropping was not significantly affected by nitrogen fertilizer was significantly greater than that of sole pea but did not differ with that of sole maize teng et al 2016 water consumption of intercropping was reduced by 16 1 and 15 3 by an alternate irrigation method fig 1 compared to flood irrigation at high and low water supply levels respectively yang et al 2011 limited water supply after the booting stage of wheat triticum aestivum l in wheat maize intercropping has been shown to save 15 irrigation water and reduce water consumption by 4 4 8 5 save 25 1 70 9 mm of soil water without significantly reducing crop productivity wang et al 2015 so reduction of water consumption by intercropping is based on reasonable crop collocation and appropriate irrigation and fertilization water consumption can also be reduced by optimizing tillage practices and mulching methods for example reduced tillage with straw and plastic mulching in wheat maize intercropping has been shown to reduce water consumption by 3 6 4 6 yin et al 2015 these findings showed that water consumption in intercropping can be reduced by integrating water regulation measures commonly used in monoculture 2 2 soil evaporation of intercropping soil evaporation plays an important role in the total water consumption by cropping systems therefore it is important to take appropriate control measures to reduce it yin et al 2019b previous studies have shown that soil evaporation during the whole growth period of intercropping was greater than that of sole cropping due to the longer growth period of intercropping but daily soil evaporation of intercropping was less than that of sole cropping indicating that intercropping has a significant advantage over sole cropping in improving crop water availability fan et al 2013 gao et al 2013 yin et al 2019b over the years research has revealed strategies to reduce ineffective field water consumption such as soil evaporation through optimization of irrigation levels fertilization systems mulching methods and tillage practices compared to conventional flood irrigation alternate irrigation can significantly reduce evaporation of soil water by 17 7 31 9 in wheat maize intercropping yang et al 2011 postponed topdressing of nitrogen fertilizer can reduce soil evaporation of maize pea intercropping by 15 30 compared to conventional fertilizer for farmer teng et al 2016 the application of no tillage with straw mulching in intercropping significantly reduced soil evaporation by 5 8 13 1 compared to conventional tillage without straw retention fan et al 2013 the integration of no tillage with straw mulching in wheat strips and residual plastic film mulching in maize strips can further restrain soil evaporation 32 71 mm by 9 0 17 3 compared to conventional tillage without straw retention in wheat strips and annual plastic film mulching in maize strips and no tillage with straw mulching measure in the intercropping system could favorably reduce soil evaporation yin et al 2018b 2 3 yield and water use efficiency of intercropping intercropping plays an important role in ensuring high and stable crop yields and addressing food security under growing shortages of irrigation water and arable land chai et al 2014b intercropping can increase total crop production and the ratio of production to investment by optimizing population structure and interspecific relationships between intercrops hu et al 2016 increasing the use of resources such as light water and nutrients thorsted et al 2006 and synchronously increasing intercropping component yield huang et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 additionally under low yielding environments intercropping can achieve yield stability by reducing pests and diseases and increasing land management brooker et al 2015 intercropping has a significant yield advantage over sole cropping fig 2 which has been verified for a variety of intercrop combinations including wheat maize yin et al 2016a maize pea hu et al 2016 jujube ziziphus jujuba mill wheat wang et al 2014 maize potato solanum tuberosum l chapagain et al 2012 and alfalfa medicago sativa maize sun et al 2014 however if the combination of intercrops is not appropriate and the spatial layout is not considered the lower yield of the component crops compared to sole cropping is more obvious banik et al 2008 previous study showed that when nitrogen application level is higher than 120 kg n ha 1 vegetative growth period is prolonged and grain filling of oat and pea is reduced resulting in lower yield of oat pea intercropping in eastern austria neugschwandtner and kaul 2014 when irrigation amount and fertilizer application are low crop growth and development appear lack of water and fertilizer phenomenon and reduce crop production jannoura et al 2014 therefore reasonable crop collocation spatial distribution and suitable irrigation and fertilization regimes are important for maximizing the yield advantage of intercropping compared to sole cropping the advantage of efficient water utilization in intercropping results from spatiotemporal differences in water demand between intercrops dong et al 2018 according to the characteristics of crop water requirement reasonable design of irrigation amount and time is important to improve the compatibility between crop water requirements and water supply morris and garrity 1993 also through optimized tillage and mulching measures the consistency between water requirement for crop growth and water supply was enhanced to improve wue of intercropping yin et al 2016b yin et al 2018b straw mulching integrated into wheat maize intercropping can improve soil water utilization by regulating the soil water environment for example no tillage with straw mulching in wheat maize intercropping system increased wue by 15 1 20 0 and 15 5 16 3 respectively compared to intercropping without straw retention and corresponding sole maize yin et al 2015 these results show that the application of no tillage with straw mulching in intercropping can improve water use more than that in sole cropping postponed topdressing of nitrogen fertilizers increased wue of intercropping by 5 1 compared to conventional fertilization system for farmers teng et al 2016 therefore through the optimization of tillage and fertilization practices the utilization of deep soil water by crop roots can be promoted and the coupling effect of water and nitrogen can be exerted thus increasing water and fertilizer use efficiency however intercropping may not have the advantage of increasing wue when crop layout or variety combination is unreasonable grema and hess 1994 the reasonable intercropping system can achieve high yield and water utilization in order to further enhance the yield increase and the beneficial effects of intercropping future research is needed to understand how to integrate the water saving measures commonly used in sole cropping into intercropping and increase efficient water utilization in intercropping system to enhance the sustainability of agricultural production 3 interspecies relationships of intercropping competition and complementation are two main types of interspecific interactions callaway and walker 1997 yin et al 2017 they coexist and play a crucial role in promoting the productivity of intercropping systems hauggaard nielsen and jensen 2005 zhang and li 2003 crops with different characteristics of resource demand provide the basis for niche differentiation in time and space utilization and promote the efficient utilization of related resources by inter species complementarity or one crop directly provides resources for another crop takim 2012 therefore interspecific competition promotes the use of different resources because intercrops utilize a given resource based on space time differences mehrhoff and turkington 1996 also interspecific complementation refers to the fact that the resource utilization should be greater than the interspecific competition zhang and li 2003 and interspecific complementation is produced via one crop promoting the growth of another crop callaway 1995 yin et al 2019a b quantifying the competition and complementary effects of intercrops on soil resources is an important issue in intercropping research chen et al 2014 yin et al 2019a the yield advantage of intercropping over monoculture depends on the net effect of intercropping on complementary and competition for growth resources garc√≠a barrios and ong 2004 when analyzing the effects of inter species competition and complementarity on resource utilization many assume that the two functions are mutually exclusive but this is not always the case for example with inter species complementary utilization of light resources competition for nutrient and water may occur simultaneously also the resource competition in the early growth stage of intercropping crops may evolve into complementary effect of sharing resources in later growth stages especially following the harvest of an early maturity intercrop yin et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 in addition the competitive disadvantage formed in the period of crop symbiosis may be recovered after the early maturity crop harvest which shows a strong recovery effect li et al 2001a therefore the transition from interspecific competition to complementation is an important period of agronomic regulation and the main goal of interspecific regulation is to delay the intersection of complementation and competition the complementary use of limited resources indicates weakening of the competitive effect and formation of a yield advantage for intercropping it is important to quantify the interspecific competitive and complementary effects in combination with the growth and development of intercrops and the dynamic change of growth factor supply for optimization of intercropping systems 4 mechanisms of efficient water utilization in intercropping 4 1 physiological basis of efficient water utilization in intercropping the photosynthetic and physiological characteristics of plants are the basis for their productivity and have important influence on their growth and development jiao et al 2017 in a specific intercropping system nitrogen fertilizer has an influence on the physiological characteristics of crops across maize cotton and maize soybean intercropping systems with different nitrogen levels intercropped maize had greater net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance compared to sole maize but the improvement effect of these variables gradually weakened with increased nitrogen application zhang et al 2014 the typical maize peanut arachis hypogaea linn intercropping system with tall and low collocation has population structure similar to an umbrella which is beneficial to improve the transmittance and interception rate of light energy of the composite population awal et al 2006 maddonni et al 2001 compared to sole cropping chloroplast composition and photosynthetic characteristics of intercropped maize and peanut were changed and the utilization of weak light in peanut and strong light in maize was promoted jiao et al 2006 higher photosynthetic product accumulation and conversion rate in the middle and late stages of the intercropping system is another reason for the significant yield increase of maize peanut intercropping jiao et al 2006 from the end of vegetative growth to the reproductive growth period of maize leaf photosynthetic rate transpiration rate stomatal conductance carboxylation efficiency and maximum electron transfer rate of maize intercropped with peanut were higher than sole maize yang and chai 2016 additionally increasing strip with of maize peanut intercropping can further enhance the increasing effect of the above indexes and the appropriate application of phosphorus can enhance the utilization of light and delay the aging of maize jiao et al 2016 in wheat broad bean vicia faba l intercropping relative water content chlorophyll content and water potential of leaves of broad bean and wheat were significantly increased by intercropping compared to sole cropping yang and chai 2016 compared to traditional flood irrigation chlorophyll content of broad bean and wheat leaves in intercropping was increased with alternative irrigation method but relative water content and water potential of leaves were decreased yang and chai 2016 according to the growth and development characteristics of intercrops alternate irrigation can increase yield and resource use efficiency by improving physiological characteristics of intercrops thus alternate irrigation is an appropriate water supply method for intercropping intercropping is beneficial for increasing the photosynthetic source leaf area index i e lai and leaf area duration i e lad and promoting the movement of photosynthetic compounds from vegetative organs to grain thereby enhancing wue by increasing yield yin et al 2017 in maize cotton and maize soybean intercropping systems with different nitrogen application levels intercropping increased grain yield compared with sole cropping zhang et al 2014 the main direct reasons for this were caused by the improvement of lai and photosynthesis and the indirect reason was the increase of leaf chlorophyll content zhang et al 2014 the grain yield of intercropped soybean and maize was higher than that of the corresponding sole crops which was attributed to higher photosynthetic radiation utilization rate rue and lai of intercropping liu et al 2017 similarly in a wheat maize intercropping system with straw mulching of wheat and plastic mulching of maize increased yield of the intercropping system compared to the corresponding sole cropping was associated with increased lai yin et al 2016a the main contribution to the increase in total yield of wheat plus maize in the intercropping system was from maize yin et al 2016a this was because straw mulching after wheat harvest enhanced water retention so that more soil water could be compensated to the maize strips to meet the water demand in the vigorous reproductive period of maize yin et al 2018b in summary intercropping can increase dry matter accumulation rate enhanced the transfer of photosynthetic products from vegetative organs to grain and realized the compensatory growth effect based on the dry matter accumulation rate and the super compensatory effect of dry matter distribution and translocation yin et al 2017 4 2 ecological basis of efficient water utilization in intercropping competition is a key factor affecting crop growth water utilization and yield formation of intercropping systems nassab et al 2011 previous studies showed that when inter species competition is less than intra species competition inter species competition is conducive to improving wue forming intercropping advantages and improving yield stability of the intercropping system schroeder moreno and janos 2008 in agricultural production two or more crops with differing growth periods and morphological characteristics are combined in the same production system to form a compensation effect in time and space for efficient utilization of resources horton and hart 1998 yin et al 2017 in terms of the compensation effect in time except for the extension of the total growth period of the composite population and the increase of leaf area duration the inhibitory effect of competition on the late maturity crop during the co growth period of intercrops could be significantly recovered after the harvest of the early maturity crop li et al 2001b for instance in wheat maize or wheat soybean intercropping systems growth and nutrient uptake of the subsidiary maize or soybean was suppressed prior to wheat harvest due to interspecific competition but after harvest of the early maturity wheat the later maturity maize or soybean recovered producing a significant compensatory effect zhang and li 2003 in terms of the compensation effect in space the basic conclusion of canopy complementation is that canopy structure with high and low collocation in intercropping is more conducive to air flow than that of sole cropping with consistent canopy structure morris and garrity 1993 in particular the open canopy of tall crops is conducive to reducing diffusion resistance of the boundary layer changing the gradient of leaf gas and water vapor or the diffusion resistance of the boundary layer stomata and leaf morris and garrity 1993 when the water absorption space and root distribution of intercropped components are different which can produce a greater complementary effect compared to intercropped components with similar water absorption space and root distribution mu et al 2013 water transport by roots is also an important mechanism for complementary utilization of water mendel et al 2003 sekiya et al 2010 the formation of efficient water utilization advantage in intercropping involves the physiological and ecological characteristics of intercrops as well as the competition and complementarity of intercropped components to water resources and related resources in time and space which is determined by the dynamics of competition and complementarity therefore analyzing the dynamics of competition and complementarity on water use of intercropping systems under water limited conditions and quantifying the relationship among water competition and complementarity and their synergistic effect and crop productivity are important theoretical bases for establishing efficient water saving irrigation technology for intercropping systems 5 regulation approaches to efficient water utilization in intercropping intercropping is an important croppig pattern for the sustainable development of agriculture especially in arid and semiarid region and under the condition of limited water resources to improve crop production and wue by integrating with main regulation approaches for optimizing soil moisture environment and interspecific interactions in intercropping systems such as crop species irrigation and fertilization regimes plant density spatial arrangement tillage and mulching practices and environmental factors table 2 integrating results from different studies could provide a basis for improving wue of intercropping systems through advanced understanding of approaches for optimizing interspecific interactions this would provide support for the development and adoption of intercropping systems in water deficient areas 5 1 crop species intercrops differ in their potential for competition and complementarity of limited resources li et al 2001b many studies have confirmed that monoculture does not necessarily produce high yield compared to total system yield in intercropping systems zhang et al 2012 previous research has shown that barley hordeum vulgare l is more competitive than pea in barley pea intercropping and yield and nitrogen uptake of intercropped barley were almost the same as that of sole barley while yield and nitrogen uptake of intercropped pea were less than half that of sole pea hauggaard nielsen and jensen 2001 additionally the interaction between pea varieties and planting patterns was significant in gramineae legume intercropping underground competition promotes stem growth in gramineae but not in legumes and greater competitiveness of gramineae crops is caused by stronger root competition mariotti et al 2009 studies have also shown that drought strongly affects the growth of sole crops and the effect on lai and pod number of sole peanut was much greater than that of intercropped peanut because interspecific complementarity of intercropping system has a stronger adaptation to drought soopramanien et al 1992 in wheat maize intercropping wheat is more competitive than maize during the co growth period and competes for soil water from the maize strips as a result soil evaporation in maize strips is reduced yin et al 2019b yin et al 2018b on the contrary after wheat harvest intercropped maize obtains compensatory soil water from the wheat strips thus soil evaporation in wheat strips is reduced yin et al 2018b yin et al 2019b these competitive and complementary effects also arise from the biological characteristics of different crops the different root configurations of various intercrops inevitably leads to the overlapping of root spatial distribution gao et al 2010 in the overlapping region of crop roots crop species that absorb water quickly and grow fast have an advantage over those that use soil water efficiently but grow slowly bramley et al 2007 during the intercropping between maize and legumes legumes can obtain the water below the root zone of maize and increase the water supply of maize by water lifting sekiya and yano 2004 slower growth rate in early stage of deep root cassava can reduce interspecific competition through root niche separation and dislocation of resource demand peak thus promoting the growth of dal cajanus cajan millsp and maize intercrops mafongoya et al 2006 according to the resource conditions in different regions and on the basis of understanding the biological characteristics of different crops reasonable allocation of different types of composite population can flexibly utilize different forms of complementary effects to achieve the goal of maximizing intercropping advantages 5 2 irrigation regime flood irrigation has been predominantly used for field crops which water losses from evaporation and leaching are very high chai et al 2014a as a result of the water saving campaign in recent years the development of regulated deficit alternate irrigation spray irrigation surface irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation technology has been recognized chai et al 2014a du et al 2010 regulated deficit alternate irrigation where one crop is irrigated while the other crop is exposed to drying soil as shown in fig 1 the wetting and drying of the root zone for the different crops is alternated at a frequency allowing the previously well watered side of the root zone to dry down while the previously dried side is fully irrigated chai et al 2016 intercropping components of crops have different water requirements so using alternate irrigation with appropriate water supply level can effectively reduce water consumption of intercropping systems by improving the coincidence between crop water requirements and water supply and increase wue medrano et al 2015 studies have shown that the application of alternate irrigation to wheat maize intercropping can save water by 16 and increase wue by 6 6 compared to conventional high level yang et al 2011 spray irrigation is currently being adopted in some small areas where main channels are paved with reinforced concrete and other ditches heading to the fields are equipped with plastic pipes the studies showed a 27 increase in cowpea yield and a 25 increase for potato crop while using spray irrigation instead of surface irrigation manjunatha et al 2000 water savings of 26 were achieved for cowpea and 37 for potato using spray irrigation compared to surface irrigation thus impring wue manjunatha et al 2000 pipe based spraying systems reduce average irrigation amounts by as much as 7500 m3 ha 1 and improve the water utilization rate by up to 80 compared to traditional irrigation systems jia and qian 2017 in arid regions drip irrigation have been gradually adopted in recent years this technology allows a small volume of soil to remain moist by frequent applications of low volumes of water du et al 2010 this limits the rooting zone to the moist and reduces water drainage from the rooting zone soil assouline et al 2002 du et al 2010 in particular subsurface drip irrigation substantially minimizes soil evaporation compared to surface drip irrigation and improves irrigation wue lamm and trooien 2003 in areas such as northwest china irrigation tubing and drippers are placed under the plastic film used to cover the soil surface fig 3 for the large enterprises and agriculture specialty companies drip irrigation is the most popular technology and is used to produce high value cash crops such as tomato sweet chili hops and grapes and grain crops such as wheat maize and potato when combined with plastic film mulching drip irrigation effectively reduces soil evaporation and saves water yang et al 2016 studies have shown that drip irrigation with plastic film mulching reduced water use of wheat maize intercropping by 48 61 compared to traditional flood irrigation at the same level of crop productivity su 2001 different soil water availability has different effects on water utilization by intercropping systems when soil water availability is high wue of cowpea vigna unguiculata walp maize intercropping is higher than that of the corresponding sole cropping however when soil water availability is low intercropping has greater wue than sole cowpea but lower wue than sole maize droppelmann et al 2000 in addition when the high growth period of intercrops coincides with the period of rainfall concentration actual water consumption of maize soybean intercropping system has been shown to be lower than that of the corresponding monoculture the coincidence between rainfall and water demand of intercropping is higher than that of sole cropping water consumption of intercropping is mainly for efficient transpiration of intercrops ren et al 2017a according to the water consumption characteristics of intercropping systems water resources can be effectively used with reasonable irrigation methods and levels to increase crop production and wue 5 3 fertilization regime managing fertilizer in conjunction with irrigation water is an important measure for water regulation in crop production ahlawat et al 1985 teng et al 2016 according to differences in nutrient demand of different component crops in intercropping timely and appropriate fertilization can enhance wue ghosh et al 2009 when nitrogen application rate is low in wheat maize intercropping intercropped wheat grows slowly and requires less water which reduces competition for water from maize strips thereby improving the soil water condition of intercropped maize strips li et al 2001b on the contrary when nitrogen application is high intercropped wheat grows vigorously and transpiration consumes more water than intercropped maize leading to competition for soil water from maize strips and reduced wue of wheat strips li et al 2001b yin et al 2018b postponed topdressing 15 of the total nitrogen fertilizer rate can reduce soil evaporation and the ratio of evaporation to water consumption e et in maize pea intercropping and improve crop productivity and wue teng et al 2016 additionally excessive fertilizer application can delay crop maturity and consume more soil water neugschwandtner and kaul 2014 the contribution rate of nitrogen fertilizer decreases with increased fertilizer application resulting in reduced yield and water utilization of intercrops wu et al 2014 therefore appropriate fertilization level is important for efficient utilization of soil water 5 4 plant density and spatial arrangement appropriate plant density is the basis for crops to make use of light and heat resources in the ecological environment to optimize the physiological indexes of crops rasekh et al 2010 the plant density of intercrops is usually higher than that of the corresponding sole cropping and greater plant density contributes to increased yield and resources use efficiency of intercropping systems echarte et al 2011 pal et al 1993 for the scientific application of dense density effects in intercropping researchers have conducted studies on resource utilization efficiency martin and snaydon 1982 population colony structure munz et al 2014 yang et al 2014 and the response mechanism of interspecific relationship neumann et al 2009 schroeder moreno and janos 2008 to plant density in intercropping systems appropriate plant density can enhance crop yield and wue by improving photosynthesis microclimate environment between populations and increasing root length density and root absorption area fan et al 2020 wang et al 2018 when the plant density of intercrops is too high adverse phenomena in plant morphology physiology and ecology can occur such as premature senescence antonietta et al 2014 slow leaf growth bos et al 2000 decreased panicle grain number maddonni and otegui 2006 decreased chlorophyll content and decreased interception of photosynthetic active radiation of the panicle leaf layer and sublayer antonietta et al 2014 but intercropping studies have not paid enough attention to them therefore it is important to study how plant density affects yield and wue of intercropping systems the spatial distribution of intercrops mainly refers to the occupation of different crops in the compound population inter row and intra row plant spacing the duration of the co existence period of the two intercrops a large number of studies show that interspecific interactions are important reason why total yield of intercropping systems different from that of sole cropping dhima et al 2007 intercrop strip widths significantly affects intercropping yield resource utilization efficiency and competitiveness dynamics and compensatory effect chen et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 when the strip width of barley and pea was 100 and 50 cm respectively rather than 50 and 100 cm respectively total nitrogen uptake of intercrops was significantly greater than that of the sole cropping hauggaard nielsen et al 2006 this indicates that there is a compensatory effect between the two intercrops which is mainly due to intercropped barley assimilating more nitrogen than pea thereby forcing pea to be more dependent on biological nitrogen fixation 5 5 tillage and mulching practices conservation tillage techniques such as reduced tillage or no tillage with straw retention can significantly improve crop yield and wue huang et al 2012 yin et al 2015 due to improved activity of crop roots and microorganisms creating a favorable surface soil structure for crop growth ji et al 2014 spedding et al 2004 straw mulching techniques with reduced tillage have also been studied in intercropping fan et al 2013 yin et al 2019b the results showed that no tillage with straw mulching significantly improved wue compared to straw incorporation and the increasing wue effect of intercropping was greater than that of monoculture yin et al 2015 no tillage changes soil physical and chemical properties rhoton et al 1993 improves soil porosity holthusen et al 2018 reduces soil evaporation baumhardt and jones 2002 and increases soil water infiltration rate and storage capacity dalmago et al 2010 hubert et al 2007 lipiec et al 2006 and straw mulching combined with no tillage further inhibits soil evaporation and thus reduces water consumption yin et al 2016b in strip intercropping systems during the early maturing crop growing period the early maturing crop roots may expend into the territory of the late maturing crop enabling the early maturity crop to compete for soil water in the late maturing crops strips ye et al 2005 however roots of the late maturing crop will extend into the early maturing crop s rooting regions after the early maturing crop has been harvested thereby absorbing some of the remaining but unused soil water resulting in a water compensation effect to the late maturing crop chen et al 2014 in terms of wheat maize intercropping after intercropped wheat has been harvested wheat straw mulching on the soil surface can conserve more soil water in the wheat strips and more soil water can then move from the wheat strips to the maize strips yin et al 2018b this movement compensates for the water requirement for growth of intercropped maize yin et al 2017 plastic mulching and straw residue are the two common soil water conservation measures which can enhance water infiltration and increase soil water retention chen et al 2007 ghosh et al 2006 previous research has shown that no tillage with straw residue and plastic mulching integrated into intercropping can reduce soil evaporation and improve wue compared with conventional tillage without straw retention and annual plastic mulching fan et al 2013 yin et al 2015 conventional tillage with annual new plastic mulching is associated with a higher soil temperature in the root zone at the flowering stage of crops resulting in root and leaf senescence thus reducing crop yield and water use bu et al 2013 however plastic mulching is imperative conserving soil moisture for maize production in arid areas which rely on irrigation for crop production gan et al 2013 therefore no tillage with residual plastic mulching combined with straw residue has been applied into intercropping in arid areas intercropping with no tillage and straw mulching in wheat strips and residual plastic mulching in maize strips has been shown to allow the greatest amount of the remaining unused water to move from wheat strips to maize strips while the conventional tillage treatment allowed the least yin et al 2019b these results show that no tillage with straw mulching in wheat strips combined with residual plastic mulching in maize strips can weaken soil water competition during the wheat growth period and strengthen water compensation during maize independent growth after wheat harvest and thereby maintain water balance between the intercrop strips yin et al 2018b these improved practices can result in efficient utilization of water by regulating the water competition and complementary utilization relationship 5 6 environmental factors interspecific interactions are influenced by environmental factors such as soil water available nutrients and light resources and these factors can strengthen or weaken interspecific relationships and place a crop in a strong dominant position sobkowicz 2006 and significantly affect the growth of intercrops dhima et al 2007 the main reason why environmental conditions affect interspecific relationships is that interspecific competition varies with resource availability hauggaard nielsen et al 2001 the position of different components in the community stratification changes correspondingly and the distribution pattern of assimilates of the intercrops are changed under competitive conditions so as to enhance the organ of obtaining limited resources james and cahill 2002 the resource competitiveness of intercropped components depends largely on the response of the crop itself to limiting factors intense competition between two intercrops may result in a decrease in the biomass and grain yields of one intercrop li et al 2001b however when the paired crop is removed or harvested a complementary effect on resource utilization is generated in time and space li et al 2001b yin et al 2017 this principle is also applied by optimizing tillage measures yin et al 2019a fertilization system hu et al 2016 and adjusting plant density yahuza 2012 to weaken competition between the two intercrops and enhance the recovery effect the time of competition for restricted resources can be shortened by means of external input and different external input means have different regulatory effects for instance the total productivity and wue of various intercropping systems can be increased by supplementary irrigation aggarwal and sidhu 1988 and optimizing nitrogen application system teng et al 2016 for maize string bean intercropping the effect of spatial distribution on leaf area index of sole and intercropped maize was not significant but irrigation could significantly improve leaf area index of maize and leaf area index of string bean is more sensitive to cropping pattern oljaca et al 2000 alternate root splitting irrigation improves crop wue via integrating with the root system crop physiological and biochemical characteristics and coupling water and fertilizer yang et al 2011 therefore it can be speculated that sprinkling irrigation enables intercrops to obtain roughly equal water resources which may lead to faster growth of highly competitive crops and a serious decline in the yield of vulnerable crops however drip irrigation can regulate crop growth and development by controlling the water supply of different crops which has the possibility of improving yield and wue especially drip irrigation under the plastic film mulching these studies illustrate the dynamics and complexity of competition and the complementary mechanism of crop coping with competition through niche separation studies on intercropping of wheat and barley found that competitiveness of barley is stronger than that of wheat and the effect of interspecific competition on intercropped wheat yield was greater than that of interspecific competition woldeamlak et al 2001 however the yield of barley was greatly affected by intraspecific competition and the niche differentiation index between the two crops was always greater than one demonstrating that niche differentiation promoted intercropping resource utilization more than interspecific competition woldeamlak et al 2001 therefore competition does not bring negative effects and moderate competition may be conducive to the improvement of comprehensive benefits in intercropping water distribution in intercropping is the result of dynamic interactions between intercrops roots and canopies and intercrops and the environment therefore the study of interactions between above and below ground components and crop and environment are the basis for revealing the adaptation of intercropping to water limited environments however previous studies on interspecific relationships of intercropping are usually based on data on crop harvesting at the same planting density and the conclusions about competitiveness or other indicators are relatively stable these conclusions cannot be used as the theoretical basis for the systematic and accurate development of water management in intercropping so the range of tolerance of intercropping groups to water competition needs to be further defined 6 prospects on key research fields for efficient water utilization in intercropping water capture and conversion rate are two important indexes of water use in intercropping the following factors should also be considered i to improve crop water availability soil water holding characteristics and crop water absorption characteristics should be considered ii increase the total amount of water absorbed from the soil iii increase the proportion of water consumed by effective transpiration of crops and iv increase the proportion of water absorption used in grain organs in previous studies on interspecific competition complementarity and crop water efficient utilization many results based on crop productivity measured at physiological maturity however there is limited information from studies revealing the dynamics of interspecific competition and complementarity as well as the interspecific ecological processes of competition complementarity and their synergistic effects on wue with above and below ground factors crop and water environment and time and space scales the integration of modern high efficiency water management technology and crop water physiological mechanisms has not been reported resulting in shortcomings in the theory and technology for improving intercropping wue through interspecific relationship regulation in addition the spatial and temporal distribution and physiological characteristics of roots are important factors in response to water changes and they are widely used in sole cropping research to tap the water saving potential of crops however results from intercropping studies on how to regulate root systems through spatio temporal variation of water supply and produce complementary utilization of water is rarely reported therefore future research should focus on competitive and complementary utilization of water in intercropping systems to i determine the dynamics of dry matter accumulation and allocation and irrigation water productivity to study compensation effects on water use in late maturing crops after the early maturing crops are harvested in intercropping systems and to clarify the correlation between wue of intercrops and interspecific interaction ii investigate spatio temporal dynamics of soil water potential and available soil water and analyze the relationships among soil water movements within interspecific competition and complementarity in order to provide theoretical basis for optimizing interspecific competition and complementarity under irrigation regulation iii evaluate the effects of intercropping on crop moisture physiological and ecological characteristics to reveal the complementary mechanism of interspecific interaction with respect to hydro physio ecological viability iv explore the correlations between root shoot equilibrium and spatiotemporal distribution of roots as well as water use characteristics and interspecific competition and complementarity to elucidate how the root shoot equilibrium works on improving wue via the synergistic effects of inter specific competition and complementarity by integrating the main results at different scales the theoretical basis for enhancing wue of intercropping through regulating interspecific interactions could be established which provides support for development and adoption of intercropping systems in water deficient areas 7 conclusion global food demands are expected to double by 2050 due to a growing human population and increased needs for feed fiber and biofuel to produce sufficient grain to meet demand family farms in populated countries must produce sufficient quantities of food to meet the ever growing population needs land and water shortages have become major constraints on agricultural production it is imperative to increase crop productivity per unit area thus strip intercropping based on crop diversification configuration has been widely applied in arid and semi arid regions due to high and stable productivity and efficient utilization of resources intercropping can increase water use efficiency wue of crops and optimize the soil moisture environment for crop growth and development competition and complementarity are two aspects of the same interspecific relationship between crops and a quantitative understanding of the competition and complementary effects of intercrops on soil resources is important for advancement of intercropping systems this paper has reviewed more than 150 publications on water utilization of strip intercropping and suggests that some of the water shortage issues can be effectively addressed by adopting innovative technologies to achieve water savings and efficient use of water without restraining future agricultural production the main factors regulating the efficient water utilization of intercropping were expounded from crop species irrigation and fertilization regimes plant density spatial arrangement tillage and mulching practices and environmental factors also a comprehensive efficient water utilization in intercropping system needs to be established integrating results from different studies could provide a basis for enhancing wue of intercropping through advanced understanding of approaches for regulating interspecific interactions this would provide support for the development and adoption of intercropping

overview of intercropping the advantages of intercropping in improving the efficiency of resource utilization have been demonstrated across the world ma et al 2017 martin guay et al 2017 intercropping is widely used as an important means to provide food security diversify cropping systems promote sustainable agricultural development and efficiently utilize limited labor on smallholder farms george and jeruto 2010 intercropping can increase the utilization efficiency of resources such as light heat water and fertilizer to effectively improve the primary production of land per unit area thereby making a significant contribution to global food security foley et al 2011 steen et al 2015 and increasing water production efficiency and economic benefit for farmers agegnehu et al 2008 yin et al 2018a with the gradual transformation of agricultural production from resource consuming to technology efficient improving the utilization efficiency of resources has become the top priority of intercropping research table 1 many researchers have explored the theory and practice of optimizing resource utilization efficiency from the perspectives of intercrop strip widths nurbakhsh et al 2015 intercrop species osunlaja et al 2010 spatial layout hauggaard nielsen et al 2006 morais et al 2018 sowing density and time ahmed et al 2018 fan et al 2020 nandy et al 2013 water and fertilizer regulation sawyer et al 2010 yang et al 2011 interspecific relationships hu et al 2016 allelopathy g√≥mez rodrƒ± guez et al 2003 and tillage and mulching practices yin et al 2018b a series of theoretical systems to guide intercropping application can be constructed from the interaction of heterogeneous individuals in a composite population to provide a solid support for the wide application of intercropping in recent years with increasing shortage of resources intercropping use has declined in water scarce areas due to its high water demand which can reduce the yield per unit of cultivated land chai et al 2014a therefore researchers should continue to focus on how to maximize the advantages of intercropping system and achieve stable yields while saving water this paper reviews the development of theory and technology of efficient water utilization of intercropping from across several paleoclimatic areas from the world in order to provide a basis for the optimization of highly efficient intercropping production technology 2 water use characteristics of intercropping 2 1 water consumption of intercropping the water consumption of intercropping during the entire growth period is greater than that of monoculture but the difference is smaller than the weighted mean value of corresponding water consumption in sole cropping morris and garrity 1993 researchers summarized previous research results and concluded that the water consumption of intercropping systems vary greatly due to environmental conditions and crop types morris and garrity 1993 however there is little difference compared to the weighted average of water consumption for the corresponding sole cropping systems morris and garrity 1993 therefore the development of intercropping has great potential in areas with sufficient water resources to meet the water requirements of high yielding sole cropping systems however in irrigated areas water consumption of intercropping is not a simple accumulation of water consumption of component crops and is less than the accumulation value due to water competition and complementary utilization effects during the growing season yin et al 2018b at present research on water consumption of intercropping mainly focuses on spatial distribution mao et al 2012 fertilization system teng et al 2016 irrigation method and system manjunatha et al 2000 and tillage and mulching practices yin et al 2018b optimal spatial layout of intercrop strips can reduce water consumption of intercropping for example maize zea mays l pea pisum sativum l strip intercropping with 4 4 model four rows of maize and four rows of pea reduced water consumption by 10 2 13 7 compared to sole cropping but maize pea strip intercropping with 2 4 model two rows of maize and four rows of pea increased water consumption by 12 5 19 8 compared to sole cropping mao et al 2012 it was found that the water consumption of maize pea intercropping was not significantly affected by nitrogen fertilizer was significantly greater than that of sole pea but did not differ with that of sole maize teng et al 2016 water consumption of intercropping was reduced by 16 1 and 15 3 by an alternate irrigation method fig 1 compared to flood irrigation at high and low water supply levels respectively yang et al 2011 limited water supply after the booting stage of wheat triticum aestivum l in wheat maize intercropping has been shown to save 15 irrigation water and reduce water consumption by 4 4 8 5 save 25 1 70 9 mm of soil water without significantly reducing crop productivity wang et al 2015 so reduction of water consumption by intercropping is based on reasonable crop collocation and appropriate irrigation and fertilization water consumption can also be reduced by optimizing tillage practices and mulching methods for example reduced tillage with straw and plastic mulching in wheat maize intercropping has been shown to reduce water consumption by 3 6 4 6 yin et al 2015 these findings showed that water consumption in intercropping can be reduced by integrating water regulation measures commonly used in monoculture 2 2 soil evaporation of intercropping soil evaporation plays an important role in the total water consumption by cropping systems therefore it is important to take appropriate control measures to reduce it yin et al 2019b previous studies have shown that soil evaporation during the whole growth period of intercropping was greater than that of sole cropping due to the longer growth period of intercropping but daily soil evaporation of intercropping was less than that of sole cropping indicating that intercropping has a significant advantage over sole cropping in improving crop water availability fan et al 2013 gao et al 2013 yin et al 2019b over the years research has revealed strategies to reduce ineffective field water consumption such as soil evaporation through optimization of irrigation levels fertilization systems mulching methods and tillage practices compared to conventional flood irrigation alternate irrigation can significantly reduce evaporation of soil water by 17 7 31 9 in wheat maize intercropping yang et al 2011 postponed topdressing of nitrogen fertilizer can reduce soil evaporation of maize pea intercropping by 15 30 compared to conventional fertilizer for farmer teng et al 2016 the application of no tillage with straw mulching in intercropping significantly reduced soil evaporation by 5 8 13 1 compared to conventional tillage without straw retention fan et al 2013 the integration of no tillage with straw mulching in wheat strips and residual plastic film mulching in maize strips can further restrain soil evaporation 32 71 mm by 9 0 17 3 compared to conventional tillage without straw retention in wheat strips and annual plastic film mulching in maize strips and no tillage with straw mulching measure in the intercropping system could favorably reduce soil evaporation yin et al 2018b 2 3 yield and water use efficiency of intercropping intercropping plays an important role in ensuring high and stable crop yields and addressing food security under growing shortages of irrigation water and arable land chai et al 2014b intercropping can increase total crop production and the ratio of production to investment by optimizing population structure and interspecific relationships between intercrops hu et al 2016 increasing the use of resources such as light water and nutrients thorsted et al 2006 and synchronously increasing intercropping component yield huang et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 additionally under low yielding environments intercropping can achieve yield stability by reducing pests and diseases and increasing land management brooker et al 2015 intercropping has a significant yield advantage over sole cropping fig 2 which has been verified for a variety of intercrop combinations including wheat maize yin et al 2016a maize pea hu et al 2016 jujube ziziphus jujuba mill wheat wang et al 2014 maize potato solanum tuberosum l chapagain et al 2012 and alfalfa medicago sativa maize sun et al 2014 however if the combination of intercrops is not appropriate and the spatial layout is not considered the lower yield of the component crops compared to sole cropping is more obvious banik et al 2008 previous study showed that when nitrogen application level is higher than 120 kg n ha 1 vegetative growth period is prolonged and grain filling of oat and pea is reduced resulting in lower yield of oat pea intercropping in eastern austria neugschwandtner and kaul 2014 when irrigation amount and fertilizer application are low crop growth and development appear lack of water and fertilizer phenomenon and reduce crop production jannoura et al 2014 therefore reasonable crop collocation spatial distribution and suitable irrigation and fertilization regimes are important for maximizing the yield advantage of intercropping compared to sole cropping the advantage of efficient water utilization in intercropping results from spatiotemporal differences in water demand between intercrops dong et al 2018 according to the characteristics of crop water requirement reasonable design of irrigation amount and time is important to improve the compatibility between crop water requirements and water supply morris and garrity 1993 also through optimized tillage and mulching measures the consistency between water requirement for crop growth and water supply was enhanced to improve wue of intercropping yin et al 2016b yin et al 2018b straw mulching integrated into wheat maize intercropping can improve soil water utilization by regulating the soil water environment for example no tillage with straw mulching in wheat maize intercropping system increased wue by 15 1 20 0 and 15 5 16 3 respectively compared to intercropping without straw retention and corresponding sole maize yin et al 2015 these results show that the application of no tillage with straw mulching in intercropping can improve water use more than that in sole cropping postponed topdressing of nitrogen fertilizers increased wue of intercropping by 5 1 compared to conventional fertilization system for farmers teng et al 2016 therefore through the optimization of tillage and fertilization practices the utilization of deep soil water by crop roots can be promoted and the coupling effect of water and nitrogen can be exerted thus increasing water and fertilizer use efficiency however intercropping may not have the advantage of increasing wue when crop layout or variety combination is unreasonable grema and hess 1994 the reasonable intercropping system can achieve high yield and water utilization in order to further enhance the yield increase and the beneficial effects of intercropping future research is needed to understand how to integrate the water saving measures commonly used in sole cropping into intercropping and increase efficient water utilization in intercropping system to enhance the sustainability of agricultural production 3 interspecies relationships of intercropping competition and complementation are two main types of interspecific interactions callaway and walker 1997 yin et al 2017 they coexist and play a crucial role in promoting the productivity of intercropping systems hauggaard nielsen and jensen 2005 zhang and li 2003 crops with different characteristics of resource demand provide the basis for niche differentiation in time and space utilization and promote the efficient utilization of related resources by inter species complementarity or one crop directly provides resources for another crop takim 2012 therefore interspecific competition promotes the use of different resources because intercrops utilize a given resource based on space time differences mehrhoff and turkington 1996 also interspecific complementation refers to the fact that the resource utilization should be greater than the interspecific competition zhang and li 2003 and interspecific complementation is produced via one crop promoting the growth of another crop callaway 1995 yin et al 2019a b quantifying the competition and complementary effects of intercrops on soil resources is an important issue in intercropping research chen et al 2014 yin et al 2019a the yield advantage of intercropping over monoculture depends on the net effect of intercropping on complementary and competition for growth resources garc√≠a barrios and ong 2004 when analyzing the effects of inter species competition and complementarity on resource utilization many assume that the two functions are mutually exclusive but this is not always the case for example with inter species complementary utilization of light resources competition for nutrient and water may occur simultaneously also the resource competition in the early growth stage of intercropping crops may evolve into complementary effect of sharing resources in later growth stages especially following the harvest of an early maturity intercrop yin et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 in addition the competitive disadvantage formed in the period of crop symbiosis may be recovered after the early maturity crop harvest which shows a strong recovery effect li et al 2001a therefore the transition from interspecific competition to complementation is an important period of agronomic regulation and the main goal of interspecific regulation is to delay the intersection of complementation and competition the complementary use of limited resources indicates weakening of the competitive effect and formation of a yield advantage for intercropping it is important to quantify the interspecific competitive and complementary effects in combination with the growth and development of intercrops and the dynamic change of growth factor supply for optimization of intercropping systems 4 mechanisms of efficient water utilization in intercropping 4 1 physiological basis of efficient water utilization in intercropping the photosynthetic and physiological characteristics of plants are the basis for their productivity and have important influence on their growth and development jiao et al 2017 in a specific intercropping system nitrogen fertilizer has an influence on the physiological characteristics of crops across maize cotton and maize soybean intercropping systems with different nitrogen levels intercropped maize had greater net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance compared to sole maize but the improvement effect of these variables gradually weakened with increased nitrogen application zhang et al 2014 the typical maize peanut arachis hypogaea linn intercropping system with tall and low collocation has population structure similar to an umbrella which is beneficial to improve the transmittance and interception rate of light energy of the composite population awal et al 2006 maddonni et al 2001 compared to sole cropping chloroplast composition and photosynthetic characteristics of intercropped maize and peanut were changed and the utilization of weak light in peanut and strong light in maize was promoted jiao et al 2006 higher photosynthetic product accumulation and conversion rate in the middle and late stages of the intercropping system is another reason for the significant yield increase of maize peanut intercropping jiao et al 2006 from the end of vegetative growth to the reproductive growth period of maize leaf photosynthetic rate transpiration rate stomatal conductance carboxylation efficiency and maximum electron transfer rate of maize intercropped with peanut were higher than sole maize yang and chai 2016 additionally increasing strip with of maize peanut intercropping can further enhance the increasing effect of the above indexes and the appropriate application of phosphorus can enhance the utilization of light and delay the aging of maize jiao et al 2016 in wheat broad bean vicia faba l intercropping relative water content chlorophyll content and water potential of leaves of broad bean and wheat were significantly increased by intercropping compared to sole cropping yang and chai 2016 compared to traditional flood irrigation chlorophyll content of broad bean and wheat leaves in intercropping was increased with alternative irrigation method but relative water content and water potential of leaves were decreased yang and chai 2016 according to the growth and development characteristics of intercrops alternate irrigation can increase yield and resource use efficiency by improving physiological characteristics of intercrops thus alternate irrigation is an appropriate water supply method for intercropping intercropping is beneficial for increasing the photosynthetic source leaf area index i e lai and leaf area duration i e lad and promoting the movement of photosynthetic compounds from vegetative organs to grain thereby enhancing wue by increasing yield yin et al 2017 in maize cotton and maize soybean intercropping systems with different nitrogen application levels intercropping increased grain yield compared with sole cropping zhang et al 2014 the main direct reasons for this were caused by the improvement of lai and photosynthesis and the indirect reason was the increase of leaf chlorophyll content zhang et al 2014 the grain yield of intercropped soybean and maize was higher than that of the corresponding sole crops which was attributed to higher photosynthetic radiation utilization rate rue and lai of intercropping liu et al 2017 similarly in a wheat maize intercropping system with straw mulching of wheat and plastic mulching of maize increased yield of the intercropping system compared to the corresponding sole cropping was associated with increased lai yin et al 2016a the main contribution to the increase in total yield of wheat plus maize in the intercropping system was from maize yin et al 2016a this was because straw mulching after wheat harvest enhanced water retention so that more soil water could be compensated to the maize strips to meet the water demand in the vigorous reproductive period of maize yin et al 2018b in summary intercropping can increase dry matter accumulation rate enhanced the transfer of photosynthetic products from vegetative organs to grain and realized the compensatory growth effect based on the dry matter accumulation rate and the super compensatory effect of dry matter distribution and translocation yin et al 2017 4 2 ecological basis of efficient water utilization in intercropping competition is a key factor affecting crop growth water utilization and yield formation of intercropping systems nassab et al 2011 previous studies showed that when inter species competition is less than intra species competition inter species competition is conducive to improving wue forming intercropping advantages and improving yield stability of the intercropping system schroeder moreno and janos 2008 in agricultural production two or more crops with differing growth periods and morphological characteristics are combined in the same production system to form a compensation effect in time and space for efficient utilization of resources horton and hart 1998 yin et al 2017 in terms of the compensation effect in time except for the extension of the total growth period of the composite population and the increase of leaf area duration the inhibitory effect of competition on the late maturity crop during the co growth period of intercrops could be significantly recovered after the harvest of the early maturity crop li et al 2001b for instance in wheat maize or wheat soybean intercropping systems growth and nutrient uptake of the subsidiary maize or soybean was suppressed prior to wheat harvest due to interspecific competition but after harvest of the early maturity wheat the later maturity maize or soybean recovered producing a significant compensatory effect zhang and li 2003 in terms of the compensation effect in space the basic conclusion of canopy complementation is that canopy structure with high and low collocation in intercropping is more conducive to air flow than that of sole cropping with consistent canopy structure morris and garrity 1993 in particular the open canopy of tall crops is conducive to reducing diffusion resistance of the boundary layer changing the gradient of leaf gas and water vapor or the diffusion resistance of the boundary layer stomata and leaf morris and garrity 1993 when the water absorption space and root distribution of intercropped components are different which can produce a greater complementary effect compared to intercropped components with similar water absorption space and root distribution mu et al 2013 water transport by roots is also an important mechanism for complementary utilization of water mendel et al 2003 sekiya et al 2010 the formation of efficient water utilization advantage in intercropping involves the physiological and ecological characteristics of intercrops as well as the competition and complementarity of intercropped components to water resources and related resources in time and space which is determined by the dynamics of competition and complementarity therefore analyzing the dynamics of competition and complementarity on water use of intercropping systems under water limited conditions and quantifying the relationship among water competition and complementarity and their synergistic effect and crop productivity are important theoretical bases for establishing efficient water saving irrigation technology for intercropping systems 5 regulation approaches to efficient water utilization in intercropping intercropping is an important croppig pattern for the sustainable development of agriculture especially in arid and semiarid region and under the condition of limited water resources to improve crop production and wue by integrating with main regulation approaches for optimizing soil moisture environment and interspecific interactions in intercropping systems such as crop species irrigation and fertilization regimes plant density spatial arrangement tillage and mulching practices and environmental factors table 2 integrating results from different studies could provide a basis for improving wue of intercropping systems through advanced understanding of approaches for optimizing interspecific interactions this would provide support for the development and adoption of intercropping systems in water deficient areas 5 1 crop species intercrops differ in their potential for competition and complementarity of limited resources li et al 2001b many studies have confirmed that monoculture does not necessarily produce high yield compared to total system yield in intercropping systems zhang et al 2012 previous research has shown that barley hordeum vulgare l is more competitive than pea in barley pea intercropping and yield and nitrogen uptake of intercropped barley were almost the same as that of sole barley while yield and nitrogen uptake of intercropped pea were less than half that of sole pea hauggaard nielsen and jensen 2001 additionally the interaction between pea varieties and planting patterns was significant in gramineae legume intercropping underground competition promotes stem growth in gramineae but not in legumes and greater competitiveness of gramineae crops is caused by stronger root competition mariotti et al 2009 studies have also shown that drought strongly affects the growth of sole crops and the effect on lai and pod number of sole peanut was much greater than that of intercropped peanut because interspecific complementarity of intercropping system has a stronger adaptation to drought soopramanien et al 1992 in wheat maize intercropping wheat is more competitive than maize during the co growth period and competes for soil water from the maize strips as a result soil evaporation in maize strips is reduced yin et al 2019b yin et al 2018b on the contrary after wheat harvest intercropped maize obtains compensatory soil water from the wheat strips thus soil evaporation in wheat strips is reduced yin et al 2018b yin et al 2019b these competitive and complementary effects also arise from the biological characteristics of different crops the different root configurations of various intercrops inevitably leads to the overlapping of root spatial distribution gao et al 2010 in the overlapping region of crop roots crop species that absorb water quickly and grow fast have an advantage over those that use soil water efficiently but grow slowly bramley et al 2007 during the intercropping between maize and legumes legumes can obtain the water below the root zone of maize and increase the water supply of maize by water lifting sekiya and yano 2004 slower growth rate in early stage of deep root cassava can reduce interspecific competition through root niche separation and dislocation of resource demand peak thus promoting the growth of dal cajanus cajan millsp and maize intercrops mafongoya et al 2006 according to the resource conditions in different regions and on the basis of understanding the biological characteristics of different crops reasonable allocation of different types of composite population can flexibly utilize different forms of complementary effects to achieve the goal of maximizing intercropping advantages 5 2 irrigation regime flood irrigation has been predominantly used for field crops which water losses from evaporation and leaching are very high chai et al 2014a as a result of the water saving campaign in recent years the development of regulated deficit alternate irrigation spray irrigation surface irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation technology has been recognized chai et al 2014a du et al 2010 regulated deficit alternate irrigation where one crop is irrigated while the other crop is exposed to drying soil as shown in fig 1 the wetting and drying of the root zone for the different crops is alternated at a frequency allowing the previously well watered side of the root zone to dry down while the previously dried side is fully irrigated chai et al 2016 intercropping components of crops have different water requirements so using alternate irrigation with appropriate water supply level can effectively reduce water consumption of intercropping systems by improving the coincidence between crop water requirements and water supply and increase wue medrano et al 2015 studies have shown that the application of alternate irrigation to wheat maize intercropping can save water by 16 and increase wue by 6 6 compared to conventional high level yang et al 2011 spray irrigation is currently being adopted in some small areas where main channels are paved with reinforced concrete and other ditches heading to the fields are equipped with plastic pipes the studies showed a 27 increase in cowpea yield and a 25 increase for potato crop while using spray irrigation instead of surface irrigation manjunatha et al 2000 water savings of 26 were achieved for cowpea and 37 for potato using spray irrigation compared to surface irrigation thus impring wue manjunatha et al 2000 pipe based spraying systems reduce average irrigation amounts by as much as 7500 m3 ha 1 and improve the water utilization rate by up to 80 compared to traditional irrigation systems jia and qian 2017 in arid regions drip irrigation have been gradually adopted in recent years this technology allows a small volume of soil to remain moist by frequent applications of low volumes of water du et al 2010 this limits the rooting zone to the moist and reduces water drainage from the rooting zone soil assouline et al 2002 du et al 2010 in particular subsurface drip irrigation substantially minimizes soil evaporation compared to surface drip irrigation and improves irrigation wue lamm and trooien 2003 in areas such as northwest china irrigation tubing and drippers are placed under the plastic film used to cover the soil surface fig 3 for the large enterprises and agriculture specialty companies drip irrigation is the most popular technology and is used to produce high value cash crops such as tomato sweet chili hops and grapes and grain crops such as wheat maize and potato when combined with plastic film mulching drip irrigation effectively reduces soil evaporation and saves water yang et al 2016 studies have shown that drip irrigation with plastic film mulching reduced water use of wheat maize intercropping by 48 61 compared to traditional flood irrigation at the same level of crop productivity su 2001 different soil water availability has different effects on water utilization by intercropping systems when soil water availability is high wue of cowpea vigna unguiculata walp maize intercropping is higher than that of the corresponding sole cropping however when soil water availability is low intercropping has greater wue than sole cowpea but lower wue than sole maize droppelmann et al 2000 in addition when the high growth period of intercrops coincides with the period of rainfall concentration actual water consumption of maize soybean intercropping system has been shown to be lower than that of the corresponding monoculture the coincidence between rainfall and water demand of intercropping is higher than that of sole cropping water consumption of intercropping is mainly for efficient transpiration of intercrops ren et al 2017a according to the water consumption characteristics of intercropping systems water resources can be effectively used with reasonable irrigation methods and levels to increase crop production and wue 5 3 fertilization regime managing fertilizer in conjunction with irrigation water is an important measure for water regulation in crop production ahlawat et al 1985 teng et al 2016 according to differences in nutrient demand of different component crops in intercropping timely and appropriate fertilization can enhance wue ghosh et al 2009 when nitrogen application rate is low in wheat maize intercropping intercropped wheat grows slowly and requires less water which reduces competition for water from maize strips thereby improving the soil water condition of intercropped maize strips li et al 2001b on the contrary when nitrogen application is high intercropped wheat grows vigorously and transpiration consumes more water than intercropped maize leading to competition for soil water from maize strips and reduced wue of wheat strips li et al 2001b yin et al 2018b postponed topdressing 15 of the total nitrogen fertilizer rate can reduce soil evaporation and the ratio of evaporation to water consumption e et in maize pea intercropping and improve crop productivity and wue teng et al 2016 additionally excessive fertilizer application can delay crop maturity and consume more soil water neugschwandtner and kaul 2014 the contribution rate of nitrogen fertilizer decreases with increased fertilizer application resulting in reduced yield and water utilization of intercrops wu et al 2014 therefore appropriate fertilization level is important for efficient utilization of soil water 5 4 plant density and spatial arrangement appropriate plant density is the basis for crops to make use of light and heat resources in the ecological environment to optimize the physiological indexes of crops rasekh et al 2010 the plant density of intercrops is usually higher than that of the corresponding sole cropping and greater plant density contributes to increased yield and resources use efficiency of intercropping systems echarte et al 2011 pal et al 1993 for the scientific application of dense density effects in intercropping researchers have conducted studies on resource utilization efficiency martin and snaydon 1982 population colony structure munz et al 2014 yang et al 2014 and the response mechanism of interspecific relationship neumann et al 2009 schroeder moreno and janos 2008 to plant density in intercropping systems appropriate plant density can enhance crop yield and wue by improving photosynthesis microclimate environment between populations and increasing root length density and root absorption area fan et al 2020 wang et al 2018 when the plant density of intercrops is too high adverse phenomena in plant morphology physiology and ecology can occur such as premature senescence antonietta et al 2014 slow leaf growth bos et al 2000 decreased panicle grain number maddonni and otegui 2006 decreased chlorophyll content and decreased interception of photosynthetic active radiation of the panicle leaf layer and sublayer antonietta et al 2014 but intercropping studies have not paid enough attention to them therefore it is important to study how plant density affects yield and wue of intercropping systems the spatial distribution of intercrops mainly refers to the occupation of different crops in the compound population inter row and intra row plant spacing the duration of the co existence period of the two intercrops a large number of studies show that interspecific interactions are important reason why total yield of intercropping systems different from that of sole cropping dhima et al 2007 intercrop strip widths significantly affects intercropping yield resource utilization efficiency and competitiveness dynamics and compensatory effect chen et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 when the strip width of barley and pea was 100 and 50 cm respectively rather than 50 and 100 cm respectively total nitrogen uptake of intercrops was significantly greater than that of the sole cropping hauggaard nielsen et al 2006 this indicates that there is a compensatory effect between the two intercrops which is mainly due to intercropped barley assimilating more nitrogen than pea thereby forcing pea to be more dependent on biological nitrogen fixation 5 5 tillage and mulching practices conservation tillage techniques such as reduced tillage or no tillage with straw retention can significantly improve crop yield and wue huang et al 2012 yin et al 2015 due to improved activity of crop roots and microorganisms creating a favorable surface soil structure for crop growth ji et al 2014 spedding et al 2004 straw mulching techniques with reduced tillage have also been studied in intercropping fan et al 2013 yin et al 2019b the results showed that no tillage with straw mulching significantly improved wue compared to straw incorporation and the increasing wue effect of intercropping was greater than that of monoculture yin et al 2015 no tillage changes soil physical and chemical properties rhoton et al 1993 improves soil porosity holthusen et al 2018 reduces soil evaporation baumhardt and jones 2002 and increases soil water infiltration rate and storage capacity dalmago et al 2010 hubert et al 2007 lipiec et al 2006 and straw mulching combined with no tillage further inhibits soil evaporation and thus reduces water consumption yin et al 2016b in strip intercropping systems during the early maturing crop growing period the early maturing crop roots may expend into the territory of the late maturing crop enabling the early maturity crop to compete for soil water in the late maturing crops strips ye et al 2005 however roots of the late maturing crop will extend into the early maturing crop s rooting regions after the early maturing crop has been harvested thereby absorbing some of the remaining but unused soil water resulting in a water compensation effect to the late maturing crop chen et al 2014 in terms of wheat maize intercropping after intercropped wheat has been harvested wheat straw mulching on the soil surface can conserve more soil water in the wheat strips and more soil water can then move from the wheat strips to the maize strips yin et al 2018b this movement compensates for the water requirement for growth of intercropped maize yin et al 2017 plastic mulching and straw residue are the two common soil water conservation measures which can enhance water infiltration and increase soil water retention chen et al 2007 ghosh et al 2006 previous research has shown that no tillage with straw residue and plastic mulching integrated into intercropping can reduce soil evaporation and improve wue compared with conventional tillage without straw retention and annual plastic mulching fan et al 2013 yin et al 2015 conventional tillage with annual new plastic mulching is associated with a higher soil temperature in the root zone at the flowering stage of crops resulting in root and leaf senescence thus reducing crop yield and water use bu et al 2013 however plastic mulching is imperative conserving soil moisture for maize production in arid areas which rely on irrigation for crop production gan et al 2013 therefore no tillage with residual plastic mulching combined with straw residue has been applied into intercropping in arid areas intercropping with no tillage and straw mulching in wheat strips and residual plastic mulching in maize strips has been shown to allow the greatest amount of the remaining unused water to move from wheat strips to maize strips while the conventional tillage treatment allowed the least yin et al 2019b these results show that no tillage with straw mulching in wheat strips combined with residual plastic mulching in maize strips can weaken soil water competition during the wheat growth period and strengthen water compensation during maize independent growth after wheat harvest and thereby maintain water balance between the intercrop strips yin et al 2018b these improved practices can result in efficient utilization of water by regulating the water competition and complementary utilization relationship 5 6 environmental factors interspecific interactions are influenced by environmental factors such as soil water available nutrients and light resources and these factors can strengthen or weaken interspecific relationships and place a crop in a strong dominant position sobkowicz 2006 and significantly affect the growth of intercrops dhima et al 2007 the main reason why environmental conditions affect interspecific relationships is that interspecific competition varies with resource availability hauggaard nielsen et al 2001 the position of different components in the community stratification changes correspondingly and the distribution pattern of assimilates of the intercrops are changed under competitive conditions so as to enhance the organ of obtaining limited resources james and cahill 2002 the resource competitiveness of intercropped components depends largely on the response of the crop itself to limiting factors intense competition between two intercrops may result in a decrease in the biomass and grain yields of one intercrop li et al 2001b however when the paired crop is removed or harvested a complementary effect on resource utilization is generated in time and space li et al 2001b yin et al 2017 this principle is also applied by optimizing tillage measures yin et al 2019a fertilization system hu et al 2016 and adjusting plant density yahuza 2012 to weaken competition between the two intercrops and enhance the recovery effect the time of competition for restricted resources can be shortened by means of external input and different external input means have different regulatory effects for instance the total productivity and wue of various intercropping systems can be increased by supplementary irrigation aggarwal and sidhu 1988 and optimizing nitrogen application system teng et al 2016 for maize string bean intercropping the effect of spatial distribution on leaf area index of sole and intercropped maize was not significant but irrigation could significantly improve leaf area index of maize and leaf area index of string bean is more sensitive to cropping pattern oljaca et al 2000 alternate root splitting irrigation improves crop wue via integrating with the root system crop physiological and biochemical characteristics and coupling water and fertilizer yang et al 2011 therefore it can be speculated that sprinkling irrigation enables intercrops to obtain roughly equal water resources which may lead to faster growth of highly competitive crops and a serious decline in the yield of vulnerable crops however drip irrigation can regulate crop growth and development by controlling the water supply of different crops which has the possibility of improving yield and wue especially drip irrigation under the plastic film mulching these studies illustrate the dynamics and complexity of competition and the complementary mechanism of crop coping with competition through niche separation studies on intercropping of wheat and barley found that competitiveness of barley is stronger than that of wheat and the effect of interspecific competition on intercropped wheat yield was greater than that of interspecific competition woldeamlak et al 2001 however the yield of barley was greatly affected by intraspecific competition and the niche differentiation index between the two crops was always greater than one demonstrating that niche differentiation promoted intercropping resource utilization more than interspecific competition woldeamlak et al 2001 therefore competition does not bring negative effects and moderate competition may be conducive to the improvement of comprehensive benefits in intercropping water distribution in intercropping is the result of dynamic interactions between intercrops roots and canopies and intercrops and the environment therefore the study of interactions between above and below ground components and crop and environment are the basis for revealing the adaptation of intercropping to water limited environments however previous studies on interspecific relationships of intercropping are usually based on data on crop harvesting at the same planting density and the conclusions about competitiveness or other indicators are relatively stable these conclusions cannot be used as the theoretical basis for the systematic and accurate development of water management in intercropping so the range of tolerance of intercropping groups to water competition needs to be further defined 6 prospects on key research fields for efficient water utilization in intercropping water capture and conversion rate are two important indexes of water use in intercropping the following factors should also be considered i to improve crop water availability soil water holding characteristics and crop water absorption characteristics should be considered ii increase the total amount of water absorbed from the soil iii increase the proportion of water consumed by effective transpiration of crops and iv increase the proportion of water absorption used in grain organs in previous studies on interspecific competition complementarity and crop water efficient utilization many results based on crop productivity measured at physiological maturity however there is limited information from studies revealing the dynamics of interspecific competition and complementarity as well as the interspecific ecological processes of competition complementarity and their synergistic effects on wue with above and below ground factors crop and water environment and time and space scales the integration of modern high efficiency water management technology and crop water physiological mechanisms has not been reported resulting in shortcomings in the theory and technology for improving intercropping wue through interspecific relationship regulation in addition the spatial and temporal distribution and physiological characteristics of roots are important factors in response to water changes and they are widely used in sole cropping research to tap the water saving potential of crops however results from intercropping studies on how to regulate root systems through spatio temporal variation of water supply and produce complementary utilization of water is rarely reported therefore future research should focus on competitive and complementary utilization of water in intercropping systems to i determine the dynamics of dry matter accumulation and allocation and irrigation water productivity to study compensation effects on water use in late maturing crops after the early maturing crops are harvested in intercropping systems and to clarify the correlation between wue of intercrops and interspecific interaction ii investigate spatio temporal dynamics of soil water potential and available soil water and analyze the relationships among soil water movements within interspecific competition and complementarity in order to provide theoretical basis for optimizing interspecific competition and complementarity under irrigation regulation iii evaluate the effects of intercropping on crop moisture physiological and ecological characteristics to reveal the complementary mechanism of interspecific interaction with respect to hydro physio ecological viability iv explore the correlations between root shoot equilibrium and spatiotemporal distribution of roots as well as water use characteristics and interspecific competition and complementarity to elucidate how the root shoot equilibrium works on improving wue via the synergistic effects of inter specific competition and complementarity by integrating the main results at different scales the theoretical basis for enhancing wue of intercropping through regulating interspecific interactions could be established which provides support for development and adoption of intercropping systems in water deficient areas 7 conclusion global food demands are expected to double by 2050 due to a growing human population and increased needs for feed fiber and biofuel to produce sufficient grain to meet demand family farms in populated countries must produce sufficient quantities of food to meet the ever growing population needs land and water shortages have become major constraints on agricultural production it is imperative to increase crop productivity per unit area thus strip intercropping based on crop diversification configuration has been widely applied in arid and semi arid regions due to high and stable productivity and efficient utilization of resources intercropping can increase water use efficiency wue of crops and optimize the soil moisture environment for crop growth and development competition and complementarity are two aspects of the same interspecific relationship between crops and a quantitative understanding of the competition and complementary effects of intercrops on soil resources is important for advancement of intercropping systems this paper has reviewed more than 150 publications on water utilization of strip intercropping and suggests that some of the water shortage issues can be effectively addressed by adopting innovative technologies to achieve water savings and efficient use of water without restraining future agricultural production the main factors regulating the efficient water utilization of intercropping were expounded from crop species irrigation and fertilization regimes plant density spatial arrangement tillage and mulching practices and environmental factors also a comprehensive efficient water utilization in intercropping system needs to be established integrating results from different studies could provide a basis for enhancing wue of intercropping through advanced understanding of approaches for regulating interspecific interactions this would provide support for the development and adoption of intercropping

10464,stomata are the channels by which plants exchange water vapor and carbon dioxide with the environment clarifying the change from stomatal limitations sl to non stomatal limitations nsl of photosynthesis and their critical conditions is vital for accurately recognizing the degree of crop drought and formulating countermeasures a field experiment was carried out from 2013 to 2015 to study the critical water conditions when maize photosynthesis changed from being limited by sl to nsl in different leaf positions under different degrees of water stress in different growth stages 3rd leaf stage 7th leaf stage and jointing stage our results indicated that photosynthesis of maize leaves at different positions changed from being determined by sl to nsl under different water stress levels at different growth stages moreover maize photosynthesis changed from being directed by sl to nsl in the first fully expanded leaf at the top before the changes occurred in the third leaf the effect of water stress during different growth stages on the maize leaf water content lwc at which photosynthesis changed from being limited by sl to nsl was not distinct the changing point of sl at different leaf positions was closely related to the lwc and the lwc at the changing point of sl was different at different leaf positions which indicated that the change in sl is mainly determined by the leaf position and lwc and its occurrence showed a decreasing trend from plant top to bottom the lwc at which the sl transformation point occurred in the first fully expanded leaf at the top 75 5 1 5 75 7 1 3 was higher than that at which the change occurred in the third leaf at the top 73 2 1 1 73 4 1 6 the phenomenon of photosynthesis changing from being limited by sl to nsl occurred first in the first fully expanded leaf at the top additionally the lwc of the first fully expanded leaf at the top was the best indicator in maize under water stress and could be used as the critical condition marking the transformation of maize damage from water stress to damage from plant physiological and ecological stress these results could provide a basis for the identification of crop drought disasters and their classification and provide a methodological reference for the identification and monitoring of drought in other crops keywords maize leaf water content photosynthesis stomatal limitations non stomatal limitations critical water conditions 1 introduction drought is a common issue in agricultural production worldwide china s annual crop reduction caused by drought amounts to 700 800 1010 kg which exceeds the total loss from other adverse factors hao and singh 2015 song et al 2018 water shortage is not only a major factor affecting crop growth but also an important factor restricting agricultural and economic development li et al 2019a global warming in recent years has led to changes in rainfall patterns and increases in extreme rainfall and evaporation and water deficit has become a crucial constraint on agricultural production grayson 2013 avramova et al 2015 liu et al 2018 photosynthesis is the basis of plant biological activities bian et al 2019 drought stress reduces photosynthesis affects the accumulation of organic matter and ultimately leads to crop yield reduction parry et al 2002 zhang et al 2005 monneveux et al 2006 generally the reduction in plant photosynthesis caused by drought is mainly caused by stomatal limitations sl and non stomatal limitations nsl farquhar and sharkey 1982 zhang et al 2010 under mild and moderate drought stress the leaf water potential continues to decrease with the loss of water in plant leaves tombesi et al 2015 bhusal et al 2019 the opening of the stomata decreases leading to an increase in stomatal resistance thus the co2 entering the stomata decreases and at the same time the intercellular co2 concentration decreases which eventually leads to a reduction in crop photosynthesis chaves et al 2008 laura et al 2012 buckley and mott 2013 cai et al 2015 the increase in stomatal resistance will also reduce the loss of water dispersion in the leaf hinder the further development of the water deficit and reduce the damage to photosynthetic organs from water stress at this stage sl is a main factor leading to the reduction of photosynthesis once the drought stress is relieved the stomata reopens and plant photosynthesis returns to its original level flexas et al 2009 campos et al 2014 with the further development of drought conditions the opening of plant stomata continues to decrease stomata may even close and the entry of co2 into leaves is blocked as a result o2 becomes a receptor for electron transfer in plant cells flexas et al 2004 the rate of plant oxidation and generation of reactive oxygen free radicals increases causing changes in the chloroplast structure and damage to plant membrane systems maxwell and johnson 2000 grassi and magnani 2005 at the same time membrane lipid peroxidation aggravates the generation of superoxide free radicals causing degradation of photosynthetic pigments thereby destroying the photosynthetic electron transfer system hindering the transfer of electrons and destroying the physiological functions of photosynthetic organs ultimately leading to the reduction of photosynthetic capacity caused by nsl factors yin et al 2006 signarbieux and feller 2011 maize is one of the most widely cultivated food crops in the world and plays a critical role in ensuring world food security cairns et al 2013 china is the second largest maize producer in the world because maize is used as food and feed and represents an economic crop the planting area of maize in china is very large meng et al 2013 maize is a high water consuming crop that requires a large amount of water during its growing season and has a high water demand intensity maize yield formation is closely related to soil moisture while the main production areas in china are mostly located in arid and semiarid areas zhang 2003 zhang et al 2018 to date drought stress is the main factor limiting maize productivity and results in 25 30 reductions in yield in some vulnerable areas hu et al 2014 in recent years with global changes surface evapotranspiration has increased the frequency of extreme rainfall has increased and the frequent occurrence of drought has brought great challenges to maize production wang et al 2011 accurately identifying crop drought and assessing the occurrence and developmental processes of drought can help to formulate scientific drought avoidance and drought resistance measures which can alleviate the negative impact of drought on food production to some degrees mardeh et al 2006 quiring 2009 choosing optimal indicators for crop drought identification assessment and monitoring is of great significance for drought avoidance and resistance ramadas and govindaraju 2015 zhong et al 2018 the leaf is the most important organ in plant assimilation and transpiration as well as the most sensitive organ to drought stress czajkowski et al 2009 the leaf water content lwc can directly reflect the actual growth and developmental state of a crop and is the best index to indicate the water conservation status of the leaves soltys kalina et al 2016 junttila et al 2018 el hendawy et al 2019 the change in the lwc can reflect the degree of crop drought to a certain extent and it is easy to observe the lwc plays an irreplaceable role in crop drought identification and in remote sensing of drought monitoring ullah et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 due to the differences in leaf age growth and developmental status and functional traits the degree of lwc changes at different leaf positions is different under drought stress liu et al 2015 therefore selecting the most representative leaf is an essential prerequisite for accurately identifying crop drought photosynthesis is an important physiological process for crops to accumulate organic matter by using light energy in this process leaf water is not only the raw material of photosynthesis but also a major factor affecting crop photosynthesis zhu et al 2017 many researchers have concentrated on the effects of soil water content on crop photosynthesis and identified the soil water content when crop photosynthesis changes from being subject to sl to nsl meanwhile the soil water content could be used as a reference to identify drought disasters and determine when to take countermeasures nov√°k and havrila 2006 wang et al 2008 meir et al 2015 sun et al 2015 however less attention has been paid to the relationship between the lwc and photosynthetic sl transformation points crop drought is a dynamic process that develops gradually and it is also a long term accumulative process affected by various factors such as its duration and the soil water content the soil water content provides less cumulative drought information and cannot explain the degree of crop drought whereas physiological and ecological indicators can reflect crop drought tolerance thus using crop physiological and ecological indicators to identify crop drought can more directly and accurately reflect crop drought resistance and adaptability lwc can directly reflect the actual moisture status of crops and it is an important ecological indicator to characterize crop drought and is of great significance in identifying crop drought in this study we combined a physiological process and ecological indicator of maize to study the relationship between photosynthesis and the lwc the objectives of this study were to 1 examine the responses of maize photosynthetic sl at different leaf positions to different degrees of water stress in different growth stages and 2 determine the lwc when maize photosynthesis in leaves at different positions changes from being determined by sl to nsl additionally we aimed to 3 choose the optimal indicator for crop drought monitoring we hypothesized the following 1 photosynthesis of maize leaves in different positions will change from being driven by sl to nsl under different water stress levels in different growth stages 2 the sl transformation point will be related to lwc and 3 leaves at different positions will have different lwc when the change from sl to nsl occurs the findings of this study will improve crop drought determination as well as provide a basis for crop drought monitoring and classification 2 materials and method 2 1 climate and soil characteristics the experiment was conducted at the

consistent with local practices 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 leaf gas exchange leaf gas exchange parameters were measured using a portable photosynthesis measurement system li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa between 9 00 am and 11 00 am on clear days the first fully expanded leaf and the third leaf at the top and three healthy maize plants with the same growth vigour were selected for the determination of leaf photosynthetic parameters in each treatment the measurement site was the middle upper part of the leaf avoiding the central leaf vein three replicates were taken for each treatment at intervals of 7 10 days and measurements were added at the critical maize growth stages the leaf net photosynthetic rate pn Œºmol co2 m 2 s 1 stomatal conductance gs mmol h2o m 2s 1 intercellular co2 concentration ci and other factors were measured the par in the leaf chamber was set to 1500 Œºmol m 2 s 1 which was the saturated light intensity of maize the indoor temperature and co2 concentration were consistent with those of the outside world and the flow rate was set to 500 Œºmol s 1 the stomatal limitation value ls was calculated by the formula 1 l s 1 c i c a 2 5 leaf water content leaves were sampled after the observation of photosynthetic physiological and ecological parameters at 9 00 am 11 00 am and the leaf samples were consistent with those observed by photosynthesis three replicates were taken for each treatment at intervals of 7 10 days and measurements were added at the critical maize growth stages the leaves were separated from the plants by scissors the fresh weight was obtained and then the leaves were put into a paper bag then put into the oven for 105 c deactivation for 1 h then dried to constant weight at 80 c to determine the dry

of photosynthetic stomatal limitations of maize leaves in different positions to different water stress levels at the 3rd leaf stage the changes in the net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs intercellular co2 concentration ci and stomatal limitation value ls of the first fully expanded leaf top1 and the third leaf top3 at the top of maize plants during drought development in 2013 are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively as drought progressed the pn and gs of maize both showed a decreasing trend among them the pn of top1 was distinctly different between treatments the pn for the treatment with more irrigation was obviously higher than that for the treatment with less irrigation differences between treatments reached a maximum 27 days after water control the gs decreased sharply with earlier development of drought and decreased gradually 27 days after water control the differences in gs between treatments gradually decreased the pn and gs of top3 gradually decreased with the development of drought and their change trends were similar to those observed for top1 distinct differences between treatments were found in the early stage of drought development with the development of drought the differences between treatments decreased gradually and no distinct differences between treatments were found 59 days after water control the reduction in photosynthesis caused by drought mainly depends on sl and nsl in general situations the turning point of ci increases and ls decreases as photosynthesis changes from being driven by sl to nsl the direction of the changes in ci and ls are the key to determining whether the photosynthesis of crops is limited by sl or nsl factors as shown in figs 1 and 2 as drought progressed the pn and gs of top1 and top3 decreased gradually ci first decreased and then increased and ls first increased and then decreased these findings indicated that with the development of drought the limiting factors for photosynthesis of top1 and top3 gradually changed from sl caused by environmental factors to nsl caused by damage to photosynthetic organs the photosynthesis of top1 under the treatments d1 d6 changed from being limited by sl to nsl at 40 33 27 34 27 and 29 days after water control while this change occurred at 44 37 40 38 32 and 34 days respectively after water control in top3 top1 and top3 both exhibited the phenomenon of photosynthesis being driven first by sl and then by nsl at the same time the occurrence of this phenomenon in top3 lagged behind that in top1 3 2 responses of photosynthetic stomatal limitations of maize leaves in different positions to different water stress levels at the 7th leaf stage figs 3 and 4 show that the pn and gs of top1 and top3 both decreased gradually with the development of drought the pn and gs of top1 sharply decreased in the earlier drought development process and decreased slowly 46 days after water control distinct differences in pn were found between treatments while no distinct differences were found in gs between treatments 46 days after water control the pn and gs of top3 decreased sharply during the earlier drought development process and decreased slowly 46 days after water control no distinct differences were found in pn and gs between treatments the pn and gs of top1 and top3 decreased gradually ci first decreased and then increased while ls first increased and then decreased which indicated that the photosynthesis of top1 and top3 changed from being determined by sl to nsl at the 7th leaf stage under different levels of water stress under the treatments d1 d6 in top1 the change from sl to nsl occurred at 51 57 49 51 50 and 47 days after water control while this change occurred at 66 50 53 51 68 and 58 days after water control in top3 respectively top1 and top3 both exhibited the phenomenon of photosynthesis being driven first by sl and then by nsl at the same time the occurrence of this phenomenon in top3 lagged behind that in top1 3 3 responses of the leaf water content in maize leaves at different positions to different degrees of water stress at the 3rd and 7th leaf stages the responses of the lwc in different leaf positions to water stress were different as shown in fig 5 the lwc at different leaf positions decreased with the development of drought in 2013 and 2014 while the rate of decrease in top1 was slightly higher than that in top3 in 2013 the lwc of top1 under the d1 d6 treatments decreased at rates of 0 30 0 30 0 26 0 24 0 15 and 0 20 d 1 significant differences p 0 05 were found in decrease rate of top1 between treatments while that of top3 decreased at rates of 0 19 0 22 0 21 0 23 0 22 and 0 22 d 1 respectively no significant differences p 0 05 were found in decrease rate of top3 between treatments in 2014 the lwc of top1 under the d1 d6 treatments decreased at rates of 0 21 0 18 0 17 0 19 0 13 and 0 15 d 1 while that of top3 decreased at rates of 0 10 0 13 0 09 0 12 0 06 and 0 08 d 1 respectively moreover significant differences p 0 05 were found in decrease rate of top1 and top3 between treatments table 2 in 2013 the differences in the lwc of top1 between treatments decreased gradually and the differences were least 33 days after the water control the lwcs under d1 d6 were 73 6 74 1 74 5 75 9 73 6 and 75 6 respectively no distinct differences were found in the lwc of top3 between treatments during the whole growing season in 2014 the differences in the lwc of top1 between treatments decreased gradually and the differences were the least 49 days after the water control the lwcs under d1 d5 were higher than that under d6 and the lwcs under d1 d6 were 71 5 72 1 71 2 71 9 71 6 and 68 9 respectively distinct differences were found in the lwc of top3 between treatments the lwc in different leaf positions responded differently with the development of drought and the lwc of top1 responded quickly to drought stress making top1 more sensitive to drought stress than top3 3 4 critical conditions for photosynthetic stomatal limitations in maize leaves at different positions under different water stress levels at the 3rd leaf stage the lwc is an optimal indicator of drought determining the lwc during the change from sl to nsl of photosynthesis is meaningful for drought monitoring and early warning the lwc when the ci and ls values are changed is defined as the lwc when photosynthesis changes from being limited by sl to nsl in 2013 the lwcs when the ci of top1 changed were 76 5 77 8 77 2 77 7 76 4 and 77 1 for d1 d6 while these were 76 1 80 7 76 0 77 9 75 1 and 76 9 for d1 d6 respectively when ls changed the lwc when the ci of top3 changed were 74 9 75 6 75 4 75 0 74 3 and 74 5 for d1 d6 while these were 74 6 75 5 75 3 74 5 73 0 and 73 0 for d1 d6 respectively when the ls changed table 3 no distinct differences in lwc were found between treatments the effect of different water stresses on the lwc in the 3rd leaf stage of top1 and top3 was not distinct and the lwc of top1 was higher than that of top3 when photosynthesis changed from being limited by sl to nsl figs 6 and 7 3 5 critical conditions for photosynthetic stomatal limitations in maize leaves at different positions under different water stress levels at the 7th leaf stage the phenomenon of photosynthesis changing from being limited by sl to nsl was found in both top1 and top3 under different degrees of water stress at the 7th leaf stage the relationship between the lwc of leaves at different positions and ci and ls was analysed figs 8 and 9 in 2014 the lwcs when the ci of top1 changed were 74 3 74 6 77 2 74 8 75 3 and 73 8 for d1 d6 while these were 71 8 74 3 77 3 74 4 74 8 and 73 2 respectively when the ls changed the lwcs when the ci of top3 changed were 73 6 73 3 73 9 74 0 74 1 and 71 1 for d1 d6 while these were 73 7 73 2 73 9 74 1 74 0 and 71 1 for d1 d6 respectively when ls changed table 4 distinct differences in the lwc of top1 and top3 were not found between treatments and the lwc of top1 was higher than that of top3 the 2015 experiment showed similar results for the critical conditions of photosynthetic sl in different leaf positions of maize under different water stress levels at the jointing stage supplementary data overall the 3 year experiment indicated that different degrees of water stress at different growth stages 3rd leaf stage 7th leaf stage and jointing stage had no distinct effect on the lwc when photosynthesis changed from being limited by sl to being limited by nsl the photosynthetic sl transformation point in different leaf positions was closely related to the lwc moreover the lwc was different in different leaf positions the photosynthetic sl transformation point of lwc was 75 5 1 5 75 7 1 3 for top1 while it was 73 2 1 1 73 4 1 6 for top3 the lwc of top1 was higher than that of top3 and the lwc of top1 responded earlier to drought than top3 and was an optimal indicator of drought stress 4 discussion the transition of photosynthesis from sl to nsl is a critical indicator marking the change from environmental constraints to physiological and ecological constraints of crop production and it can be used to identify critical conditions for crop drought disasters in the early stage of drought stress drought leads to a decrease in the stomatal conductance of plants thus the amount of co2 entering the stomata may decrease to levels that fail to meet the demands of photosynthesis which leads to the reduction of photosynthesis this phenomenon is caused by sl of photosynthesis as drought stress progresses the decrease in lwc leads to an increase in leaf temperature the activity of chloroplasts and rubisco decreases and the regeneration ability of the substrate rubp decreases which leads to a decrease in photosynthetic ability these processes are considered nsl of photosynthesis griffiths and parry 2002 flexas and medrano 2002 flexas et al 2004 grassi and magnani 2005 yu et al 2009 wang et al 2018 in this study photosynthesis of maize leaves changed from being driven by sl to nsl with the development of drought which is consistent with our assumptions the determination of the turning point at which crop photosynthesis is limited by nsl rather than sl is of great significance in determining the lowest limit of water demand in plant photosynthetic physiology as well as an essential sign of the transition of plants from light and medium drought stress to severe drought stress bacelar et al 2009 knowledge of this change point is also of great reference value in crop drought identification and classification pilon et al 2018 as the accumulation of stress from adverse environmental conditions exceeds a certain limitation crop photosynthesis will change from being determined by sl to nsl the soil water content of 44 is the sl transformation point of maize ma and zhou 2018 prior research lawlor and cornic 2002 found that when the lwc is less than 75 leaf photosynthetic metabolism will be significantly inhibited in this experiment the lwc was 73 4 1 6 75 7 1 3 when ci changed while these were 73 2 1 1 75 5 1 5 when ls changed maize photosynthesis changed from being determined by sl to nsl at a lwc of 73 2 1 1 75 7 1 3 higher net photosynthesis rates and stomatal conductance and stable ci and ls occur when environmental conditions are suitable for plant growth and development when ci decreases and ls increases sl play a dominant role in photosynthesis while when ci increases and ls decreases nsl play a dominant role in photosynthesis the directioin of changes in ci and ls can indicate when crops are stressed by adversity drought waterlogging heat damage freezing damage etc the change in the ci and ls values is the key to determining whether the photosynthesis of crops is affected by sl or nsl berry and downton 1982 accurate identification of sl and nsl of crop photosynthesis is the basis for crop drought identification assessment and classification the lwc is not only the raw material for photosynthesis but also affects the photosynthetic process arad et al 1973 it is an important ecological index for crop drought identification ullah et al 2013 the lwc decreased significantly under drought stress and the decrease in the lwc led to an increase in leaf temperature which caused the closure of stomata and a reduction in the net photosynthetic rate lugojan and ciulca 2011 the lwc is closely related to the physiological function of leaves embodies the balance between the leaf tissue water supply and transpiration rate and can reflect the water holding capacity of plants under adversity furthermore the lwc is the most direct indicator of plant water conditions kumar and sharma 2010 sun et al 2019 our experiment revealed that the maize lwc continued to decrease with the development of drought and different degrees of water stress in different growth stages 3rd leaf stage 7th leaf stage and jointing stage had no distinct effect on the lwc when maize photosynthesis changed from being driven by sl to nsl the sl transformation point in maize was distinctly related to the lwc changes in the lwc can reflect the degree of crop drought the lwc can be used as an indicator of whether crop photosynthesis is experiencing sl or nsl leaf emergence and dehiscence periods structure function and photosynthetic performance are different for leaves at different leaf positions ciganda et al 2008 chen et al 2015 li et al 2019b during the process of crop growth and development the lwc in different leaf positions is significantly different at the same time the lwc in different leaf positions responds to adverse stress differently the maize lwc in different leaf positions varied greatly under drought stress and decreased gradually from plant bottom to top sun et al 2015 the first fully expanded leaf at the top is a newly grown leaf that has strong vitality and a high photosynthetic capacity and is generally relatively sensitive to adversity our results also found that the lwc of the top1 decreased faster than that of the top3 and the transition from sl to nsl of photosynthesis occurred in top1 before top3 the lwc of top1 was higher than that of top3 when the change from sl to nsl of photosynthesis occurred the lwc of top1 can reflect crop drought early providing a better characterization and indication of drought than that of other leaves as stress accumulates to a certain extent the physiological functions of the crop will be destroyed photosynthesis will no longer be affected by the environment and internal physiological damage will become the major reason for the reduction in photosynthesis in the current research the change in the direction of ci and ls was key to determining whether photosynthesis was limited by sl or nsl factors identifying the turning point of this change in photosynthesis from sl to nsl in a timely and accurate manner and developing a method of identifying this turning point are of great importance for scientific drought avoidance and drought resistance measures crop physiological and ecological indicators can be used to diagnose crop water deficiency during the drought development process selecting appropriate physiological and ecological indicators for rapid drought identification in different drought development stages can provide a basis for drought monitoring and early warning by combining maize physiological processes and ecological indicators this study determined the lwc at which maize photosynthesis changed from being limited by sl to nsl which could provide a theoretical basis for the identification classification and remote sensing monitoring of drought disasters in future research important physiological processes of crops and ecological indicators should be taken into consideration together and physiological process and ecological indicators should be quantitatively integrated into drought monitoring and early warning models to provide a theoretical basis for global crop drought identification monitoring and early warning 5 conclusion in conclusion 1 maize photosynthesis changed from being limited by sl to nsl under different degrees of water stress at different stages 3rd leaf stage 7th leaf stage and jointing stage and the transition from sl to nsl occurred in top1 before top3 2 different water stress levels at different stages had no distinct effect on the lwc at which maize photosynthesis changed from being determined by sl to nsl the change point of the limitations in leaves at different positions was closely related to the lwc and the lwc at the transition point from sl to nsl was different at different leaf positions 3 the lwc was 75 5 1 5 75 7 1 3 for top1 while it was 73 2 1 1 73 4 1 6 for top3 when the photosynthesis of maize changed from sl to nsl the lwc of top1 was the best indicator for crop drought this study can provide a basis for the identification remote sensing monitoring and classification of drought in maize and provide a methodological reference for drought monitoring in other crops declaration of

10464,stomata are the channels by which plants exchange water vapor and carbon dioxide with the environment clarifying the change from stomatal limitations sl to non stomatal limitations nsl of photosynthesis and their critical conditions is vital for accurately recognizing the degree of crop drought and formulating countermeasures a field experiment was carried out from 2013 to 2015 to study the critical water conditions when maize photosynthesis changed from being limited by sl to nsl in different leaf positions under different degrees of water stress in different growth stages 3rd leaf stage 7th leaf stage and jointing stage our results indicated that photosynthesis of maize leaves at different positions changed from being determined by sl to nsl under different water stress levels at different growth stages moreover maize photosynthesis changed from being directed by sl to nsl in the first fully expanded leaf at the top before the changes occurred in the third leaf the effect of water stress during different growth stages on the maize leaf water content lwc at which photosynthesis changed from being limited by sl to nsl was not distinct the changing point of sl at different leaf positions was closely related to the lwc and the lwc at the changing point of sl was different at different leaf positions which indicated that the change in sl is mainly determined by the leaf position and lwc and its occurrence showed a decreasing trend from plant top to bottom the lwc at which the sl transformation point occurred in the first fully expanded leaf at the top 75 5 1 5 75 7 1 3 was higher than that at which the change occurred in the third leaf at the top 73 2 1 1 73 4 1 6 the phenomenon of photosynthesis changing from being limited by sl to nsl occurred first in the first fully expanded leaf at the top additionally the lwc of the first fully expanded leaf at the top was the best indicator in maize under water stress and could be used as the critical condition marking the transformation of maize damage from water stress to damage from plant physiological and ecological stress these results could provide a basis for the identification of crop drought disasters and their classification and provide a methodological reference for the identification and monitoring of drought in other crops keywords maize leaf water content photosynthesis stomatal limitations non stomatal limitations critical water conditions 1 introduction drought is a common issue in agricultural production worldwide china s annual crop reduction caused by drought amounts to 700 800 1010 kg which exceeds the total loss from other adverse factors hao and singh 2015 song et al 2018 water shortage is not only a major factor affecting crop growth but also an important factor restricting agricultural and economic development li et al 2019a global warming in recent years has led to changes in rainfall patterns and increases in extreme rainfall and evaporation and water deficit has become a crucial constraint on agricultural production grayson 2013 avramova et al 2015 liu et al 2018 photosynthesis is the basis of plant biological activities bian et al 2019 drought stress reduces photosynthesis affects the accumulation of organic matter and ultimately leads to crop yield reduction parry et al 2002 zhang et al 2005 monneveux et al 2006 generally the reduction in plant photosynthesis caused by drought is mainly caused by stomatal limitations sl and non stomatal limitations nsl farquhar and sharkey 1982 zhang et al 2010 under mild and moderate drought stress the leaf water potential continues to decrease with the loss of water in plant leaves tombesi et al 2015 bhusal et al 2019 the opening of the stomata decreases leading to an increase in stomatal resistance thus the co2 entering the stomata decreases and at the same time the intercellular co2 concentration decreases which eventually leads to a reduction in crop photosynthesis chaves et al 2008 laura et al 2012 buckley and mott 2013 cai et al 2015 the increase in stomatal resistance will also reduce the loss of water dispersion in the leaf hinder the further development of the water deficit and reduce the damage to photosynthetic organs from water stress at this stage sl is a main factor leading to the reduction of photosynthesis once the drought stress is relieved the stomata reopens and plant photosynthesis returns to its original level flexas et al 2009 campos et al 2014 with the further development of drought conditions the opening of plant stomata continues to decrease stomata may even close and the entry of co2 into leaves is blocked as a result o2 becomes a receptor for electron transfer in plant cells flexas et al 2004 the rate of plant oxidation and generation of reactive oxygen free radicals increases causing changes in the chloroplast structure and damage to plant membrane systems maxwell and johnson 2000 grassi and magnani 2005 at the same time membrane lipid peroxidation aggravates the generation of superoxide free radicals causing degradation of photosynthetic pigments thereby destroying the photosynthetic electron transfer system hindering the transfer of electrons and destroying the physiological functions of photosynthetic organs ultimately leading to the reduction of photosynthetic capacity caused by nsl factors yin et al 2006 signarbieux and feller 2011 maize is one of the most widely cultivated food crops in the world and plays a critical role in ensuring world food security cairns et al 2013 china is the second largest maize producer in the world because maize is used as food and feed and represents an economic crop the planting area of maize in china is very large meng et al 2013 maize is a high water consuming crop that requires a large amount of water during its growing season and has a high water demand intensity maize yield formation is closely related to soil moisture while the main production areas in china are mostly located in arid and semiarid areas zhang 2003 zhang et al 2018 to date drought stress is the main factor limiting maize productivity and results in 25 30 reductions in yield in some vulnerable areas hu et al 2014 in recent years with global changes surface evapotranspiration has increased the frequency of extreme rainfall has increased and the frequent occurrence of drought has brought great challenges to maize production wang et al 2011 accurately identifying crop drought and assessing the occurrence and developmental processes of drought can help to formulate scientific drought avoidance and drought resistance measures which can alleviate the negative impact of drought on food production to some degrees mardeh et al 2006 quiring 2009 choosing optimal indicators for crop drought identification assessment and monitoring is of great significance for drought avoidance and resistance ramadas and govindaraju 2015 zhong et al 2018 the leaf is the most important organ in plant assimilation and transpiration as well as the most sensitive organ to drought stress czajkowski et al 2009 the leaf water content lwc can directly reflect the actual growth and developmental state of a crop and is the best index to indicate the water conservation status of the leaves soltys kalina et al 2016 junttila et al 2018 el hendawy et al 2019 the change in the lwc can reflect the degree of crop drought to a certain extent and it is easy to observe the lwc plays an irreplaceable role in crop drought identification and in remote sensing of drought monitoring ullah et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 due to the differences in leaf age growth and developmental status and functional traits the degree of lwc changes at different leaf positions is different under drought stress liu et al 2015 therefore selecting the most representative leaf is an essential prerequisite for accurately identifying crop drought photosynthesis is an important physiological process for crops to accumulate organic matter by using light energy in this process leaf water is not only the raw material of photosynthesis but also a major factor affecting crop photosynthesis zhu et al 2017 many researchers have concentrated on the effects of soil water content on crop photosynthesis and identified the soil water content when crop photosynthesis changes from being subject to sl to nsl meanwhile the soil water content could be used as a reference to identify drought disasters and determine when to take countermeasures nov√°k and havrila 2006 wang et al 2008 meir et al 2015 sun et al 2015 however less attention has been paid to the relationship between the lwc and photosynthetic sl transformation points crop drought is a dynamic process that develops gradually and it is also a long term accumulative process affected by various factors such as its duration and the soil water content the soil water content provides less cumulative drought information and cannot explain the degree of crop drought whereas physiological and ecological indicators can reflect crop drought tolerance thus using crop physiological and ecological indicators to identify crop drought can more directly and accurately reflect crop drought resistance and adaptability lwc can directly reflect the actual moisture status of crops and it is an important ecological indicator to characterize crop drought and is of great significance in identifying crop drought in this study we combined a physiological process and ecological indicator of maize to study the relationship between photosynthesis and the lwc the objectives of this study were to 1 examine the responses of maize photosynthetic sl at different leaf positions to different degrees of water stress in different growth stages and 2 determine the lwc when maize photosynthesis in leaves at different positions changes from being determined by sl to nsl additionally we aimed to 3 choose the optimal indicator for crop drought monitoring we hypothesized the following 1 photosynthesis of maize leaves in different positions will change from being driven by sl to nsl under different water stress levels in different growth stages 2 the sl transformation point will be related to lwc and 3 leaves at different positions will have different lwc when the change from sl to nsl occurs the findings of this study will improve crop drought determination as well as provide a basis for crop drought monitoring and classification 2 materials and method 2 1 climate and soil characteristics the experiment was conducted at the

consistent with local practices 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 leaf gas exchange leaf gas exchange parameters were measured using a portable photosynthesis measurement system li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa between 9 00 am and 11 00 am on clear days the first fully expanded leaf and the third leaf at the top and three healthy maize plants with the same growth vigour were selected for the determination of leaf photosynthetic parameters in each treatment the measurement site was the middle upper part of the leaf avoiding the central leaf vein three replicates were taken for each treatment at intervals of 7 10 days and measurements were added at the critical maize growth stages the leaf net photosynthetic rate pn Œºmol co2 m 2 s 1 stomatal conductance gs mmol h2o m 2s 1 intercellular co2 concentration ci and other factors were measured the par in the leaf chamber was set to 1500 Œºmol m 2 s 1 which was the saturated light intensity of maize the indoor temperature and co2 concentration were consistent with those of the outside world and the flow rate was set to 500 Œºmol s 1 the stomatal limitation value ls was calculated by the formula 1 l s 1 c i c a 2 5 leaf water content leaves were sampled after the observation of photosynthetic physiological and ecological parameters at 9 00 am 11 00 am and the leaf samples were consistent with those observed by photosynthesis three replicates were taken for each treatment at intervals of 7 10 days and measurements were added at the critical maize growth stages the leaves were separated from the plants by scissors the fresh weight was obtained and then the leaves were put into a paper bag then put into the oven for 105 c deactivation for 1 h then dried to constant weight at 80 c to determine the dry weight the lwc was calculated by the following equation 2 l w c l e a f f r e s h w e i g h t l e a f d r y w e i g h t l e a f f r e s h w e i g h t 100 2 6 statistical analyses spss v 21 0 statistic software spss inc chicago il usa was used to perform the statistical analysis one way anova with duncan s multiple comparison was used to test the differences in the lwc between drought treatments at

of photosynthetic stomatal limitations of maize leaves in different positions to different water stress levels at the 3rd leaf stage the changes in the net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs intercellular co2 concentration ci and stomatal limitation value ls of the first fully expanded leaf top1 and the third leaf top3 at the top of maize plants during drought development in 2013 are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively as drought progressed the pn and gs of maize both showed a decreasing trend among them the pn of top1 was distinctly different between treatments the pn for the treatment with more irrigation was obviously higher than that for the treatment with less irrigation differences between treatments reached a maximum 27 days after water control the gs decreased sharply with earlier development of drought and decreased gradually 27 days after water control the differences in gs between treatments gradually decreased the pn and gs of top3 gradually decreased with the development of drought and their change trends were similar to those observed for top1 distinct differences between treatments were found in the early stage of drought development with the development of drought the differences between treatments decreased gradually and no distinct differences between treatments were found 59 days after water control the reduction in photosynthesis caused by drought mainly depends on sl and nsl in general situations the turning point of ci increases and ls decreases as photosynthesis changes from being driven by sl to nsl the direction of the changes in ci and ls are the key to determining whether the photosynthesis of crops is limited by sl or nsl factors as shown in figs 1 and 2 as drought progressed the pn and gs of top1 and top3 decreased gradually ci first decreased and then increased and ls first increased and then decreased these findings indicated that with the development of drought the limiting factors for photosynthesis of top1 and top3 gradually changed from sl caused by environmental factors to nsl caused by damage to photosynthetic organs the photosynthesis of top1 under the treatments d1 d6 changed from being limited by sl to nsl at 40 33 27 34 27 and 29 days after water control while this change occurred at 44 37 40 38 32 and 34 days respectively after water control in top3 top1 and top3 both exhibited the phenomenon of photosynthesis being driven first by sl and then by nsl at the same time the occurrence of this phenomenon in top3 lagged behind that in top1 3 2 responses of photosynthetic stomatal limitations of maize leaves in different positions to different water stress levels at the 7th leaf stage figs 3 and 4 show that the pn and gs of top1 and top3 both decreased gradually with the development of drought the pn and gs of top1 sharply decreased in the earlier drought development process and decreased slowly 46 days after water control distinct differences in pn were found between treatments while no distinct differences were found in gs between treatments 46 days after water control the pn and gs of top3 decreased sharply during the earlier drought development process and decreased slowly 46 days after water control no distinct differences were found in pn and gs between treatments the pn and gs of top1 and top3 decreased gradually ci first decreased and then increased while ls first increased and then decreased which indicated that the photosynthesis of top1 and top3 changed from being determined by sl to nsl at the 7th leaf stage under different levels of water stress under the treatments d1 d6 in top1 the change from sl to nsl occurred at 51 57 49 51 50 and 47 days after water control while this change occurred at 66 50 53 51 68 and 58 days after water control in top3 respectively top1 and top3 both exhibited the phenomenon of photosynthesis being driven first by sl and then by nsl at the same time the occurrence of this phenomenon in top3 lagged behind that in top1 3 3 responses of the leaf water content in maize leaves at different positions to different degrees of water stress at the 3rd and 7th leaf stages the responses of the lwc in different leaf positions to water stress were different as shown in fig 5 the lwc at different leaf positions decreased with the development of drought in 2013 and 2014 while the rate of decrease in top1 was slightly higher than that in top3 in 2013 the lwc of top1 under the d1 d6 treatments decreased at rates of 0 30 0 30 0 26 0 24 0 15 and 0 20 d 1 significant differences p 0 05 were found in decrease rate of top1 between treatments while that of top3 decreased at rates of 0 19 0 22 0 21 0 23 0 22 and 0 22 d 1 respectively no significant differences p 0 05 were found in decrease rate of top3 between treatments in 2014 the lwc of top1 under the d1 d6 treatments decreased at rates of 0 21 0 18 0 17 0 19 0 13 and 0 15 d 1 while that of top3 decreased at rates of 0 10 0 13 0 09 0 12 0 06 and 0 08 d 1 respectively moreover significant differences p 0 05 were found in decrease rate of top1 and top3 between treatments table 2 in 2013 the differences in the lwc of top1 between treatments decreased gradually and the differences were least 33 days after the water control the lwcs under d1 d6 were 73 6 74 1 74 5 75 9 73 6 and 75 6 respectively no distinct differences were found in the lwc of top3 between treatments during the whole growing season in 2014 the differences in the lwc of top1 between treatments decreased gradually and the differences were the least 49 days after the water control the lwcs under d1 d5 were higher than that under d6 and the lwcs under d1 d6 were 71 5 72 1 71 2 71 9 71 6 and 68 9 respectively distinct differences were found in the lwc of top3 between treatments the lwc in different leaf positions responded differently with the development of drought and the lwc of top1 responded quickly to drought stress making top1 more sensitive to drought stress than top3 3 4 critical conditions for photosynthetic stomatal limitations in maize leaves at different positions under different water stress levels at the 3rd leaf stage the lwc is an optimal indicator of drought determining the lwc during the change from sl to nsl of photosynthesis is meaningful for drought monitoring and early warning the lwc when the ci and ls values are changed is defined as the lwc when photosynthesis changes from being limited by sl to nsl in 2013 the lwcs when the ci of top1 changed were 76 5 77 8 77 2 77 7 76 4 and 77 1 for d1 d6 while these were 76 1 80 7 76 0 77 9 75 1 and 76 9 for d1 d6 respectively when ls changed the lwc when the ci of top3 changed were 74 9 75 6 75 4 75 0 74 3 and 74 5 for d1 d6 while these were 74 6 75 5 75 3 74 5 73 0 and 73 0 for d1 d6 respectively when the ls changed table 3 no distinct differences in lwc were found between treatments the effect of different water stresses on the lwc in the 3rd leaf stage of top1 and top3 was not distinct and the lwc of top1 was higher than that of top3 when photosynthesis changed from being limited by sl to nsl figs 6 and 7 3 5 critical conditions for photosynthetic stomatal limitations in maize leaves at different positions under different water stress levels at the 7th leaf stage the phenomenon of photosynthesis changing from being limited by sl to nsl was found in both top1 and top3 under different degrees of water stress at the 7th leaf stage the relationship between the lwc of leaves at different positions and ci and ls was analysed figs 8 and 9 in 2014 the lwcs when the ci of top1 changed were 74 3 74 6 77 2 74 8 75 3 and 73 8 for d1 d6 while these were 71 8 74 3 77 3 74 4 74 8 and 73 2 respectively when the ls changed the lwcs when the ci of top3 changed were 73 6 73 3 73 9 74 0 74 1 and 71 1 for d1 d6 while these were 73 7 73 2 73 9 74 1 74 0 and 71 1 for d1 d6 respectively when ls changed table 4 distinct differences in the lwc of top1 and top3 were not found between treatments and the lwc of top1 was higher than that of top3 the 2015 experiment showed similar results for the critical conditions of photosynthetic sl in different leaf positions of maize under different water stress levels at the jointing stage supplementary data overall the 3 year experiment indicated that different degrees of water stress at different growth stages 3rd leaf stage 7th leaf stage and jointing stage had no distinct effect on the lwc when photosynthesis changed from being limited by sl to being limited by nsl the photosynthetic sl transformation point in different leaf positions was closely related to the lwc moreover the lwc was different in different leaf positions the photosynthetic sl transformation point of lwc was 75 5 1 5 75 7 1 3 for top1 while it was 73 2 1 1 73 4 1 6 for top3 the lwc of top1 was higher than that of top3 and the lwc of top1 responded earlier to drought than top3 and was an optimal indicator of drought stress 4 discussion the transition of photosynthesis from sl to nsl is a critical indicator marking the change from environmental constraints to physiological and ecological constraints of crop production and it can be used to identify critical conditions for crop drought disasters in the early stage of drought stress drought leads to a decrease in the stomatal conductance of plants thus the amount of co2 entering the stomata may decrease to levels that fail to meet the demands of photosynthesis which leads to the reduction of photosynthesis this phenomenon is caused by sl of photosynthesis as drought stress progresses the decrease in lwc leads to an increase in leaf temperature the activity of chloroplasts and rubisco decreases and the regeneration ability of the substrate rubp decreases which leads to a decrease in photosynthetic ability these processes are considered nsl of photosynthesis griffiths and parry 2002 flexas and medrano 2002 flexas et al 2004 grassi and magnani 2005 yu et al 2009 wang et al 2018 in this study photosynthesis of maize leaves changed from being driven by sl to nsl with the development of drought which is consistent with our assumptions the determination of the turning point at which crop photosynthesis is limited by nsl rather than sl is of great significance in determining the lowest limit of water demand in plant photosynthetic physiology as well as an essential sign of the transition of plants from light and medium drought stress to severe drought stress bacelar et al 2009 knowledge of this change point is also of great reference value in crop drought identification and classification pilon et al 2018 as the accumulation of stress from adverse environmental conditions exceeds a certain limitation crop photosynthesis will change from being determined by sl to nsl the soil water content of 44 is the sl transformation point of maize ma and zhou 2018 prior research lawlor and cornic 2002 found that when the lwc is less than 75 leaf photosynthetic metabolism will be significantly inhibited in this experiment the lwc was 73 4 1 6 75 7 1 3 when ci changed while these were 73 2 1 1 75 5 1 5 when ls changed maize photosynthesis changed from being determined by sl to nsl at a lwc of 73 2 1 1 75 7 1 3 higher net photosynthesis rates and stomatal conductance and stable ci and ls occur when environmental conditions are suitable for plant growth and development when ci decreases and ls increases sl play a dominant role in photosynthesis while when ci increases and ls decreases nsl play a dominant role in photosynthesis the directioin of changes in ci and ls can indicate when crops are stressed by adversity drought waterlogging heat damage freezing damage etc the change in the ci and ls values is the key to determining whether the photosynthesis of crops is affected by sl or nsl berry and downton 1982 accurate identification of sl and nsl of crop photosynthesis is the basis for crop drought identification assessment and classification the lwc is not only the raw material for photosynthesis but also affects the photosynthetic process arad et al 1973 it is an important ecological index for crop drought identification ullah et al 2013 the lwc decreased significantly under drought stress and the decrease in the lwc led to an increase in leaf temperature which caused the closure of stomata and a reduction in the net photosynthetic rate lugojan and ciulca 2011 the lwc is closely related to the physiological function of leaves embodies the balance between the leaf tissue water supply and transpiration rate and can reflect the water holding capacity of plants under adversity furthermore the lwc is the most direct indicator of plant water conditions kumar and sharma 2010 sun et al 2019 our experiment revealed that the maize lwc continued to decrease with the development of drought and different degrees of water stress in different growth stages 3rd leaf stage 7th leaf stage and jointing stage had no distinct effect on the lwc when maize photosynthesis changed from being driven by sl to nsl the sl transformation point in maize was distinctly related to the lwc changes in the lwc can reflect the degree of crop drought the lwc can be used as an indicator of whether crop photosynthesis is experiencing sl or nsl leaf emergence and dehiscence periods structure function and photosynthetic performance are different for leaves at different leaf positions ciganda et al 2008 chen et al 2015 li et al 2019b during the process of crop growth and development the lwc in different leaf positions is significantly different at the same time the lwc in different leaf positions responds to adverse stress differently the maize lwc in different leaf positions varied greatly under drought stress and decreased gradually from plant bottom to top sun et al 2015 the first fully expanded leaf at the top is a newly grown leaf that has strong vitality and a high photosynthetic capacity and is generally relatively sensitive to adversity our results also found that the lwc of the top1 decreased faster than that of the top3 and the transition from sl to nsl of photosynthesis occurred in top1 before top3 the lwc of top1 was higher than that of top3 when the change from sl to nsl of photosynthesis occurred the lwc of top1 can reflect crop drought early providing a better characterization and indication of drought than that of other leaves as stress accumulates to a certain extent the physiological functions of the crop will be destroyed photosynthesis will no longer be affected by the environment and internal physiological damage will become the major reason for the reduction in photosynthesis in the current research the change in the direction of ci and ls was key to determining whether photosynthesis was limited by sl or nsl factors identifying the turning point of this change in photosynthesis from sl to nsl in a timely and accurate manner and developing a method of identifying this turning point are of great importance for scientific drought avoidance and drought resistance measures crop physiological and ecological indicators can be used to diagnose crop water deficiency during the drought development process selecting appropriate physiological and ecological indicators for rapid drought identification in different drought development stages can provide a basis for drought monitoring and early warning by combining maize physiological processes and ecological indicators this study determined the lwc at which maize photosynthesis changed from being limited by sl to nsl which could provide a theoretical basis for the identification classification and remote sensing monitoring of drought disasters in future research important physiological processes of crops and ecological indicators should be taken into consideration together and physiological process and ecological indicators should be quantitatively integrated into drought monitoring and early warning models to provide a theoretical basis for global crop drought identification monitoring and early warning 5 conclusion in conclusion 1 maize photosynthesis changed from being limited by sl to nsl under different degrees of water stress at different stages 3rd leaf stage 7th leaf stage and jointing stage and the transition from sl to nsl occurred in top1 before top3 2 different water stress levels at different stages had no distinct effect on the lwc at which maize photosynthesis changed from being determined by sl to nsl the change point of the limitations in leaves at different positions was closely related to the lwc and the lwc at the transition point from sl to nsl was different at different leaf positions 3 the lwc was 75 5 1 5 75 7 1 3 for top1 while it was 73 2 1 1 73 4 1 6 for top3 when the photosynthesis of maize changed from sl to nsl the lwc of top1 was the best indicator for crop drought this study can provide a basis for the identification remote sensing monitoring and classification of drought in maize and provide a methodological reference for drought monitoring in other crops declaration of
