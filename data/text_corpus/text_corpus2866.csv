14330,magnetic carbon nanotube tio2 mcnt tio2 composites that rely on the inherent magnetic properties of carbon nanotubes were synthesized and their photocatalytic activity was evaluated for the degradation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole under solar irradiation and environmentally relevant conditions compared with a tio2 reference catalyst the mcnt tio2 composites exhibited a higher photodegradation rate due to the high surface area and extended visible light absorption the photodegradation rate constants for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in pure water were 1 5 and 1 2 times greater than those for tio2 respectively the catalysts were tested in the presence of natural organic matter and rapid photodegradation rates for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were observed relative to bare tio2 indicating that mcnt tio2 may be suitable for practical applications solar and uvc reactivation were used to recover the photocatalytic activity and uvc irradiation was more efficient and maintained the performance of mcnt tio2 for consecutive treatment cycles mcnt tio2 with its unique fast kinetics and high photodegradation activity toward micropollutants exhibits great potential as an alternative method for water and wastewater treatment keywords magnetic carbon nanotubes tio2 pharmaceuticals natural organic matter water treatment regeneration 1 introduction effluents from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants are the main source of pharmaceuticals in natural waters 1 2 pharmaceutical concentrations as low as 500 ng l 1 in natural water could alter the reproduction and tissue regeneration of living organisms 3 5 the production and consumption of pharmaceuticals have increased dramatically over the past few decades however current wastewater treatment technologies e g activated sludge are not effective in removing these harmful compounds 6 the antiepileptic carbamazepine and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole are the most frequently detected persistent pharmaceuticals worldwide in natural and waste water 7 and their average removal efficiencies in water treatment plants are below 20 and 55 respectively 6 therefore efficient water treatment techniques are needed to reduce the release of pharmaceuticals into the aquatic environment photocatalysis is a promising advanced water treatment process for degrading pharmaceuticals that may be suitable to replace or assist conventional treatment approaches 8 10 tio2 is the most widely used semiconductor for photocatalytic processes due to its low cost non toxicity and high stability 11 in addition carbon nanotube cnt tio2 composites have attracted attention for environmental applications for several reasons cnts concentrate the contaminants by adsorption bringing the contaminants closer to the tio2 active sites for photodegradation 12 combining cnts with tio2 can promote the separation of the electron hole charges generated upon irradiation and the presence of c o ti linkages reduces the band gap and thus extends the absorption wavelength 13 previous studies of cnt tio2 have not used practical water treatment conditions such as the presence of background natural organic matter nom table s1 most experimental studies of cnt tio2 photocatalysis have focused on the kinetics and mechanisms for individual contaminants at high pharmaceutical concentrations 10 100 mg l 1 that are 104 105 times higher than their practical concentrations 14 the coexistence of nom reduces the photocatalytic activity of tio2 because nom is present in natural waters and wastewater at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than pharmaceuticals thus nom interferes with the photocatalytic mechanisms via the inner filter effect and radical scavenging and adsorbed nom competes for active sites with the targeted pollutants 15 17 the photocatalytic activity increases with the increase in the number of active reaction sites and the lifetime of photogenerated electron hole pairs which results in higher radical generation 14 hence increasing the specific surface area for photocatalytic reaction sites in cnt tio2 would reduce the probability of electron hole pair recombination and minimize the inhibitory effect of nom in this study we used the inherently magnetic particles present in pristine cnts as a green facile approach to prepare magnetic carbon nanotubes mcnts 18 our facile method is also scalable inexpensive and preserves the external surface of the nanotube walls for tio2 particles we investigated the photocatalytic activity of a mcnt tio2 composite in the presence of nom which is more relevant to conditions in water treatment plants we used industrial grade cnts to prepare mcnt tio2 by a simple mixing method industrial grade cnts was chosen due to its significant lower cost and higher content of metallic residuals i e magnetic particles compared to the analytical grade cnts the photocatalytic activity of mcnt tio2 for the photodegradation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole was tested under solar light irradiation with and without nom and we compared solar and uvc irradiation photooxidation reactivation techniques for regenerating mcnt tio2 further electrical energy demand eeo was calculated for the evaluation of energy efficiencies of the new material at relevant environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials carbamazepine 98 molecular formula c15h12n2o molecular weight 236 269 g mol 1 sulfamethoxazole 98 molecular formula c10h11n3o3s

10 mg l 1 carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were prepared in ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm 1 the urnom sample was dissolved in 0 01 m naoh solution to prepare a 10 g l 1 nom stock solution and then the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 using 0 01 m hcl solution the volume of acid or alkali solution was recorded and was considered when calculating the final nom concentration all stock solutions were stored at 4 c in the dark when not in use 2 2 preparation and characterization of mcnt tio2 composites mcnts were prepared using a facile method described in our previous work 18 19 as received cnts 0 5 g were dispersed in ethanol 100 ml with a sonicator the magnetic fraction of cnts was separated with the permanent nd fe b magnet and the non magnetic and low magnetism fractions were decanted this procedure was repeated three times with ethanol followed by three times with water the mcnts were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h and stored at room temperature prior to use the mcnt tio2 composite

experiments the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole 150 500 μg l 1 were studied in a glass beaker in aqueous solution 200 ml the concentrations were chosen based on reported concentrations of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in water and wastewater 25 the ph values of the solutions were adjusted to 7 0 0 2 with 0 01 m hcl and naoh the concentration of the catalyst tio2 mcnts and mcnt tio2 composites was 0 1 g l 1 the temperature was kept constant at room temperature 26 3 c a solar simulator ms 35aaa ushio lighting edge technologies japan at an intensity of 1000 w m 2 was used as a light source 26 each photocatalysis experiment consisted of two steps i adsorption of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole on the catalyst surface for 60 min in the dark with or without nom to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium additional stirring for 120 min resulted in no further adsorption ii photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole with or without nom under irradiation from the solar simulator the photocatalytic activity of the composites was investigated in the presence of nom by spiking the solution with urnom and the dissolved organic carbon doc was adjusted to 5 mg l 1 which is the average concentration in surface water and pre treated domestic wastewater 27 28 under dark conditions samples were collected at 5 10 15 30 50 and 60 min during irradiation the reaction solutions were stirred continuously and aliquots of the samples were collected at 5 10 15 20 and 30 min blank experiments without catalysts were run to test the photolysis of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in ultrapure water and in the presence of nom for 30 min all of the experiments were run in duplicate 2 4 recyclability of mcnt tio2 composites the recyclability of mcnt tio2 was tested without nom two different recyclability scenarios were tested in the first the spent mcnt tio2 after the photocatalytic degradation reaction was collected with a permanent magnet to separate it from the solution the mcnt tio2 was then used directly for the next photocatalysis cycles in the second scenario xenon short arc lamp and uvc λ 254 nm 80 w m 2 lamp irradiation were used for photooxidation reactivation the spent mcnt tio2 was collected with a permanent magnet placed in ultrapure water and exposed to solar or uvc irradiation for 1 h the photooxidation reactivated mcnt tio2 composites were used for the next cycle of photocatalysis under solar irradiation as described in section 2 3 the weight loss of mcnt tio2 after the recyclability experiments was negligible 2 5 analytical and statistical methods the carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole concentrations were analyzed using an hplc system prominence uflc shimadzu japan equipped with a uv vis absorbance detector spd 20 uflc shimadzu and a c18 column kinetex phenomenex co usa 5 μm 4 6 250 mm prior to hplc analysis the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter pes filter membrane solutions japan doc concentrations were quantified using total organic carbon toc analyzer toc chp shimadzu v series japan the analytical methods and their minimum reporting limits are shown in table s3 linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between adsorption capacity and specific surface area p 0 05 one way analysis of variance tukey s mean comparison test p 0 05 was used to compare photocatalytic activity k app for different catalysts and different recyclability scenarios student s t test at a 5 significance level was used to compare the effect of initial concentrations and the presence of nom for both tio2 and mcnt tio2 2 6 calculation of electrical energy per order of the transformation the energy efficiency of photocatalysis is expressed in terms of electrical energy per order e eo of the transformation and is defined as the electrical energy in kilowatt hours required to degrade a contaminant by one order of magnitude in 1 m3 of contaminated water 29 e eo is determined by 1 e eo electrical power kw time h volume m 3 log c 0 c t where c 0 and c t are the initial and final concentrations of each substance mg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization fig 1 shows the sem images of mcnts tio2 and mcnt tio2 composites the number of tio2 clusters increased in the composites as the mcnt tio2 mass ratio decreased tem edx analysis indicated that there were metallic co particles inside the tubes and they were the main source of the magnetic activity of mcnts figs s2 and s3 this is consistent with previous studies on commercial cnts containing metal impurities i e fe ni and co in the tubes from the production processes which could give the material inherent magnetic properties 30 the gravimetric analysis of mcnts indicated that the magnetic particles accounted for 6 of the total mcnt mass table 1 previous mcnt preparation methods that attach magnetic particles e g metal oxides and tio2 to the surface of cnt have suffered from photodissolution and release of the metals into solution 22 31 32 however in our mcnts these metallic particles are stable and difficult to remove even in concentrated acids at high temperature 18 moreover the utilization of industrial grade cnt in this study can decrease the cost for material preparation due to relatively lower price compare to the analytical grade cnt therefore our approach has the extra advantage over previously reported methods of avoiding unintentional contamination of the solution with magnetic particles and low material cost the surface area total pore volume pore distribution and magnetization values of mcnts tio2 and mcnt tio2 composites are listed in table 1 the surface area and total pore volume of mcnt tio2 composites were higher than those of pristine tio2 confirming that tio2 was anchored to the mcnts a high surface area adsorbent the specific surface area decreased and the total pore volume of the composite decreased as the tio2 loading increased the pore volume distribution for all samples showed that mesopores 50 nm pore size 2 nm and macropores pore size 50 nm were dominant with a small percentage of micropores 1 the pores were formed by tio2 and mcnt bundles as both materials are non porous 33 34 the magnetization curves showed that all the composites had paramagnetic properties fig s4 18 and the saturation magnetization values were highest for the mcnts and decreased with increasing tio2 fraction in the mcnt tio2 composites however all composites showed high magnetic activity and responded fast 1 min to an external magnetic field xrd diffraction peaks for mcnts tio2 and mcnt tio2 composites are shown in fig s5 the mcnts had two main diffraction peaks at 2θ 26 and 43 that were attributed to the carbon nanotube graphite like structure 18 however co particles were not detected in all samples because their concentrations were below the detection sensitivity limit of the xrd measurements 30 and the main diffraction peak of co 2θ 45 overlapped with the graphite like peak 2θ 43 35 the diffraction peak of tio2 consisted of anatase main diffraction peak at 2θ 25 3 and rutile main diffraction peak at 2θ 27 4 tio2 peaks polymorphous tio2 consisting of a mixture of anatase and rutile tio2 has better photocatalytic activity and a smaller band gap than the individual phases 36 for all mcnt tio2 composites the profile and intensity of tio2 peaks were consistent with the mass ratio of tio2 in each composite and an overlap with the mcnt peaks was observed at lower tio2 masses the ftir spectra of the samples are shown in fig s6 the broad peaks at 3730 and 3380 cm 1 were assigned to oh stretching the peaks at 1520 and 970 cm 1 arose from cc stretching and bending vibrations respectively in addition the absorption peak at 690 cm 1 was characteristic of ch the peak for the tio stretching vibration appeared around 450 cm 1 for the tio2 and mcnt tio2 composites 37 3 2 adsorption and photodegradation of pharmaceuticals 3 2 1 adsorption phase the adsorption of the contaminants on or close to the catalyst surface plays an important role in the effective photodegradation of the contaminants the increase in the adsorption capacity and pore volume of mcnt tio2 can increase the overall photocatalytic activity due to the synergetic effect of adsorption and photocatalysis at initial carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole concentrations of 150 μg l 1 all mcnt tio2 composites exhibited adsorption equilibria in the range of 1 1 4 mg g 1 which were much higher than that of bare tio2 0 2 mg g 1 fig s7 the adsorption equilibrium of the materials was positively correlated with their surface area as indicated by the r2 values 0 99 p 0 001 the main mechanisms for the adsorption on the surface of tio2 are the electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange 38 on the other hand the presence of the cnt in case of mcnt tio2 enhances the adsorption mechanism via hydrophobic interaction π π interaction hydrogen bonding interactions and electrostatic interactions 39 carbamazepine is a neutral species therefore the mass transport of carbamazepine is mainly governed by hydrophobic and π π interactions 40 in contrast sulfamethoxazole has two acidic dissociation constants of pk a 1 1 85 and pk a 2 5 6 41 indicating that sulfamethoxazole molecules were present in anionic form under the neutral ph conditions in this study and the adsorption mechanism onto mcnt tio2 and tio2 could be affected by electrostatic interactions 3 2 2 photodegradation phase the results showed that for direct photolysis without catalysts under solar irradiation carbamazepine showed negligible removal 2 whereas the sulfamethoxazole concentration decreased significantly by 20 50 fig s8 the carbamazepine removal was negligible under direct photodegradation because it does not have functional groups that absorb radiation at 290 nm which is the main solar irradiation spectrum 42 the higher removal of sulfamethoxazole is related to its phenylamine functional group which absorbs radiation at 290 nm 43 the photocatalytic degradation for both compounds using all composites was tested the photodegradation reactions were described quantitively by the langmuir hinshelwood model and the pseudo first order rates k app were used to examine the photodegradation efficiencies 44 k app of carbamazepine followed the trend mcnt tio2 1 5 mcnt tio2 1 10 tio2 mcnt tio2 1 1 not significantly different mcnt tio2 5 1 mcnt tio2 10 1 p 0 001 fig 2 the highest carbamazepine photodegradation was observed with mcnt tio2 1 5 k app 6 8 10 2 min 1 which was almost 1 5 times the value for bare tio2 k app 4 6 10 2 min 1 and the maximum synergetic effect between tio2 and mcnt was achieved with mcnt tio2 1 5 the solar light reactivity of tio2 was enhanced significantly in the presence of mcnt due to 1 the excited mcnt can inject electrons into tio2 which increases the photocurrent 2 the excitation electron from mcnt can combine with dissolved o2 to form superoxide and 3 mcnt provides suitable sites for the sorption of contaminants acts as an electron sink and renders visible light absorption due to ti o c linkage i e band gap reduction however increasing the tio2 mcnt mass ratio further mcnt tio2 1 10 reduced the degradation efficiency mainly because of the aggregation of tio2 on the mcnts which limited the number of active sites for sorption and photocatalysis 45 moreover an excessive amount of mcnts mcnt tio2 10 1 and mcnt tio2 5 1 also decreased the photodegradation rate of carbamazepine by screening the light and preventing the photocatalytic reaction 46 therefore mcnt tio2 1 5 was selected for the subsequent experiments as the optimum mcnt tio2 mass ratio for achieving the maximum photocatalytic degradation of the target contaminants we evaluated the photodegradation rate at initial concentrations of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole of 150 and 500 μg l 1 the photodegradation rate of carbamazepine decreased significantly at the higher initial concentrations for both tio2 and mcnt tio2 p 0 01 fig s9 this reduction may be related to the absorption of light by carbamazepine and the degradation intermediates which may interfere with the photocatalytic degradation reaction however the effect of the increased initial concentration was small for sulfamethoxazole hydroxylation processes i e hydroxyl radical oxidation have been reported as a main degradation mechanism of carbamazepine by tio2 based photocatalysis 47 48 in contrast degradation mechanism for sulfamethoxazole happened due to hydroxylation process and also direct degradation i e direct photolysis via the cleavage of the sn bond 41 at fixed catalysts concentration and irradiation times the total hydroxyl radicals amounts are constant 49 therefore the effect of increased initial concentration at fixed catalyst concentration on the degradation rate was more prone in case of carbamazepine than sulfamethoxazole where direct photolysis also take part in the total degradation rate for the latter case 3 3 adsorption and photodegradation of pharmaceuticals in the presence of nom the presence of nom is of particular concern because it competes for the adsorption sites and quenches advanced oxidation processes 50 the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine fig 3 and sulfamethoxazole fig s10 using tio2 and mcnt tio2 1 5 was tested in the presence of nom which significantly decreased the adsorption of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole onto tio2 and mcnt tio2 1 5 p 0 05 the competitive adsorption of nom reduced the interaction between the pharmaceuticals and the catalysts 16 these observations also confirmed the advantage of using mcnt tio2 because despite the competition the high surface area of the composites provided enough active sites for the adsorption of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole on mcnt tio2 in contrast to tio2 the heterogeneous nature of nom affects the molecular sieving behavior of tio2 and cnts in the presence of nom tio2 preferentially adsorbs small to medium molecular weight species 0 1 kda 15 whereas cnts adsorb species with molecular weights of 1 3 kda 39 the presence of nom significantly reduced the photodegradation rate of tio2 for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole from 4 2 10 2 and 4 7 10 2 min 1 respectively in the absence of nom to 6 10 3 and 5 10 3 min 1 p 0 01 for mcnt tio2 1 5 the photodegradation rates of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were also decreased significantly from 5 3 10 2 and 4 9 10 2 min 1 respectively in the absence of nom to 1 2 10 2 and 7 10 3 min 1 respectively p 0 01 the significant decrease in photodegradation rates of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were due to competitive adsorption 51 scavenger effect of nom toward oh radicals 17 and superoxide 52 as well as absorbing light via the inner filter effect 53 54 nom absorbs in both the uv and visible light spectrum diminishing the illumination intensity that available for the production of reactive oxygen species ros further the non selective nature of oh radicals and superoxide lead to the ros loss due to reaction with either the targeted pharmaceuticals or the non targeted compounds i e background nom besides those reasons the adsorbed nom i e electron rich compounds were also capable of scavenging the holes h in the catalysts valence band and reduced the interaction of the pharmaceuticals close to the catalysts active site for the photodegradation processes 16 the inhibitory effect of nom depends strongly on the properties of the target compounds nom quality and quantity and the catalysts in our study despite the lower photodegradation rate in the presence of nom the reductions in the removal efficiency and the photodegradation rate of mcnt tio2 1 5 were less than those of bare tio2 under the operational conditions these findings highlight the effect of nom on the photocatalytic degradation using mcnt tio2 although future studies will be necessary to understand fully the effects of nom types and concentrations on the removal efficacy of photocatalytic degradation the comparison of photocatalytic performance of fabricated mcnt tio2 with peer cnt tio2 composites is summarized in table s1 previous studies set out that the total removal of pharmaceuticals was ranging from 50 to 99 for various cnt tio2 composites however the removal of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole from this study were 60 and 40 respectively the photocatalytic activity of cnt tio2 composites mainly related with the photocatalysts morphologies pharmaceuticals physicochemical properties initial concentrations of pharmaceuticals source of the lights or intensities and the effect of water chemistries e g ph background co existing organic or inorganic species 14 it was noted that most of the previous studies evaluate the photocatalytic activity of cnt tio2 under uv irradiation λmax 254 366 and in ultrapure water matrices therefore this different might be largely because the difference in the source of the light and the water matrices compared with the others the fabricated mcnt tio2 in this study exhibits a promising photocatalytic performance under solar irradiation and in the presence of co existing background nom 3 4 recyclability of the mcnt tio2 composite the recyclability of mcnt tio2 1 5 was investigated by repeating the carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole photodegradation experiments in the absence of nom for five cycles of treatment and cleaning fig 4 photoreactivation by solar and uvc regeneration were used in this study where uvc regeneration gave the best performance probably due to the higher energy for the production of radicals the carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole removal tended to decrease from the first to the fifth cycle for all of the conditions direct recycling of mcnt tio2 1 5 statistically showed the highest decrease in the percentage removal of carbamazepine 40 decrease after five cycles followed by solar regeneration 20 decrease after five cycles and uvc regeneration 15 decrease after five cycles p 0 001 a similar trend was observed for sulfamethoxazole where uvc regeneration statistically gave the lowest decrease in the removal efficiency after five cycles p 0 001 sulfamethoxazole also showed a lower decrease in removal efficiencies after five cycles than carbamazepine for direct recycling solar regeneration and uvc regeneration these results agree with a previous study 55 in which pharmaceuticals with f and s containing groups e g sulfamethoxazole were more rapidly photodegraded and regenerated than molecules without these groups carbamazepine in tio2 photocatalysis the decrease in percentage removal of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole may be due to the accumulation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole or their photodegradation byproducts on mcnt tio2 1 5 56 3 5 electrical energy determination the photochemical process of contaminant degradation is energy intensive and the electrical energy per order e eo represents a major fraction of the total operating cost 57 this approach allows a simple comparison and provides data required for scale up and economic analysis however comprehensive information about the use of e eo values in modified tio2 based photocatalysis applications is still limited 29 the e eo values calculated for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole removal in ultrapure water and in the presence of nom are shown in fig 5 in general the photocatalysis techniques gave lower electrical consumptions than photolysis for the degradation of the pharmaceuticals mainly due to the production of radicals which increased the degradation rate the electrical energy consumption for the photocatalytic process in the presence of nom was higher than that without nom the electrical energy consumption depended on the water quality e g presence of nom and the pharmaceutical properties stable or prone to direct photodegradation because photolysis and photocatalysis are compound specific processes 58 moreover e eo values of 2076 19 954 kw h m 3 order 1 were necessary to transform carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in ultrapure water and in the presence of nom using pristine tio2 whereas lower e eo values of 1820 15 054 kw h m 3 order 1 were needed for mcnt tio2 due to the synergetic effect between mcnts and tio2 in the composite system it should be noted that these calculated e eo values were used for comparison purposes and they may differ in real water samples where inorganic species are present 4 conclusions we used a solar light driven mcnt tio2 composite for the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole an optimum mass ratio of mcnt to tio2 was needed to achieve maximum photodegradation of pharmaceuticals the recyclability of mcnt tio2 was assessed through five consecutive cycles of treatment and cleaning the removal efficiency decreased as the number of consecutive cycles increased due to mcnt tio2 fouling to recover the photocatalytic efficiency solar and uvc irradiation were used for regeneration uvc irradiation showed better performance than solar irradiation finally mcnt tio2 was tested under more realistic conditions in the presence of nom and mcnt tio2 still degraded carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole compared with pristine tio2 the photocatalytic activity of mcnt tio2 was higher and the electrical energy consumption was lower future studies should test mcnt tio2 for the removal of other organic micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides dyes etc in real waters and or wastewaters and for the identification of

14330,magnetic carbon nanotube tio2 mcnt tio2 composites that rely on the inherent magnetic properties of carbon nanotubes were synthesized and their photocatalytic activity was evaluated for the degradation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole under solar irradiation and environmentally relevant conditions compared with a tio2 reference catalyst the mcnt tio2 composites exhibited a higher photodegradation rate due to the high surface area and extended visible light absorption the photodegradation rate constants for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in pure water were 1 5 and 1 2 times greater than those for tio2 respectively the catalysts were tested in the presence of natural organic matter and rapid photodegradation rates for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were observed relative to bare tio2 indicating that mcnt tio2 may be suitable for practical applications solar and uvc reactivation were used to recover the photocatalytic activity and uvc irradiation was more efficient and maintained the performance of mcnt tio2 for consecutive treatment cycles mcnt tio2 with its unique fast kinetics and high photodegradation activity toward micropollutants exhibits great potential as an alternative method for water and wastewater treatment keywords magnetic carbon nanotubes tio2 pharmaceuticals natural organic matter water treatment regeneration 1 introduction effluents from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants are the main source of pharmaceuticals in natural waters 1 2 pharmaceutical concentrations as low as 500 ng l 1 in natural water could alter the reproduction and tissue regeneration of living organisms 3 5 the production and consumption of pharmaceuticals have increased dramatically over the past few decades however current wastewater treatment technologies e g activated sludge are not effective in removing these harmful compounds 6 the antiepileptic carbamazepine and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole are the most frequently detected persistent pharmaceuticals worldwide in natural and waste water 7 and their average removal efficiencies in water treatment plants are below 20 and 55 respectively 6 therefore efficient water treatment techniques are needed to reduce the release of pharmaceuticals into the aquatic environment photocatalysis is a promising advanced water treatment process for degrading pharmaceuticals that may be suitable to replace or assist conventional treatment approaches 8 10 tio2 is the most widely used semiconductor for photocatalytic processes due to its low cost non toxicity and high stability 11 in addition carbon nanotube cnt tio2 composites have attracted attention for environmental applications for several reasons cnts concentrate the contaminants by adsorption bringing the contaminants closer to the tio2 active sites for photodegradation 12 combining cnts with tio2 can promote the separation of the electron hole charges generated upon irradiation and the presence of c o ti linkages reduces the band gap and thus extends the absorption wavelength 13 previous studies of cnt tio2 have not used practical water treatment conditions such as the presence of background natural organic matter nom table s1 most experimental studies of cnt tio2 photocatalysis have focused on the kinetics and mechanisms for individual contaminants at high pharmaceutical concentrations 10 100 mg l 1 that are 104 105 times higher than their practical concentrations 14 the coexistence of nom reduces the photocatalytic activity of tio2 because nom is present in natural waters and wastewater at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than pharmaceuticals thus nom interferes with the photocatalytic mechanisms via the inner filter effect and radical scavenging and adsorbed nom competes for active sites with the targeted pollutants 15 17 the photocatalytic activity increases with the increase in the number of active reaction sites and the lifetime of photogenerated electron hole pairs which results in higher radical generation 14 hence increasing the specific surface area for photocatalytic reaction sites in cnt tio2 would reduce the probability of electron hole pair recombination and minimize the inhibitory effect of nom in this study we used the inherently magnetic particles present in pristine cnts as a green facile approach to prepare magnetic carbon nanotubes mcnts 18 our facile method is also scalable inexpensive and preserves the external surface of the nanotube walls for tio2 particles we investigated the photocatalytic activity of a mcnt tio2 composite in the presence of nom which is more relevant to conditions in water treatment plants we used industrial grade cnts to prepare mcnt tio2 by a simple mixing method industrial grade cnts was chosen due to its significant lower cost and higher content of metallic residuals i e magnetic particles compared to the analytical grade cnts the photocatalytic activity of mcnt tio2 for the photodegradation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole was tested under solar light irradiation with and without nom and we compared solar and uvc irradiation photooxidation reactivation techniques for regenerating mcnt tio2 further electrical energy demand eeo was calculated for the evaluation of energy efficiencies of the new material at

procedure was repeated three times with ethanol followed by three times with water the mcnts were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h and stored at room temperature prior to use the mcnt tio2 composite

experiments the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole 150 500 μg l 1 were studied in a glass beaker in aqueous solution 200 ml the concentrations were chosen based on reported concentrations of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in water and wastewater 25 the ph values of the solutions were adjusted to 7 0 0 2 with 0 01 m hcl and naoh the concentration of the catalyst tio2 mcnts and mcnt tio2 composites was 0 1 g l 1 the temperature was kept constant at room temperature 26 3 c a solar simulator ms 35aaa ushio lighting edge technologies japan at an intensity of 1000 w m 2 was used as a light source 26 each photocatalysis experiment consisted of two steps i adsorption of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole on the catalyst surface for 60 min in the dark with or without nom to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium additional stirring for 120 min resulted in no further adsorption ii photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole with or without nom under irradiation from the solar simulator the photocatalytic activity of the composites was investigated in the presence of nom by spiking the solution with urnom and the dissolved organic carbon doc was adjusted to 5 mg l 1 which is the average concentration in surface water and pre treated domestic wastewater 27 28 under dark conditions samples were collected at 5 10 15 30 50 and 60 min during irradiation the reaction solutions were stirred continuously and aliquots of the samples were collected at 5 10 15 20 and 30 min blank experiments without catalysts were run to test the photolysis of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in ultrapure water and in the presence of nom for 30 min all of the experiments were run in duplicate 2 4 recyclability of mcnt tio2 composites the recyclability of mcnt tio2 was tested without nom two different recyclability scenarios were tested in the first the spent mcnt tio2 after the photocatalytic degradation reaction was collected with a permanent magnet to separate it from the solution the mcnt tio2 was then used directly for the next photocatalysis cycles in the second scenario xenon short arc lamp and uvc λ 254 nm 80 w m 2 lamp irradiation were used for photooxidation reactivation the spent mcnt tio2 was collected with a permanent magnet placed in ultrapure water and exposed to solar or uvc irradiation for 1 h the photooxidation reactivated mcnt tio2 composites were used for the next cycle of photocatalysis under solar irradiation as described in section 2 3 the weight loss of mcnt tio2 after the recyclability experiments was negligible 2 5 analytical and statistical methods the carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole concentrations were analyzed using an hplc system prominence uflc shimadzu japan equipped with a uv vis absorbance detector spd 20 uflc shimadzu and a c18 column kinetex phenomenex co usa 5 μm 4 6 250 mm prior to hplc analysis the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane

comparison test p 0 05 was used to compare photocatalytic activity k app for different catalysts and different recyclability scenarios student s t test at a 5 significance level was used to compare the effect of initial concentrations and the presence of nom for both tio2 and mcnt tio2 2 6 calculation of electrical energy per order of the transformation the energy efficiency of photocatalysis is expressed in terms of electrical energy per order e eo of the transformation and is defined as the electrical energy in kilowatt hours required to degrade a contaminant by one order of magnitude in 1 m3 of contaminated water 29 e eo is determined by 1 e eo electrical power kw time h volume m 3 log c 0 c t where c 0 and c t are the initial and final concentrations of each substance mg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization fig 1 shows the sem images of mcnts tio2 and mcnt tio2 composites the number of tio2 clusters increased in the composites as the mcnt tio2 mass ratio decreased tem edx analysis indicated that there were metallic co particles inside the tubes and they were the main source of the magnetic activity of mcnts figs s2 and s3 this is consistent with previous studies on commercial cnts containing metal impurities i e fe ni and co in the tubes from the production processes which could give the material inherent magnetic properties 30 the gravimetric analysis of mcnts indicated that the magnetic particles accounted for 6 of the total mcnt mass table 1 previous mcnt preparation methods that attach magnetic particles e g metal oxides and tio2 to the surface of cnt have suffered from photodissolution and release of the metals into solution 22 31 32 however in our mcnts these metallic particles are stable and difficult to remove even in concentrated acids at high temperature 18 moreover the utilization of industrial grade cnt in this study can decrease the cost for material preparation due to relatively lower price compare to the analytical grade cnt therefore our approach has the extra advantage over previously reported methods of avoiding unintentional contamination of the solution with magnetic particles and low material cost the surface area total pore volume pore distribution and magnetization values of mcnts tio2 and mcnt tio2 composites are listed in table 1 the surface area and total pore volume of mcnt tio2 composites were higher than those of pristine tio2 confirming that tio2 was anchored to the mcnts a high surface area adsorbent the specific surface area decreased and the total pore volume of the composite decreased as the tio2 loading increased the pore volume distribution for all samples showed that mesopores 50 nm pore size 2 nm and macropores pore size 50 nm were dominant with a small percentage of micropores 1 the pores were formed by tio2 and mcnt bundles as both materials are non porous 33 34 the magnetization curves showed that all the composites had paramagnetic properties fig s4 18 and the saturation magnetization values were highest for the mcnts and decreased with increasing tio2 fraction in the mcnt tio2 composites however all composites showed high magnetic activity and responded fast 1 min to an external magnetic field xrd diffraction peaks for mcnts tio2 and mcnt tio2 composites are shown in fig s5 the mcnts had two main diffraction peaks at 2θ 26 and 43 that were attributed to the carbon nanotube graphite like structure 18 however co particles were not detected in all samples because their concentrations were below the detection sensitivity limit of the xrd measurements 30 and the main diffraction peak of co 2θ 45 overlapped with the graphite like peak 2θ 43 35 the diffraction peak of tio2 consisted of anatase main diffraction peak at 2θ 25 3 and rutile main diffraction peak at 2θ 27 4 tio2 peaks polymorphous tio2 consisting of a mixture of anatase and rutile tio2 has better photocatalytic activity and a smaller band gap than the individual phases 36 for all mcnt tio2 composites the profile and intensity of tio2 peaks were consistent with the mass ratio of tio2 in each composite and an overlap with the mcnt peaks was observed at lower tio2 masses the ftir spectra of the samples are shown in fig s6 the broad peaks at 3730 and 3380 cm 1 were assigned to oh stretching the peaks at 1520 and 970 cm 1 arose from cc stretching and bending vibrations respectively in addition the absorption peak at 690 cm 1 was characteristic of ch the peak for the tio stretching vibration appeared around 450 cm 1 for the tio2 and mcnt tio2 composites 37 3 2 adsorption and photodegradation of pharmaceuticals 3 2 1 adsorption phase the adsorption of the contaminants on or close to the catalyst surface plays an important role in the effective photodegradation of the contaminants the increase in the adsorption capacity and pore volume of mcnt tio2 can increase the overall photocatalytic activity due to the synergetic effect of adsorption and photocatalysis at initial carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole concentrations of 150 μg l 1 all mcnt tio2 composites exhibited adsorption equilibria in the range of 1 1 4 mg g 1 which were much higher than that of bare tio2 0 2 mg g 1 fig s7 the adsorption equilibrium of the materials was positively correlated with their surface area as indicated by the r2 values 0 99 p 0 001 the main mechanisms for the adsorption on the surface of tio2 are the electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange 38 on the other hand the presence of the cnt in case of mcnt tio2 enhances the adsorption mechanism via hydrophobic interaction π π interaction hydrogen bonding interactions and electrostatic interactions 39 carbamazepine is a neutral species therefore the mass transport of carbamazepine is mainly governed by hydrophobic and π π interactions 40 in contrast sulfamethoxazole has two acidic dissociation constants of pk a 1 1 85 and pk a 2 5 6 41 indicating that sulfamethoxazole molecules were present in anionic form under the neutral ph conditions in this study and the adsorption mechanism onto mcnt tio2 and tio2 could be affected by electrostatic interactions 3 2 2 photodegradation phase the results showed that for direct photolysis without catalysts under solar irradiation carbamazepine showed negligible removal 2 whereas the sulfamethoxazole concentration decreased significantly by 20 50 fig s8 the carbamazepine removal was negligible under direct photodegradation because it does not have functional groups that absorb radiation at 290 nm which is the main solar irradiation spectrum 42 the higher removal of sulfamethoxazole is related to its phenylamine functional group which absorbs radiation at 290 nm 43 the photocatalytic degradation for both compounds using all composites was tested the photodegradation reactions were described quantitively by the langmuir hinshelwood model and the pseudo first order rates k app were used to examine the photodegradation efficiencies 44 k app of carbamazepine followed the trend mcnt tio2 1 5 mcnt tio2 1 10 tio2 mcnt tio2 1 1 not significantly different mcnt tio2 5 1 mcnt tio2 10 1 p 0 001 fig 2 the highest carbamazepine photodegradation was observed with mcnt tio2 1 5 k app 6 8 10 2 min 1 which was almost 1 5 times the value for bare tio2 k app 4 6 10 2 min 1 and the maximum synergetic effect between tio2 and mcnt was achieved with mcnt tio2 1 5 the solar light reactivity of tio2 was enhanced significantly in the presence of mcnt due to 1 the excited mcnt can inject electrons into tio2 which increases the photocurrent 2 the excitation electron from mcnt can combine with dissolved o2 to form superoxide and 3 mcnt provides suitable sites for the sorption of contaminants acts as an electron sink and renders visible light absorption due to ti o c linkage i e band gap reduction however increasing the tio2 mcnt mass ratio further mcnt tio2 1 10 reduced the degradation efficiency mainly because of the aggregation of tio2 on the mcnts which limited the number of active sites for sorption and photocatalysis 45 moreover an excessive amount of mcnts mcnt tio2 10 1 and mcnt tio2 5 1 also decreased the photodegradation rate of carbamazepine by screening the light and preventing the photocatalytic reaction 46 therefore mcnt tio2 1 5 was selected for the subsequent experiments as the optimum mcnt tio2 mass ratio for achieving the maximum photocatalytic degradation of the target contaminants we evaluated the photodegradation rate at initial concentrations of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole of 150 and 500 μg l 1 the photodegradation rate of carbamazepine decreased significantly at the higher initial concentrations for both tio2 and mcnt tio2 p 0 01 fig s9 this reduction may be related to the absorption of light by carbamazepine and the degradation intermediates which may interfere with the photocatalytic degradation reaction however the effect of the increased initial concentration was small for sulfamethoxazole hydroxylation processes i e hydroxyl radical oxidation have been reported as a main degradation mechanism of carbamazepine by tio2 based photocatalysis 47 48 in contrast degradation mechanism for sulfamethoxazole happened due to hydroxylation process and also direct degradation i e direct photolysis via the cleavage of the sn bond 41 at fixed catalysts concentration and irradiation times the total hydroxyl radicals amounts are constant 49 therefore the effect of increased initial concentration at fixed catalyst concentration on the degradation rate was more prone in case of carbamazepine than sulfamethoxazole where direct photolysis also take part in the total degradation rate for the latter case 3 3 adsorption and photodegradation of pharmaceuticals in the presence of nom the presence of nom is of particular concern because it competes for the adsorption sites and quenches advanced oxidation processes 50 the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine fig 3 and sulfamethoxazole fig s10 using tio2 and mcnt tio2 1 5 was tested in the presence of nom which significantly decreased the adsorption of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole onto tio2 and mcnt tio2 1 5 p 0 05 the competitive adsorption of nom reduced the interaction between the pharmaceuticals and the catalysts 16 these observations also confirmed the advantage of using mcnt tio2 because despite the competition the high surface area of the composites provided enough active sites for the adsorption of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole on mcnt tio2 in contrast to tio2 the heterogeneous nature of nom affects the molecular sieving behavior of tio2 and cnts in the presence of nom tio2 preferentially adsorbs small to medium molecular weight species 0 1 kda 15 whereas cnts adsorb species with molecular weights of 1 3 kda 39 the presence of nom significantly reduced the photodegradation rate of tio2 for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole from 4 2 10 2 and 4 7 10 2 min 1 respectively in the absence of nom to 6 10 3 and 5 10 3 min 1 p 0 01 for mcnt tio2 1 5 the photodegradation rates of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were also decreased significantly from 5 3 10 2 and 4 9 10 2 min 1 respectively in the absence of nom to 1 2 10 2 and 7 10 3 min 1 respectively p 0 01 the significant decrease in photodegradation rates of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were due to competitive adsorption 51 scavenger effect of nom toward oh radicals 17 and superoxide 52 as well as absorbing light via the inner filter effect 53 54 nom absorbs in both the uv and visible light spectrum diminishing the illumination intensity that available for the production of reactive oxygen species ros further the non selective nature of oh radicals and superoxide lead to the ros loss due to reaction with either the targeted pharmaceuticals or the non targeted compounds i e background nom besides those reasons the adsorbed nom i e electron rich compounds were also capable of scavenging the holes h in the catalysts valence band and reduced the interaction of the pharmaceuticals close to the catalysts active site for the photodegradation processes 16 the inhibitory effect of nom depends strongly on the properties of the target compounds nom quality and quantity and the catalysts in our study despite the lower photodegradation rate in the presence of nom the reductions in the removal efficiency and the photodegradation rate of mcnt tio2 1 5 were less than those of bare tio2 under the operational conditions these findings highlight the effect of nom on the photocatalytic degradation using mcnt tio2 although future studies will be necessary to understand fully the effects of nom types and concentrations on the removal efficacy of photocatalytic degradation the comparison of photocatalytic performance of fabricated mcnt tio2 with peer cnt tio2 composites is summarized in table s1 previous studies set out that the total removal of pharmaceuticals was ranging from 50 to 99 for various cnt tio2 composites however the removal of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole from this study were 60 and 40 respectively the photocatalytic activity of cnt tio2 composites mainly related with the photocatalysts morphologies pharmaceuticals physicochemical properties initial concentrations of pharmaceuticals source of the lights or intensities and the effect of water chemistries e g ph background co existing organic or inorganic species 14 it was noted that most of the previous studies evaluate the photocatalytic activity of cnt tio2 under uv irradiation λmax 254 366 and in ultrapure water matrices therefore this different might be largely because the difference in the source of the light and the water matrices compared with the others the fabricated mcnt tio2 in this study exhibits a promising photocatalytic performance under solar irradiation and in the presence of co existing background nom 3 4 recyclability of the mcnt tio2 composite the recyclability of mcnt tio2 1 5 was investigated by repeating the carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole photodegradation experiments in the absence of nom for five cycles of treatment and cleaning fig 4 photoreactivation by solar and uvc regeneration were used in this study where uvc regeneration gave the best performance probably due to the higher energy for the production of radicals the carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole removal tended to decrease from the first to the fifth cycle for all of the conditions direct recycling of mcnt tio2 1 5 statistically showed the highest decrease in the percentage removal of carbamazepine 40 decrease after five cycles followed by solar regeneration 20 decrease after five cycles and uvc regeneration 15 decrease after five cycles p 0 001 a similar trend was observed for sulfamethoxazole where uvc regeneration statistically gave the lowest decrease in the removal efficiency after five cycles p 0 001 sulfamethoxazole also showed a lower decrease in removal efficiencies after five cycles than carbamazepine for direct recycling solar regeneration and uvc regeneration these results agree with a previous study 55 in which pharmaceuticals with f and s containing groups e g sulfamethoxazole were more rapidly photodegraded and regenerated than molecules without these groups carbamazepine in tio2 photocatalysis the decrease in percentage removal of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole may be due to the accumulation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole or their photodegradation byproducts on mcnt tio2 1 5 56 3 5 electrical energy determination the photochemical process of contaminant degradation is energy intensive and the electrical energy per order e eo represents a major fraction of the total operating cost 57 this approach allows a simple comparison and provides data required for scale up and economic analysis however comprehensive information about the use of e eo values in modified tio2 based photocatalysis applications is still limited 29 the e eo values calculated for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole removal in ultrapure water and in the presence of nom are shown in fig 5 in general the photocatalysis techniques gave lower electrical consumptions than photolysis for the degradation of the pharmaceuticals mainly due to the production of radicals which increased the degradation rate the electrical energy consumption for the photocatalytic process in the presence of nom was higher than that without nom the electrical energy consumption depended on the water quality e g presence of nom and the pharmaceutical properties stable or prone to direct photodegradation because photolysis and photocatalysis are compound specific processes 58 moreover e eo values of 2076 19 954 kw h m 3 order 1 were necessary to transform carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in ultrapure water and in the presence of nom using pristine tio2 whereas lower e eo values of 1820 15 054 kw h m 3 order 1 were needed for mcnt tio2 due to the synergetic effect between mcnts and tio2 in the composite system it should be noted that these calculated e eo values were used for comparison purposes and they may differ in real water samples where inorganic species are present 4 conclusions we used a solar light driven mcnt tio2 composite for the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole an optimum mass ratio of mcnt to tio2 was needed to achieve maximum photodegradation of pharmaceuticals the recyclability of mcnt tio2 was assessed through five consecutive cycles of treatment and cleaning the removal efficiency decreased as the number of consecutive cycles increased due to mcnt tio2 fouling to recover the photocatalytic efficiency solar and uvc irradiation were used for regeneration uvc irradiation showed better performance than solar irradiation finally mcnt tio2 was tested under more realistic conditions in the presence of nom and mcnt tio2 still degraded carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole compared with pristine tio2 the photocatalytic activity of mcnt tio2 was higher and the electrical energy consumption was lower future studies should test mcnt tio2 for the removal of other organic micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides dyes etc in real waters and or wastewaters and for the identification of

14331,this study focused on the regeneration of iron sorbents and the investigation of sorbent properties after exposure to four sorption desorption cycles batch regeneration tests with sodium hydroxide were conducted on two commercial sorbents cfh 12 and geh 101 saturated with vanadium cfh 12 is ferric oxyhydroxide that also contains some gypsum and goethite kemira oyj geh 101 is ferric hydroxide containing akaganéite ß feooh and ferrihydrite geh wasserchemie both materials displayed similar performance in sorption and desorption studies despite their mineralogical difference both materials can be reused but the sorption efficiency decreased from 95 97 to about 53 55 after the first sorption initial v 50 mg l dosage 10 g l and then remained at the same level naoh desorbed 84 86 of vanadium in the first cycle x ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the surface did not contain vanadium after regeneration thus the desorption resistant fractions were located in the pores of the materials subsequent desorption stages provided the same or higher recovery of vanadium both materials showed some wider pore size distribution whereas pore volume increased significantly only with cfh 12 this study confirmed that regeneration with alkali and reuse of iron sorbents is a viable option although the sorption and desorption efficiency are affected by the treatment keywords water treatment sorption regeneration desorption reuse 1 introduction iron materials are excellent sorbents due to their large surface area and surface hydroxyl groups which can complex anionic species such as vanadates phosphate and arsenic from water 1 3 there are several iron materials that can be utilized as sorbents for example goethite α feooh akaganéite β feooh hematite α fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 and ferrihydrite surface area porosity the point of zero charge phpzc particle size and the amount of surface hydroxyl groups are the most important factors affecting the performance of iron materials once the material is saturated with the contaminant ion the sorbents used must be carefully handled especially in the case of toxic species e g as usually they are disposed in sanitary landfills or special hazardous waste landfills depending on the result of the leaching tests 4 in recent years there has been growing interest in recycling materials 4 6 regeneration and reuse of the iron material could decrease costs and support the sustainable use of natural resources wang and chen 5 showed that in the removal of arsenic in small water systems the cost of media replacement accounts for the majority of the total cost in addition regeneration will decrease the amount of waste significantly for example sarkar et al 7 demonstrated that the regeneration of hybrid anion exchanger resulted in about a 100 times smaller amount of solid waste chen et al 8 reported that about 80 of arsenic could be desorbed from exhausted ferric oxyhydroxide sorbents with a 1 m naoh solution which allowed the reuse of the iron sorbent in the case of vanadium 3 m naoh resulted in 85 recovery of vanadium from iron oxyhydroxide granules 9 the main limitation of regeneration is the disposal of spent regenerant precipitation of arsenic and vanadium with iron could be achieved after ph adjustment 7 10 in which case safe disposal of the spent regenerant could be obtained however reuse of the regenerant solution would decrease the costs but also concentrate the desorbed species for subsequent recovery steps the effect of regeneration on the characteristics of iron materials is not well understood previously it was found that the surface area and total pore volume of ferric oxyhydroxide cfh 12 increased due to naoh treatment which might have been the reason for different sorption and desorption efficiency in the subsequent cycle 9 the present study further investigates this phenomenon with two different types of iron materials cfh 12 and geh 101 cfh 12 is amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide and contains some goethite which has a diaspore structure based on the hexagonal close packing of anions hcp 11 a minor amount of gypsum and jarosite as impurities has also been observed in the cfh 12 product depending on the batch 12 geh 101 contains akaganéite and fe oh 3 akaganéite has a hollandite type structure which is based on the body centred cubic packing of anions bcp 11 the structure contains tunnels which are stabilized most commonly with cl ions both cfh 12 and geh 101 have been applied successfully to remove arsenic species from water 13 15 and cfh 12 has been investigated for vanadium removal from synthetic solutions 9 industrial process water 1 and natural water 12 however very little is known about the sorption of vanadium on akaganéite in addition to the best of our knowledge no information is available on the desorption of vanadium from akaganéite based material and reuse of said material the aim of this study was to test vanadium sorption and desorption in batch tests using cfh 12 and geh 101 sorbents and sodium hydroxide for regeneration fresh washed and used materials were characterized using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem x ray diffraction xrd and surface area and pore size measurements in addition the reuse of the regenerant solution was investigated with the cfh 12 sorbent

bjh barrett joyner halenda method data is presented as the differential pore volume distribution dv dd versus the pore diameter 2 3 batch experiments batch sorption experiments were conducted at room temperature 21 c by shaking the sorbent materials with synthetic vanadium solution in a plastic bottle in a rotating shaker for a selected period of time after shaking the sorbent was separated from the sample by centrifugation jouan c4 12 10 min 2500 rpm firstly 10 ml was taken from the top of the supernatant for vanadium analysis next a sample was taken for ph analysis referred to as the final ph two or three replicates were performed for each experiment for the investigation of the effect of initial ph batch sorption experiments were conducted using a contact time of 24 h a dosage of 10 g

parameters of kinetic models the chi squared χ2 value and the coefficient of determination r2 were calculated in order to identify the best fit models 20 table s2 vanadium sorption capacity was measured without ph adjustment using a 72 h contact time dosage of 2 g l and vanadium concentration ranging between 10 and 300 mg l to study the effect of time on desorption the sorption was performed first with a 10 g l dosage of iron sorbent and 50 mg l vanadium solution using a 24 h contact time after batch shaking samples were centrifuged and then samples were taken for vanadium and ph analyses

mixing for a certain period 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 6 h the sorbent was separated by centrifugation and the supernatant was sampled for v analysis the naoh treated sample for characterization was prepared separately as follows washed sorbent was mixed with 3 m naoh for 2 h then the mixture was centrifuged and the regenerant solution discarded the naoh treated sorbent was washed with water several times and then dried at 60 c for approximately 24 h to assess the reuse of sorbents four sorption desorption cycles were carried out sorption was performed with 2 g of iron sorbent dosage of 10 g l and using 200 ml vanadium solution 50 mg l v and a 24 h contact time after sorption the sorbent was separated by centrifugation and the supernatant was sampled for v and ph analyses as described above after that the rest of the solution was removed carefully from the bottle regeneration was performed with 100 ml of 3 m naoh and using a two hour contact time the sorbent was separated by centrifugation and the supernatant was sampled for v analysis after regeneration the sorbent was washed once with 0 01 m hcl and then with water several times washing was continued until the ph was neutralised after the last washing stage water was pipetted carefully from the bottle and the next cycle was started after four cycles the sorbent was dried at 60 for approximately 24 h named after 4 cycles recovery was calculated from the sorption solution and without taking into account the non desorbed vanadium present in the material after the 1st and subsequent cycles reuse of the regenerant solution 3 m naoh was studied with the cfh 12 sorbent only firstly 2 g of sorbent dosage 10 g l was treated with vanadium solution volume 200 ml 50 mg l v contact time 24 h then the sample was centrifuged and a sample was taken for vanadium and ph analyses as described above the rest of the solution was pipetted carefully from the bottle the regeneration was performed with 100 ml 3 m naoh and using a two hour contact time after regeneration the sorbent was separated by centrifugation and a 1 ml sample of spent regenerant solution was taken for vanadium analysis then the rest of the naoh solution was recovered by pipetting and used for the new vanadium treated sorbent sample about 2 3 ml of fresh 3 m naoh was added per cycle so that 100 ml volume was maintained in each regeneration step 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph vanadium v occurs as anionic species when the ph is 3 21 whereas anion sorption onto iron materials is favoured at ph values lower than their phpzc the akaganéite based material had a phpzc of 8 2 22 and reported values for goethite have been mostly above 8 23 previously it has been shown that ph 3 4 was the optimal ph for vanadium sorption on iron sorbent 24 whereas increasing the dosage provides constant removal rates over a wider ph range 1 24 in this study a similar finding was made for both sorbents when the dosage used was 10 g l and the vanadium concentration 50 mg l as the initial ph values of the solutions were between 4 8 vanadium removal rates were 96 99 with cfh 12 and 95 99 with geh 101 table s1 at a higher initial ph of 9 5 vanadium removal rates were slightly lower for geh 101 90 final ph 6 5 thus in this research subsequent sorption experiments were carried out without ph adjustment at about ph 6 first sorption stage 3 2 sorption and desorption kinetics the kinetics of vanadium sorption both onto cfh 12 and geh 101 are shown in fig 1 after 72 h 93 of vanadium was removed with both sorbents dosage 5 g l initial v 50 mg l the initial sorption of vanadium was fast due to the surface reactions then the sorption was followed by slower uptake several authors have reported similar behaviour with the adsorption of different anions on iron materials 1 25 26 slower uptake has been considered to result from slow diffusion into pores 25 and from the decrease in the driving concentration difference between the bulk solution and the surface 26 of the three kinetic models applied pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich table s2 the elovich model was found to provide the best fit to the kinetic data both cfh 12 and geh 101 when considering both the correlation co efficient r2 and the chi squared χ2 value cfh 12 r2 0 9940 and χ2 0 0797 geh 101 r2 0 9944 and χ2 0 0398 the elovich model is known to describe the kinetics of chemisorption well 20 the α value of geh 101 was higher than that of cfh 12 which indicates a higher initial sorption rate of geh 101 the regeneration efficiency of the v treated sorbents revealed that vanadium was desorbed from cfh 12 to a slightly higher extent than from geh 101 fig 2 with a contact time of 3 h or less this might be due to the higher pore volume of geh 101 table 1 as compared to cfh 12 and thus a higher amount of desorption resistant fraction with both materials firstly the recovery of desorbed vanadium increased and reached maximum at three hours while some lower recovery was observed at four and six hours the possible reason for this might be the change in textural properties due to prolonged alkaline conditions especially with cfh 12 this might have resulted in the development of new pores and larger pores that are accessible for vanadium and thus lower recovery was obtained 3 3 vanadium sorption capacity vanadium sorption capacity was measured at an initial ph of 6 and using a contact time of 72 h due to the slow uptake rate shown in fig 1 the maximum vanadium sorption capacity was 34 mg g with cfh 12 and 22 mg g with geh 101 fig 3 which were somewhat higher than the capacity of iron loaded peat 16 mg g 27 and similar or lower than that of feooh 25 20 mg g 24 and fe oh 3 β feooh 107 80 mg g 24 at lower initial concentrations 50 mg l first three data points in fig 3 sorption capacity was the same for both sorbents while at higher concentrations differences in sorption capacity were obvious besides the properties of sorbents the speciation of vanadium which is dependent on both the ph and concentration may affect the adsorbability of vanadium species on sorbents at higher concentrations polynuclear forms of vanadium predominate 21 3 4 sorbent regeneration and reuse in cyclic treatments the aim was to provide a high removal rate of vanadium in the first sorption and a high desorption rate in the first regeneration thus the dosage and contact times were adjusted according to the contact time experiments presented above dosage 10 g l 24 h sorption and 2 h desorption both materials displayed similar performance in the sorption and desorption studies despite their mineralogical difference fig 4 a and b both materials can be reused but the sorption efficiency decreased from 95 97 to about 53 55 after the first sorption and then remained at the same level the lower efficiency probably mostly resulted from incomplete regeneration but also from the higher final ph 7 8 in the 2nd 4th sorption stages naoh desorbed 84 86 of vanadium in the first cycle incomplete regeneration implies that pore diffusion had occurred to some extent once the pores were occupied and more resistant to desorption lower uptakes were obtained in the subsequent sorption stages probably due to the prevalent mechanism being complex formation with surface functional groups the presence of desorption resistant fraction was also detected in the case of the regeneration of ferric hydroxide loaded support materials saturated with arsenate 28 and with phosphate loaded ferric hydroxide 29 on the other hand subsequent desorption stages provided the same or higher recovery of vanadium calculated from the sorbed amount in each cycle the design of the sorption process should thus be based on the regenerated material and taking into account the desorption resistant fraction the reuse of the regenerant was studied only with cfh 12 material reuse was successful for four times only under selected experimental conditions fig s2 after being used four times and reaching a vanadium solution of slightly above 300 mg l the spent regenerant was inefficient in desorbing vanadium for the recovery of vanadium from the spent regenerant solution one option could be precipitation with iron after ph adjustment the formed sludge could be used in ferrovanadium production another option might be precipitation with calcium as calcium vanadate apatite ca10 vo4 6 oh 2 30 which would allow the direct reuse of naoh 3 5 characterization of sorbents after four cycles the materials were recovered and characterized along with fresh washed v treated and naoh treated samples xrd data confirmed that geh 101 contained poorly crystallized akaganéite fig s1a which is consistent with xrd data by kersten et al 22 they showed that 2 line ferrihydrite was present in large quantities in the material 42 4 after treatments the geh 101 showed similar crystallinity in all samples and no obvious line broadening was observed due to the lower amount of chlorine as reported earlier 31 the xrd pattern of the geh 101 sample after four cycles did not show any new peaks associated with vanadium nevertheless a slight decrease in surface area was observed washed geh 101 298 1 m2 g v treated 282 0 m2 g naoh treated 274 0 m2 g after 4 cycles 265 1 2 8 m2 g amorphous cfh 12 contained some goethite and gypsum fig s1b gypsum was removed from cfh 12 by washing the improved crystallinity of cfh 12 after four cycles was obvious and no peaks associated with vanadium were seen the improved crystallinity could also be observed as a lower surface area 202 6 0 6 m2 g in comparison to the washed 241 8 m2 g v treated 235 6 m2 g and naoh treated 255 2 m2 g cfh 12 on the other hand washing increased the surface area and pore volume of cfh 12 material significantly as compared to the fresh cfh 12 the reason for the increase might be the dissolution of contaminants from cfh 12 and or particle degradation during washing particle size and crystallinity have a great effect on the surface area of iron materials in general the lower the particle size and crystallinity the higher the surface area the nitrogen adsorption isotherms showed that the isotherms for both fresh cfh 12 and fresh geh 101 were type iv fig 5a and b according to the iupac classification 32 the shape of the isotherms i e an almost horizontal curve at high relative pressure p p0 indicates that the mesopores 2 50 nm are predominant hysteresis loops observed at mid relative pressures and higher imply that the mechanism of mesopore filling varies from mesopore emptying type h4 hysteresis was observed with cfh 12 although very small for fresh and washed samples which is often associated with narrow slit like pores 33 the steep desorption branch with geh 101 refers to type h2 hysteresis which agrees well with previous research 34 washing the materials did not affect the shape of the isotherms the isotherms of the geh 101 samples remained similar after naoh treatment and cyclic treatment fig 5 a the pore volume and the pore width were not affected in the case of geh 101 however the pore size distribution was slightly broadened by the naoh and cyclic treatments fig 5c in the case of the cfh 12 samples regeneration changed the shape of the nitrogen adsorption isotherms fig 5b the curves were much steeper in addition the sample after four cycles did not have a saturation plateau at high relative pressures which was observed for other samples and is a typical feature of type iv isotherms 32 regeneration significantly increased the pore width fig 5d and the pore volume of cfh 12 0 2542 0 0007 cm3 g after 4 cycles 0 2427 cm3 g naoh treated fig 5d the surfaces of the iron sorbents were uneven having numerous small particles attached to bigger granules fig 6 after alkali treatment the surface seemed to be smoother high magnification images of alkali treated geh 101 fig 6e and f revealed areas with nanorod morphology as has been shown for akaganéite samples 35 the xps survey spectra of fresh and washed geh 101 samples confirmed the presence of o fe c cl and f the c 1s was composed of adventitious carbon contamination co2 and hydrocarbons cl 2p3 2 peak existed at 198 3 198 4 ev and the cl 2p peak contained chlorine ions stabilizing the akaganéite structure in addition fluorine which was present in a small amount may be accommodated in the akaganéite tunnels 11 washing decreased some of the chlorine ions probably the ions existing on the external surfaces chlorine content decreased on the surface of geh 101 even more due to regeneration as compared to the fresh and washed samples samples after four cycles still showed a small cl 2p peak on the survey spectrum although the naoh treated sample did not however chlorine most likely existed deeper in the naoh treated geh 101 since xrd confirmed akaganéite in the material due to the small size of the hollandite tunnels the chlorine content cannot be decreased below 2 wt total content without disrupting the structure 31 on the other hand cai et al 36 reported that hydroxide ions also have the ability to hold akaganéite tunnels although not as strongly as chlorine or fluorine the surface of fresh and washed cfh 12 samples contained o fe c and s according to xps also minor amounts of mg ca k and f were detected in the fresh sample and f was detected in the washed sample the c 1s was composed of adventitious carbon contamination washing also decreased the amount of sulphur which originated from the gypsum impurity leaching of impurities from cfh 12 had also been confirmed earlier in a pilot study 1 with the cfh 12 sample from the same batch the o 1s spectra of fresh materials and samples after four cycles were similar to those with the washed and naoh treated samples respectively thus their spectra are not shown in fig 7 the o 1s spectrum of geh 101 showed two components fig 7a which can mainly be assigned to the oxygen binding with fe feo 529 7 529 8 ev and hydroxyl binding with fe feoh 531 1 531 2 ev surface contamination due to co bonds can be found around 532 ev 37 whereas adsorbed water has been reported to exist at around 533 4 ev 3 the feo feoh ratio was about 1 02 based on the peak area for pure akaganéite the ratio should be 1 0 3 the o 1s spectra of cfh 12 also showed two components fig 7b which are mainly related to o 1s oxide 530 1 530 2 ev and o 1s hydroxide 531 6 531 7 ev 38 with goethite these components should have approximately equal intensity 39 as with the geh 101 sample the cfh 12 sample also showed some carbon contamination and adsorbed water could not be excluded the regeneration decreased the proportion of the o 1s hydroxide component for both iron sorbents fig 7 which was also confirmed with cfh 12 in a previous study 9 regeneration also shifted the o 1s peak to a lower be by about 0 2 ev with geh 101 and about 0 7 ev with cfh 12 the o 1s spectra of v treated samples showed that the surface hydroxyl component decreased significantly after vanadium sorption the results further confirmed the reaction between surface hydroxyl groups and vanadate anions the peak related to the vo bonds is known to exist at 530 ev 37 and thus these bonds were included in the component at the lower be side which is mainly attributed to feo bonds fe 2p3 2 peaks of fresh and washed geh 101 existed at binding energies of around 711 0 711 2 ev data not shown which is consistent with values reported for akaganéite 3 fresh and washed cfh 12 had an fe 2p3 2 peak at around 711 6 ev data not shown goethite has an fe 2p3 2 peak of around 711 ev 40 41 regeneration also shifted the fe 2p spectra in the case of geh 101 the shift was only observed for naoh treated samples and was clearly at a higher be about 0 7 ev in the case of cfh 12 both the naoh treated cfh 12 and cfh 12 samples after four cycles showed a shift to a lower be by 0 7 ev the v 2p xps spectrum confirmed the presence of vanadium on the surface of v treated geh 101 and cfh 12 samples whereas negligible amounts were observed after four cycles data not shown a similar result was obtained earlier for cfh 12 9 and it was concluded that the main desorption mechanism was the reverse reaction of surface complex formation the v 2p3 2 peak was found at 517 1 ev full width at half maximum fwhm 1 2 ev with geh 101 and at 517 5 ev fwhm 1 2 ev with cfh 12 which relates to the v5 state 37 4 conclusions the results of this study support the idea of regeneration but also confirm that some changes in iron sorbents can be assumed to occur due to alkali treatment the poorly crystallized akaganéite geh 101 was more stable towards alkali treatment the most obvious changes were some wider pore size distribution and partial removal of chlorine nonetheless xrd did not reveal any decomposition of the akaganéite structure due to a lower amount of chlorine line positions remained similar ferric oxyhydroxide with some goethite cfh 12 showed more changes in chemical and physical properties after alkali treatment its pore volume and pore width increased significantly moreover the xrd pattern showed more crystallized goethite these results suggest that akaganéite based material is a better choice for pore size sensitive applications for example if adsorption desorption or selectivity is affected very much by the pore size despite their mineralogical difference both sorbents displayed similar performance in vanadium sorption and desorption studies vanadium was desorbed efficiently from the surface the desorption resistant fraction being located in the pores lower sorption efficiency due to incomplete regeneration in subsequent cycles needs to be taken into account in the design of the water treatment process although this study focused on vanadium removal and recovery these materials are also being used in many other applications and for different contaminants regeneration and reuse of iron materials in water and wastewater treatment could decrease the costs of the treatment and amount of waste disposal in landfills and also support the

14331,this study focused on the regeneration of iron sorbents and the investigation of sorbent properties after exposure to four sorption desorption cycles batch regeneration tests with sodium hydroxide were conducted on two commercial sorbents cfh 12 and geh 101 saturated with vanadium cfh 12 is ferric oxyhydroxide that also contains some gypsum and goethite kemira oyj geh 101 is ferric hydroxide containing akaganéite ß feooh and ferrihydrite geh wasserchemie both materials displayed similar performance in sorption and desorption studies despite their mineralogical difference both materials can be reused but the sorption efficiency decreased from 95 97 to about 53 55 after the first sorption initial v 50 mg l dosage 10 g l and then remained at the same level naoh desorbed 84 86 of vanadium in the first cycle x ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the surface did not contain vanadium after regeneration thus the desorption resistant fractions were located in the pores of the materials subsequent desorption stages provided the same or higher recovery of vanadium both materials showed some wider pore size distribution whereas pore volume increased significantly only with cfh 12 this study confirmed that regeneration with alkali and reuse of iron sorbents is a viable option although the sorption and desorption efficiency are affected by the treatment keywords water treatment sorption regeneration desorption reuse 1 introduction iron materials are excellent sorbents due to their large surface area and surface hydroxyl groups which can complex anionic species such as vanadates phosphate and arsenic from water 1 3 there are several iron materials that can be utilized as sorbents for example goethite α feooh akaganéite β feooh hematite α fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 and ferrihydrite surface area porosity the point of zero charge phpzc particle size and the amount of surface hydroxyl groups are the most important factors affecting the performance of iron materials once the material is saturated with the contaminant ion the sorbents used must be carefully handled especially in the case of toxic species e g as usually they are disposed in sanitary landfills or special hazardous waste landfills depending on the result of the leaching tests 4 in recent years there has been growing interest in recycling materials 4 6 regeneration and reuse of the iron material could decrease costs and support the sustainable use of natural resources wang and chen 5 showed that in the removal of arsenic in small water systems the cost of media replacement accounts for the majority of the total cost in addition regeneration will decrease the amount of waste significantly for example sarkar et al 7 demonstrated that the regeneration of hybrid anion exchanger resulted in about a 100 times smaller amount of solid waste chen et al 8 reported that about 80 of arsenic could be desorbed from exhausted ferric oxyhydroxide sorbents with a 1 m naoh solution which allowed the reuse of the iron sorbent in the case of vanadium 3 m naoh resulted in 85 recovery of vanadium from iron oxyhydroxide granules 9 the main limitation of regeneration is the disposal of spent regenerant precipitation of arsenic and vanadium with iron could be achieved after ph adjustment 7 10 in which case safe disposal of the spent regenerant could be obtained however reuse of the regenerant solution would decrease the costs but also concentrate the desorbed species for subsequent recovery steps the effect of regeneration on the characteristics of iron materials is not well understood previously it was found that the surface area and total pore volume of ferric oxyhydroxide cfh 12 increased due to naoh treatment which might have been the reason for different sorption and desorption efficiency in the subsequent cycle 9 the present study further investigates this phenomenon with two different types of iron materials cfh 12 and geh 101 cfh 12 is amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide and contains some goethite which has a diaspore structure based on the hexagonal close packing of anions hcp 11 a minor amount of gypsum and jarosite as impurities has also been observed in the cfh 12 product depending on the batch 12 geh 101 contains akaganéite and fe oh 3 akaganéite has a hollandite type structure which is based on the body centred cubic packing of anions bcp 11 the structure contains tunnels which are stabilized most commonly with cl ions both cfh 12 and geh 101 have been applied successfully to remove arsenic species from water 13 15 and cfh 12 has been investigated for vanadium removal from synthetic solutions 9 industrial process water 1 and natural water 12 however very little is known about the sorption of vanadium on akaganéite in addition to the best of our knowledge no information is available on the desorption of vanadium from akaganéite based material and reuse of said material the aim of this study was to test vanadium sorption and desorption in batch tests using cfh 12 and geh 101 sorbents and sodium hydroxide for regeneration fresh washed and used materials were characterized using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem x ray diffraction xrd and surface area and pore size measurements in addition the reuse of the regenerant solution was investigated with the cfh 12 sorbent 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials table 1 shows the chemical and physical properties for the iron sorbents before testing materials were washed with milli q water about ten times and dried in an oven at 60 c for approximately 24 h sodium metavanadate navo3 sigma aldrich was used for the preparation of synthetic vanadium solutions solid pellets of naoh sigma aldrich were used for the preparation of regenerant solutions and for ph adjustment hcl merck kgaa was used for neutralization after regeneration and for ph adjustment 2 2 analyses vanadium concentration was analysed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy gfaas perkin elmer aanalyst 600 with argon following standard method sfs 5074 1990 with the exception of sorption capacity experiments where vanadium was analysed by the phosphoric acid sodium tungstate spectrophotometry method uv 1800 shimadzu 16 a metrohm 744 ph meter was used for measuring the ph of the vanadium solutions the xrd analyses were performed with a rigaku smartlab rotating anode diffractometer using co kα radiation the ground samples were measured at room temperature in the 2 theta range from 5 to 110 with a step size of 0 02 the diffraction patterns were analysed using pdxl2 rigaku analysis software with an icdd pdf 4 database the surface morphology of materials was studied by fesem zeiss sigma the samples were coated with carbon 5 nm in a vacuum evaporator jeol jee 420 xps was carried out with a thermo fisher scientific escalab 250xi using a monochromatic al kα source 1486 6 ev the shirley function was used to subtract the background the charge correction was performed by setting the binding energy be of adventitious carbon to 284 8 ev the surface area and pore size distribution were measured with an asap 2020 surface area and porosity analyser micromeritics the surface area was measured by the bet brunauer emmett and teller nitrogen adsorption technique at 195 86 c in a 0 01 0 1 relative pressure range before analysis the samples were out gassed in a vacuum for 12 h at a temperature of 100 c the pore size distribution was measured by analysing the desorption branches of the isotherm using the bjh barrett joyner halenda method data is presented as the differential pore volume distribution dv dd versus the pore diameter 2 3 batch experiments batch sorption experiments were conducted at room temperature 21 c by shaking the sorbent materials with synthetic vanadium solution in a plastic bottle in a rotating shaker for a selected period of time after shaking the sorbent was separated from the sample by centrifugation jouan c4 12 10 min 2500 rpm firstly 10 ml was taken from the top of the supernatant for vanadium analysis next a sample was taken for ph analysis referred to as the final ph two or three replicates were performed for each experiment for the investigation of the effect of initial ph batch sorption experiments were conducted using a contact time of 24 h a dosage of 10 g l and a vanadium concentration of 50 mg l the initial ph of the solutions was adjusted to the desired ph value with hcl or naoh 4 9 5 for the investigation of sorption kinetics tests were conducted using a dosage of 5 g l and a vanadium concentration of 50 mg l the initial ph of the vanadium solution was about 6 without ph adjustment and the following contact times were studied 1 4 24 48 and 72 h the used sorbent after 72 h sorption was recovered for characterization named v treated the used sorbent was washed three times with water and dried at 60 c for approximately 24 h the adsorption kinetics were analysed by the pseudo first order pfo equation 17 the pseudo second order pso equation 18 and the elovich equation 19 table s2 the non linear method was applied to determine the parameters of kinetic models the chi squared χ2 value and the coefficient of determination r2 were calculated in order to identify the best fit models 20 table s2 vanadium sorption capacity was measured without ph adjustment using a 72 h contact time dosage of 2 g l and vanadium concentration ranging between 10 and 300 mg l to study the effect of time on desorption the sorption was performed first with a 10 g l dosage of iron sorbent and 50 mg l vanadium solution using a 24 h contact time after batch shaking samples were centrifuged and then samples were taken for vanadium and ph analyses as described above after that the rest of the solution was removed carefully from the bottle regeneration was performed on the used sorbent material by adding 20 ml of 3 m naoh to the bottle after mixing for a certain period 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 6 h the sorbent was separated by centrifugation and the supernatant was sampled for v analysis the naoh treated sample for characterization was prepared separately as follows washed sorbent was mixed with 3 m naoh for 2 h then the mixture was centrifuged and the regenerant solution discarded the naoh treated sorbent was washed with water several times and then dried at 60 c for approximately 24 h to assess the reuse of sorbents four sorption desorption cycles were carried out sorption was performed with 2 g of iron sorbent dosage of 10 g l and using 200 ml vanadium solution 50 mg l v and a 24 h contact time after sorption the sorbent was separated by centrifugation and the supernatant was sampled for v and ph analyses as described above after that the rest of the solution was removed carefully from the bottle regeneration was performed with 100 ml of 3 m naoh and using a two hour contact time the sorbent was separated by centrifugation and the supernatant was sampled for v analysis after regeneration the sorbent was washed once with 0 01 m hcl and then with water several times washing was continued until the ph was neutralised after the last washing stage water was pipetted carefully from the bottle and the next cycle was started after four cycles the sorbent was dried at 60 for approximately 24 h named after 4 cycles recovery was calculated from the sorption solution and without taking into account the non desorbed vanadium present in the material after the 1st and subsequent cycles reuse of the regenerant solution 3 m naoh was studied with the cfh 12 sorbent only firstly 2 g of sorbent dosage 10 g l was treated with vanadium solution volume 200 ml 50 mg l v contact time 24 h then the sample was centrifuged and a sample was taken for vanadium and ph analyses as described above the rest of the solution was pipetted carefully from the bottle the regeneration was performed with 100 ml 3 m naoh and using a two hour contact time after regeneration the sorbent was separated by centrifugation and a 1 ml sample of spent regenerant solution was taken for vanadium analysis then the rest of the naoh solution was recovered by pipetting and used for the new vanadium treated sorbent sample about 2 3 ml of fresh 3 m naoh was added per cycle so that 100 ml volume was maintained in each regeneration step 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph vanadium v occurs as anionic species when the ph is 3 21 whereas anion sorption onto iron materials is favoured at ph values lower than their phpzc the akaganéite based material had a phpzc of 8 2 22 and reported values for goethite have been mostly above 8 23 previously it has been shown that ph 3 4 was the optimal ph for vanadium sorption on iron sorbent 24 whereas increasing the dosage provides constant removal rates over a wider ph range 1 24 in this study a similar finding was made for both sorbents when the dosage used was 10 g l and the vanadium concentration 50 mg l as the initial ph values of the solutions were between 4 8 vanadium removal rates were 96 99 with cfh 12 and 95 99 with geh 101 table s1 at a higher initial ph of 9 5 vanadium removal rates were slightly lower for geh 101 90 final ph 6 5 thus in this research subsequent sorption experiments were carried out without ph adjustment at about ph 6 first sorption stage 3 2 sorption and desorption kinetics the kinetics of vanadium sorption both onto cfh 12 and geh 101 are shown in fig 1 after 72 h 93 of vanadium was removed with both sorbents dosage 5 g l initial v 50 mg l the initial sorption of vanadium was fast due to the surface reactions then the sorption was followed by slower uptake several authors have reported similar behaviour with the adsorption of different anions on iron materials 1 25 26 slower uptake has been considered to result from slow diffusion into pores 25 and from the decrease in the driving concentration difference between the bulk solution and the surface 26 of the three kinetic models applied pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich table s2 the elovich model was found to provide the best fit to the kinetic data both cfh 12 and geh 101 when considering both the correlation co efficient r2 and the chi squared χ2 value cfh 12 r2 0 9940 and χ2 0 0797 geh 101 r2 0 9944 and χ2 0 0398 the elovich model is known to describe the kinetics of chemisorption well 20 the α value of geh 101 was higher than that of cfh 12 which indicates a higher initial sorption rate of geh 101 the regeneration efficiency of the v treated sorbents revealed that vanadium was desorbed from cfh 12 to a slightly higher extent than from geh 101 fig 2 with a contact time of 3 h or less this might be due to the higher pore volume of geh 101 table 1 as compared to cfh 12 and thus a higher amount of desorption resistant fraction with both materials firstly the recovery of desorbed vanadium increased and reached maximum at three hours while some lower recovery was observed at four and six hours the possible reason for this might be the change in textural properties due to prolonged alkaline conditions especially with cfh 12 this might have resulted in the development of new pores and larger pores that are accessible for vanadium and thus lower recovery was obtained 3 3 vanadium sorption capacity vanadium sorption capacity was measured at an initial ph of 6 and using a contact time of 72 h due to the slow uptake rate shown in fig 1 the maximum vanadium sorption capacity was 34 mg g with cfh 12 and 22 mg g with geh 101 fig 3 which were somewhat higher than the capacity of iron loaded peat 16 mg g 27 and similar or lower than that of feooh 25 20 mg g 24 and fe oh 3 β feooh 107 80 mg g 24 at lower initial concentrations 50 mg l first three data points in fig 3 sorption capacity was the same for both sorbents while at higher concentrations differences in sorption capacity were obvious besides the properties of sorbents the speciation of vanadium which is dependent on both the ph and concentration may affect the adsorbability of vanadium species on sorbents at higher concentrations polynuclear forms of vanadium predominate 21 3 4 sorbent regeneration and reuse in cyclic treatments the aim was to provide a high removal rate of vanadium in the first sorption and a high desorption rate in the first regeneration thus the dosage and contact times were adjusted according to the contact time experiments presented above dosage 10 g l 24 h sorption and 2 h desorption both materials displayed similar performance in the sorption and desorption studies despite their mineralogical difference fig 4 a and b both materials can be reused but the sorption efficiency decreased from 95 97 to about 53 55 after the first sorption and then remained at the same level the lower efficiency probably mostly resulted from incomplete regeneration but also from the higher final ph 7 8 in the 2nd 4th sorption stages naoh desorbed 84 86 of vanadium in the first cycle incomplete regeneration implies that pore diffusion had occurred to some extent once the pores were occupied and more resistant to desorption lower uptakes were obtained in the subsequent sorption stages probably due to the prevalent mechanism being complex formation with surface functional groups the presence of desorption resistant fraction was also detected in the case of the regeneration of ferric hydroxide loaded support materials saturated with arsenate 28 and with phosphate loaded ferric hydroxide 29 on the other hand subsequent desorption stages provided the same or higher recovery of vanadium calculated from the sorbed amount in each cycle the design of the sorption process should thus be based on the regenerated material and taking into account the desorption resistant fraction the reuse of the regenerant was studied only with cfh 12 material reuse was successful for four times only under selected experimental conditions fig s2 after being used four times and reaching a vanadium solution of slightly above 300 mg l the spent regenerant was inefficient in desorbing vanadium for the recovery of vanadium from the spent regenerant solution one option could be precipitation with iron after ph adjustment the formed sludge could be used in ferrovanadium production another option might be precipitation with calcium as calcium vanadate apatite ca10 vo4 6 oh 2 30 which would allow the direct reuse of naoh 3 5 characterization of sorbents after four cycles the materials were recovered and characterized along with fresh washed v treated and naoh treated samples xrd data confirmed that geh 101 contained poorly crystallized akaganéite fig s1a which is consistent with xrd data by kersten et al 22 they showed that 2 line ferrihydrite was present in large quantities in the material 42 4 after treatments the geh 101 showed similar crystallinity in all samples and no obvious line broadening was observed due to the lower amount of chlorine as reported earlier 31 the xrd pattern of the geh 101 sample after four cycles did not show any new peaks associated with vanadium nevertheless a slight decrease in surface area was observed washed geh 101 298 1 m2 g v treated 282 0 m2 g naoh treated 274 0 m2 g after 4 cycles 265 1 2 8 m2 g amorphous cfh 12 contained some goethite and gypsum fig s1b gypsum was removed from cfh 12 by washing the improved crystallinity of cfh 12 after four cycles was obvious and no peaks associated with vanadium were seen the improved crystallinity could also be observed as a lower surface area 202 6 0 6 m2 g in comparison to the washed 241 8 m2 g v treated 235 6 m2 g and naoh treated 255 2 m2 g cfh 12 on the other hand washing increased the surface area and pore volume of cfh 12 material significantly as compared to the fresh cfh 12 the reason for the increase might be the dissolution of contaminants from cfh 12 and or particle degradation during washing particle size and crystallinity have a great effect on the surface area of iron materials in general the lower the particle size and crystallinity the higher the surface area the nitrogen adsorption isotherms showed that the isotherms for both fresh cfh 12 and fresh geh 101 were type iv fig 5a and b according to the iupac classification 32 the shape of the isotherms i e an almost horizontal curve at high relative pressure p p0 indicates that the mesopores 2 50 nm are predominant hysteresis loops observed at mid relative pressures and higher imply that the mechanism of mesopore filling varies from mesopore emptying type h4 hysteresis was observed with cfh 12 although very small for fresh and washed samples which is often associated with narrow slit like pores 33 the steep desorption branch with geh 101 refers to type h2 hysteresis which agrees well with previous research 34 washing the materials did not affect the shape of the isotherms the isotherms of the geh 101 samples remained similar after naoh treatment and cyclic treatment fig 5 a the pore volume and the pore width were not affected in the case of geh 101 however the pore size distribution was slightly broadened by the naoh and cyclic treatments fig 5c in the case of the cfh 12 samples regeneration changed the shape of the nitrogen adsorption isotherms fig 5b the curves were much steeper in addition the sample after four cycles did not have a saturation plateau at high relative pressures which was observed for other samples and is a typical feature of type iv isotherms 32 regeneration significantly increased the pore width fig 5d and the pore volume of cfh 12 0 2542 0 0007 cm3 g after 4 cycles 0 2427 cm3 g naoh treated fig 5d the surfaces of the iron sorbents were uneven having numerous small particles attached to bigger granules fig 6 after alkali treatment the surface seemed to be smoother high magnification images of alkali treated geh 101 fig 6e and f revealed areas with nanorod morphology as has been shown for akaganéite samples 35 the xps survey spectra of fresh and washed geh 101 samples confirmed the presence of o fe c cl and f the c 1s was composed of adventitious carbon contamination co2 and hydrocarbons cl 2p3 2 peak existed at 198 3 198 4 ev and the cl 2p peak contained chlorine ions stabilizing the akaganéite structure in addition fluorine which was present in a small amount may be accommodated in the akaganéite tunnels 11 washing decreased some of the chlorine ions probably the ions existing on the external surfaces chlorine content decreased on the surface of geh 101 even more due to regeneration as compared to the fresh and washed samples samples after four cycles still showed a small cl 2p peak on the survey spectrum although the naoh treated sample did not however chlorine most likely existed deeper in the naoh treated geh 101 since xrd confirmed akaganéite in the material due to the small size of the hollandite tunnels the chlorine content cannot be decreased below 2 wt total content without disrupting the structure 31 on the other hand cai et al 36 reported that hydroxide ions also have the ability to hold akaganéite tunnels although not as strongly as chlorine or fluorine the surface of fresh and washed cfh 12 samples contained o fe c and s according to xps also minor amounts of mg ca k and f were detected in the fresh sample and f was detected in the washed sample the c 1s was composed of adventitious carbon contamination washing also decreased the amount of sulphur which originated from the gypsum impurity leaching of impurities from cfh 12 had also been confirmed earlier in a pilot study 1 with the cfh 12 sample from the same batch the o 1s spectra of fresh materials and samples after four cycles were similar to those with the washed and naoh treated samples respectively thus their spectra are not shown in fig 7 the o 1s spectrum of geh 101 showed two components fig 7a which can mainly be assigned to the oxygen binding with fe feo 529 7 529 8 ev and hydroxyl binding with fe feoh 531 1 531 2 ev surface contamination due to co bonds can be found around 532 ev 37 whereas adsorbed water has been reported to exist at around 533 4 ev 3 the feo feoh ratio was about 1 02 based on the peak area for pure akaganéite the ratio should be 1 0 3 the o 1s spectra of cfh 12 also showed two components fig 7b which are mainly related to o 1s oxide 530 1 530 2 ev and o 1s hydroxide 531 6 531 7 ev 38 with goethite these components should have approximately equal intensity 39 as with the geh 101 sample the cfh 12 sample also showed some carbon contamination and adsorbed water could not be excluded the regeneration decreased the proportion of the o 1s hydroxide component for both iron sorbents fig 7 which was also confirmed with cfh 12 in a previous study 9 regeneration also shifted the o 1s peak to a lower be by about 0 2 ev with geh 101 and about 0 7 ev with cfh 12 the o 1s spectra of v treated samples showed that the surface hydroxyl component decreased significantly after vanadium sorption the results further confirmed the reaction between surface hydroxyl groups and vanadate anions the peak related to the vo bonds is known to exist at 530 ev 37 and thus these bonds were included in the component at the lower be side which is mainly attributed to feo bonds fe 2p3 2 peaks of fresh and washed geh 101 existed at binding energies of around 711 0 711 2 ev data not shown which is consistent with values reported for akaganéite 3 fresh and washed cfh 12 had an fe 2p3 2 peak at around 711 6 ev data not shown goethite has an fe 2p3 2 peak of around 711 ev 40 41 regeneration also shifted the fe 2p spectra in the case of geh 101 the shift was only observed for naoh treated samples and was clearly at a higher be about 0 7 ev in the case of cfh 12 both the naoh treated cfh 12 and cfh 12 samples after four cycles showed a shift to a lower be by 0 7 ev the v 2p xps spectrum confirmed the presence of vanadium on the surface of v treated geh 101 and cfh 12 samples whereas negligible amounts were observed after four cycles data not shown a similar result was obtained earlier for cfh 12 9 and it was concluded that the main desorption mechanism was the reverse reaction of surface complex formation the v 2p3 2 peak was found at 517 1 ev full width at half maximum fwhm 1 2 ev with geh 101 and at 517 5 ev fwhm 1 2 ev with cfh 12 which relates to the v5 state 37 4 conclusions the results of this study support the idea of regeneration but also confirm that some changes in iron sorbents can be assumed to occur due to alkali treatment the poorly crystallized akaganéite geh 101 was more stable towards alkali treatment the most obvious changes were some wider pore size distribution and partial removal of chlorine nonetheless xrd did not reveal any decomposition of the akaganéite structure due to a lower amount of chlorine line positions remained similar ferric oxyhydroxide with some goethite cfh 12 showed more changes in chemical and physical properties after alkali treatment its pore volume and pore width increased significantly moreover the xrd pattern showed more crystallized goethite these results suggest that akaganéite based material is a better choice for pore size sensitive applications for example if adsorption desorption or selectivity is affected very much by the pore size despite their mineralogical difference both sorbents displayed similar performance in vanadium sorption and desorption studies vanadium was desorbed efficiently from the surface the desorption resistant fraction being located in the pores lower sorption efficiency due to incomplete regeneration in subsequent cycles needs to be taken into account in the design of the water treatment process although this study focused on vanadium removal and recovery these materials are also being used in many other applications and for different contaminants regeneration and reuse of iron materials in water and wastewater treatment could decrease the costs of the treatment and amount of waste disposal in landfills and also support the

14332,ammonia was removed from the anaerobic digestion effluent of slaughterhouse wastewater by a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium under laboratory and ambient conditions the highest ammonia removal of 80 4 with the lowest volatilization of 0 6 was achieved in the laboratory under half day illuminated conditions at 140 μmol photons m 2 s 1 because a diel cycle could mitigate the light inhibition on nitrification and ph increase by photosynthesis nitrification was partially and completely inhibited by continuous illumination and sun light decreasing ammonia removal to 73 3 and 47 8 respectively although the applied light intensities in this study were similar to or lower than those in previous studies stronger nitrification inhibition was observed prolonged light exposure and or high light intensity with excess free ammonia up to 59 4 mg l 1 probably inhibited nitrification thus light mitigation strategies such as using granular sludge will be effective when applying the consortium process under ambient conditions keywords consortium photo oxygenation wastewater light inhibition free ammonia 1 introduction anaerobic digestion is among the most efficient treatment technologies for organic wastes and wastewaters the advantages of anaerobic digestion include the degradation and stabilization of organic pollutants with low energy consumption and simultaneous energy recovery 1 familiarizing the public with this technology directly contributes to the realization of part of the sustainable development goals sdgs such as clean waste and sanitation and sustainable cities and communities adopted by the united nations general assembly in 2015 2 in an anaerobic digester nitrogen compounds which are mainly present as ammonia are not completely removed due to the lack of sufficient autotrophic microorganisms that can metabolize inorganic nitrogen 3 anaerobic digestion effluent ade which has a high concentration of ammonia is often reused in agricultural fields as a liquid fertilizer 4 however the effluent cannot be used in urban areas owing to its low demand 5 in such a case biological nitrification denitrification processes are widely applied as post treatment methods to remove ammonia from the ade before discharging the effluent into the aquatic environment nevertheless the post treatment requires high aeration energy for nitrification as well as additional organic carbon such as methanol for denitrification 6 aeration is an energy intensive and costly process that may account for more than half of the energy consumption by a wastewater treatment plant 7 a more energetically efficient and cost effective technology for treating ade should be developed a microalgal bacterial consortium has a potential to remove ammonia from ade effectively previous studies have confirmed that microalgae can produce oxygen that bacteria require to remove biodegradable pollutants in a consortium reactor 8 9 another study on microalgal bacterial consortia found that complete nitrification without the accumulation of intermediate compounds was successfully achieved through using oxygen derived from photo oxygenation by microalgae 10 combining microalgae growth with nitrification has other advantages when treating high ammonia wastewater the toxic inhibitory effects of the high free ammonia fa nh3 concentration on microalgae growth and odor due to nh3 volatilization can be prevented by the decrease in ph caused by nitrification 11 12 intensive studies on combining microalgae and nitrifiers in a single reactor have been conducted recently vergas et al 13 studied a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium in a continuous stirred tank reactor with limited aeration using a synthetic culture medium they reported high ammonia removal percentages above 98 even at low levels of dissolved oxygen karya et al 10 evaluated the photo oxygenation capability of microalgae to support nitrification in an algal bacterial consortium in a cylindrical glass jacketed reactor inoculated with nitrifiers and scenedesmus quadricauda they demonstrated that the system could completely nitrify synthetic wastewater without aeration achieving a maximum nitrification rate of 7 7 mg nh4 n l 1 h 1 rada ariza et al 14 operated two flat panel reactors one inoculated with nitrifiers and microalgae and the other only inoculated with microalgae they reported an ammonia removal capability of the microalgal bacterial reactor of 100 18 mg nh4 n l 1 d 1 which is over double the capability of the microalgal reactor despite the relevance of using a microalgal nitrifying consortium as an alternative technology to treat ammonia containing wastewater few studies have assessed the ammonia removal performance using real wastewater such as ade under ambient conditions during which temperature and light intensity would fluctuate greatly gonzález camejo et al 15 evaluated the effect of light intensity and temperature on nitrogen and phosphorus removal from the effluent of an anaerobic membrane bioreactor their study indicated that light intensity and temperature are key parameters in controlling the microalgal nitrifying bacterial competition but the applied light conditions 40 125 μmol photons m 2 s 1 are below the natural light intensity which often exceeds 1 000 2 000 μmol photons m 2 s 1 16 17 the impact of natural fluctuation in temperature and light intensity on real wastewater treatment which is an important consideration for better understanding the microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium must be studied in this study for the first time the ammonia removal performance of a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium for the treatment of ade was evaluated under both laboratory controlled and ambient conditions previous literature indicated that the prolonged light conditions of the laboratory could effectively remove nutrients along with support high microalgal biomass production 18 thus in addition to half day illuminated conditions light dark 12 h 12 h continuously illuminated conditions light dark 24 h 0 h were also applied in the laboratory experiment 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculums the ade was collected from the full scale anaerobic digester for slaughterhouse wastewater treatment in leon guanajuato state mexico the effluent was

480 410 and 0 respectively approximately 1 0 l of the filtered effluent was diluted four times using 3 0 l of freshly deionized water agua desionizada karal and the diluted effluent was used as a substrate to prevent nh4 inhibition of microalgae the microalgae consortium consisted of chlorella sp scenedesmus sp and diatoms which were used owing to their ability to grow in wastewater 19 they

city guanajuato state mexico the cultivated microalgae were harvested using a centrifugal separator at 3000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature centrificient crm globe while the nitrifying sludge was left to settle for a few hours to remove the supernatant the concentrated microalgae and sludge were used as inoculums 2 2 experimental set up batch experiments were conducted using conical flasks with an effective volume of 0 5 l under laboratory controlled or ambient conditions to evaluate the ammonia removal capability of the microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium table 1 under all conditions the diluted ade of slaughterhouse wastewater was added to each reactor leading to an initial nh4 concentration of 102 mg n l 1 as a form of ionized ammonia nitrogen microalgae and nitrifying bacteria were inoculated into the reactors to achieve initial suspended solid ss concentrations of 0 5 g l 1 of each biomass under laboratory conditions light was provided by fluorescent

conventional nitrification process denoted as n lab the dark condition was maintained by sealing with aluminum foil in order to avoid exposure to light according to stapleton and dodder 20 in n lab the aeration rate was approximately 1 0 l min 1 during the experimental period and the initial ss concentration was 0 5 g l 1 under ambient conditions the reactors were located outside of the engineering laboratory in the university of guanajuato and exposed to natural sunlight in august 2016 denoted as mn amb amb ambient conditions ambient light intensities were measured twice every day at day time 10 a m to noon and night time 10 pm to midnight the reactors were incubated at 25 2 c under laboratory conditions while the reactors were incubated at 18 29 c under ambient conditions the reactors in the laboratory were agitated continuously by a shaker ago 60 90 prendo and those under ambient conditions were agitated continuously by magnetic stirrers for both laboratory and ambient

environmental conditions the environmental conditions including ph do light intensity and temperature for all conditions are presented in fig 2 relatively high ph values above 8 5 were observed in the consortium reactors under laboratory controlled conditions with continuous illumination mn lab 24 0 and ambient conditions mn amb fig 2a meanwhile the ph values decreased gradually under the half day illuminated conditions mn lab 12 12 with experimental time in the microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium the ph of the culture medium is changed by the progress of photosynthesis and or nitrification the value increases due to inorganic carbon consumption and the release of basic bioreaction metabolites by microalgae 26 while it decreases due to ammonia oxidation by nitrifying bacteria the higher ph values observed in mn lab 24 0 and the mn amb were due to active photosynthesis caused by continuous illumination and natural sunlight with high light intensity reaching 1573 μmol photons m 2 s 1 fig 2c fig s1 showed the variation of representative one day light intensities measured in august 2017 at the same place as the mn amb experiment although the ambient light intensities were not measured frequently in this study the obtained range 0 1573 μmol photons m 2 s 1 was probably not far from the actual values in mn lab 12 12 the ph decrease due to ammonia oxidization exceeded the ph increase by photosynthesis resulting in lower ph values under nitrification conditions n lab the ph value increased from 7 7 8 5 during the first day and then decreased gradually to 6 5 7 0 indicating the progression of nitrification changes in the do values of all reactors are presented in fig 2b under laboratory controlled conditions the do of all reactors increased during the first few days and then maintained relatively stable values ranging from 4 11 to 6 43 mg l 1 until the end of the experiment under ambient conditions the do values varied widely ranging from 1 5 16 3 mg l 1 the oxygen oversaturation occurred under the mn amb condition possibly due to active photosynthesis in the outdoor culture 27 previous studies reported that nitrifiers require do concentrations of approximately 1 0 2 0 mg l 1 to completely oxidize ammonia to nitrate 28 29 a sufficient oxygen supply to conduct nitrification was confirmed in all consortium mn conditions exhibiting a comparable capability to mechanical aeration although the do level indicated algal photosynthesis excessive do levels that are much greater than the air saturation values would inhibit photosynthesis 30 a previous study reported that a do concentration above 35 mg l 1 could severely inhibit microalgal growth 31 the highest do value observed in the experiments under ambient conditions mn amb was lower than the inhibitive value thus do values were maintained within an appropriate range for both nitrifiers and microalgae in this study the temperature under ambient conditions varied from 19 to 29 c fig 2d the appropriate temperature range for microalgae growth varies depending on the species for instance james et al 32 demonstrated that the growth rates of chlorella sp were highest at temperatures between 25 and 30 c martínez et al 33 observed the greatest specific growth rate of scenedesmus obliquus at 30 c meanwhile many types of freshwater microalgae including chlorella sp senedesmum sp and diatoms failed to grow persistently above 30 c 32 34 the temperatures observed under ambient condition were likely within an appropriate range for the growth of the microalgae used in this study 3 2 process performance the variations of nitrogenous ions comprising nh4 and nitrous oxides no3 and no2 for all conditions are presented in fig 3 in all microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium reactors the added ammonia decreased rapidly during the first few days confirming the progress of nh4 removal by nitrification and or uptake by microalgae in the consortium reactors the amount of produced nitrous oxides varied depending on the conditions high no3 production was achieved in mn lab 12 12 partial nitrous oxide production was observed in mn lab 24 0 and few nitrous oxides were observed in mn amb this difference could be caused by the inhibition of high free ammonia fa concentration on the nitrification process it has been reported that a high fa concentration severely inhibits the activity of nitrifying bacteria including both ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 22 35 the variations in fa for all operating conditions of the reactors are shown in fig 4 in mn 12 12 the fa concentration decreased rapidly within the first two days and remained below the detection limit thereafter relatively high fa concentrations were observed under the other consortium conditions due to the higher ph or temperature values fig 2a and d anthonisen et al 22 stated that fa concentrations above 10 mg l 1 are sufficiently high to inhibit nob activity other studies have reported inhibition of nob activity at fa values of approximately 20 mg l 1 36 despite the higher tolerance of aob to fa an excessively high fa level above 150 mg l 1 inhibits them 22 in mn 24 0 the fa values may exceed the inhibitive values on the nob 10 mg l 1 after two days in mn amb relatively high fa values ranging from 13 7 59 4 mg l 1 were confirmed which inhibited nob however the observed fa values did not exceed the critical range required to deteriorate the whole nitrification process thus the nitrification inhibition observed in mn lab 24 0 and mn amb was not only due to fa previous studies have reported that ammonia oxidizers are sensitive to light exposure especially under high light intensity for instance merbt et al 37 demonstrated that the specific growth rate of aquatic aob nitrosomonas europaea and nitrosopira multiformis was inhibited by continuous illumination at a light intensity of 500 μmol photons m 2 s 1 guerrero and jones 38 demonstrated that the activity of nitrifying bacteria aob and nob in axenic cultures was inhibited severely after two hours of sunlight exposure with a light intensity of 1900 μmol photons m 2 s 1 these observations indicate that the continuous illumination or the exposure to sunlight under the mn lab 24 0 and mn amb conditions were additional factors inhibiting nitrification although the same light intensity of 140 μmol photons m 2 s 1 was applied to mn lab 12 12 a high nitrate production of 79 1 mg n l 1 was achieved at the end of the experiment previous literature reported the recovery of ammonia oxidizers from photodamage in dark incubation 39 therefore the successful nitrification obtained in mn lab 12 12 may have been due to the diel cycle although nitrification was partially or completely inhibited in mn lab 24 0 and mn amb a significant amount of the added nh4 was removed indicating nutrient uptake by microalgae and or heterotrophic bacteria at the end of the experiment the final nh4 concentrations were 20 0 27 1 53 1 and 0 0 mg n l 1 in mn lab 12 12 mn lab 24 0 mn amb and n lab respectively in the consortium reactors relatively low final nh4 concentrations were observed under the laboratory conditions in which both microalgae and nitrification activities were observed compared to ambient conditions in which only microalgal activity was observed this indicates that the nh4 removal capability may be enhanced by the co cultivation of microalgae with bacteria which is consistent with the results of previous studies for instance de bashan et al 40 reported that the nh4 removal efficiency improved significantly when employing a consortium of chlorella vulgaris and azospirillum brasilense a nitrogen fixing bacteria compared to microalgae alone liang et al 41 also reported that the nh4 removal efficiency of a combined c vulgaris and bacillus licheniformis system was 2 7 times higher than that of the single microalgal system a recent study on a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium reported that a consortia of microalgae scenedesmus quadricauda anabena variabilis chlorella sp chlorococcus sp and spirulina sp and nitrifying bacteria collected from a wastewater treatment plant exhibited higher nh4 removal rates 100 mg n l 1 d 1 than microalgae 44 mg n l 1 d 1 using flat panel reactors 14 as a result the progress of nitrification is a key factor for the efficient removal of nh4 by a microalgal nitrifying consortium system the remaining nh4 in the consortium reactors at the end of the experiment indicated that nitrification and or microalgae growth ceased during the later days of the experiment a possible reason is the limitation of substrate and or diffusion of do previous studies reported that the mass transfer limitation due to diffusion was observed in activated sludge flocs 42 aerobic granule 43 and nitrifying biofilm 44 in their studies the mass transfer limitation occurred in the case of using flocs with a diameter larger than 100 200 μm 42 granules with a size lager than 500 μm 43 and biofilms with a thickness of 50 150 μm 44 meanwhile dispersed microalgae and nitrifiers were inoculated at the beginning of this study and none of the flocs granules and biofilm were observed during the experimental period thus the diffusion process of substrate and or dissolved oxygen to the nitrifies was unlikely to be a limiting factor as the ph of the culture medium has an important role in the growth of both microalgae and nitrifying bacteria variations in ph during the experiment may have been a reason for this result liang et al 41 evaluated the effect of ph on nutrient removal by a combined microalgae bacteria system of chlorella vulgaris and bacillus licheniformis they reported higher nh4 and tp removal efficiencies when the ph was regulated to neutral conditions than those when ph was not controlled and decreased from 7 to 3 5 with experimental time in a previous study on microalgae chlorella vulgaris cultivation the best growth was observed at ph levels of 6 and 7 45 a similar result was also presented by ghosh et al 46 who observed effective chlorella sp growth at ph 7 a favorable ph for the activity of nitrifying bacteria was 7 9 47 in the consortium reactors the ph values during the final half days of the experiment gradually exceeded mn lab 24 0 and mn amb or fell below mn 12 12 the appropriate range for the activities of freshwater microalgae and nitrifying bacteria fig 1a which limited nh4 removal the nh4 removal efficiency could be enhanced through optimizing the microalgae bacteria ratio 48 or photoperiod 18 under the n lab condition a more rapid decrease in nh4 was observed than that of the consortium reactors although most of the added nh4 was removed under the n lab conditions the produced no3 at the end of the experiment was lower than the amount of nh4 removed the loss of nh4 could be due to nitrogen assimilation 49 denitrification 50 and or ammonia volatilization 51 the amount of nh4 assimilated into nitrifiers calculated by the eq 8 was below 1 of the added nh4 besides nitrification nitrogen losses because of denitrification have been reported 50 nevertheless do has a negative effect on denitrification even at concentrations less than 0 1 mg l 1 52 conversely a do concentration higher than 0 5 mg l 1 is known to inhibit denitrification 53 a constant do concentration around 5 0 mg l 1 was observed in the n lab and therefore denitrification probably did not occur one of the main reasons for the loss could be ammonia volatilization it has been reported that direct aeration via forcing air through a reactor often releases volatile ammonia into the air especially at an alkaline ph 54 under the n lab conditions an alkaline ph of up to 8 5 was observed during the first two days of the experiment indicating the progress of volatilization the other possible reason is ammonia uptake by heterotrophic bacteria in the presence of dissolve organic carbon a previous study reported that the dissolved cod to nitrogen cod n ratio above 3 0 enhanced heterotrophic bacterial growth instead of nitrifiers 55 the applied cod n ratio was 4 8 in this study possibly resulting in ammonia consumption by heterotrophic bacteria meanwhile other literatures showed an evidence that heterotrophic bacteria grew less vigorously in the presence of microalgae such as chlorella vulgaris and chlorella pyrenoidosa 56 57 in addition heterotrophic bacterial colony formation decreased clearly at an acidic ph below 5 0 and at an alkaline ph of 9 0 compared to a neutral ph of 7 0 57 these observations implied that the growth of heterotrophic bacteria mainly occurred in the n lab in which only nitrifying bacteria was inoculated and neutral ph was maintained after three days of the experiment fig 2a 3 3 nitrogen mass balance the nitrogen mass balance at the end of the experiment was calculated and is shown in fig 5 which represents the remaining nh4 the produced nox volatilized ammonia ammonia assimilated by nitrifying bacteria and ammonia taken up by microalgae and or heterotrophic bacteria the nh4 removal efficiency and its pathway varied depending on the conditions in the consortium reactors higher ammonia removal efficiencies of 80 4 and 73 3 were achieved under laboratory conditions mn 12 12 and mn 24 0 than those under ambient conditions which achieved a removal efficiency of 47 8 nh4 removal mainly occurred via nitrification in mn lab 12 12 both uptake by microalgae and nitrification in mn lab 24 0 and uptake by microalgae only in mn amb some ammonia volatilization was observed in mn lab 24 0 and mn amb due to the high ph and fa values meanwhile very little ammonia volatilization was observed in mn lab 12 12 due to the low ph caused by the progress of nitrification previously reported work mentioned that the transformation of volatilized to non volatile nitrogen species through biological treatment such as nitrification and denitrification is a major ammonia emission mitigation technique 58 thus the successful nitrification with photo oxygenation by microalgae in this study led to ammonia emission abatement as well as effective nh4 removal 3 4 the effect of physicochemical parameters on nitrification performance under light exposure studies concerning nitrification process under light exposure including this study are summarized in table 2 high ammonia removal efficiencies above ca 80 and nitrification performances i e the percentage of the amount of added ammonia oxidized to nox above ca 80 were achieved in all previous studies on microalgal nitrifying bacteria consortia 10 59 60 and mn lab 12 12 in this study the comparable results obtained from mn lab 12 12 to those in previous results indicate that a real wastewater such as ade can be treated sufficiently by a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium under laboratory controlled conditions relatively low ammonia removal efficiencies 47 8 73 3 and nitrification performances 0 0 35 1 were observed under the other mn conditions vergara et al 60 applied strong light intensities reaching 1250 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to evaluate the influence of light intensity on nitrification process they reported that the specific total ammonium nitrogen removal rates of nitrifying bacteria decreased to 20 60 under continuous illumination at 500 and 1250 μmol photons m 2 s 1 however the total ammonia removal and nitrification efficiencies at the end of the experiment did not decrease remarkably this result was not coincident with the observations for mn lab 24 0 and mn amb which exhibited significant decreases in the ammonia removal and or nitrification efficiencies at similar or lower light intensities than those in vergara et al 60 as described in 3 3 the combination of light inhibition with other inhibitive factors i e excess ph and fa values may have deteriorated nitrification although ph control is considered as an effective strategy to avoid multiple inhibitions on nitrification the chemicals used are often unacceptable owing to their high cost in actual treatment plants one possible solution is the direct mitigation of light inhibition using a shading net furthermore the use of nitrifying granules 61 and or immobilized materials for nitrifying bacteria 62 is an effective method to mitigate the influence of light because aggregated microorganisms can prevent direct exposure to solar irradiance further research using this type of application is required to optimize the ammonia removal and nitrification performances of a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium under ambient conditions 4 conclusion ammonia was removed from the ade of slaughterhouse wastewater without aeration using a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium under laboratory and ambient conditions a successful ammonia removal efficiency of 80 4 was achieved through nitrification under half day illuminated conditions in the laboratory demonstrating the capability of ade treatment by a consortium nitrification inhibition with lower ammonia removal efficiencies than those of previous studies was observed under the continuously illuminated and ambient conditions a combination of light exposure reaching at least 1573 mol photons m 2 s 1 with high fa values ranging from 3 3 59 4 mg l 1 may have caused severe inhibition of nitrification by the microalgal bacterial consortium acknowledgements we appreciate the financial support provided by the

14332,ammonia was removed from the anaerobic digestion effluent of slaughterhouse wastewater by a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium under laboratory and ambient conditions the highest ammonia removal of 80 4 with the lowest volatilization of 0 6 was achieved in the laboratory under half day illuminated conditions at 140 μmol photons m 2 s 1 because a diel cycle could mitigate the light inhibition on nitrification and ph increase by photosynthesis nitrification was partially and completely inhibited by continuous illumination and sun light decreasing ammonia removal to 73 3 and 47 8 respectively although the applied light intensities in this study were similar to or lower than those in previous studies stronger nitrification inhibition was observed prolonged light exposure and or high light intensity with excess free ammonia up to 59 4 mg l 1 probably inhibited nitrification thus light mitigation strategies such as using granular sludge will be effective when applying the consortium process under ambient conditions keywords consortium photo oxygenation wastewater light inhibition free ammonia 1 introduction anaerobic digestion is among the most efficient treatment technologies for organic wastes and wastewaters the advantages of anaerobic digestion include the degradation and stabilization of organic pollutants with low energy consumption and simultaneous energy recovery 1 familiarizing the public with this technology directly contributes to the realization of part of the sustainable development goals sdgs such as clean waste and sanitation and sustainable cities and communities adopted by the united nations general assembly in 2015 2 in an anaerobic digester nitrogen compounds which are mainly present as ammonia are not completely removed due to the lack of sufficient autotrophic microorganisms that can metabolize inorganic nitrogen 3 anaerobic digestion effluent ade which has a high concentration of ammonia is often reused in agricultural fields as a liquid fertilizer 4 however the effluent cannot be used in urban areas owing to its low demand 5 in such a case biological nitrification denitrification processes are widely applied as post treatment methods to remove ammonia from the ade before discharging the effluent into the aquatic environment nevertheless the post treatment requires high aeration energy for nitrification as well as additional organic carbon such as methanol for denitrification 6 aeration is an energy intensive and costly process that may account for more than half of the energy consumption by a wastewater treatment plant 7 a more energetically efficient and cost effective technology for treating ade should be developed a microalgal bacterial consortium has a potential to remove ammonia from ade effectively previous studies have confirmed that microalgae can produce oxygen that bacteria require to remove biodegradable pollutants in a consortium reactor 8 9 another study on microalgal bacterial consortia found that complete nitrification without the accumulation of intermediate compounds was successfully achieved through using oxygen derived from photo oxygenation by microalgae 10 combining microalgae growth with nitrification has other advantages when treating high ammonia wastewater the toxic inhibitory effects of the high free ammonia fa nh3 concentration on microalgae growth and odor due to nh3 volatilization can be prevented by the decrease in ph caused by nitrification 11 12 intensive studies on combining microalgae and nitrifiers in a single reactor have been conducted recently vergas et al 13 studied a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium in a continuous stirred tank reactor with limited aeration using a synthetic culture medium they reported high ammonia removal percentages above 98 even at low levels of dissolved oxygen karya et al 10 evaluated the photo oxygenation capability of microalgae to support nitrification in an algal bacterial consortium in a cylindrical glass jacketed reactor inoculated with nitrifiers and scenedesmus quadricauda they demonstrated that the system could completely nitrify synthetic wastewater without aeration achieving a maximum nitrification rate of 7 7 mg nh4 n l 1 h 1 rada ariza et al 14 operated two flat panel reactors one inoculated with nitrifiers and microalgae and the other only inoculated with microalgae they reported an ammonia removal capability of the microalgal bacterial reactor of 100 18 mg nh4 n l 1 d 1 which is over double the capability of the microalgal reactor despite the relevance of using a microalgal nitrifying consortium as an alternative technology to treat ammonia containing wastewater few studies have assessed the ammonia removal performance using real wastewater such as ade under ambient conditions during which temperature and light intensity would fluctuate greatly gonzález camejo et al 15 evaluated the effect of light intensity and temperature on nitrogen and phosphorus removal from the effluent of an anaerobic membrane bioreactor their study indicated that light intensity and temperature are key parameters in controlling the microalgal nitrifying bacterial competition but the applied light conditions 40 125 μmol photons m 2 s 1 are below the natural light intensity which often exceeds 1 000 2 000 μmol photons m 2 s 1 16 17 the impact of natural fluctuation in temperature and light intensity on real wastewater treatment which is an important consideration for better understanding the microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium must be studied in this study for the first time the ammonia removal performance of a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium for the treatment of ade was evaluated under both laboratory controlled and ambient conditions previous literature indicated that the prolonged light conditions of the laboratory could effectively remove nutrients along with support high microalgal biomass production 18 thus in addition to half day illuminated conditions light dark 12 h 12 h continuously illuminated conditions light dark 24 h 0 h were also applied in the laboratory experiment 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculums the ade was collected from the full scale anaerobic digester for slaughterhouse wastewater treatment in leon guanajuato state mexico the effluent was filtrated through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter and stored in the refrigerator at 4 c until use the ph chemical oxygen demand cod mg l 1 nh4 mg n l 1 and nox mg n l 1 of the filtrated effluent were 7 8 480 410 and 0 respectively approximately 1 0 l of the filtered effluent was diluted four times using 3 0 l of freshly deionized water agua desionizada karal and the diluted effluent was used as a substrate to prevent nh4 inhibition of microalgae the microalgae consortium consisted of chlorella sp scenedesmus sp and diatoms which were used owing to their ability to grow in wastewater 19 they

city guanajuato state mexico the cultivated microalgae were harvested using a centrifugal separator at 3000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature centrificient crm globe while the nitrifying sludge was left to settle for a few hours to remove the supernatant the concentrated microalgae and sludge were used as inoculums 2 2 experimental set up batch experiments were conducted using conical flasks with an effective volume of 0 5 l under laboratory controlled or ambient conditions to evaluate the ammonia removal capability of the microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium table 1 under all conditions the diluted ade of slaughterhouse wastewater was added to each reactor leading to an initial nh4 concentration of 102 mg n l 1 as a form of ionized ammonia nitrogen microalgae and nitrifying bacteria were inoculated into the reactors to achieve initial suspended solid ss concentrations of 0 5 g l 1 of each biomass under laboratory conditions light was provided by fluorescent

conventional nitrification process denoted as n lab the dark condition was maintained by sealing with aluminum foil in order to avoid exposure to light according to stapleton and dodder 20 in n lab the aeration rate was approximately 1 0 l min 1 during the experimental period and the initial ss concentration was 0 5 g l 1 under ambient conditions the reactors were located outside of the

at day time 10 a m to noon and night time 10 pm to midnight the reactors were incubated at 25 2 c under laboratory conditions while the reactors were incubated at 18 29 c under ambient conditions the reactors in the laboratory were agitated continuously by a shaker ago 60 90 prendo and those under ambient conditions were agitated continuously by magnetic stirrers for both laboratory and ambient

environmental conditions the environmental conditions including ph do light intensity and temperature for all conditions are presented in fig 2 relatively high ph values above 8 5 were observed in the consortium reactors under laboratory controlled conditions with continuous illumination mn lab 24 0 and ambient conditions mn amb fig 2a meanwhile the ph values decreased gradually under the half day illuminated conditions mn lab 12 12 with experimental time in the microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium the ph of the culture medium is changed by the progress of photosynthesis and or nitrification the value increases due to inorganic carbon consumption and the release of basic bioreaction metabolites by microalgae 26 while it decreases due to ammonia oxidation by nitrifying bacteria the higher ph values observed in mn lab 24 0 and the mn amb were due to active photosynthesis caused by continuous illumination and natural sunlight with high light intensity reaching 1573 μmol photons m 2 s 1 fig 2c fig s1 showed the variation of representative one day light intensities measured in august 2017 at the same place as the mn amb experiment although the ambient light intensities were not measured frequently in this study the obtained range 0 1573 μmol photons m 2 s 1 was probably not far from the actual values in mn lab 12 12 the ph decrease due to ammonia oxidization exceeded the ph increase by photosynthesis resulting in lower ph values under nitrification conditions n lab the ph value increased from 7 7 8 5 during the first day and then decreased gradually to 6 5 7 0 indicating the progression of nitrification changes in the do values of all reactors are presented in fig 2b under laboratory controlled conditions the do of all reactors increased during the first few days and then maintained relatively stable values ranging from 4 11 to 6 43 mg l 1 until the end of the experiment under ambient conditions the do values varied widely ranging from 1 5 16 3 mg l 1 the oxygen oversaturation occurred under the mn amb condition possibly due to active photosynthesis in the outdoor culture 27 previous studies reported that nitrifiers require do concentrations of approximately 1 0 2 0 mg l 1 to completely oxidize ammonia to nitrate 28 29 a sufficient oxygen supply to conduct nitrification was confirmed in all consortium mn conditions exhibiting a comparable capability to mechanical aeration although the do level indicated algal photosynthesis excessive do levels that are much greater than the air saturation values would inhibit photosynthesis 30 a previous study reported that a do concentration above 35 mg l 1 could severely inhibit microalgal growth 31 the highest do value observed in the experiments under ambient conditions mn amb was lower than the inhibitive value thus do values were maintained within an appropriate range for both nitrifiers and microalgae in this study the temperature under ambient conditions varied from 19 to 29 c fig 2d the appropriate temperature range for microalgae growth varies depending on the species for instance james et al 32 demonstrated that the growth rates of chlorella sp were highest at temperatures between 25 and 30 c martínez et al 33 observed the greatest specific growth rate of scenedesmus obliquus at 30 c meanwhile many types of freshwater microalgae including chlorella sp senedesmum sp and diatoms failed to grow persistently above 30 c 32 34 the temperatures observed under ambient condition were likely within an appropriate range for the growth of the microalgae used in this study 3 2 process performance the variations of nitrogenous ions comprising nh4 and nitrous oxides no3 and no2 for all conditions are presented in fig 3 in all microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium reactors the added ammonia decreased rapidly during the first few days confirming the progress of nh4 removal by nitrification and or uptake by microalgae in the consortium reactors the amount of produced nitrous oxides varied depending on the conditions high no3 production was achieved in mn lab 12 12 partial nitrous oxide production was observed in mn lab 24 0 and few nitrous oxides were observed in mn amb this difference could be caused by the inhibition of high free ammonia fa concentration on the nitrification process it has been reported that a high fa concentration severely inhibits the activity of nitrifying bacteria including both ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 22 35 the variations in fa for all operating conditions of the reactors are shown in fig 4 in mn 12 12 the fa concentration decreased rapidly within the first two days and remained below the detection limit thereafter relatively high fa concentrations were observed under the other consortium conditions due to the higher ph or temperature values fig 2a and d anthonisen et al 22 stated that fa concentrations above 10 mg l 1 are sufficiently high to inhibit nob activity other studies have reported inhibition of nob activity at fa values of approximately 20 mg l 1 36 despite the higher tolerance of aob to fa an excessively high fa level above 150 mg l 1 inhibits them 22 in mn 24 0 the fa values may exceed the inhibitive values on the nob 10 mg l 1 after two days in mn amb relatively high fa values ranging from 13 7 59 4 mg l 1 were confirmed which inhibited nob however the observed fa values did not exceed the critical range required to deteriorate the whole nitrification process thus the nitrification inhibition observed in mn lab 24 0 and mn amb was not only due to fa previous studies have reported that ammonia oxidizers are sensitive to light exposure especially under high light intensity for instance merbt et al 37 demonstrated that the specific growth rate of aquatic aob nitrosomonas europaea and nitrosopira multiformis was inhibited by continuous illumination at a light intensity of 500 μmol photons m 2 s 1 guerrero and jones 38 demonstrated that the activity of nitrifying bacteria aob and nob in axenic cultures was inhibited severely after two hours of sunlight exposure with a light intensity of 1900 μmol photons m 2 s 1 these observations indicate that the continuous illumination or the exposure to sunlight under the mn lab 24 0 and mn amb conditions were additional factors inhibiting nitrification although the same light intensity of 140 μmol photons m 2 s 1 was applied to mn lab 12 12 a high nitrate production of 79 1 mg n l 1 was achieved at the end of the experiment previous literature reported the recovery of ammonia oxidizers from photodamage in dark incubation 39 therefore the successful nitrification obtained in mn lab 12 12 may have been due to the diel cycle although nitrification was partially or completely inhibited in mn lab 24 0 and mn amb a significant amount of the added nh4 was removed indicating nutrient uptake by microalgae and or heterotrophic bacteria at the end of the experiment the final nh4 concentrations were 20 0 27 1 53 1 and 0 0 mg n l 1 in mn lab 12 12 mn lab 24 0 mn amb and n lab respectively in the consortium reactors relatively low final nh4 concentrations were observed under the laboratory conditions in which both microalgae and nitrification activities were observed compared to ambient conditions in which only microalgal activity was observed this indicates that the nh4 removal capability may be enhanced by the co cultivation of microalgae with bacteria which is consistent with the results of previous studies for instance de bashan et al 40 reported that the nh4 removal efficiency improved significantly when employing a consortium of chlorella vulgaris and azospirillum brasilense a nitrogen fixing bacteria compared to microalgae alone liang et al 41 also reported that the nh4 removal efficiency of a combined c vulgaris and bacillus licheniformis system was 2 7 times higher than that of the single microalgal system a recent study on a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium reported that a consortia of microalgae scenedesmus quadricauda anabena variabilis chlorella sp chlorococcus sp and spirulina sp and nitrifying bacteria collected from a wastewater treatment plant exhibited higher nh4 removal rates 100 mg n l 1 d 1 than microalgae 44 mg n l 1 d 1 using flat panel reactors 14 as a result the progress of nitrification is a key factor for the efficient removal of nh4 by a microalgal nitrifying consortium system the remaining nh4 in the consortium reactors at the end of the experiment indicated that nitrification and or microalgae growth ceased during the later days of the experiment a possible reason is the limitation of substrate and or diffusion of do previous studies reported that the mass transfer limitation due to diffusion was observed in activated sludge flocs 42 aerobic granule 43 and nitrifying biofilm 44 in their studies the mass transfer limitation occurred in the case of using flocs with a diameter larger than 100 200 μm 42 granules with a size lager than 500 μm 43 and biofilms with a thickness of 50 150 μm 44 meanwhile dispersed microalgae and nitrifiers were inoculated at the beginning of this study and none of the flocs granules and biofilm were observed during the experimental period thus the diffusion process of substrate and or dissolved oxygen to the nitrifies was unlikely to be a limiting factor as the ph of the culture medium has an important role in the growth of both microalgae and nitrifying bacteria variations in ph during the experiment may have been a reason for this result liang et al 41 evaluated the effect of ph on nutrient removal by a combined microalgae bacteria system of chlorella vulgaris and bacillus licheniformis they reported higher nh4 and tp removal efficiencies when the ph was regulated to neutral conditions than those when ph was not controlled and decreased from 7 to 3 5 with experimental time in a previous study on microalgae chlorella vulgaris cultivation the best growth was observed at ph levels of 6 and 7 45 a similar result was also presented by ghosh et al 46 who observed effective chlorella sp growth at ph 7 a favorable ph for the activity of nitrifying bacteria was 7 9 47 in the consortium reactors the ph values during the final half days of the experiment gradually exceeded mn lab 24 0 and mn amb or fell below mn 12 12 the appropriate range for the activities of freshwater microalgae and nitrifying bacteria fig 1a which limited nh4 removal the nh4 removal efficiency could be enhanced through optimizing the microalgae bacteria ratio 48 or photoperiod 18 under the n lab condition a more rapid decrease in nh4 was observed than that of the consortium reactors although most of the added nh4 was removed under the n lab conditions the produced no3 at the end of the experiment was lower than the amount of nh4 removed the loss of nh4 could be due to nitrogen assimilation 49 denitrification 50 and or ammonia volatilization 51 the amount of nh4 assimilated into nitrifiers calculated by the eq 8 was below 1 of the added nh4 besides nitrification nitrogen losses because of denitrification have been reported 50 nevertheless do has a negative effect on denitrification even at concentrations less than 0 1 mg l 1 52 conversely a do concentration higher than 0 5 mg l 1 is known to inhibit denitrification 53 a constant do concentration around 5 0 mg l 1 was observed in the n lab and therefore denitrification probably did not occur one of the main reasons for the loss could be ammonia volatilization it has been reported that direct aeration via forcing air through a reactor often releases volatile ammonia into the air especially at an alkaline ph 54 under the n lab conditions an alkaline ph of up to 8 5 was observed during the first two days of the experiment indicating the progress of volatilization the other possible reason is ammonia uptake by heterotrophic bacteria in the presence of dissolve organic carbon a previous study reported that the dissolved cod to nitrogen cod n ratio above 3 0 enhanced heterotrophic bacterial growth instead of nitrifiers 55 the applied cod n ratio was 4 8 in this study possibly resulting in ammonia consumption by heterotrophic bacteria meanwhile other literatures showed an evidence that heterotrophic bacteria grew less vigorously in the presence of microalgae such as chlorella vulgaris and chlorella pyrenoidosa 56 57 in addition heterotrophic bacterial colony formation decreased clearly at an acidic ph below 5 0 and at an alkaline ph of 9 0 compared to a neutral ph of 7 0 57 these observations implied that the growth of heterotrophic bacteria mainly occurred in the n lab in which only nitrifying bacteria was inoculated and neutral ph was maintained after three days of the experiment fig 2a 3 3 nitrogen mass balance the nitrogen mass balance at the end of the experiment was calculated and is shown in fig 5 which represents the remaining nh4 the produced nox volatilized ammonia ammonia assimilated by nitrifying bacteria and ammonia taken up by microalgae and or heterotrophic bacteria the nh4 removal efficiency and its pathway varied depending on the conditions in the consortium reactors higher ammonia removal efficiencies of 80 4 and 73 3 were achieved under laboratory conditions mn 12 12 and mn 24 0 than those under ambient conditions which achieved a removal efficiency of 47 8 nh4 removal mainly occurred via nitrification in mn lab 12 12 both uptake by microalgae and nitrification in mn lab 24 0 and uptake by microalgae only in mn amb some ammonia volatilization was observed in mn lab 24 0 and mn amb due to the high ph and fa values meanwhile very little ammonia volatilization was observed in mn lab 12 12 due to the low ph caused by the progress of nitrification previously reported work mentioned that the transformation of volatilized to non volatile nitrogen species through biological treatment such as nitrification and denitrification is a major ammonia emission mitigation technique 58 thus the successful nitrification with photo oxygenation by microalgae in this study led to ammonia emission abatement as well as effective nh4 removal 3 4 the effect of physicochemical parameters on nitrification performance under light exposure studies concerning nitrification process under light exposure including this study are summarized in table 2 high ammonia removal efficiencies above ca 80 and nitrification performances i e the percentage of the amount of added ammonia oxidized to nox above ca 80 were achieved in all previous studies on microalgal nitrifying bacteria consortia 10 59 60 and mn lab 12 12 in this study the comparable results obtained from mn lab 12 12 to those in previous results indicate that a real wastewater such as ade can be treated sufficiently by a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium under laboratory controlled conditions relatively low ammonia removal efficiencies 47 8 73 3 and nitrification performances 0 0 35 1 were observed under the other mn conditions vergara et al 60 applied strong light intensities reaching 1250 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to evaluate the influence of light intensity on nitrification process they reported that the specific total ammonium nitrogen removal rates of nitrifying bacteria decreased to 20 60 under continuous illumination at 500 and 1250 μmol photons m 2 s 1 however the total ammonia removal and nitrification efficiencies at the end of the experiment did not decrease remarkably this result was not coincident with the observations for mn lab 24 0 and mn amb which exhibited significant decreases in the ammonia removal and or nitrification efficiencies at similar or lower light intensities than those in vergara et al 60 as described in 3 3 the combination of light inhibition with other inhibitive factors i e excess ph and fa values may have deteriorated nitrification although ph control is considered as an effective strategy to avoid multiple inhibitions on nitrification the chemicals used are often unacceptable owing to their high cost in actual treatment plants one possible solution is the direct mitigation of light inhibition using a shading net furthermore the use of nitrifying granules 61 and or immobilized materials for nitrifying bacteria 62 is an effective method to mitigate the influence of light because aggregated microorganisms can prevent direct exposure to solar irradiance further research using this type of application is required to optimize the ammonia removal and nitrification performances of a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium under ambient conditions 4 conclusion ammonia was removed from the ade of slaughterhouse wastewater without aeration using a microalgal nitrifying bacterial consortium under laboratory and ambient conditions a successful ammonia removal efficiency of 80 4 was achieved through nitrification under half day illuminated conditions in the laboratory demonstrating the capability of ade treatment by a consortium nitrification inhibition with lower ammonia removal efficiencies than those of previous studies was observed under the continuously illuminated and ambient conditions a combination of light exposure reaching at least 1573 mol photons m 2 s 1 with high fa values ranging from 3 3 59 4 mg l 1 may have caused severe inhibition of nitrification by the microalgal bacterial consortium acknowledgements we appreciate the financial support provided by the

classical mechanism of fenton is a simple redox reaction in which the fe2 ions are oxidized to fe3 and h2o2 is reduced to hydroxyl ion and hydroxyl radical reaction 1 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho ho k1 76 m 1 s

efficiently through the mechanism explained in reaction 1 but each fe2 ion generates only one hydroxyl radical the fe3 ion produced in reaction 1 is reduced back during the reaction due to a second h2o2 molecule reaction 2 however the reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of fe2 ion and it is relatively slow 11 studies carried out aimed at increasing the speed of the reaction aiding the regeneration of ferric ion one way of accelerating this process is to use phenolic compounds especially dihydroxybenzenes dhb which have the ability to reduce fe3 allowing greater efficiency in the remediation processes 15 16 the advantage of this system is the higher generation of free radicals for a longer time compared to conventional fenton another alternative is to increase the concentration of the ferrous catalyst nevertheless when working at higher concentrations 0 5 mg l 1 the removal of the residual iron is necessary to carry out the proper effluent disposal 17 18 these characteristics led to a study that conductsthe residual iron removal acceleration through lamellar settler on a pilot scale notwithstanding the electrochemical processes highlighted by the

containing ruo2 and iro2 are widely used in electrochemical processes because they are mechanically resistant and easy to scale up for industrial purposes 20 which provides dsa wide applicability in the treatment of wastewater it also provides high active areas due to its known morphology of cracked clay allowing direct oxidation of the substrate on the surface of the electrode reaction 4 as well as oxidation through the electro generation of oxidant species 19 in a first step reaction 4 h2o acidic medium or oh basic medium is oxidized on the surface of the electrodes forming the hydroxyl

in the presence of chloride active chlorine can be electrogenerated through the oxidation of cl ions at the anode thus releasing cl2 reaction 7 22 then hclo and cl are released according to reaction 8 because of an acid base balance eq 9 with pka 7 55 depending on the ph of the effluent clo may be the major species in the solution alternatively clo can be produced in the direct reaction of the chloride with m oh according to eq 10 the almost indubitable presence of chloride ions in wastewaters highlights the possibility of using electrochemistry to promote the generation of active chlorine species using particular electrocatalytic anodes such as dimensionally stable anodes dsa likewise the correct dsa selection as well as adequate operating conditions prevents the production of chlorate

instrumentation and analyses aliquots were collected from the preparative reactions and analyzed by cod chemical oxygen demand and turbidity using policontrol solution reactor and analyzer kits using the standard apha awwa 2012 method 26 a spectrophotometer with a flow injection system and o phenanthroline as a chromogenic reagent were used to monitor the concentration of fe2 the variations used in the settler were the effluent entrance height and the decanter angulation with the support surface the residual iron concentration of the optimized condition was determined by a spectrophotometer uv vis λ 510 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 fenton experiments reagents concentration is highly important to determine the viability of the applied process both as to the operational cost and the generation of secondary waste in the classic fenton reactions there is a throwback about the ferrous catalyst used which can generate sludge after the pollutant degradation most of the studies tried to adapt the initial iron concentration to be beneath the limit allowed by the environmental agencies in the case of brazil 0 5 mg l 1 is the limit established by the national council for the environment conama 2005 17 however in face of recalcitrant organic compounds it is necessary to increase the life time or the concentration of oxidant species in the solution which can be achieved elevating the quantity of the catalyst fe2 the degradation process can be monitored from the decay of their cod which is related to the oxidation of organic compounds these data allow calculating the percentages of cod removal or decay using eq 1 as shown by brillas and martínez huitle 2015 27 11 cod removal δcod co d 0 x 100 where cod is the experimental cod decays in mg dm 3 respectively at reaction time t and cod0 is the corresponding initial values before treatment fig 2 a shows the highest catalytic effect with 0 7 mm of fe2 achieving 87 of cod removal against 34 and 37 using 0 3 and 0 5 mm of the catalyst respectively and 200 mm of h2o2 another important feature we ought to highlight is the cod removal of approximately 60 with t 15 min presenting fast degradation during the first minutes this can be imputed to the significant presence of fe2 at this time as will be introduced in fig 2b where the majority of the iron added is used to accelerate the formation of hydroxyl radicals and reduced to fe3 gomeset al and tavares et al had similar behavior with high cod removal 80 during the first 15 min which became glaring when the catalyst concentration was going up 27 28 the reaction kinetics were calculated through eq 2 it can be observed from the inset in fig 2a that the obtained rate constant values corroborate the rapid removal of cod reached in the first 15 min for the highest fe2 0 7 mm the kobs value was 5 fold and 9 3 fold higher than fe2 0 5 mm and fe2 0 3 mm respectively by estimating the values of observed rate constant kobs by using eq 2 12 ln cod 0 cod t k o b s t where cod 0 and cod t represent the cod values of solution measured at times zero and t respectively and kobs is the first order oxidation rate constant min 1 fitting the rate data using order higher than one does not produce good correlation coefficients data not shown fig 2b shows fe2 monitoring during the reaction through a flow injection system with spectrophotometric detection and o phenanthroline as a chromogenic reagent it was observed that fe2 is rapidly oxidized by the peroxide and the residual fe2 concentration is proportional to the initial iron concentration previous studies have confirmed that fe2 regeneration through fe3 reduction is the reaction rate determinant step 13 furthermore such finding is compatible with the fast cod removal presented in fig 2a where can be assumed that the ferrous catalyst consumed was used in the hydroxyl radicalproduction to act on the mineralization of the organic matter dihydroxybenzenes dhbs are widely studied compounds as iron regenerator in the fenton reactions mainly those derived from catechol fe3 is captured by catechol resulting in a complex species followed by intern oxidation and production ofa semiquinone radical letting fe2 free in the solution to keep the cyclic catalytic process 29 30 xiao et al demonstrated the catechol efficiency in moderate concentrations presenting acceleration of dimethyl phthalate degradation by fenton reaction 31 the best conditions to the fe catechol coupling is neutral ph after the complexes formation ph is induced to decrease and the regeneration of fe2 is promoted fig 2c introduces the addition of catechol 0 5 mm as a catalyst for fe3 reduction with significant effect for 0 5 mm fe2 and 200 mm h2o2 63 and 37 of cod reduction were obtained in the presence and absence of catechol respectively the fe2 concentration was slightly higher in the first 20 min of reaction due to the catalytic effect of the catechol previous studies indicate that after this time catechol is oxidized and loses the effect moreover the final cod suggests the added organic matter incident to dhb have no negative effect another sign of the catechol degradation 11 3 2 pilot scale reactor followed by sludge removal fig 3 a can provide the cod removal behavior from fenton reaction on pilot scale the first relevant finding is about the role of iron at lowest h2o2 50 mm there is higher cod removal up to 0 5 mm of fe2 51 on the other hand at 0 7 mm fe2 72 the removal decreased when compared with bench scale using h2o2 200 mm that has achieved respectively 37 and 87 of cod removal after 120 min another leading information is related to the iron decantation process samples collected from the treated effluent revel an increase of cod removal in 17 7 and 5 for fe2 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 mm inset fig 3a in this order furthermore the reactor presented on fig 4 came up with high effective sludge removal previous experiments required 24 h for decantation of the visible iron waste and adequacy of treated effluent to the disposal rules regarding final fe however the lamellar decanter has removed the sludge in 80 min of sequential pumping and the iron concentration on the treated effluent was 0 095 mg l 1 well below the disposal limit of conama 2005 and the update conama 2011 which establish the follow limits for river water 5 0 mg l 1 and 15 0 mg l 1 for effluents discharge 17 18 moreover the environmental protection agency epa red book 1976 recommended a criterion of 0 3 mg l 1 for domestic water supply uses for iron and 1 0 mg l 1 for freshwater aquatic life protection at certain concentrations iron can also be toxic to aquatic life 32 a significant throwback of fenton reactions is the generation of secondary waste iron sludge it became highly concerning to provide a proper destination to this matter therefore paixão and et al presented an alternative to iron sludge reuse the addition of the sludge to a mass of red ceramicin fractions of 2 10 by weight caused a decreaseof the flexural strength of the dry body at 110 c mainly due to the reduction of the linear retraction of drying 33 at mud particles had low interaction with clayup to 1000 c above this temperature the ferric slurry was the ceramic mass and significantly increased the retraction linear sludge calcination made it possible to increase the resistance tobending relative to the incorporation of the raw calcined sludge at 1000 cmainly became hematite fe2o3 with18 loss of mass and maintenance of the original form of the particles another important application could be in agriculture depending on the raw water a pretreatment can be addressed with micro and macronutrients enriching that can be made available to plants 34 a new reuse and disposal method of fenton sludge wasstudied by zhang et al magnetic nife2o4 was synthesized using iron containing fenton sludge as an iron source an excellent catalytic performance was achieved on the degradation of phenol by heterogeneous fenton reactions 35 according to bolobajevand et al reused iron containing sludge was an effective technique to treat three different wastewater samples 36 two of them treated without pre treatment anddone with a pre coagulation step the optimized fenton treatmentresulted in substantial organic matter removal the application of the fenton based process catalyzed by ferric sludge behaved likewise classical fenton process efficacy during four reuse cycles the turbidity fig 3b is slight influenced by the slope of the decanter 45 presented better efficiency about 91 the effluent entry position presented a more significant variation the entrance in the upper part was the one that presented the best result since the entrance at the sedimentation base showed the lowest turbidity reduction with the entrance at the top the downward flow of the effluent contributes to decantation of the sediment already at the bottom the upward flow of the effluent entrains part of the particulate material making sedimentation difficult flocculation and sedimentation may contribute to the removal of the organic load from the effluent it can also be observed that the variations of the decanterhave slight influence on the efficiency of the cod removal nevertheless this behaviorcan be associated to the flocculation process which depends mainly on the ph than settling speed related to the settler 3 3 electrochemical experiments electrochemical oxidation reactionswere performed testing the effect of the current density 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 and the electrolyte h2so4and hcl fig 4a b introduces cod removal calculated by eq 1 27 the effect of current density cd it is highly important since is directly connected with the power consumption in case of h2so4 as electrolyte it was observed significant improvement while the cd increased furthermore although the final cod removal is just 8 different between 60 and 90 ma cm 2 at 30 min it was 48 and the kobs indicates the 90 ma cm 2 4 36 times higher than 60 ma cm 2 in the case of hcl electrolyte the cod removal curves were more likely linear and the cd increase had not such pronounced effect as h2so4 had these results indicate the possibility of carrying out the electrolysis at lower potentials in the presence of chlorides face up to those required for direct anodic oxidation 37 38 fig 4c reveals two important events while the increase of applied current leads to undesired reactions such as oxygen evolution reaction 11 and possible chlorine evolution reaction 12 at 90 ma cm 2 this effect was more apparent in chloride medium due to the highest cod removal at 30 min for both electrolytes 38 in addition these findings are an important indication of possible reduction of the overall reaction time and energy consumption as well turbidity analysis exposed at fig 4d has another approach corroborating previous results at raised potentials the removal was improved which is due to the amount of gas evolutions however 30 and 60 ma cm 2 present h2so4 medium as more effective with this behavior inversed at 90 ma cm 2 what can be a clue of the difference in gas production and sequent lessened cod removal between the electrolytes studied 19 13 oh 1 2o2 h e 14 2cl cl2 2e according to duarte et al using ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 ti pt and bdd to degrade rifampicin and menezes et al in the treatment of shrimp farm effluent with ti ru0 34ti0 66o2 and ti pt the total current efficiency tce values fig 5 a revealed depletion while the applied current density increases 38 39 tce was estimated following eq 3 beyond that the evolution of the species described in eqs 11 and 12 originating from the electrolytes usually cause a deviate at the portion of the applied current thereby elevation of current lessens the direct oxidation mechanism 15 t c e f v c o d i c o d f 8 i δ t wherecodt and codt δt are the chemical oxygen demands g dm 3 at times t 0 initial and f final

difference of the cell in v i is the current in a t is the electrolysis time in h vs is the solution volume in l and cod are the corresponding experimental abatements of cod in mg l 1 fig 5b shows the comparison of the electrolytes in terms of removal of cod and power consumption ratifying the facts addressed at section 3 3 where it is possible to find no difference at the cod depletion among 60 and 90 ma cm 2 when hcl was used notwithstanding in case of energy the higher current spent more without inducing any significant effect at the pollutants mineralization this additional energy was used at o2 and chloride evolution this assertive explain the difference on the efficiency and energy discrepancy only at 90 ma cm 2 in comparison to h2so2 and hcl suggesting that the increment of applied current density had more significance at sulfate medium behavior already commented at section 3 3 on the cod and tce results 40 table 1 provides the average cell voltage and energy consumption estimation per unit volume unit cod mass and cost in brazilian currency for both in the study using h2so4 a proportional outcome was observed due the increase of applied current density for example the per unit volume energy were19 95 49 76 and 76 59 kw h m 3 for 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 respectively on the other hand when hcl was employed the consume per unit volume were 28 77 60 65 and 104 39 kw h m 3for 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 respectively these inferences are in agreement with cod removal tce values and turbidity reduction the higher power consumption under elevated current density from chloride medium is likely to increase the incidence of undesired side reactions which explains the decrease on degradation efficiency 41 3 4 fenton x electrochemical regarding the comparison between the homogeneous fenton and heterogeneous electrochemical by sulfate or chloride bases process fenton exhibited higher efficiency and these conclusions can be seen highlighted in the insert table in fig 6 first important feature at 30 min fenton already achieved 81 of cod removal meanwhile sulfate and chloride based electrochemical oxidation had 75 and 49 removals respectively under the same experimental conditions the faster degradation in sulfate medium can be attributed to the oxidizing agents e 2 5 3 1 v electrogenerated due to the eq 18 that effectively contribute toorganic pollutant oxidation degradation in addition in the analysis at 90 min final of fenton experiments itis observed 87 of cod reduction against 79 of both electrochemical experiments the maximum cod removal from electrolysis were 81 and 89 after 3 h for h2so4and hcl using hcl the electrochemical reaction is catalyzed by the generation of strong oxidizing agents clo and hclo however the homogeneous process showed higher efficiency due to the elevated concentration of hydroxyl radicals and stronger oxidation power of the oh e oh 280 v e clo 0954 v e hclo 149 v it is essential to point out that sulfate induces a cleaner process in comparison with chloride and the reaction time can be reduced in function of high speed oxidation at the first 30 min 39 42 44 18 2so4 2 h2o s2o8 2 2e 2h ½o2 4 conclusion the results showed the great efficiency of the oxidation process used both fenton 87 and electro oxidation were effective in the cod removal in the case of the electrochemical experiments an increase on the applied current density favors an efficient removal of organic matter for sulfate electrolyte until 90 ma cm 2 82 and 60 ma cm 2 when hcl 89 was employed fenton showed higher efficiency similar degradation at shorter reaction time due to the elevated concentration of hydroxyl radicals additionally persulfate can be electrogenerated which contributes to oxidation of the organic matter and explain the good effectiveness with fast degradation under 30 min of experiment however hcl electrolyte demonstrates slower degradation in the beginning nevertheless it lead to upper removal of cod after 180 min with no difference between 60 and 90 ma cm 2 a final relevant outcome was the possibility of fast iron sludge removal the pre pilot scale experiments followed by lamellar decantation successfully removed the sludge a significant drawback of fenton oxidation in 80 min letting the final effluent with 0 095 mg l 1 of fe3 well below the iron concentration allowed by conama 2005 2011

as oxidation through the electro generation of oxidant species 19 in a first step reaction 4 h2o acidic medium or oh basic medium is oxidized on the surface of the electrodes forming the hydroxyl radical adsorbed reaction 5 describes the second step known as oxygen release reaction 21 4 mox h2o mox oh h e 5 mox oh 1 2o2 mox h e 6 mox oh r mox co2 zh ze another important feature of dsa occurs in the presence of chloride active chlorine can be electrogenerated through the oxidation of cl ions at the anode thus releasing cl2 reaction 7 22 then hclo and cl are released according to reaction 8 because of an acid base balance eq 9 with pka 7 55 depending on the ph of the effluent clo may be the major species in the solution alternatively clo can be produced in the direct reaction of the chloride with m oh according to eq 10 the almost indubitable presence of chloride ions in wastewaters highlights the possibility of using electrochemistry to promote the generation of active chlorine species using particular electrocatalytic anodes such as dimensionally stable anodes dsa likewise the correct dsa selection as well as adequate operating conditions prevents the production of chlorate and perchlorate ions 22 25 7 2cl cl2 2e 8 cl2 aq h2o hclo cl h 9 hclo cl h 10 cl m oh clo h e these considerations guided the objectives of the present study which aims at the degradation of an

total water volume of 250 ml a continuous magnetic stirring system was employed and the solution ph was maintained at 3 0 0 1 the fenton reagent concentrations were as follows 0 3 0 5 0 7 mm of fe2 and 200 mm of h2o2 the reaction time was 90 min 2 3 fenton reaction followed by lamellar settler themodel effluent containing 9 94 g of oil and 40 ml of commercial detergent was prepared by sonication in 200 ml of than incorporated to total water volume of 50 l a continuous mechanical stirring system was employed and the solution ph was maintained at 3 0 0 1 the fenton reagent concentrations were as follows 0 3 0 5 0 7 mm of fe2 and 200 mm of h2o2 the lamellar settler fig 1 was set with lamellar configuration at 45 of the support surface and the effluent was pumped with 1 6 ml min 1 flow rate

instrumentation and analyses aliquots were collected from the preparative reactions and analyzed by cod chemical oxygen demand and turbidity using policontrol solution reactor and analyzer kits using the standard apha awwa 2012 method 26 a spectrophotometer with a flow injection system and o phenanthroline as a chromogenic reagent were used to monitor the concentration of fe2 the variations used in the settler were the effluent entrance height and the decanter angulation with the support surface the residual iron concentration of the optimized condition was determined by a spectrophotometer uv vis λ 510 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 fenton experiments reagents concentration is highly important to determine the viability of the applied process both as to the operational cost and the generation of secondary waste in the classic fenton reactions there is a throwback about the ferrous catalyst used which can generate sludge after the pollutant degradation most of the studies tried to adapt the initial iron concentration to be beneath the limit allowed by the environmental agencies in the case of brazil 0 5 mg l 1 is the limit established by the national council for the environment conama 2005 17 however in face of recalcitrant organic compounds it is necessary to increase the life time or the concentration of oxidant species in the solution which can be achieved elevating the quantity of the catalyst fe2 the degradation process can be monitored from the decay of their cod which is related to the oxidation of organic compounds these data allow calculating the percentages of cod removal or decay using eq 1 as shown by brillas and martínez huitle 2015 27 11 cod removal δcod co d 0 x 100 where cod is the experimental cod decays in mg dm 3 respectively at reaction time t and cod0 is the corresponding initial values before treatment fig 2 a shows the highest catalytic effect with 0 7 mm of fe2 achieving 87 of cod removal against 34 and 37 using 0 3 and 0 5 mm of the catalyst respectively and 200 mm of h2o2 another important feature we ought to highlight is the cod removal of approximately 60 with t 15 min presenting fast degradation during the first minutes this can be imputed to the significant presence of fe2 at this time as will be introduced in fig 2b where the majority of the iron added is used to accelerate the formation of hydroxyl radicals and reduced to fe3 gomeset al and tavares et al had similar behavior with high cod removal 80 during the first 15 min which became glaring when the catalyst concentration was going up 27 28 the reaction kinetics were calculated through eq 2 it can be observed from the inset in fig 2a that the obtained rate constant values corroborate the rapid removal of cod reached in the first 15 min for the highest fe2 0 7 mm the kobs value was 5 fold and 9 3 fold higher than fe2 0 5 mm and fe2 0 3 mm respectively by estimating the values of observed rate constant kobs by using eq 2 12 ln cod 0 cod t k o b s t where cod 0 and cod t represent the cod values of solution measured at times zero and t respectively and kobs is the first order oxidation rate constant min 1 fitting the rate data using order higher than one does not produce good correlation coefficients data not shown fig 2b shows fe2 monitoring during the reaction through a flow injection system with spectrophotometric detection and o phenanthroline as a chromogenic reagent it was observed that fe2 is rapidly oxidized by the peroxide and the residual fe2 concentration is proportional to the initial iron concentration previous studies have confirmed that fe2 regeneration through fe3 reduction is the reaction rate determinant step 13 furthermore such finding is compatible with the fast cod removal presented in fig 2a where can be assumed that the ferrous catalyst consumed was used in the hydroxyl radicalproduction to act on the mineralization of the organic matter dihydroxybenzenes dhbs are widely studied compounds as iron regenerator in the fenton reactions mainly those derived from catechol fe3 is captured by catechol resulting in a complex species followed by intern oxidation and production ofa semiquinone radical letting fe2 free in the solution to keep the cyclic catalytic process 29 30 xiao et al demonstrated the catechol efficiency in moderate concentrations presenting acceleration of dimethyl phthalate degradation by fenton reaction 31 the best conditions to the fe catechol coupling is neutral ph after the complexes formation ph is induced to decrease and the regeneration of fe2 is promoted fig 2c introduces the addition of catechol 0 5 mm as a catalyst for fe3 reduction with significant effect for 0 5 mm fe2 and 200 mm h2o2 63 and 37 of cod reduction were obtained in the presence and absence of catechol respectively the fe2 concentration was slightly higher in the first 20 min of reaction due to the catalytic effect of the catechol previous studies indicate that after this time catechol is oxidized and loses the effect moreover the final cod suggests the added organic matter incident to dhb have no negative effect another sign of the catechol degradation 11 3 2 pilot scale reactor followed by sludge removal fig 3 a can provide the cod removal behavior from fenton reaction on pilot scale the first relevant finding is about the role of iron at lowest h2o2 50 mm there is higher cod removal up to 0 5 mm of fe2 51 on the other hand at 0 7 mm fe2 72 the removal decreased when compared with bench scale using h2o2 200 mm that has achieved respectively 37 and 87 of cod removal after 120 min another leading information is related to the iron decantation process samples collected from the treated effluent revel an increase of cod removal in 17 7 and 5 for fe2 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 mm inset fig 3a in this order furthermore the reactor presented on fig 4 came up with high effective sludge removal previous experiments required 24 h for decantation of the visible iron waste and adequacy of treated effluent to the disposal rules regarding final fe however the lamellar decanter has removed the sludge in 80 min of sequential pumping and the iron concentration on the treated effluent was 0 095 mg l 1 well below the disposal limit of conama 2005 and the update conama 2011 which establish the follow limits for river water 5 0 mg l 1 and 15 0 mg l 1 for effluents discharge 17 18 moreover the environmental protection agency epa red book 1976 recommended a criterion of 0 3 mg l 1 for domestic water supply uses for iron and 1 0 mg l 1 for freshwater aquatic life protection at certain concentrations iron can also be toxic to aquatic life 32 a significant throwback of fenton reactions is the generation of secondary waste iron sludge it became highly concerning to provide a proper destination to this matter therefore paixão and et al presented an alternative to iron sludge reuse the addition of the sludge to a mass of red ceramicin fractions of 2 10 by weight caused a decreaseof the flexural strength of the dry body at 110 c mainly due to the reduction of the linear retraction of drying 33 at mud particles had low interaction with clayup to 1000 c above this temperature the ferric slurry was the ceramic mass and significantly increased the retraction linear sludge calcination made it possible to increase the resistance tobending relative to the incorporation of the raw calcined sludge at 1000 cmainly became hematite fe2o3 with18 loss of mass and maintenance of the original form of the particles another important application could be in agriculture depending on the raw water a pretreatment can be addressed with micro and macronutrients enriching that can be made available to plants 34 a new reuse and disposal method of fenton sludge wasstudied by zhang et al magnetic nife2o4 was synthesized using iron containing fenton sludge as an iron source an excellent catalytic performance was achieved on the degradation of phenol by heterogeneous fenton reactions 35 according to bolobajevand et al reused iron containing sludge was an effective technique to treat three different wastewater samples 36 two of them treated without pre treatment anddone with a pre coagulation step the optimized fenton treatmentresulted in substantial organic matter removal the application of the fenton based process catalyzed by ferric sludge behaved likewise classical fenton process efficacy during four reuse cycles the turbidity fig 3b is slight influenced by the slope of the decanter 45 presented better efficiency about 91 the effluent entry position presented a more significant variation the entrance in the upper part was the one that presented the best result since the entrance at the sedimentation base showed the lowest turbidity reduction with the entrance at the top the downward flow of the effluent contributes to decantation of the sediment already at the bottom the upward flow of the effluent entrains part of the particulate material making sedimentation difficult flocculation and sedimentation may contribute to the removal of the organic load from the effluent it can also be observed that the variations of the decanterhave slight influence on the efficiency of the cod removal nevertheless this behaviorcan be associated to the flocculation process which depends mainly on the ph than settling speed related to the settler 3 3 electrochemical experiments electrochemical oxidation reactionswere performed testing the effect of the current density 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 and the electrolyte h2so4and hcl fig 4a b introduces cod removal calculated by eq 1 27 the effect of current density cd it is highly important since is directly connected with the power consumption in case of h2so4 as electrolyte it was observed significant improvement while the cd increased furthermore although the final cod removal is just 8 different between 60 and 90 ma cm 2 at 30 min it was 48 and the kobs indicates the 90 ma cm 2 4 36 times higher than 60 ma cm 2 in the case of hcl electrolyte the cod removal curves were more likely linear and the cd increase had not such pronounced effect as h2so4 had these results indicate the possibility of carrying out the electrolysis at lower potentials in the presence of chlorides face up to those required for direct anodic oxidation 37 38 fig 4c reveals two important events while the increase of applied current leads to undesired reactions such as oxygen evolution reaction 11 and possible chlorine evolution reaction 12 at 90 ma cm 2 this effect was more apparent in chloride medium due to the highest cod removal at 30 min for both electrolytes 38 in addition these findings are an important indication of possible reduction of the overall reaction time and energy consumption as well turbidity analysis exposed at fig 4d has another approach corroborating previous results at raised potentials the removal was improved which is due to the amount of gas evolutions however 30 and 60 ma cm 2 present h2so4 medium as more effective with this behavior inversed at 90 ma cm 2 what can be a clue of the difference in gas production and sequent lessened cod removal between the electrolytes studied 19 13 oh 1 2o2 h e 14 2cl cl2 2e according to duarte et al using ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 ti pt and bdd to degrade rifampicin and menezes et al in the treatment of shrimp farm effluent with ti ru0 34ti0 66o2 and ti pt the total current efficiency tce values fig 5 a revealed depletion while the applied current density increases 38 39 tce was estimated following eq 3 beyond that the evolution of the species described in eqs 11 and 12 originating from the electrolytes usually cause a deviate at the portion of the applied current thereby elevation of current lessens the direct oxidation mechanism 15 t c e f v c o d i c o d f 8 i δ t wherecodt and codt δt are the chemical oxygen demands g dm 3 at times t 0 initial and f final

difference of the cell in v i is the current in a t is the electrolysis time in h vs is the solution volume in l and cod are the corresponding experimental abatements of cod in mg l 1 fig 5b shows the comparison of the electrolytes in terms of removal of cod and power consumption ratifying the facts addressed at section 3 3 where it is possible to find no difference at the cod depletion among 60 and 90 ma cm 2 when hcl was used notwithstanding in case of energy the higher current spent more without inducing any significant effect at the pollutants mineralization this additional energy was used at o2 and chloride evolution this assertive explain the difference on the efficiency and energy discrepancy only at 90 ma cm 2 in comparison to h2so2 and hcl suggesting that the increment of applied current density had more significance at sulfate medium behavior already commented at section 3 3 on the cod and tce results 40 table 1 provides the average cell voltage and energy consumption estimation per unit volume unit cod mass and cost in brazilian currency for both in the study using h2so4 a proportional outcome was observed due the increase of applied current density for example the per unit volume energy were19 95 49 76 and 76 59 kw h m 3 for 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 respectively on the other hand when hcl was employed the consume per unit volume were 28 77 60 65 and 104 39 kw h m 3for 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 respectively these inferences are in agreement with cod removal tce values and turbidity reduction the higher power consumption under elevated current density from chloride medium is likely to increase the incidence of undesired side reactions which explains the decrease on degradation efficiency 41 3 4 fenton x electrochemical regarding the comparison between the homogeneous fenton and heterogeneous electrochemical by sulfate or chloride bases process fenton exhibited higher efficiency and these conclusions can be seen highlighted in the insert table in fig 6 first important feature at 30 min fenton already achieved 81 of cod removal meanwhile sulfate and chloride based electrochemical oxidation had 75 and 49 removals respectively under the same experimental conditions the faster degradation in sulfate medium can be attributed to the oxidizing agents e 2 5 3 1 v electrogenerated due to the eq 18 that effectively contribute toorganic pollutant oxidation degradation in addition in the analysis at 90 min final of fenton experiments itis observed 87 of cod reduction against 79 of both electrochemical experiments the maximum cod removal from electrolysis were 81 and 89 after 3 h for h2so4and hcl using hcl the electrochemical reaction is catalyzed by the generation of strong oxidizing agents clo and hclo however the homogeneous process showed higher efficiency due to the elevated concentration of hydroxyl radicals and stronger oxidation power of the oh e oh 280 v e clo 0954 v e hclo 149 v it is essential to point out that sulfate induces a cleaner process in comparison with chloride and the reaction time can be reduced in function of high speed oxidation at the first 30 min 39 42 44 18 2so4 2 h2o s2o8 2 2e 2h ½o2 4 conclusion the results showed the great efficiency of the oxidation process used both fenton 87 and electro oxidation were effective in the cod removal in the case of the electrochemical experiments an increase on the applied current density favors an efficient removal of organic matter for sulfate electrolyte until 90 ma cm 2 82 and 60 ma cm 2 when hcl 89 was employed fenton showed higher efficiency similar degradation at shorter reaction time due to the elevated concentration of hydroxyl radicals additionally persulfate can be electrogenerated which contributes to oxidation of the organic matter and explain the good effectiveness with fast degradation under 30 min of experiment however hcl electrolyte demonstrates slower degradation in the beginning nevertheless it lead to upper removal of cod after 180 min with no difference between 60 and 90 ma cm 2 a final relevant outcome was the possibility of fast iron sludge removal the pre pilot scale experiments followed by lamellar decantation successfully removed the sludge a significant drawback of fenton oxidation in 80 min letting the final effluent with 0 095 mg l 1 of fe3 well below the iron concentration allowed by conama 2005 2011

14334,the pseudo first order pfo the pseudo second order pso the elovich and the vermeulen kinetic models are widely used in describing batch adsorption from aqueous solutions the corresponding kinetic parameters are often obtained by traditional linear regression methods which require the linearization of the original nonlinear equations and can lead to distorted regression results in this work a new improved linear regression method is presented where the original kinetic equations are preserved without transformation and the root mean square error rmse is minimized the method is applied to the adsorption of cd2 by modified chitosan and of succinic acid by macroporous resin the results show that cd2 adsorption is best described by the vermeulen model where intraparticle diffusion is the controlling mechanism and succinic acid adsorption by the pfo model where surface reaction is the main mechanism keywords adsorption kinetic models regression method adsorption mechanism 1 introduction adsorption is an effective method for chemical separation and water treatment 1 11 in the study of adsorption processes and the evaluation of adsorbents an important aspect is the rate or kinetics of adsorption among the various kinetic models 12 16 the most convenient and widely used are the pseudo first order pfo model 17 22 the pseudo second order pso model 17 22 the elovich model 12 16 and the vermeulen model 23 26 in each of these four models there are two parameters which are usually obtained by fitting experimental kinetic data to the respective models in this regard linear or nonlinear regression methods can be used as nonlinear regression requires the use of a search or an optimization technique or software 14 15 linear regression is used much more often 3 2 11 in the traditional linear regression methods the original nonlinear kinetic equations are transformed into linear ones this transformation can alter the data structure and error distribution which can in turn lead to distorted regression results 14 16 18 20 in applying a regression method a relevant question is how to assess the data fitting quality in cases where different kinetic models are to be compared and adsorption mechanism to be understood there also arises the question which model is better or the best the traditional and most widely used criterion is the coefficient of determination 3 11 in the traditional linear regression methods the coefficient of determination is also distorted as a result of transforming nonlinear kinetic equations into linear ones and is thus not a reliable indicator of the data fitting quality 15 18 20 the objective of this work is to present an improved linear regression method for the commonly used adsorption kinetic models which can overcome the shortcomings of the traditional linear regression methods so that correct regression results are obtained 2 theoretical 2 1 kinetic models 2 1 1 pfo model the differential form of the pfo model is 16 17 1 d q d t k 1 q e q where q is the adsorbed amount at time t k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant and q e is the equilibrium value of q integration of eq 1 with the initial condition q 0 at t 0 gives 2 q q e 1 e k 1 t 2 1 2 pso model the differential form of the pso model is 16 17 3 d q d t k 2 q e q 2 where k 2 is the pseudo second order rate constant the integrated form can be written as 4 q k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t 2 1 3 vermeulen model the differential form of the vermeulen model is 23 5 d q d t π 2 d i r 2 q e 2 q 2 2 q b q e 2 q 2 2 q where r is the adsorbent radius d i is the effective intraparticle diffusion coefficient and b is defined as 6 b π 2 d i r 2 the integrated vermeulen model can be expressed as 7 q q e 1 e b t the vermeulen model is based on the assumption that intraparticle diffusion is the controlling mechanism of adsorption it is also known as the urano model 27 or the dumwald wagner model 28 for short adsorption time when q q e 0 3 eq 7 can be approximated by 26 27 8 q q e b t k t which is usually known as the weber morris or the intraparticle diffusion model 12 13 26 27 2 1 4 elovich model the differential form of the elovich model is 13 15 9 d q d t α e β q where the elovich parameters α and β are respectively the initial adsorption rate and the desorption constant the integrated form is 10 q 1 β ln 1 α β t it is noted that the elovich model predicts an infinite equilibrium as time goes to infinity and is considered suitable only for kinetics far from equilibrium 14 2 2 traditional linear regression methods 2 2 1 pfo model one traditional linear regression method for the pfo model is by transforming eq 2 to the linear form 13 14 11 ln 1 q q e k 1 t which can be rewritten as 12 f 1 q k 1 t by defining 13 f 1 q ln 1 q q e then plotting f 1 versus t would lead to a straight line passing through the origin with a slope equal to k 1 the evaluation of f 1 by eq 13 requires the value of q e which is usually taken as the experimental value q e exp this means that k 1 is the only parameter to be determined by regression it is noted that in this regression method a small error in q near adsorption equilibrium where q is close to q e exp can result in a large uncertainty in eq 13 for this regression method the coefficient of determination r 2 can be written as 13 15 18 14 r 2 1 f 1 k 1 t 2 f 1 1 n f 1 2 where n is the number of data points another traditional linear regression method for the pfo model is by transforming eq 2 to the following linear form 3 6 8 11 15 ln q e q ln q e k 1 t which may be rewritten as 16 g 1 q ln q e k 1 t by defining 17 g 1 q ln q e q then plotting g 1 versus t would show a straight line with a slope k 1 and an intercept ln q e q e in eq 17 is generally taken as the experimental value q e exp q e evaluated from the intercept ln q e is usually called the calculated value q e cal the ideal situation is that q e cal is equal to q e exp but this rarely occurs the usual case is that q e cal and q e exp are different which is often taken as an indication that the pfo model is not suitable for the adsorption system under consideration 3 6 8 11 in this regression method a small error in q near adsorption equilibrium can also lead to a high uncertainty in eq 17 here the coefficient of determination is expressed as 18 r 2 1 g 1 ln q e k 1 t 2 g 1 1 n g 1 2 2 2 2 pso model the most widely used linear regression method for the pso model is by transforming eq 4 to the linear form 3 6 8 11 19 t q 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e from the slope and the intercept of the plot of t q versus t q e and k 2 are readily evaluated it is noted that eq 19 cannot be used at the initial point q 0 at t 0 for this regression method the coefficient of determination is 20 r 2 1 t q 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 2 t q 1 n t q 2 2 2 3 vermeulen model the vermeulen model eq 7 can be expressed in the linear form 21 ln 1 q q e 2 b t which may be rewritten as 22 f v q b t by defining 23 f v q ln 1 q q e 2 the parameter b is then determined from the slope of the plot f v versus t q e in eq 23 is again taken as the experimental value q e exp in this regression method a small error in q near adsorption equilibrium can also result in a large uncertainty in eq 23 here the coefficient of determination is given by 24 r 2 1 f v b t 2 f v 1 n f v 2 2 2 4 elovich model by assuming αβt 1 the elovich model eq 10 can be linearized as 13 15 25 q 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t the parameters α and β are then determined from plotting q versus lnt it is noted that eq 25 cannot be used at the initial point q 0 at t 0 and that the assumption αβt 1 is not valid for short adsorption time the coefficient of determination for this regression method is 26 r 2 1 q 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t 2 q 1 n q 2 from eqs 14 18 20 24 and 26 it is seen that the coefficients of determination in the traditional linear regression methods are evaluated differently for different regression methods and models it is thus not appropriate to assess the data fitting quality simply by the values of r 2 14 16 18 20 21 in fact it was shown that linear regression by the pso model resulted in a higher coefficient of determination than by the pfo model for simulated kinetic data generated by the pfo model 16 18 a better criterion for comparing the data fitting quality of different regression methods and models is the root mean square error rmse defined as 13 14 29 27 r m s e q exp q cal 2 n where q exp and q cal are respectively the experimental and calculated values of q 2 3 new linear regression methods 2 3 1 pfo model the pfo model eq 2 can be expressed as 28 q q e f 1 t by defining 29 f 1 t 1 e k 1 t eq 28 means that plotting q against f 1 evaluated by eq 29 for a known k 1 should lead to a straight line passing through the origin with a slope equal to q e in other words q e is readily obtained by linear regression based on eq 28 the corresponding coefficient of determination is given by 30 r 2 1 q q e f 1 2 q 1 n q 2 the question then is how to determine k 1 which is required in the evaluation of f 1 by eq 29 we propose that k 1 be determined by a try and error process as the coefficient of determination r 2 in the linear regression step based on eq 28 is dependent on the value of k 1 different values of k 1 would result in different values of r 2 by try and error the best k 1 can be found which gives maximum r 2 to start the try and error process an initial value for k 1 may be obtained by using the half adsorption time t 1 2 defined as the time when q q e 2 estimated from the kinetic data and the following relationship for the pfo model 31 k 1 ln 2 t 1 2 application of the new linear regression method is illustrated in section 3 2 3 2 pso model the pso model eq 4 can be written as 32 q q e f 2 t by defining 33 f 2 t k 2 q e t 1 k 2 q e t then q e is readily obtained by linear regression according to eq 32 like k 1 in the pfo model k 2 q e in eq 33 can also be determined by a try and error process in searching for the maximum coefficient of determination 34 r 2 1 q q e f 2 2 q 1 n q 2 an initial trial value for k 2 q e may be obtained by using the following relationship for the pso model 35 k 2 q e 1 t 1 2 it is noted that once q e and k 2 q e are determined k 2 is easily calculated 2 3 3 vermeulen model the vermeulen model eq 7 may be expressed as 36 q q e f v t by defining 37 f v t 1 e b t q e is then determined by linear regression based on eq 36 and b by a try and error process in maximizing coefficient of determination 38 r 2 1 q q e f v 2 q 1 n q 2 an initial trial value for b may be obtained by using the relationship for the vermeulen model 39 b ln 4 3 t 1 2 2 3 4 elovich model the elovich model eq 10 can be written as 40 q 1 β f e t by defining 41 f e t ln 1 α β t β is then determined by linear regression based on eq 40 and αβ by try and error in obtaining the maximum coefficient of determination 42 r 2 1 q 1 β f e 2 q 1 n q 2 an initial trial value for αβ may be estimated by using the following relationship for the elovich model derived from eq 25 43 α β t 2 q 1 q 2 q 1 t 1 q 2 q 2 q 1 where t 1 q 1 and t 2 q 2 are two kinetic data points a common feature of the new linear regression methods for the pfo the pso the vermeulen and the elovich models is that the adsorbed amount q is used as the regression variable without transformation and thus the original data structure is preserved unlike the traditional linear regression methods furthermore eqs 30 34 38 and 42 show that in the new linear regression methods r 2 for different models can all be expressed as 44 r 2 1 q exp q cal 2 q exp 1 n q exp 2 this means that r 2 for different models can be compared directly unlike the traditional linear regression methods from eq 44 and the definition of rmse eq 27 a simple relationship between r 2 and rmse is obtained for the new linear regression methods this relationship does not exist for the traditional linear regression methods 45 r 2 1 r m s e 2 q exp 1 n q exp 2 n or 46 1 r 2 r m s e q exp 1 n q exp 2 n this means that i the new linear regression methods minimize rmse as a result of maximizing r 2 which is not the case in the traditional linear regression methods ii r 2 or 1 r 2 0 5 as well as rmse can be equivalently used to judge the relative suitability of different models in describing the kinetics of an adsorption system a higher r 2 or a lower 1 r 2 0 5 means a smaller rmse which in turn indicates a better fit in the traditional linear regression methods r 2 or 1 r 2 0 5 cannot be directly compared as it is evaluated differently in different models 3 application 3 1 adsorption of cd2 by modified chitosan the kinetic data for cd2 adsorption from aqueous solutions by modified chitosan at the initial cd2

linear regression by eq 12 is not good traditional linear regression by eq 16 is shown in fig 1b from the intercept in fig 1b the calculated q e is 98 9 mg g table 1 which is much lower than the experimental value the high value of rmse 17 2 mg g also proves that this regression method is not acceptable for the new linear regression method based on eqs 28 and 29 an initial trial value for k 1

corresponding best k 2 q e 0 22 min 1 are determined by try and error as seen in table 1 the new linear regression method shows rmse 3 72 mg g which is significantly lower than 5 37 mg g by the traditional linear regression method but r 2 0 9929 by the former is lower than r 2 0 9997 by the latter demonstrating that the coefficient of determination in the traditional linear regression method can be misleading it is also seen that the new linear regression method gives k 2 0 00132 g mg 1 min 1 which differs substantially from k 2 0 00182 g mg 1 min 1 by the traditional linear regression

for b may be obtained by eq 39 fig 3b shows the plot of q versus f v with the maximum r 2 0 9964 and the corresponding best b 0 073 min 1 being determined by try and error it is seen from table 1 that the new linear regression method results in q e 156 9 mg g which is same as the experimental value and rmse 2 65 mg g which is the lowest of all models 3 1 4 elovich model for the elovich model traditional linear regression based on eq 25 is shown in fig 4 a for the new linear regression method based on eqs 40 and 41 an initial trial value for αβ may be obtained by eq 43 fig 4b shows the plot of q versus f e where the maximum r 2 0 949 and the corresponding best αβ 35 min 1 are determined by try and error from table 1 it is seen that the values of α β and rmse by the traditional linear regression method are close or the same as those by the new linear regression method but r 2 0 7875 by the former is significantly lower than r 2 0 949 by the latter demonstrating again that the coefficient of determination in the traditional linear regression method is misleading as discussed earlier one advantage of the new linear regression methods is that r 2 and rmse are simply related by eq 46 there is no such relationship for the traditional linear regression methods this is clearly shown in fig 5 where 1 r 2 0 5 is proportional to rmse for the new linear regression methods fig 5b and that there is no correlation between 1 r 2 0 5 and rmse for the traditional linear regression methods fig 5a thus in the new linear regression methods r 2 or 1 r 2 0 5 or rmse can

14334,the pseudo first order pfo the pseudo second order pso the elovich and the vermeulen kinetic models are widely used in describing batch adsorption from aqueous solutions the corresponding kinetic parameters are often obtained by traditional linear regression methods which require the linearization of the original nonlinear equations and can lead to distorted regression results in this work a new improved linear regression method is presented where the original kinetic equations are preserved without transformation and the root mean square error rmse is minimized the method is applied to the adsorption of cd2 by modified chitosan and of succinic acid by macroporous resin the results show that cd2 adsorption is best described by the vermeulen model where intraparticle diffusion is the controlling mechanism and succinic acid adsorption by the pfo model where surface reaction is the main mechanism keywords adsorption kinetic models regression method adsorption mechanism 1 introduction adsorption is an effective method for chemical separation and water treatment 1 11 in the study of adsorption processes and the evaluation of adsorbents an important aspect is the rate or kinetics of adsorption among the various kinetic models 12 16 the most convenient and widely used are the pseudo first order pfo model 17 22 the pseudo second order pso model 17 22 the elovich model 12 16 and the vermeulen model 23 26 in each of these four models there are two parameters which are usually obtained by fitting experimental kinetic data to the respective models in this regard linear or nonlinear regression methods can be used as nonlinear regression requires the use of a search or an optimization technique or software 14 15 linear regression is used much more often 3 2 11 in the traditional linear regression methods the original nonlinear kinetic equations are transformed into linear ones this transformation can alter the data structure and error distribution which can in turn lead to distorted regression results 14 16 18 20 in applying a regression method a relevant question is how to assess the data fitting quality in cases where different kinetic models are to be compared and adsorption mechanism to be understood there also arises the question which model is better or the best the traditional and most widely used criterion is the coefficient of determination 3 11 in the traditional linear regression methods the coefficient of determination is also distorted as a result of transforming nonlinear kinetic equations into linear ones and is thus not a reliable indicator of the data fitting quality 15 18 20 the objective of this work is to present an improved linear regression method for the commonly used adsorption kinetic models which can overcome the shortcomings of the traditional linear regression methods so that correct regression results are obtained 2 theoretical 2 1 kinetic models 2 1 1 pfo model the differential form of the pfo model is 16 17 1 d q d t k 1 q e q where q is the adsorbed amount at time t k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant and q e is the equilibrium value of q integration of eq 1 with the initial condition q 0 at t 0 gives 2 q q e 1 e k 1 t 2 1 2 pso model the differential form of the pso model is 16 17 3 d q d t k 2 q e q 2 where k 2 is the pseudo second order rate constant the integrated form can be written as 4 q k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t 2 1 3 vermeulen model the differential form of the vermeulen model is 23 5 d q d t π 2 d i r 2 q e 2 q 2 2 q b q e 2 q 2 2 q where r is the adsorbent radius d i is the effective intraparticle diffusion coefficient and b is defined as 6 b π 2 d i r 2 the integrated vermeulen model can be expressed as 7 q q e 1 e b t the vermeulen model is based on the assumption that intraparticle diffusion is the controlling mechanism of adsorption it is also known as the urano model 27 or the dumwald wagner model 28 for short adsorption time when q q e 0 3 eq 7 can be approximated by 26 27 8 q q e b t k t which is usually known as the weber morris or the intraparticle diffusion model 12 13 26 27 2 1 4 elovich model the differential form of the elovich model is 13 15 9 d q d t α e β q where the elovich parameters α and β are respectively the initial adsorption rate and the desorption constant the integrated form is 10 q 1 β ln 1 α β t it is noted that the elovich model predicts an infinite equilibrium as time goes to infinity and is considered suitable only for kinetics far from equilibrium 14 2 2 traditional linear regression methods 2 2 1 pfo model one traditional linear regression method for the pfo model is by transforming eq 2 to the linear form 13 14 11 ln 1 q q e k 1 t which can be rewritten as 12 f 1 q k 1 t by defining 13 f 1 q ln 1 q q e then plotting f 1 versus t would lead to a straight line passing through the origin with a slope equal to k 1 the evaluation of f 1 by eq 13 requires the value of q e which is usually taken as the experimental value q e exp this means that k 1 is the only parameter to be determined by regression it is noted that in this regression method a small error in q near adsorption equilibrium where q is close to q e exp can result in a large uncertainty in eq 13 for this regression method the coefficient of determination r 2 can be written as 13 15 18 14 r 2 1 f 1 k 1 t 2 f 1 1 n f 1 2 where n is the number of data points another traditional linear regression method for the pfo model is by transforming eq 2 to the following linear form 3 6 8 11 15 ln q e q ln q e k 1 t which may be rewritten as 16 g 1 q ln q e k 1 t by defining 17 g 1 q ln q e q then plotting g 1 versus t would show a straight line with a slope k 1 and an intercept ln q e q e in eq 17 is generally taken as the experimental value q e exp q e evaluated from the intercept ln q e is usually called the calculated value q e cal the ideal situation is that q e cal is equal to q e exp but this rarely occurs the usual case is that q e cal and q e exp are different which is often taken as an indication that the pfo model is not suitable for the adsorption system under consideration 3 6 8 11 in this regression method a small error in q near adsorption equilibrium can also lead to a high uncertainty in eq 17 here the coefficient of determination is expressed as 18 r 2 1 g 1 ln q e k 1 t 2 g 1 1 n g 1 2 2 2 2 pso model the most widely used linear regression method for the pso model is by transforming eq 4 to the linear form 3 6 8 11 19 t q 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e from the slope and the intercept of the plot of t q versus t q e and k 2 are readily evaluated it is noted that eq 19 cannot be used at the initial point q 0 at t 0 for this regression method the coefficient of determination is 20 r 2 1 t q 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 2 t q 1 n t q 2 2 2 3 vermeulen model the vermeulen model eq 7 can be expressed in the linear form 21 ln 1 q q e 2 b t which may be rewritten as 22 f v q b t by defining 23 f v q ln 1 q q e 2 the parameter b is then determined from the slope of the plot f v versus t q e in eq 23 is again taken as the experimental value q e exp in this regression method a small error in q near adsorption equilibrium can also result in a large uncertainty in eq 23 here the coefficient of determination is given by 24 r 2 1 f v b t 2 f v 1 n f v 2 2 2 4 elovich model by assuming αβt 1 the elovich model eq 10 can be linearized as 13 15 25 q 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t the parameters α and β are then determined from plotting q versus lnt it is noted that eq 25 cannot be used at the initial point q 0 at t 0 and that the assumption αβt 1 is not valid for short adsorption time the coefficient of determination for this regression method is 26 r 2 1 q 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t 2 q 1 n q 2 from eqs 14 18 20 24 and 26 it is seen that the coefficients of determination in the traditional linear regression methods are evaluated differently for different regression methods and models it is thus not appropriate to assess the data fitting quality simply by the values of r 2 14 16 18 20 21 in fact it was shown that linear regression by the pso model resulted in a higher coefficient of determination than by the pfo model for simulated kinetic data generated by the pfo model 16 18 a better criterion for comparing the data fitting quality of different regression methods and models is the root mean square error rmse defined as 13 14 29 27 r m s e q exp q cal 2 n where q exp and q cal are respectively the experimental and calculated values of q 2 3 new linear regression methods 2 3 1 pfo model the pfo model eq 2 can be expressed as 28 q q e f 1 t by defining 29 f 1 t 1 e k 1 t eq 28 means that plotting q against f 1 evaluated by eq 29 for a known k 1 should lead to a straight line passing through the origin with a slope equal to q e in other words q e is readily obtained by linear regression based on eq 28 the corresponding coefficient of determination is given by 30 r 2 1 q q e f 1 2 q 1 n q 2 the question then is how to determine k 1 which is required in the evaluation of f 1 by eq 29 we propose that k 1 be determined by a try and error process as the coefficient of determination r 2 in the linear regression step based on eq 28 is dependent on the value of k 1 different values of k 1 would result in different values of r 2 by try and error the best k 1 can be found which gives maximum r 2 to start the try and error process an initial value for k 1 may be obtained by using the half adsorption time t 1 2 defined as the time when q q e 2 estimated from the kinetic data and the following relationship for the pfo model 31 k 1 ln 2 t 1 2 application of the new linear regression method is illustrated in section 3 2 3 2 pso model the pso model eq 4 can be written as 32 q q e f 2 t by defining 33 f 2 t k 2 q e t 1 k 2 q e t then q e is readily obtained by linear regression according to eq 32 like k 1 in the pfo model k 2 q e in eq 33 can also be determined by a try and error process in searching for the maximum coefficient of determination 34 r 2 1 q q e f 2 2 q 1 n q 2 an initial trial value for k 2 q e may be obtained by using the following relationship for the pso model 35 k 2 q e 1 t 1 2 it is noted that once q e and k 2 q e are determined k 2 is easily calculated 2 3 3 vermeulen model the vermeulen model eq 7 may be expressed as 36 q q e f v t by defining 37 f v t 1 e b t q e is then determined by linear regression based on eq 36 and b by a try and error process in maximizing coefficient of determination 38 r 2 1 q q e f v 2 q 1 n q 2 an initial trial value for b may be obtained by using the relationship for the vermeulen model 39 b ln 4 3 t 1 2 2 3 4 elovich model the elovich model eq 10 can be written as 40 q 1 β f e t by defining 41 f e t ln 1 α β t β is then determined by linear regression based on eq 40 and αβ by try and error in obtaining the maximum coefficient of determination 42 r 2 1 q 1 β f e 2 q 1 n q 2 an initial trial value for αβ may be estimated by using the following relationship for the elovich model derived from eq 25 43 α β t 2 q 1 q 2 q 1 t 1 q 2 q 2 q 1 where t 1 q 1 and t 2 q 2 are two kinetic data points a common feature of the new linear regression methods for the pfo the pso the vermeulen and the elovich models is that the adsorbed amount q is used as the regression variable without transformation and thus the original data structure is preserved unlike the traditional linear regression methods furthermore eqs 30 34 38 and 42 show that in the new linear regression methods r 2 for different models can all be expressed as 44 r 2 1 q exp q cal 2 q exp 1 n q exp 2 this means that r 2 for different models can be compared directly unlike the traditional linear regression methods from eq 44 and the definition of rmse eq 27 a simple relationship between r 2 and rmse is obtained for the new linear regression methods this relationship does not exist for the traditional linear regression methods 45 r 2 1 r m s e 2 q exp 1 n q exp 2 n or 46 1 r 2 r m s e q exp 1 n q exp 2 n this means that i the new linear regression methods minimize rmse as a result of maximizing r 2 which is not the case in the traditional linear regression methods ii r 2 or 1 r 2 0 5 as well as rmse can be equivalently used to judge the relative suitability of different models in describing the kinetics of an adsorption system a higher r 2 or a lower 1 r 2 0 5 means a smaller rmse which in turn indicates a better fit in the traditional linear regression methods r 2 or 1 r 2 0 5 cannot be directly compared as it is evaluated differently in different models 3 application 3 1 adsorption of cd2 by modified chitosan the kinetic data for cd2 adsorption from aqueous solutions by modified chitosan at the initial cd2
