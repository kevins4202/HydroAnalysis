2790,exploring the developing characteristics and spatial distribution of fractures and conduits in the karst system is of great significance for utilizing groundwater resources and preventing geological disasters this study took the field of xingfu spring chaohu city china as a target zone three geophysical methods including malm tem and ert were used to disclose the distribution regulation of the karst system based on the geophysical methods results a hydrogeological borehole with a depth of 24 4 m was constructed to observe the structure of stratum then the point velocity probe pvp technique was used to reveal the structure characteristics of stratum in borehole and measure the flow velocity and direction of the karst system finally the tracer test was carried out in the borehole to explore the connection between borehole area and spring system the main results show 1 the extension direction of the karst cave in borehole is about 20 west by south and the direction of spring water flow path is about 30 north by east 2 the groundwater in this karst cave and spring water flow path system has a similar flow direction roughly from northeast to west 3 there is no direct hydraulic connection between the borehole area and the spring water flow path based on the result of the tracer test in this paper the spatial distribution of groundwater in the study area has been successfully revealed based on the ensemble hydrogeological survey technologies the good application of the integrated geophysical method and pvp technique can provide the reliable technology means for researching the spatial distribution and development regulation of groundwater in karst system keywords integrated geophysical methods pvp technique groundwater flow xingfu spring karst system data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction researching the spatial distribution characteristics of karst system is a challenge for regional construction and development due to the strong inhomogeneity and irregularity jiang et al 2021 moreover the flow regulation of groundwater in karst system is very complicated which brings another worldwide issue in hydrogeology field schuler et al 2020 benischke 2021 the development of karst system was controlled by factors including lithology geological structure topography and other factors berkowitz 2002 bauer et al 2016 the space size extension direction and connectivity of fractures and conduits in karst system are affected by various factors presenting the complexity of the karst environments jiang et al 2019 currently a single hydrogeological survey method is insufficient to pinpoint the structural properties of karst systems and the flow regulation of groundwater bu et al 2019 chen et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 further development of the study is required in the aspect of the refinement analysis of karst system structure the technical integration of various methods and the development and application of new technologies groundwater is one of the driving forces promoted the evolution and circulation of karst system qian et al 2017 wang et al 2021 to research the flow regulation of groundwater in the karst system it is the key issue to explore the distribution and development regulation of karst fractures and conduits jiang et al 2020 over the years many hydrogeologists have done a lot of work in the formation evolution and development of karst system through traditional hydrogeological survey methods such as geophysical technology geological drilling and tracer test accumulating a wealth of experience amiel et al 2010 geophysical prospecting methods play a very important role under different hydrogeological environment however each method has its own limitations that present great challenges for exploration in the complex field conditions park et al 2013 therefore how to choose a suitable geophysical prospecting method and a reasonable design scheme is an important procedure for understanding the karst system and improving the interpretation accuracy watlet et al 2018 the geophysical prospecting method has been widely used to research the karst system and has always achieved good results in many fields fores et al 2021 with the advance in science and technology geophysical methods have gradually innovated o connell et al 2018 combining different technologies to analyze karst systems from different attributes is also a valuable technology fusion which has strong universal applicability martel et al 2018 for example the mise à la masse malm method is used to research the conductivity of groundwater to disclose the distribution characteristics of karst system pant 2004 the malm method is feasible in determining the connectivity of the groundwater but it has greatly affected by the uneven resistivity from surrounding rocks soil and topography in addition the malm method is unable to obtain the vertical information of the stratum therefore it is often used in combination with other geophysical methods carlo et al 2013 ling et al 2019 guérin et al 2009 used malm ert magnetic resonance sounding mrs and seismic tomography to study karst systems and evaluate the applicability of each method interpretation of electrical and seismic data indicates that the distribution of limestone medium around the conduit is quite uneven the transient electromagnetic method tem is another commonly used geophysical method the resistivity of the stratum can be obtained from the perspective of an electromagnetic field which can often achieve better results khalil et al 2018 when the tem method is used to find low resistance targets in high resistance surrounding rocks the response of the abnormal area is very sensitive it has a lower requirement on terrain and has a stronger ability of resolution legchenko et al 2009 therefore the tem method has been widely used in hydrogeological exploration zhang et al 2018 have combined the fuzzy evaluation system and geophysical exploration techniques such as tem to improve the accuracy of fracture prediction it has obtained a good understanding in the application of tunnel engineering exploration the electrical resistivity tomography ert methods are often used to reveal the distribution characteristics of the stratum from the aspect of electrical parameters torrese 2020 haslam et al 2014 obtained an image of the spatial distribution of electrical resistivity in a core section with millimeter level accuracy for the first time in the world moreira et al 2019 have proposed a multi azimuth resistivity measurement scheme for the detection of vertical fractures and the continuously rotating electrode device is used to detect the vertical fractures in a narrow area all of these fully illustrate the unique significance of electrical parameters for the study of fractured groundwater in the stratum meyerhoff et al 2014 hydrogeological drilling is another hydrogeology survey method which can determine the location and distribution of karst system and observe the development characteristic of stratum structures it also can provide basic materials for hydrogeological tests on borehole chen et al 2020 as an important hydrogeological test the tracer test has long been used to disclose the hydraulic connection of groundwater in karst areas determine the flow direction of groundwater and calculate the hydraulic parameters of groundwater wu et al 2021 however as the result of indirect observation those data cannot directly show the real change characteristics of groundwater flow sivelle et al 2020 in order to improve the measurement technology of groundwater a new technique referred to here as the point velocity probe pvp equipment was made with a convenient economic and multifunctional tool for streamlining the micrometer scale in field monitor of groundwater flow osorno et al 2018 the moving trajectories of colloidal particles in groundwater were captured by this probe after the data was digitized by a built in compass and an accurate particle tracking measurement device the flow information at a specific depth of the borehole was calculated through statistical methods the measured data is not only used as a single parameter for evaluating the hydrogeological system but is used for real time monitoring of the dynamic flow characteristics of groundwater gibson and devlin 2018 this equipment is of great value in grasping the groundwater flow characteristics in the karst system heyer et al 2021 as far as we know it is the first time that combines the integrated geophysical methods and pvp measurement technique to explore the distribution regulation and flow characteristics of groundwater in karst areas the objective of this paper is to 1 explore the spatial distribution and development regulation of karst system in xingfu spring by comparing the results of integrated geophysical methods 2 reveal the flow characteristic and distribution of groundwater in this karst system by using pvp technique 3 determine the preferential flow paths of the groundwater related to the spring by comprehensive analysis of the results between geophysical methods and tracer test 2 description of the study area the research site of xingfu spring is located 70 km away from eastern hefei city anhui province china the climate of this area belongs to the north humid monsoon subtropical climate with four distinctive seasons this area has abundant rainfall the air temperature of annual average in this area is 15 7 16 1 c and the precipitation of average annual is about 1200 mm the study area is located at the foot on the west side of juzhang mountain and surrounded by mountains on three sides and faced chaohu lake in the south fig 1 the mountains area in the north of chaohu city is located in the northeastern part of the yangtze plate and the eastern side of the tan lu fault zone the strong tectogenesis since the mesozoic period has formed a regional tectonic regime forming three secondary folds as the main tectonic units which are mainly composed of the yufu village syncline the fenghuang mountain anticline and the pingding mountain syncline from east to west the mainly period of strata in this area are silurian s devonian d cambrian c permian p triassic t and jurassic j the indosinian period has the strongest tectogenesis dominated by the direction of nne ssw folds with a series of faults these folds are arranged parallel to each other and the core of the folds is pitched the landform has shown a low mountain landform with an m shaped distribution the field of the xingfu spring belongs to the chaohu drainage basin and is located on the east side of the core of the yufu village syncline the quaternary q system has largely covered the ground with a thickness of about 0 3 m m the stratum lithology is dark gray limestone with a thick layer of the qixia formation p1q in permian bare karst and covered karst are two important types in this area bare bedrocks are commonly found with trench and caves and it has much more fractures on the rock surface in the covered karst layer the evaporation capacity of groundwater has been effectively reduced due to the shielding of the quaternary soil layer a relatively strong karst process has been formed by the long term flow and erosion of groundwater in the bedrock stratum qian et al 2019 it also has formed most karst caves fractures and conduits in the karst system which may cause geological problems such as ground collapse and subsidence the long term tectonic movement has shaped complicated karst system zomlot et al 2015 the aquifers in this karst system mainly include fractures and conduits in carbonate rock the xingfu spring is developed in the limestone of the lower member of p1q as the outflow of the underground karst system this spring is a permanent spring the elevation of this spring is 38 1 m above sea level m and the flow rate is keeping about 20 140 m3 h in addition the spring water flow varies significantly with seasonal precipitation indicating that the spring is a typical descending spring recharged by atmospheric precipitation luo et al 2020 the temperature of the water is relatively stable about 15 23 c the type of water quality is hco3 ca and the value of ph is about 7 1 7 7 overall the water quality is good and can be used for the drinking water supply and agricultural irrigation 3 materials and methods 3 1 integrated geophysical prospecting methods before drilling work geophysical prospecting technologies were performed to disclose the distribution of stratum and karst system some geology and hydrogeology data were collected from reports maps books and field investigations jiang et al 1994 from those materials the malm surveys surface tem and ert methods were applied in the northern of the xingfu spring to research the development of the karst system for the malm method when the surrounding rock is a homogeneous dielectric medium the groundwater in stratum is a better conductor and it can be approximated as an equalizer with equal potentials everywhere perri et al 2018 this method takes the xingfu spring as the target zone based on the electrical characteristic of the stratum to release electrical current so that the electricity spreads throughout the entire aquifers without potential drop then the plane distribution of groundwater flow paths was delineated by measuring the surface potential gradient e the potential gradient method was adopted for data measurement data acquisition was proceeding using the wdjd 4 multifunctional digital electrometer instrument in the working process of this method the power supply electrode of a positive electrode was placed at the spring outflow and the power supply electrode of b negative electrode was placed at a farther position on the north side of this spring four parallel profiles with 24 east by south orientation were arranged on the north side of the spring named line 5 line 10 line 20 and line 30 fig 2 a those profiles were 20 m apart with 5 m apart from the measuring points in each profile and the total length of four lines was 760 m measuring points on each measuring line were sorted from small to large in the direction from west to east when the measurement work starts the electricity is discharged in the spring the electricity i and the potential difference δumn between the two measuring electrodes m and n in the measuring points are transferred to the external computer host and the potential gradient value between the two electrodes is calculated the two measuring electrodes m and n represent two measuring points on the measuring line with 5 m apart then the potential gradient value between each measuring electrode was measured with the way point by point along each measuring lines finally the potential gradient curve on each measuring lines was obtained the formula for calculating the potential gradient is shown in eq 1 since the potential gradient curve of the equalizer with equal potentials everywhere is an asymmetric curve the potential gradient value at the top of the target body is 0 near the edge of the charged body the potential gradient curve drops sharply and the gradient values have an extreme value then the location of the flow paths in the karst system related to the spring can be determined from the point on the potential gradient curve where the value is 0 the specific workload of malm is shown in table 1 1 e δ u mn i mn where mn is the vector value of the distance between the two measuring points for the tem method significant differences were found in permittivity and conductivity between the quaternary soil layer and limestone according to the collected materials the resistivity statistics of the lithological samples were shown in table 2 electromagnetic wave reflection occurs at the interface between the two media due to electromagnetic waves traveling at different speeds then the position of the interface was delineated according to the reflected signal the signal difference of electromagnetic wave reflection was determined by the difference of medium and the degree of rock fragmentation in stratum in the tectonic area data was proceeding using the fctem 60 1 high resolution transient electromagnetic system data was fed back to the transient electromagnetic host through the cl900 coils and the imaging was performed by the analysis from the software then four parallel tem profiles with 24 east by south orientation were arranged on the north side of the spring named line 1 line 2 line 3 and line 4 fig 2b those profiles were 3 m apart with 1 m apart of the measuring points in each profile and the total length of four lines was 48 m measuring points on each measuring line were sorted from small to large in the direction from east to west after the measurement work starts each measuring point in measuring line was measured in turn along the measuring line from east to west using coils each measuring line has twelve measuring points after completing the measurement of the measuring line the data was analyzed and processed on the computer to generate the inversion resistivity profile the specific workload of tem is shown in table 1 for the ert method it is an exploration technology with the way of array method which is based on the electrical difference between the rock and soil according to the distribution regulation of conduction current in the strata under the condition of the released electric field the storage and distribution of geological structures with different resistivity in the strata are identified the intact limestones in the stratum have high resistance which has significantly different electrical properties between the quaternary systems tassy et al 2014 the area with broken rocks mixed with water has low resistivity performance relative to surrounding intact rocks palacios et al 2019 ert equipment uses gd 10 type direct current method measurement system which is composed of gd 10 host and cl 10 two way intelligent cable head the wenner α device is used for data collection based on the construction conditions of this work after the arrangement of electrode is completed the system will achieve the measurement of various electrode arrangements at one time process according to the arrangement sequence of the electrode a m n b a b power supply and m n receiving the electrode distance during the measurement process is keeping am mn nb the distance between the electrodes gradually increases with the distance between the measuring points then one ert profile with 30 north by east orientation was arranged on the east side of the spring named line 6 fig 2a the profiles were 0 5 m apart from the measuring points and the total length of lines was 90 m with 180 electrodes measuring points on this measuring line were sorted from small to large in the direction from north to south after the measurement work starts the corresponding electric signal about strata is processed by the host computer and the obtained various parameters are automatically inverted and imaged through the corresponding program processing this technology can quickly and accurately give the map of geological interpretation about the surveyed strata profile the specific workload of ert is shown in table 1 overall this area has well conditions for three geophysical technologies to apply exploration work of karstic research including malm tem and ert methods 3 2 borehole drilling according to the results of hydrogeological surveys and geophysical prospecting methods the xy 180 drilling machine was used to drill boreholes in this area in order to research the development characteristics of stratum and karst system in the north area of xingfu spring the zk2 well was designed fig 2c it was located in point 3 of line 2 in the tem profiles this point had an obvious abnormal reaction of subsidence and low resistance from geophysical data at depth which was interpreted as the reaction of karst broken zone or cave development in addition this location is the 0 value of the malm method it can be confirmed that this location has some certain connection relationship with the groundwater flow paths of this spring this borehole had a 146 mm inner diameter with a drilling depth of 24 4 m and the elevation of this borehole mouth is 46 2 m above sea level it is 29 9 m away from the outflow of xingfu spring the work was applied to collect the core by using a diamond carbide drill bit in rotary drilling technique 3 3 the pvp technique setting the pvp is a new groundwater monitoring equipment named g o sensor intelligent groundwater monitor this monitoring equipment can be used to monitor groundwater flow velocity and direction as well as observe borehole structures video pipe microscope camera technique is installed on the front end of the probe fig 3 groundwater flow velocity and direction are measured in real time according to the moving trajectories of colloidal particles in the groundwater captured by the microscope the electronic compass built into the probe can accurately locate the flow direction of colloidal particles when the colloidal particles have passed through the lens of the probe they can be captured by a microscope probe with a magnification of 140 times then its electronic image data is transmitted to the computer host through high strength cables and digitally processed and displayed by the system software a high definition surveillance camera is equipped at the bottom of the probe with 720 p resolutions enabling precise placement location of the probe and real time visualization in the borehole the function of this surveillance camera is like the downhole television video device which can observe the geologic structure and karst development in the borehole so as to accurately measure the flow velocity and direction at a certain position the technical parameters of this equipment are detailed in table 3 to reduce the disturbance of the probe to the groundwater environment and improve monitoring efficiency the method of measuring from bottom to top in the borehole was adopted according to the results of the borehole and pvp s bottom hd camera video image four monitoring points were selected in zk2 well before measurement work the probe was placed at the specified position and then starts the measurement process after the groundwater environment was stable for 20 min the measurement time was 30 min after the colloidal particles flowing through the probe were captured those data were transmitted to the computer software when the measurement process has been completed the arithmetic mean value of all data was calculated to obtain the parameter value representing the flow velocity and direction of the measurement point the advantages of this equipment for measuring the groundwater flow velocity and direction are more intuitive high sensitivity and high reliability of measurement results it overcomes the error caused by the indirect measurement method of groundwater flow this technique is also easy to operate 3 4 tracer test design since there is no groundwater exposure position near the study area except the xingfu spring the malm method showed that there was a certain connection between the borehole and the spring so this spring was selected as the receiving point for the tracer in order to further explore the hydraulic connectivity between the xingfu spring and the zk2 well and obtain relevant hydrogeological parameters a tracer test was carried out in zk2 well according to the results of tem and drilling data the tracer was injected into the karst cave at 14 6 m in depth the characteristics of the selected tracer were as followed it is very soluble in water with low background value it does not damage the water ecosystem it is not easily absorbed by soil and surrounding rock it has high sensitivity with relatively low cost therefore industrial salt was selected as the tracer material to determine the connection between spring and borehole by measuring the values of electric connectivity ec and total dissolved solids tds the values of ec and tds were measured by a handheld portable conductivity meter the type of this conductivity meter is hi98130 from hanna instruments the ec and tds values of spring water were measured a week before the experiment it is 0 94 ms cm of ec and 0 47 g l of tds two hundred kilogram kg of industrial salt was dissolved into one ton t of water in a bucket to prepare a saturated solution as a tracer after the test started the tracer was injected at a 0 083 t min speed into the zk2 well at 14 6 m depth using a submersible pump the ec and tds values were continuously measured in the triangular weir at the outflow of xingfu spring and the zk2 well 4 results 4 1 comparative analysis of integrated geophysical prospecting results in order to study the hydrogeological environment of regional karst system this work innovatively combined the three geophysical technologies of malm tem and ert methods the application of integrated geophysical techniques in the xingfu spring field allows studying the structure of the karst system to provide a vision for the construction of hydrological drilling and provide effective guidance for the study of the groundwater flow regulation red areas in the contour diagram of the potential gradient plane of the malm method represent a high potential gradient area and blue areas represent a low potential gradient area fig 4 a fig 4b shows that the changes in potential gradient values between the areas of line 5 to line 10 have obvious fluctuation the changes of positive and negative values on the potential gradient curves between the areas of line 20 to line 30 are relatively stable it indicates that the karst development degree in the area between line 10 to the spring is stronger than that in the areas between line 30 to line 20 the point with value of zero in the potential gradient curve is interpreted as the response of the karst flow paths each profile has some zero value points which means that the karst networks are associated with the xingfu spring the xingfu spring is one of the outcrop points of this karst system and its upstream groundwater flow paths are connected by the fractures and conduits the results of the malm method indicate that the potential channels of this area associated with the spring are mainly distributed between the left area of 1090 point and 1125 1165 point of line 5 the areas between the left side of 1090 point on line 5 and the left side of 1105 point on line 10 were deduced more likely to connect spring based on the results of interpretation by the malm method therefore the tem method was designed in the left area of 1090 point of line 5 due to the large interference of the field this work was carried out by multiple sets of measurements and then a set with better measurements result was selected for explaining the regulation fig 5 the results of the tem method show a low resistivity anomaly at 11 m in the depth of the area between line 1 to line 3 indicating the response of the groundwater in the stratum the low resistance concave anomaly was below 14 m in depth indicating the development of karst caves according to tem results the extension direction of this karst cave is about 20 west by south as shown in the area of the red dotted line in fig 5 in addition the area below 14 m in depth of line 4 was relatively flat with a high resistance value indicating the response of intact limestone it also shows that the southern boundary of the cave is located between line 3 and line 4 based on the interpretation results of tem method it is considered that the point at 3 m in line 2 is the eastern boundary of this karst cave therefore the hydrogeological drilling work of the zk2 well was carried out in this area the results of drilling coring and downhole image have shown that the karst fracture was developed at a depth of 8 10 m section a large karst cave was developed at a depth of 14 18 m section a layer of well sorted gritstone with brown was deposited at a depth of 18 19 m section the karst fracture was developed at a depth of 19 21 m section the limestone with long columnar was developed at a depth of 21 24 4 m section fig 2c the color of the lithology column in fig 2c has represented the color of the core to further reveal the relationship between the borehole and spring one ert profile was arranged on the east side of the spring named line 6 fig 2a and fig 6 there was a low resistance anomaly in the range of 16 27 m with the red dotted box on the left side of line 6 the location of the zk2 well corresponded to the position of about 26 m in the inverted resistivity section it can be seen that zk2 well belongs to this karst system the area within the red dotted box on the right side of fig 6a shows low resistivity anomalies indicating the development of karst system this area is in the direction of the spring s flow path and it is relatively close to the spring the location of the spring corresponds to the position of about 56 m in the inverted resistivity section then it was speculated that this area belongs to the flow path of this spring there was a high resistivity anomaly area between 27 and 40 m in the inverted resistivity section with the black dashed box and it was the response of intact limestone this area has speculated an aquiclude that separates the two karst systems 4 2 the preferential flow direction on borehole in order to reduce the disturbance of the probe to the groundwater environment the four points in different depths of the zk2 well were measured in sequence from bottom to top the value of groundwater flow direction was expressed by degrees where 0 360 means north 90 means east 180 means south and 270 means west the measurement information and vector data of the four locations were shown in table 4 and the measurement results were shown in fig 7 the measurement results of the pvp method show that the probe can effectively obtain the flow information of colloidal particles in the borehole at a specified depth in the few minutes after the measurement started the two parameters changed greatly due to the influence of groundwater flow disturbance by probe after the stabilization of the groundwater flow environment the change of the groundwater flow direction has gradually stable on the whole the value of groundwater flow direction in this borehole fluctuated around 240 however the flow direction at the depth of 15 3 m is much larger than the flow direction at others position this location is the middle position of the karst cave as shown in fig 2c according to the results of the downhole tv video it was found that this place is located on the north side of a limestone rock mass when the groundwater flows here from the north it is blocked by the southern and eastern boundaries of this rock mass resulting in a change of the groundwater flow direction then the groundwater flow direction has changed to the northwest the values of groundwater flow velocity have fluctuated in different depths mostly in the range of 0 12 m d and the flow velocity is relatively slow it also shows that the groundwater flow is in a relatively regular flow in this karst system 4 3 tracer test after the tracer injection into zk2 well the value changes of ec and tds in the spring and zk2 well were continuously monitored among them three monitoring locations have been selected in the zk2 well which were 10 m 15 m and 18 m in depth respectively during the monitoring period there was no significant precipitation in this area after 12 days of continuous monitoring the results showed that the values of ec and tds at 18 m in depth have gradually decreased from the larger abnormal value until restored to the original value on the 28th day the values at 15 m and 10 m in depth also show a gradual recovery from the higher abnormal value to the original value fig 8 the tracer dilution curve in the zk2 well shows that the tds value has the same changing trend as the ec value and the groundwater in this well is in a flowing state however the ec and tds values at the spring outflow have not significantly changed over 12 days and the ec values ranged from 0 88 to 0 94 ms cm and the tds values ranged from 0 44 to 0 47 g l it indicates that there has no obvious connection relationship between the spring system and the borehole area 5 discussions 5 1 identification of groundwater flow in the karst system according to the results of the malm method fig 4 shows that the contour map of potential gradient plane can clearly and intuitively reflect the distribution and extension of the karst system as shown in fig 4a three low potential gradient distribution areas were obtained through this method the area with low potential gradient in the west and middle areas were more closely related to the spring and the area with low potential gradient in the east area was farther away from spring and extends eastward however the results of the tracer tests indicated that the area with low potential gradient between the west and middle areas were not directly connected in the direction between the borehole and the spring therefore it is speculated that those three low potential gradient areas may be connected by fractures or conduits in the north area of line 20 according to the results of malm method the malm results have disclosed the plane extension direction of the karst system to further investigate the plane and vertical distribution regulation of karst structure the tem method was carried out in the low potential gradient area on the west side of line 5 fig 5 shows that four tem profiles have relatively low resistance values in the shallow stratum the low resistance concave anomaly was below 14 m in depth indicating the development of karst caves combined with the drilling data of the zk2 well it was confirmed that karst caves developed in this region fig 2c all these results found that the karst cave developed from east to west on large scale and the area between line 3 to line 4 was the southern boundary of this cave the results of the tem method and drilling were basically the same indicating that the tem method can reveal the spatial structure of karst system and provide a perspective for the study of regional environmental hydrogeology the pvp technique results in fig 7 have shown that the flow direction of groundwater in this cave was about 30 west by south which was roughly consistent with the extension direction of karst caves fig 9 however there was a big difference between this direction and the straight line direction between the borehole and spring tracer test results further confirmed that there was no obvious connection between the spring and the zk2 well it has revealed that the zk2 well area is another karst system different from the spring system the ert result in fig 6 has also revealed the existence of this karst system since the xingfu spring is a typical descending spring the spring outflow was controlled by a fracture with the extension direction of 30 north by east therefore it can be inferred that the low resistance area in the right side red dotted box of the ert profile is the actual flow channel of spring water fig 9 shows that the two red dotted box areas were the actual distribution range of the two karst systems and the arrows represented the flow direction of groundwater in the aquifer the high resistivity and low resistivity zones obtained by the tem and ert methods were used to identify the groundwater flow paths and the geophysical results were compared with the results of pvp technique and tracer test to improve the accuracy of identification taken together the combination of integrated hydrogeological survey methods has effectively improved the interpretation accuracy 5 2 comprehensive analysis of effects of various technologies geophysical exploration technology has been widely used in the karst system it has advantages with non destructive green and intuitive way to obtain geological parameters cueto et al 2018 however the processing of geophysical data has greatly affected by the limitations of the technology and the complexity of field conditions different technologies can recognize the development regulation of hydrogeological structure from multiple perspectives by obtaining different physical properties of the stratum each technology method is effective but also limited to overcome this difficulty integrated geophysical methods are used to analyze and verify interpretation results from different aspects which greatly improve interpretation accuracy and efficiency however how to choose a suitable set of integrated geophysical method has gradually become a hot research topic hussain et al 2020 this work has combined three geophysical technologies including malm tem and ert methods the malm method can directly obtain the plane distribution of karst system related to spring the application of the tem method near the area of zk2 well successfully captured the development scale and extension direction of the karst caves the ert profile has presented the existence of two sets of karst systems the integrated geophysical methods can effectively and intuitively disclose the spatial distribution and development characteristics of karst system in the study area which is a successful combination and application in this work pvp technique was used for the first time to identify the structural characteristics of the karst system and to monitor the flow velocity and direction of groundwater at different depths the location with stable groundwater flow velocity and direction is determined by the main flow direction of groundwater in the stratum the main flow direction of this borehole is about 30 west by south which is consistent with the extension direction of the karst cave interpreted by the geophysical method this technique can directly research the flow regulation of groundwater in the karst system the results of the integral measurement process of pvp technique were presented by computer this measurement method did not cause secondary pollution to the groundwater it can accurately measure the data of groundwater in a specific depth this is an effective technology for detecting groundwater flow however due to the complexity of karst systems this technology should be combined with the measurement results of rock fractures in borehole imaging to obtain a deeper understanding of the karst system except to the application of the above hydrogeological survey technologies the tracer test can disclose the hydraulic connection of between the borehole and the spring it has further identified the complexity and irregularity of the karst system since there is no groundwater exposure position near the study area except the xingfu spring the malm method showed that there was a certain connection between the borehole and the spring so this spring was selected as the receiving point for the tracer however the process of the tracer test was successful but the result has confirmed that there was no straight line connection between the borehole and the spring therefore by comparing and analyzing the results of the tracer test with the results of pvp technology and integrated geophysical methods we have found that there is a set of karst fracture cave system developed in the lower section of borehole which is different from the karst system of spring the combination of pvp technique integrated geophysical methods and tracer test has increased the understanding of the structural characteristics of karst system and the regulations of groundwater flow moreover this study is expected to provide necessary technical support for groundwater utilization and applications in related fields 6 conclusions in this study the distribution and flow characteristics of groundwater in the karst system of xingfu spring were obtained by the integrated geophysical methods drilling the pvp technique and trace test the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the extension direction of preferential flow paths related to the spring was successfully obtained on the plane by the malm method application of the tem method has successfully discovered a set of karst cave in the left area of 1090 point of line 5 by the interpretation result the extension direction of this karst system is about 20 west by south the drilling data and ert results have further revealed the existence of this karst system in addition the extension direction of the water flow path of this spring has been identified with about 30 north by east by ert result the combination of the integrated geophysical method with drilling work can effectively and intuitively explore the spatial distribution and development characteristics of karst system in the study area which is a successful combination and application 2 the pvp technique was applied to the measurement of the karst system for the first time it can accurately measure the flow velocity and direction of different depths in boreholes on the whole the groundwater flow direction of this karst cave in the borehole is about 30 west by south which is consistent with the extension direction of this karst cave interpreted by geophysical methods the geological structure in zk2 well was clearly observed by the downhole video of this equipment

2790,exploring the developing characteristics and spatial distribution of fractures and conduits in the karst system is of great significance for utilizing groundwater resources and preventing geological disasters this study took the field of xingfu spring chaohu city china as a target zone three geophysical methods including malm tem and ert were used to disclose the distribution regulation of the karst system based on the geophysical methods results a hydrogeological borehole with a depth of 24 4 m was constructed to observe the structure of stratum then the point velocity probe pvp technique was used to reveal the structure characteristics of stratum in borehole and measure the flow velocity and direction of the karst system finally the tracer test was carried out in the borehole to explore the connection between borehole area and spring system the main results show 1 the extension direction of the karst cave in borehole is about 20 west by south and the direction of spring water flow path is about 30 north by east 2 the groundwater in this karst cave and spring water flow path system has a similar flow direction roughly from northeast to west 3 there is no direct hydraulic connection between the borehole area and the spring water flow path based on the result of the tracer test in this paper the spatial distribution of groundwater in the study area has been successfully revealed based on the ensemble hydrogeological survey technologies the good application of the integrated geophysical method and pvp technique can provide the reliable technology means for researching the spatial distribution and development regulation of groundwater in karst system keywords integrated geophysical methods pvp technique groundwater flow xingfu spring karst system data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction researching the spatial distribution characteristics of karst system is a challenge for regional construction and development due to the strong inhomogeneity and irregularity jiang et al 2021 moreover the flow regulation of groundwater in karst system is very complicated which brings another worldwide issue in hydrogeology field schuler et al 2020 benischke 2021 the development of karst system was controlled by factors including lithology geological structure topography and other factors berkowitz 2002 bauer et al 2016 the space size extension direction and connectivity of fractures and conduits in karst system are affected by various factors presenting the complexity of the karst environments jiang et al 2019 currently a single hydrogeological survey method is insufficient to pinpoint the structural properties of karst systems and the flow regulation of groundwater bu et al 2019 chen et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 further development of the study is required in the aspect of the refinement analysis of karst system structure the technical integration of various methods and the development and application of new technologies groundwater is one of the driving forces promoted the evolution and circulation of karst system qian et al 2017 wang et al 2021 to research the flow regulation of groundwater in the karst system it is the key issue to explore the distribution and development regulation of karst fractures and conduits jiang et al 2020 over the years many hydrogeologists have done a lot of work in the formation evolution and development of karst system through traditional hydrogeological survey methods such as geophysical technology geological drilling and tracer test accumulating a wealth of experience amiel et al 2010 geophysical prospecting methods play a very important role under different hydrogeological environment however each method has its own limitations that present great challenges for exploration in the complex field conditions park et al 2013 therefore how to choose a suitable geophysical prospecting method and a reasonable design scheme is an important procedure for understanding the karst system and improving the interpretation accuracy watlet et al 2018 the geophysical prospecting method has been widely used to research the karst system and has always achieved good results in many fields fores et al 2021 with the advance in science and technology geophysical methods have gradually innovated o connell et al 2018 combining different technologies to analyze karst systems from different attributes is also a valuable technology fusion which has strong universal applicability martel et al 2018 for example the mise à la masse malm method is used to research the conductivity of groundwater to disclose the distribution characteristics of karst system pant 2004 the malm method is feasible in determining the connectivity of the groundwater but it has greatly affected by the uneven resistivity from surrounding rocks soil and topography in addition the malm method is unable to obtain the vertical information of the stratum therefore it is often used in combination with other geophysical methods carlo et al 2013 ling et al 2019 guérin et al 2009 used malm ert magnetic resonance sounding mrs and seismic tomography to study karst systems and evaluate the applicability of each method interpretation of electrical and seismic data indicates that the distribution of limestone medium around the conduit is quite uneven the transient electromagnetic method tem is another commonly used geophysical method the resistivity of the stratum can be obtained from the perspective of an electromagnetic field which can often achieve better results khalil et al 2018 when the tem method is used to find low resistance targets in high resistance surrounding rocks the response of the abnormal area is very sensitive it has a lower requirement on terrain and has a stronger ability of resolution legchenko et al 2009 therefore the tem method has been widely used in hydrogeological exploration zhang et al 2018 have combined the fuzzy evaluation system and geophysical exploration techniques such as tem to improve the accuracy of fracture prediction it has obtained a good understanding in the application of tunnel engineering exploration the electrical resistivity tomography ert methods are often used to reveal the distribution characteristics of the stratum from the aspect of electrical parameters torrese 2020 haslam et al 2014 obtained an image of the spatial distribution of electrical resistivity in a core section with millimeter level accuracy for the first time in the world moreira et al 2019 have proposed a multi azimuth resistivity measurement scheme for the detection of vertical fractures and the continuously rotating electrode device is used to detect the vertical fractures in a narrow area all of these fully illustrate the unique significance of electrical parameters for the study of fractured groundwater in the stratum meyerhoff et al 2014 hydrogeological drilling is another hydrogeology survey method which can determine the location and distribution of karst system and observe the development characteristic of stratum structures it also can provide basic materials for hydrogeological tests on borehole chen et al 2020 as an important hydrogeological test the tracer test has long been used to disclose the hydraulic connection of groundwater in karst areas determine the flow direction of groundwater and calculate the hydraulic parameters of groundwater wu et al 2021 however as the result of indirect observation those data cannot directly show the real change characteristics of groundwater flow sivelle et al 2020 in order to improve the measurement technology of groundwater a new technique referred to here as the point velocity probe pvp equipment was made with a convenient economic and multifunctional tool for streamlining the micrometer scale in field monitor of groundwater flow osorno et al 2018 the moving trajectories of colloidal particles in groundwater were captured by this probe after the data was digitized by a built in compass and an accurate particle tracking measurement device the flow information at a specific depth of the borehole was calculated through statistical methods the measured data is not only used as a single parameter for evaluating the hydrogeological system but is used for real time monitoring of the dynamic flow characteristics of groundwater gibson and devlin 2018 this equipment is of great value in grasping the groundwater flow characteristics in the karst system heyer et al 2021 as far as we know it is the first time that combines the integrated geophysical methods and pvp measurement technique to explore the distribution regulation and flow characteristics of groundwater in karst areas the objective of this paper is to 1 explore the spatial distribution and development regulation of karst system in xingfu spring by comparing the results of integrated geophysical methods 2 reveal the flow characteristic and distribution of groundwater in this karst system by using pvp technique 3 determine the preferential flow paths of the groundwater related to the spring by comprehensive analysis of the results between geophysical methods and tracer test 2 description of the study area the research site of xingfu spring is located 70 km away from eastern hefei city anhui province china the climate of this area belongs to the north humid monsoon subtropical climate with four distinctive seasons this area has abundant rainfall the air temperature of annual average in this area is 15 7 16 1 c and the precipitation of average annual is about 1200 mm the study area is located at the foot on the west side of juzhang mountain and surrounded by mountains on three sides and faced chaohu lake in the south fig 1 the mountains area in the north of chaohu city is located in the northeastern part of the yangtze plate and the eastern side of the tan lu fault zone the strong tectogenesis since the mesozoic period has formed a regional tectonic regime forming three secondary folds as the main tectonic units which are mainly composed of the yufu village syncline the fenghuang mountain anticline and the pingding mountain syncline from east to west the mainly period of strata in this area are silurian s devonian d cambrian c permian p triassic t and jurassic j the indosinian period has the strongest tectogenesis dominated by the direction of nne ssw folds with a series of faults these folds are arranged parallel to each other and the core of the folds is pitched the landform has shown a low mountain landform with an m shaped distribution the field of the xingfu spring belongs to the chaohu drainage basin and is located on the east side of the core of the yufu village syncline the quaternary q system has largely covered the ground with a thickness of about 0 3 m m the stratum lithology is dark gray limestone with a thick layer of the qixia formation p1q in permian bare karst and covered karst are two important types in this area bare bedrocks are commonly found with trench and caves and it has much more fractures on the rock surface in the covered karst layer the evaporation capacity of groundwater has been effectively reduced due to the shielding of the quaternary soil layer a relatively strong karst process has been formed by the long term flow and erosion of groundwater in the bedrock stratum qian et al 2019 it also has formed most karst caves fractures and conduits in the karst system which may cause geological problems such as ground collapse and subsidence the long term tectonic movement has shaped complicated karst system zomlot et al 2015 the aquifers in this karst system mainly include fractures and conduits in carbonate rock the xingfu spring is developed in the limestone of the lower member of p1q as the outflow of the underground karst system this spring is a permanent spring the elevation of this spring is 38 1 m above sea level m and the flow rate is keeping about 20 140 m3 h in addition the spring water flow varies significantly with seasonal precipitation indicating that the spring is a typical descending spring recharged by atmospheric precipitation luo et al 2020 the temperature of the water is relatively stable about 15 23 c the type of water quality is hco3 ca and the value of ph is about 7 1 7 7 overall the water quality is good and can be used for the drinking water supply and agricultural irrigation 3 materials and methods 3 1 integrated geophysical prospecting methods before drilling work geophysical prospecting technologies were performed to disclose the distribution of stratum and karst system some geology and hydrogeology data were collected from reports maps books and field investigations jiang et al 1994 from those materials the malm surveys surface tem and ert methods were applied in the northern of the xingfu spring to research the development of the karst system for the malm method when the surrounding rock is a homogeneous dielectric medium the groundwater in stratum is a better conductor and it can be approximated as an equalizer with equal potentials everywhere perri et al 2018 this method takes the xingfu spring as the target zone based on the electrical characteristic of the stratum to release electrical current so that the electricity spreads throughout the entire aquifers without potential drop then the plane distribution of groundwater flow paths was delineated by measuring the surface potential gradient e the potential gradient method was adopted for data measurement data acquisition was proceeding using the wdjd 4 multifunctional digital electrometer instrument in the working process of this method the power supply electrode of a positive electrode was placed at the spring outflow and the power supply electrode of b negative electrode was placed at a farther position on the north side of this spring four parallel profiles with 24 east by south orientation were arranged on the north side of the spring named line 5 line 10 line 20 and line 30 fig 2 a those profiles were 20 m apart with 5 m apart from the measuring points in each profile and the total length of four lines was 760 m measuring points on each measuring line were sorted from small to large in the direction from west to east when the measurement work starts the electricity is discharged in the spring the electricity i and the potential difference δumn between the two measuring electrodes m and n in the measuring points are transferred to the external computer host and the potential gradient value between the two electrodes is calculated the two measuring electrodes m and n represent two measuring points on the measuring line with 5 m apart then the potential gradient value between each measuring electrode was measured with the way point by point along each measuring lines finally the potential gradient curve on each measuring lines was obtained the formula for calculating the potential gradient is shown in eq 1 since the potential gradient curve of the equalizer with equal potentials everywhere is an asymmetric curve the potential gradient value at the top of the target body is 0 near the edge of the charged body the potential gradient curve drops sharply and the gradient values have an extreme value then the location of the flow paths in the karst system related to the spring can be determined from the point on the potential gradient curve where the value is 0 the specific workload of malm is shown in table 1 1 e δ u mn i mn where mn is the vector value of the distance between the two measuring points for the tem method significant differences were found in permittivity and conductivity between the quaternary soil layer and limestone according to the collected materials the resistivity statistics of the lithological samples were shown in table 2 electromagnetic wave reflection occurs at the interface between the two media due to electromagnetic waves traveling at different speeds then the position of the interface was delineated according to the reflected signal the signal difference of electromagnetic wave reflection was determined by the difference of medium and the degree of rock fragmentation in stratum in the tectonic area data was proceeding using the fctem 60 1 high resolution transient electromagnetic system data was fed back to the transient electromagnetic host through the cl900 coils and the imaging was performed by the analysis from the software then four parallel tem profiles with 24 east by south orientation were arranged on the north side of the spring named line 1 line 2 line 3 and line 4 fig 2b those profiles were 3 m apart with 1 m apart of the measuring points in each profile and the total length of four lines was 48 m measuring points on each measuring line were sorted from small to large in the direction from east to west after the measurement work starts each measuring point in measuring line was measured in turn along the measuring line from east to west using coils each measuring line has twelve measuring points after completing the measurement of the measuring line the data was analyzed and processed on the computer to generate the inversion resistivity profile the specific workload of tem is shown in table 1 for the ert method it is an exploration technology with the way of array method which is based on the electrical difference between the rock and soil according to the distribution regulation of conduction current in the strata under the condition of the released electric field the storage and distribution of geological structures with different resistivity in the strata are identified the intact limestones in the stratum have high resistance which has significantly different electrical properties between the quaternary systems tassy et al 2014 the area with broken rocks mixed with water has low resistivity performance relative to surrounding intact rocks palacios et al 2019 ert equipment uses gd 10 type direct current method measurement system which is composed of gd 10 host and cl 10 two way intelligent cable head the wenner α device is used for data collection based on the construction conditions of this work after the arrangement of electrode is completed the system will achieve the measurement of various electrode arrangements at one time process according to the arrangement sequence of the electrode a m n b a b power supply and m n receiving the electrode distance during the measurement process is keeping am mn nb the distance between the electrodes gradually increases with the distance between the measuring points then one ert profile with 30 north by east orientation was arranged on the east side of the spring named line 6 fig 2a the profiles were 0 5 m apart from the measuring points and the total length of lines was 90 m with 180 electrodes measuring points on this measuring line were sorted from small to large in the direction from north to south after the measurement work starts the corresponding electric signal about strata is processed by the host computer and the obtained various parameters are automatically inverted and imaged through the corresponding program processing this technology can quickly and accurately give the map of geological interpretation about the surveyed strata profile the specific workload of ert is shown in table 1 overall this area has well conditions for three geophysical technologies to apply exploration work of karstic research including malm tem and ert methods 3 2 borehole drilling according to the results of hydrogeological surveys and geophysical prospecting methods the xy 180 drilling machine was used to drill boreholes in this area in order to research the development characteristics of stratum and karst system in the north area of xingfu spring the zk2 well was designed fig 2c it was located in point 3 of line 2 in the tem profiles this point had an obvious abnormal reaction of subsidence and low resistance from geophysical data at depth which was interpreted as the reaction of karst broken zone or cave development in addition this location is the 0 value of the malm method it can be confirmed that this location has some certain connection relationship with the groundwater flow paths of this spring this borehole had a 146 mm inner diameter with a drilling depth of 24 4 m and the elevation of this borehole mouth is 46 2 m above sea level it is 29 9 m away from the outflow of xingfu spring the work was applied to collect the core by using a diamond carbide drill bit in rotary drilling technique 3 3 the pvp technique setting the pvp is a new groundwater monitoring equipment named g o sensor intelligent groundwater monitor this monitoring equipment can be used to monitor groundwater flow velocity and direction as well as observe borehole structures video pipe microscope camera technique is installed on the front end of the probe fig 3 groundwater flow velocity and direction are measured in real time according to the moving trajectories of colloidal particles in the groundwater captured by the microscope the electronic compass built into the probe can accurately locate the flow direction of colloidal particles when the colloidal particles have passed through the lens of the probe they can be captured by a microscope probe with a magnification of 140 times then its electronic image data is transmitted to the computer host through high strength cables and digitally processed and displayed by the system software a high definition surveillance camera is equipped at the bottom of the probe with 720 p resolutions enabling precise placement location of the probe and real time visualization in the borehole the function of this surveillance camera is like the downhole television video device which can observe the geologic structure and karst development in the borehole so as to accurately measure the flow velocity and direction at a certain position the technical parameters of this equipment are detailed in table 3 to reduce the disturbance of the probe to the groundwater environment and improve monitoring efficiency the method of measuring from bottom to top in the borehole was adopted according to the results of the borehole and pvp s bottom hd camera video image four monitoring points were selected in zk2 well before measurement work the probe was placed at the specified position and then starts the measurement process after the groundwater environment was stable for 20 min the measurement time was 30 min after the colloidal particles flowing through the probe were captured those data were transmitted to the computer software when the measurement process has been completed the arithmetic mean value of all data was calculated to obtain the parameter value representing the flow velocity and direction of the measurement point the advantages of this equipment for measuring the groundwater flow velocity and direction are more intuitive high sensitivity and high reliability of measurement results it overcomes the error caused by the indirect measurement method of groundwater flow this technique is also easy to operate 3 4 tracer test design since there is no groundwater exposure position near the study area except the xingfu spring the malm method showed that there was a certain connection between the borehole and the spring so this spring was selected as the receiving point for the tracer in order to further explore the hydraulic connectivity between the xingfu spring and the zk2 well and obtain relevant hydrogeological parameters a tracer test was carried out in zk2 well according to the results of tem and drilling data the tracer was injected into the karst cave at 14 6 m in depth the characteristics of the selected tracer were as followed it is very soluble in water with low background value it does not damage the water ecosystem it is not easily absorbed by soil and surrounding rock it has high sensitivity with relatively low cost therefore industrial salt was selected as the tracer material to determine the connection between spring and borehole by measuring the values of electric connectivity ec and total dissolved solids tds the values of ec and tds were measured by a handheld portable conductivity meter the type of this conductivity meter is hi98130 from hanna instruments the ec and tds values of spring water were measured a week before the experiment it is 0 94 ms cm of ec and 0 47 g l of tds two hundred kilogram kg of industrial salt was dissolved into one ton t of water in a bucket to prepare a saturated solution as a tracer after the test started the tracer was injected at a 0 083 t min speed into the zk2 well at 14 6 m depth using a submersible pump the ec and tds values were continuously measured in the triangular weir at the outflow of xingfu spring and the zk2 well 4 results 4 1 comparative analysis of integrated geophysical prospecting results in order to study the hydrogeological environment of regional karst system this work innovatively combined the three geophysical technologies of malm tem and ert methods the application of integrated geophysical techniques in the xingfu spring field allows studying the structure of the karst system to provide a vision for the construction of hydrological drilling and provide effective guidance for the study of the groundwater flow regulation red areas in the contour diagram of the potential gradient plane of the malm method represent a high potential gradient area and blue areas represent a low potential gradient area fig 4 a fig 4b shows that the changes in potential gradient values between the areas of line 5 to line 10 have obvious fluctuation the changes of positive and negative values on the potential gradient curves between the areas of line 20 to line 30 are relatively stable it indicates that the karst development degree in the area between line 10 to the spring is stronger than that in the areas between line 30 to line 20 the point with value of zero in the potential gradient curve is interpreted as the response of the karst flow paths each profile has some zero value points which means that the karst networks are associated with the xingfu spring the xingfu spring is one of the outcrop points of this karst system and its upstream groundwater flow paths are connected by the fractures and conduits the results of the malm method indicate that the potential channels of this area associated with the spring are mainly distributed between the left area of 1090 point and 1125 1165 point of line 5 the areas between the left side of 1090 point on line 5 and the left side of 1105 point on line 10 were deduced more likely to connect spring based on the results of interpretation by the malm method therefore the tem method was designed in the left area of 1090 point of line 5 due to the large interference of the field this work was carried out by multiple sets of measurements and then a set with better measurements result was selected for explaining the regulation fig 5 the results of the tem method show a low resistivity anomaly at 11 m in the depth of the area between line 1 to line 3 indicating the response of the groundwater in the stratum the low resistance concave anomaly was below 14 m in depth indicating the development of karst caves according to tem results the extension direction of this karst cave is about 20 west by south as shown in the area of the red dotted line in fig 5 in addition the area below 14 m in depth of line 4 was relatively flat with a high resistance value indicating the response of intact limestone it also shows that the southern boundary of the cave is located between line 3 and line 4 based on the interpretation results of tem method it is considered that the point at 3 m in line 2 is the eastern boundary of this karst cave therefore the hydrogeological drilling work of the zk2 well was carried out in this area the results of drilling coring and downhole image have shown that the karst fracture was developed at a depth of 8 10 m section a large karst cave was developed at a depth of 14 18 m section a layer of well sorted gritstone with brown was deposited at a depth of 18 19 m section the karst fracture was developed at a depth of 19 21 m section the limestone with long columnar was developed at a depth of 21 24 4 m section fig 2c the color of the lithology column in fig 2c has represented the color of the core to further reveal the relationship between the borehole and spring one ert profile was arranged on the east side of the spring named line 6 fig 2a and fig 6 there was a low resistance anomaly in the range of 16 27 m with the red dotted box on the left side of line 6 the location of the zk2 well corresponded to the position of about 26 m in the inverted resistivity section it can be seen that zk2 well belongs to this karst system the area within the red dotted box on the right side of fig 6a shows low resistivity anomalies indicating the development of karst system this area is in the direction of the spring s flow path and it is relatively close to the spring the location of the spring corresponds to the position of about 56 m in the inverted resistivity section then it was speculated that this area belongs to the flow path of this spring there was a high resistivity anomaly area between 27 and 40 m in the inverted resistivity section with the black dashed box and it was the response of intact limestone this area has speculated an aquiclude that separates the two karst systems 4 2 the preferential flow direction on borehole in order to reduce the disturbance of the probe to the groundwater environment the four points in different depths of the zk2 well were measured in sequence from bottom to top the value of groundwater flow direction was expressed by degrees where 0 360 means north 90 means east 180 means south and 270 means west the measurement information and vector data of the four locations were shown in table 4 and the measurement results were shown in fig 7 the measurement results of the pvp method show that the probe can effectively obtain the flow information of colloidal particles in the borehole at a specified depth in the few minutes after the measurement started the two parameters changed greatly due to the influence of groundwater flow disturbance by probe after the stabilization of the groundwater flow environment the change of the groundwater flow direction has gradually stable on the whole the value of groundwater flow direction in this borehole fluctuated around 240 however the flow direction at the depth of 15 3 m is much larger than the flow direction at others position this location is the middle position of the karst cave as shown in fig 2c according to the results of the downhole tv video it was found that this place is located on the north side of a limestone rock mass when the groundwater flows here from the north it is blocked by the southern and eastern boundaries of this rock mass resulting in a change of the groundwater flow direction then the groundwater flow direction has changed to the northwest the values of groundwater flow velocity have fluctuated in different depths mostly in the range of 0 12 m d and the flow velocity is relatively slow it also shows that the groundwater flow is in a relatively regular flow in this karst system 4 3 tracer test after the tracer injection into zk2 well the value changes of ec and tds in the spring and zk2 well were continuously monitored among them three monitoring locations have been selected in the zk2 well which were 10 m 15 m and 18 m in depth respectively during the monitoring period there was no significant precipitation in this area after 12 days of continuous monitoring the results showed that the values of ec and tds at 18 m in depth have gradually decreased from the larger abnormal value until restored to the original value on the 28th day the values at 15 m and 10 m in depth also show a gradual recovery from the higher abnormal value to the original value fig 8 the tracer dilution curve in the zk2 well shows that the tds value has the same changing trend as the ec value and the groundwater in this well is in a flowing state however the ec and tds values at the spring outflow have not significantly changed over 12 days and the ec values ranged from 0 88 to 0 94 ms cm and the tds values ranged from 0 44 to 0 47 g l it indicates that there has no obvious connection relationship between the spring system and the borehole area 5 discussions 5 1 identification of groundwater flow in the karst system according to the results of the malm method fig 4 shows that the contour map of potential gradient plane can clearly and intuitively reflect the distribution and extension of the karst system as shown in fig 4a three low potential gradient distribution areas were obtained through this method the area with low potential gradient in the west and middle areas were more closely related to the spring and the area with low potential gradient in the east area was farther away from spring and extends eastward however the results of the tracer tests indicated that the area with low potential gradient between the west and middle areas were not directly connected in the direction between the borehole and the spring therefore it is speculated that those three low potential gradient areas may be connected by fractures or conduits in the north area of line 20 according to the results of malm method the malm results have disclosed the plane extension direction of the karst system to further investigate the plane and vertical distribution regulation of karst structure the tem method was carried out in the low potential gradient area on the west side of line 5 fig 5 shows that four tem profiles have relatively low resistance values in the shallow stratum the low resistance concave anomaly was below 14 m in depth indicating the development of karst caves combined with the drilling data of the zk2 well it was confirmed that karst caves developed in this region fig 2c all these results found that the karst cave developed from east to west on large scale and the area between line 3 to line 4 was the southern boundary of this cave the results of the tem method and drilling were basically the same indicating that the tem method can reveal the spatial structure of karst system and provide a perspective for the study of regional environmental hydrogeology the pvp technique results in fig 7 have shown that the flow direction of groundwater in this cave was about 30 west by south which was roughly consistent with the extension direction of karst caves fig 9 however there was a big difference between this direction and the straight line direction between the borehole and spring tracer test results further confirmed that there was no obvious connection between the spring and the zk2 well it has revealed that the zk2 well area is another karst system different from the spring system the ert result in fig 6 has also revealed the existence of this karst system since the xingfu spring is a typical descending spring the spring outflow was controlled by a fracture with the extension direction of 30 north by east therefore it can be inferred that the low resistance area in the right side red dotted box of the ert profile is the actual flow channel of spring water fig 9 shows that the two red dotted box areas were the actual distribution range of the two karst systems and the arrows represented the flow direction of groundwater in the aquifer the high resistivity and low resistivity zones obtained by the tem and ert methods were used to identify the groundwater flow paths and the geophysical results were compared with the results of pvp technique and tracer test to improve the accuracy of identification taken together the combination of integrated hydrogeological survey methods has effectively improved the interpretation accuracy 5 2 comprehensive analysis of effects of various technologies geophysical exploration technology has been widely used in the karst system it has advantages with non destructive green and intuitive way to obtain geological parameters cueto et al 2018 however the processing of geophysical data has greatly affected by the limitations of the technology and the complexity of field conditions different technologies can recognize the development regulation of hydrogeological structure from multiple perspectives by obtaining different physical properties of the stratum each technology method is effective but also limited to overcome this difficulty integrated geophysical methods are used to analyze and verify interpretation results from different aspects which greatly improve interpretation accuracy and efficiency however how to choose a suitable set of integrated geophysical method has gradually become a hot research topic hussain et al 2020 this work has combined three geophysical technologies including malm tem and ert methods the malm method can directly obtain the plane distribution of karst system related to spring the application of the tem method near the area of zk2 well successfully captured the development scale and extension direction of the karst caves the ert profile has presented the existence of two sets of karst systems the integrated geophysical methods can effectively and intuitively disclose the spatial distribution and development characteristics of karst system in the study area which is a successful combination and application in this work pvp technique was used for the first time to identify the structural characteristics of the karst system and to monitor the flow velocity and direction of groundwater at different depths the location with stable groundwater flow velocity and direction is determined by the main flow direction of groundwater in the stratum the main flow direction of this borehole is about 30 west by south which is consistent with the extension direction of the karst cave interpreted by the geophysical method this technique can directly research the flow regulation of groundwater in the karst system the results of the integral measurement process of pvp technique were presented by computer this measurement method did not cause secondary pollution to the groundwater it can accurately measure the data of groundwater in a specific depth this is an effective technology for detecting groundwater flow however due to the complexity of karst systems this technology should be combined with the measurement results of rock fractures in borehole imaging to obtain a deeper understanding of the karst system except to the application of the above hydrogeological survey technologies the tracer test can disclose the hydraulic connection of between the borehole and the spring it has further identified the complexity and irregularity of the karst system since there is no groundwater exposure position near the study area except the xingfu spring the malm method showed that there was a certain connection between the borehole and the spring so this spring was selected as the receiving point for the tracer however the process of the tracer test was successful but the result has confirmed that there was no straight line connection between the borehole and the spring therefore by comparing and analyzing the results of the tracer test with the results of pvp technology and integrated geophysical methods we have found that there is a set of karst fracture cave system developed in the lower section of borehole which is different from the karst system of spring the combination of pvp technique integrated geophysical methods and tracer test has increased the understanding of the structural characteristics of karst system and the regulations of groundwater flow moreover this study is expected to provide necessary technical support for groundwater utilization and applications in related fields 6 conclusions in this study the distribution and flow characteristics of groundwater in the karst system of xingfu spring were obtained by the integrated geophysical methods drilling the pvp technique and trace test the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the extension direction of preferential flow paths related to the spring was successfully obtained on the plane by the malm method application of the tem method has successfully discovered a set of karst cave in the left area of 1090 point of line 5 by the interpretation result the extension direction of this karst system is about 20 west by south the drilling data and ert results have further revealed the existence of this karst system in addition the extension direction of the water flow path of this spring has been identified with about 30 north by east by ert result the combination of the integrated geophysical method with drilling work can effectively and intuitively explore the spatial distribution and development characteristics of karst system in the study area which is a successful combination and application 2 the pvp technique was applied to the measurement of the karst system for the first time it can accurately measure the flow velocity and direction of different depths in boreholes on the whole the groundwater flow direction of this karst cave in the borehole is about 30 west by south which is consistent with the extension direction of this karst cave interpreted by geophysical methods the geological structure in zk2 well was clearly observed by the downhole video of this equipment therefore this pvp technique has provided an effective reference for the identification of karst system structure and groundwater flow regulations 3 there was no connection relationship between the karst systems in the zk2 well and the spring water flow path based on the result of the tracer test those two sets of karst systems in the study area have a similar flow direction of groundwater roughly from northeast to west the application of pvp technique has demonstrated unique capabilities results of this research further verify the feasibility of integrated geophysical methods and pvp

2791,reference evapotranspiration et0 is usually employed for estimating actual crop et together with crop coefficients kc however it is necessary to explore an alternative model to estimate et0 concisely because of numerous limitations in the penman monteith method to improve the et0 estimation accuracy using limited meteorological data this study developed a novel hybrid deep learning model d lstm based on the meteorological data during 1961 2020 observed at fifty stations on the loess plateau which used the deep belief network dbn module to extract features from meteorological data and the long short term memory lstm module to expand time features and process data information with sequential features respectively based on the comparative evaluation of et0 estimation accuracy between the d lstm dbn lstm and nine empirical models the results drawn from this study demonstrated that the d lstm model manifested the best performance as rh based rn based and t based et0 estimating models for local strategy the value of r2 nse rmse mape and gpi ranging 0 941 0 020 0 940 0 032 0 436 0 457 mm d 1 0 150 0 016 and 1 611 0 180 for d lstm1 rh based 0 944 0 030 0 943 0 037 0 423 0 313

rmse mape and gpi were 0 874 0 872 0 651 mm d 1 0 159 and 1 837 for d lstm1 0 894 0 892 0 591 mm d 1 0 138 and 2 000 for d lstm2 and 0 839 0 827 0 768 mm d 1 0 212 and 1 482 for d lstm3 following the lstm performed better than dbn for local strategy but vice versa for external strategy despite dl models outperforming rh based and rn based empirical models hs outperformed the dbn3 for local strategy and was superior to lstm3 for external strategy under limited meteorological data the rn based et0 estimating models are superior to rh based and t based models and rh based achieved better accuracy than t based for dl models but vice versa for empirical models there is significant spatial variability in the accuracy of daily et0 models but the high precision of the d lstm was stable on the loess plateau overall the d lstm model which combines the advantages of dbn and lstm is the most recommended et0 model using incomplete meteorological data on the loess plateau which is very helpful for farmers or irrigation system operators to improve their irrigation scheduling keywords empirical model hybrid deep learning model deep belief network long short term memory k fold cross validation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as an essential component in eco hydrological processes evapotranspiration et plays a crucial role in agricultural water meticulous management in general direct measurement of et is less practicability high commission and time consuming consequently reference evapotranspiration et0 is introduced for estimating actual crop et combined with crop coefficients kc et0 is defined as the rate of et from a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 the fao 56 penman monteith equation p m represents the most widely accepted standard method for estimating et0 chen et al 2020b fan et al 2021a hadria et al 2021 martí et al 2015 however the p m method requires many meteorological data which limit its more comprehensive application especially in developing countries feng et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to develop an alternative simple model for accurately estimating et0 with reasonable precision and high stability using fewer meteorological data previous empirical et0 models can be classified as radiation based humidity based temperature based and combination methods according to the development philosophy and meteorological features humidity based radiation based and temperature based models have been widely studied for estimating et0 using incomplete meteorological data however empirical models can vary significantly in terms of performance because of the model assumptions and data requirements xu and singh 2000 evaluated eight radiation based equations for estimating et0 in switzerland and the results showed that the makkink mak and modified priestley taylor p t agreed most closely with pan evaporation valipour 2014 compared eleven temperature based models to detect the best model in iran and the results showed that the modified hargreaves hs models estimate the et0 better than other models the humidity based models mainly include the romanenko rom romanenko 1961 dalton celestin et al 2020 and schendel sch djaman et al 2015 models which are also commonly used to calculate et0 however empirical based et0 models generally include multivariate nonlinear relations based on numerous assumptions and principles the performance of these mathematical models is seriously influenced by model uncertainty associated with model structure model parameters and measurement noise consequently it is challenging to establish accurate empirical models representing the underlying et0 processes with the rapid development of computer computing power cp and artificial intelligence ai theory empirical models have been improved or replaced by artificial intelligence methods despite the original version of the empirical models optimized by swarm intelligence algorithms chia et al 2021 valle júnior et al 2020 machine learning models ml have achieved success at estimating et0 using incomplete meteorological data compared to various empirical models due to its black box characteristics gocic et al 2016 employed the adjusted hs p t turc and extreme learning machine elm for modeling et0 in serbia and the result revealed that the elm could be an alternative for the et0 estimation feng et al 2017b developed two ai models for daily et0 estimation only with temperature data in southwest china and the result shows that the temperature based grnn generalized regression neural network and elm models are appropriate alternatives for accurate et0 estimation as a cutting edge technology of ml recent years have witnessed a booming development of deep learning models dl in many domains ben yahia et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 attribute to its efficient ability for big data mining starting from the basic multi layer perceptron mlp researchers have proposed various dl models which can be generally subdivided into recurrent neural networks rnn deep neural network dnn and convolutional neural networks cnn sporadic reports hitherto have begun to focus on rnn models applied for et0 estimation the rnn which mainly includes the long short term memory lstm improved the processing ability of time series data by connecting the hidden layer nodes and proposing the output of the last time hidden layer as the input of the hidden layer cagcag yolcu et al 2021 sattari et al 2021 used lstm models to estimate et0 in different combinations and the results showed that the lstm model predicted et0 amounts with acceptable accuracy granata and di nunno 2021 selected lstm to predict the short term ahead et in america and the result showed that the model provided accurate predictions but the performance can be affected by local climatic conditions however rnn sacrifices a large amount of computing power to avoid long term dependence which can be effectively remedied by dbn models although many dl models have been successfully applied to et0 estimation chen et al 2020b elbeltagi et al 2020 fan et al 2021b saggi and jain 2019 little research has been reported on the application of dbn as most mainstream dnn models the classic dbn model is composed of feature extractors formed by stacking multiple restricted boltzmann machines rbms and a single layer of bp neural network which effectively solves the problem of the slow training speed of large artificial neural networks hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 chen et al 2012 proposed the dbn model to predict the drought event in the huaihe river basin of china and the dbn based drought prediction model has shown better predictive skills than the back propagation neural network bp for the different time scale standardized precipitation index spi moreover dbn models are usually applied as a feature extractor combined with other models which can effectively reduce the dimension and remove the noise of the original input data shuaishuai et al 2018 combined the dbn with least squares support vector regression lssvm to establish a prediction model for the transpiration rate of strawberry leaves in a solar greenhouse and the dbn was used to eliminate the correlation of environmental variables dimension reduction the results showed that the prediction accuracy and regression fitting degree of dbn lssvm was significantly superior to the original version of lssvm chen et al 2022 coupled the p m formula into the dbn and subsequently they insisted that the hybrid dbn model could be adopted to generate continuous et datasets wang et al 2022 proposed the dbn to predict atmospheric visibility in short and long term sequences and the results showed the dbn was significantly superior to the bp and cnn although the performance of the dbn model is proven to be better than the other models in most cases it is inclined to fall into the trap of local optimal solution and gradient disappearance when dealing with long time series problems because of the deepening of neural network layers which is regarded as the main constraint in its applications çakıroğlu et al 2021 shang et al 2021 as mentioned above the distinct advantages and disadvantages of the dbn and lstm are complementary in solving the complex nonlinear system problem with time series characteristics however few reports hitherto make an effort to coupled dbn with lstm for et0 estimation using limited meteorological data therefore it is of great significance to apply the hybrid dl model which consists of dbn and lstm for et0 estimation in consideration of its characteristic of multivariate nonlinear and time series and the objectives of the present study were to 1 reveal the spatiotemporal variation patterns of meteorological variables and et0 2 establish the hybrid deep learning model i e d lstm by composing dbn and lstm to improve the estimating accuracy of et0 3 comparative evaluate the accuracy performance between empirical models dl models and hybrid dl model in et0 simulation for two k fold cross validation strategies 4 assess the spatial accuracy performance of et0 estimating models using limited meteorological data on the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the loess plateau is located in the northwest of china 100 54 114 33e 33 43 41 16 n and covers approximately 640 000 km2 fig 1 as a transition zone from semi humid area to arid area the region is a water limited landscape and annual precipitation varied from 142 mm in the southeast to 809 mm in the northwest with an average value of 420 mm the et accounts for 85 of the precipitation with an average value of 1094 mm and this percentage increases along the precipitation gradient wang et al 2020 despite providing excellent photo thermal conditions regional agricultural production potential is seriously limited by insufficient water resources therefore it is crucial to estimate the reference evapotranspiration accurately and efficiently on the loess plateau table s1 in the supplementary material provides information for specific national standard meteorological stations the daily meteorological data during 1961 2020 including maximum minimum and average air temperature tmax tmin tmean wind speed at 2 m u2 relative humidity rh sunshine duration n were retrieved from the national climatic centre of the china meteorological administration cma considering the discontinuous observation data and station relocation the criteria for selecting meteorological stations in this study were the missing measurements of each station should not be longer than 90 days and the continuous missing measurements of each station should not be longer than 7 days 2 2 penman monteith the penman monteith model was used to calculate reference evapotranspiration as the

accuracy difference between the simple empirical methods and dnn models in substituting for p m under the limited meteorological features this study tested three humidity based three radiation based and three temperature based empirical models for estimating et0 respectively on the loess plateau 2 3 1 humidity based the humidity based model also known as the mass transfer model can simplify the simulation of the water and heat transfer process for evapotranspiration which is one of the most widely used models to estimate et0 the common humidity based model are modified baier robertson model baier 1971 rohwer model rohwer 1931 and romanenko model romanenko 1961 which were described as follows baier 1971 modified the b r model by introducing saturated water vapor pressure and actual water

as a typical humidity based empirical et0 model 4 e t 0 4 5 1 t mean 25 2 1 e a e s 2 3 2 radiation based about 80 of et0 might be explained by temperature and solar radiation priestley and taylor 1972 samani 2000 and many radiation based et0 models which used radiation and temperature data could estimate et0 accurately tabari et al 2013 feng et al 2016 in the current study the makkink model makkink 1957 priestley taylor model priestley and taylor 1972 and irmak model irmak et al 2003 were selected to represent radiation based empirical et0 models as follows the makkink equation eq 5 has been applied worldwide to estimate et0 based on radiation which was commonly considered to be the closest to the p m method 5 e t 0 a δ δ λ r s 2 45 b where rs is the total ground radiation mj mm 2 d

2 3 3 temperature based air temperature is the most accessible meteorological data which was measured by more than 2400 national stations in china currently temperature based empirical models had proven their potential for estimating et0 using the least data in the current study the hargreaves samani model hargreaves and samani 1985 the baier robertson model baier and robertson 1965 and the oudin model oudin et al 2005 were selected to represent temperature based empirical et0 models as follows hargreaves and samani 1985 firstly put forward an equation eq 8 that estimates et0 from

3 2 4 deep learning models the long short term memory network improved with multiple restricted boltzmann machines d lstm developed in this study is a hybrid deep learning model comprising deep belief network dbn and long short term memory network lstm in the d lstm model the dbn module is used to extract features from meteorological data and the lstm module is applied to expand time features and process data information with sequential features progressive by time series the d lstm model produces time series of dependent meteorological input data variables in the complex nonlinear system the mathematical process of the d lstm model refers to the dbn module and lstm module as follows and their structures are shown in fig 2 a dbn module dbn is a probability model proposed by hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 which is generally composed of multiple restricted boltzmann machines rbms to extract features and of the bp model to do regression analysis as shown in fig 2b each rbm contains a hidden layer h and a visible layer v for an m layer dbn model the hidden layer of the previous rbm is the visible layer of the next rbm and the first visible layer v0 and the last hidden layer hm is the input and output layer of the dbn model respectively the energy function for the joint distribution of the visible layer unit and the hidden layer unit is as follows 11 e v h i 1 n j 1 m w ij v i

schmidhuber 1997 comprises a set of recurrently connected memory blocks to solve the gradient explosion and disappearance problem when rnn processes long time series data as shown in fig 2c each memory block is composed of input gate forget gate update gate and output gate which control the information accumulation speed by judging whether the information meets the requirements so as to avoid long term dependence the mathematical framework of the lstm model is shown as follows input gate it input gate is responsible for determining whether the input value h m t i e the features extracted by dbn should be used to update the state st of the current memory block on the one hand the sigmoid activation function is responsible for determining the output value yt of the current memory block on the other hand the tanh activation function is responsible for creating a candidate vector ut of the current memory block and the updated gate determines whether it should be added to the state st of the current memory block the calculation principle of the update gate is shown in the following formula 16 i t σ w i y t 1 h m t b i 17 u t tanh w c y t 1 h m t b c forget gate ft the sigmoid activation function reads the output value yt 1 of the old memory block and the input value h m t of the current memory block combined with the paranoid vector and the corresponding weight to determine whether the state st of the current memory block should be retained the calculation principle of the forget gate is shown as follows 18 f t σ w f y t 1 h m t b f update gate ut update gate determines whether the current memory block should update the state of the old cell from st 1 to st by multiplying the forget gate and the input gate the principle of the update gate is as follows 19 s t f t s t 1 i t u i output gate ot output gate is responsible for calculating the output value yt of the current memory block the output gate runs the sigmoid activation function to determine whether to output the current memory block state by judging the output value of the old cell and the input value of the current memory block then the current memory block state st is processed by the tanh activation function and multiplied by the output ot of the sigmoid activation function to finally determine the output value yt in the current memory block the principle of the output gate is shown as follows 20 o t σ w o y t 1 h m t b o 21 y t o t tanh s t where w represents the corresponding weight b represents the corresponding paranoid vector σ represents the sigmoid activation function tanh represents the hyperbolic tangent activation function training process and hyper parameters the number of hidden neurons in the d lstm model was determined by the sequence length of the time series lstm module and each hidden neuron with three hidden rbn layers dbn module the pre training stage and fine tuning stage were included in the training process of the d lstm model rbms can efficiently pre train the initial weights of the networks and then the fine tuning stage was carried out to slightly adjust the weights of the whole d lstm model the learning algorithm and fine tuning procedure enable d lstm to achieve high performance and avoid over fitting kuremoto et al 2014 in the pre training stage the learning rate and max training epoch of rbns are initialized at 0 01 and 100 and then the layer by layer network training methods are used one layer of rbm is used to train each time and the output result is used as the input layer to the next rbm when fine tuning the full d lstm model the initial training rate was set at 0 01 and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm sgd was used to fine tune the parameters i e the learning rate decayed by half when the error at the lstm output layer in this epoch was larger than that in last epoch the training halted when the learning rate was smaller than 10 6 2 5 model implementation in this study the empirical models were calibrated by the least square method kovoor and nandagiri 2007 under local external k fold cross validation strategies shiri et al 2014a shiri et al 2014b and the special value of parameters at fifty meteorological stations were listed in table s2 then we established rh based rn based and t based dl models according to the limited meteorological features used in the empirical models and the dl models were tested under two k fold cross validation strategies equally table 1 summarizes the input variables input combinations and model abbreviation of the dl models the procedures of the two k fold cross validation strategies were 1 local k fold cross validation strategy for division ratio between the training dataset and test dataset of dl models is 8 2 generally jiang et al 2022 the local meteorological data 60 years of each meteorological station were separated into five equal periods chronologically where one period 12 years was used for testing and the other four periods 48 years for training calibrating zhang et al 2019 2 external k fold cross validation strategy the models were tested in each meteorological station and trained calibrated using the external meteorological data from all other stations on the loess plateau shiri et al 2019 finally the average of estimation accuracy results is taken as the evaluation basis of et0 estimating models for two k fold cross

between the dl and empirical models the statistical accuracy indicators of mbr dbn1 lstm1 and d lstm1 were compared in this study compared to mbr all dl models performed better and d lstm1 achieved the best with values of r2 nse rmse mape and gpi were 0 941 0 020 0 940 0 032 0 436 0 457 mm d 1 0 150 0 016 and 1 611 0 180 in terms of r2 mbr dbn1 and lstm1 models decreased by 12 86 5 84 and 1 49

all rh based empirical models decreased from southwest to northeast whilst nse and mape values of mbr showed the same variation pattern in terms of nse and mape obtained by roh the values showed a significant gradient descent from northwest to southeast regarding the rom model the spatial variations of nse values have the same varying tendency with roh while the mape values increased from southwest to northwest and southeast in terms of nse obtained by roh and rom the values showed a significant gradient descent from northwest to southeast regionally the lowest rmse values of rh based empirical models occurred in the middle of the loess plateau and grew to the west and east border fig 5d f showed that the regional performance of rh based dl models was significantly superior to the empirical models despite the consistent variation pattern of r2 values with empirical models the nse mape and rmse values obtained by rh based dl models exhibited a west high and east low feature fig 5f showed that the d lstm1 performed stalely with better accuracy in the whole region and the corresponding values of r2 and nse were higher than 0 92 and 0 90 and the value of rmse and mape was lower than 0 8 mm d 1 and 0 12 in short the performance of rh based dl models was significantly superior to the empirical models across the region and the d lstm1 was the most recommended rh based model for et0 estimation according to its excellent regional performance fig 6 a c exhibited that the lower dispersion degree of the mbr was considerably higher than other rh based empirical models which further indicated the high precision estimation performance moreover fig 6f showed that the et0 values estimated by the d lstm1 were the closest to the et0 pm values for a clearly articulated evaluation the estimation performance of deep learning models in this study the accuracy comparison between rh based models was only conducted among mbr dbn1 lstm1 and d lstm1 for external strategy table 3 lists the accuracy results of daily et0 estimating models for the external strategy as shown in table 3 d lstm1 achieved the best performance among rh based models for external strategy with corresponding r2 nse rmse mape and gpi were 0 874 0 872 0 651 mm d 1 0 159 and 1 837 in terms of r2 mbr dbn1 and lstm1 models decreased by 13 84 3 89 and 8 92 compared to d lstm1 the same results can be gained from nse that values of mbr dbn1 and lstm1 decreased by 19 50 5 05 and 12 73 besides the improvement of rmse for mbr dbn1 and lstm1 were 35 94 10 14 and 23 35 respectively similarly the mape that the d lstm1 decreased by 36 49 21 77 and 26 06 compared to mbr dbn1 and lstm1 these the accuracy of rh based et0 models for external strategy can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as follows d lstm1 dbn1 lstm1 mbr rom and roh to summarize d lstm1 achieved the best performance among the rh based et0 estimating models for the local and external strategy on the loess plateau besides all dl models superior to the empirical models lstm1 performed better than dbn1 for the local strategy but vice versa for the external strategy 3 3 estimation accuracy of radiation based models as seen from fig 4f j mak obtained the most accurate et0 estimates among three empirical rn based empirical models with corresponding r2 nse rmse mape and gpi values were 0 897 0 090 0 888 0 092 0 626 0 306 mm d 1 0 193 0 036 and 1 422 0 386 compared to p t the r2 nse rmse and gpi values of mak were improved by 3 58 2 78 7 12 11 06 and 14 31 the same results can be gained from the comparison between mak and i a that the values of r2 nse rmse and gpi of mak were improved by 154 11 152 99 75 00 60 61 and 210 66 for i a to further explore the accuracy discrepancies between the dl and empirical models the statistical accuracy indicators of mak dbn2 lstm2 and d lstm2 were compared in this study compared to mak all dl models performed better and d lstm2 achieved the best estimation accuracy with values of r2 nse rmse mape and gpi were 0 944 0 030 0 943 0 037 0 423 0 313 mm d 1 0 119 0 013 and 1 917 0 155 in terms of r2 mak dbn2 and lstm2 models decreased by 4 98 1 38 and 1 27 in terms of nse the values of mak dbn2 and lstm2 decreased by 5 83 1 80 and 1 59 in terms of rmse the improvement value for d lstm2 were 32 43 12 96 and 9 23 compared to mak dbn2 and lstm2 respectively similarly the mape that the d lstm2 decreased by 38 34 15 00 and 4 03 compared to mak dbn2 and lstm2 these the accuracy of rn based et0 models for local strategy can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as follows d lstm2 lstm2 dbn2 mak p t and i a table 2 listed the specific values of the statistical accuracy indicators for local strategy fig 5g l plotted the spatial variation of statistical accuracy indicators achieved by rn based et0 estimating models for local strategy over the 50 meteorological stations on the loess plateau it can be seen from fig 5g h that the values of r2 and nse obtained by mak and p t showed significant gradient descent from southwest to northeast and the higher values of rmse occurred in the northwest region in terms of mape values of the mak and p t the spatial variations showed a trend of simultaneous decline from the middle of the region to the east and west notably the r2 nse mape and rmse values of the i a exhibited poor performance across the region which implied the model was unsuitable on the loess plateau fig 5i as shown in fig 5j l the excellent performance of r2 nse mape and rmse obtained by rn based dl models showed the high applicability across the region despite the consistent variation pattern of r2 values with empirical ones the worst rmse values obtained by rn based dl models occurred on the eastern and western boundaries notably nse and mape performed almost perfectly in the whole region with only a few low value regions concentrated in the western boundaries fig 5l showed that the d lstm2 performed stalely with better accuracy in the whole region and the corresponding values of r2 and nse were higher than 0 91 and 0 90 and the value of rmse and mape was lower than 0 8 mm d 1 and 0 10 in short the performance of rn based dl models was significantly superior to the empirical models across the region and the d lstm1 was the most recommended rn based model for et0 estimation according to its excellent regional performance it is exhibited that the lower dispersion degree of the mak was considerably higher than other empirical models in fig 6g i which indicated the high precision estimation performance for external strategy for a clearly articulated evaluation of the estimation performance of deep learning models in this study the accuracy comparison between rn based empirical models was only conducted among mak dbn2 lstm2 and d lstm2 for external strategy despite et0 values estimated by the d lstm2 being the closest to the et0 pm values shown in fig 6l the gpi index of d lstm2 ranked first consistently indicated that d lstm1 achieved the best accuracy of daily et0 among rh based models for external strategy table 3 with corresponding r2 nse rmse mape and gpi were 0 894 0 892 0 591 mm d 1 0 138 and 2 000 in terms of r2 mak dbn2 and lstm2 models decreased by 8 95 4 36 and 5 37 compared to d lstm2 the same results can be gained from nse that values of mbr dbn2 and lstm2 decreased by 10 43 4 71 and 5 38 moreover the improvement of rmse for mak dbn2 and lstm2 were 47 21 16 41 and 22 84 respectively similarly the mape that the d lstm2 decreased by 37 62 13 15 and 19 75 compared to mak dbn2 and lstm2 these the accuracy of rn based et0 models for external strategy can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as follows d lstm2 dbn2 lstm2 mak p t and i a see table 3 for specific values of the statistical accuracy indicators to summarize d lstm2 achieved the best performance among the rn based et0 estimating models for the local and external strategy on the loess plateau besides all dl models superior to the empirical models lstm2 performed better than dbn2 for the local strategy but vice versa for the external strategy 3 4 estimation accuracy of temperature based models it can be seen from fig 4k 4o that hs achieved the best performance among empirical t based empirical models with corresponding r2 nse rmse mape and gpi values were 0 824 0 083 0 803 0 058 0 722 0 513 mm d 1 0 246 0 043 and 0 882 0 488 compared to b r and oud the improvement value of the r2 nse rmse mape and gpi obtained by hs were 3 39 1 77 9 41 18 54 and 31 05 and were 6 87 6 78 43 10 5 02 and 17 13 respectively to further explore the accuracy discrepancies between the dl and empirical models the statistical accuracy indicators of hs dbn3 lstm3 and d lstm3 were compared in this study as shown in table 2 d lstm3 performed best with values of r2 nse rmse and gpi were 0 902 0 091 0 891 0 094 0 558 0 319 mm d 1 0 181 0 058 and 1 440 0 550 however dbn3 was significantly inferior to hs for the local strategy compared to dbn3 the excess r2 nse rmse and gpi values of hs were 33 12 31 00 46 64 and 161 72 while the difference in average values of mape between hs and dbn 3 was almost negligible regarding lstm3 the accuracy performance of et0 estimation was superior to hs with improvement values of r2 nse rmse mape and gpi was 2 79 3 11 3 60 23 98 and 46 15 these the accuracy of t based et0 models for local strategy can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as follows d lstm3 lstm3 hs b r oud and dbn3 table 2 fig 5m r plotted the spatial variation of statistical accuracy indicators achieved by t based et0 estimating models for local strategy over the 50 meteorological stations on the loess plateau fig 5m n showed a consistent variation pattern of r2 nse and mape obtained by hs and b r that the values significant gradient descent from southwest to northeast and the values of rmse performed relatively unacceptable in the middle region notably dbn3 performed an enormous north south difference which strongly implied the inapplicability in the south region fig 5p in terms of lstm3 and d lstm3 the r2 and nse showed an obvious decreasing trend from southwest to northeast however the high values of rmse concentrated in the northwest fig 5q r in terms of mape the spatial variations of mape obtained by d lstm3 showed the same trend as rmse but the values of lstm3 present several obvious extremely high value areas in the north south and east of the region fig 5r showed that the d lstm3 performed better in the southwest and the areas with poor estimation occurred in the northwest region with the values of r2 and nse ranging 0 81 0 99 and 0 80 0 98 and the value of rmse and mape ranging 0 24 0 9 mm d 1 and 0 12 0 30 in short the performance of t based lstm and d lstm were significantly superior to the empirical models across the region but the dbn was applicable in the northern region among three t based dl models the d lstm3 was the most recommended t based model for et0 estimation according to its excellent regional performance fig 6m o illustrated that the lower dispersion degree of the hs was considerably higher than other empirical models which further indicates the high precision estimation performance for a clearly articulated evaluation of the estimation performance of dl models in this study the accuracy comparison between t based empirical models only was conducted among hs dbn3 lstm3 and d lstm3 for external strategy as shown in table 3 d lstm3 achieved the best performance among t based models with corresponding r2 nse rmse mape and gpi were 0 839 0 827 0 768 mm d 1 0 212 and 1 482 similar to local strategy hs performed quite well and gpi ranked third among t based models for external strategy and slightly superior to lstm3 with corresponding r2 nse rmse mape and gpi were 0 695 0 681 1 050 mm d 1 0 256 and 0 666 compared with lstm3 the value of the r2 nse rmse and gpi of hs were improved by 7 09 6 74 11 17 and 43 89 respectively while the mape was increased by 6 13 regarding dbn3 its gpi ranked second to d lstm3 with corresponding r2 nse rmse mape and gpi were 0 738 0 707 0 927 mm d 1 0 229 and 0 937 these the accuracy of t based et0 models for external strategy can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as follows d lstm3 dbn3 hs lstm3 b r and oud see table 3 for specific values of the statistical accuracy indicators to summarize d lstm3 still achieved the best performance among the t based et0 estimating models for the local and external strategy on the loess plateau however hs outperformed the dbn3 for local strategy and was superior to lstm3 for external strategy 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy discrepancies among different et0 models consistent with the conclusion drawn by ferreira and da cunha 2020 who established cnn lstm to forecast seven days ahead of daily et0 and concluded that the hybrid dl performed better than the original version for the regional and local scenarios this study also found the d lstm achieved the best performance for estimating daily et0 using incomplete data for local and external strategy based on the coupling of dbn and lstm tables 2 3 therefore the d lstm model proposed in this study as a reformative deep learning model can better simulate et0 using incomplete meteorological data as the most mainstream dl models dbn and lstm performed better than the other rh based and rn based empirical models in this study which was similar to other research yin et al 2020 developed the bi directional long short term memory bi lstm model to forecast short term daily et0 in the semi arid region of northwest china and the results showed that rh based rn based and t based lstm both excel empirical models in estimating et0 for local strategy chen et al 2020b also conclude that lstm performed markedly better than rh based rn based and t based empirical models which is consistent with this study that lstm was recommended as a substitution for empirical models such excellent accuracy performance proved the high potential of the lstm applied in modeling et0 and attributes the success to its model structure which vested the excellent ability to mine the information in the history data the lstm model represents a deep network structure that has been proven to accommodate different types and representations of data recognize sequential patterns over long periods and capture complex nonlinear relationships cui et al 2020 khadem and rey 2021 tian et al 2021 however we found lstm slightly inferior to hs for the external strategy in a departure from chen et al 2020b it is presumably because the historical data learned at train stations cannot provide adequate information for test stations on the loess plateau similar to this conclusion we found that the dbn was not suitable for estimating et0 when only temperature data were available for the local strategy table 2 which was consistent with chen et al 2020b who insisted that dbn was not superior to hs significantly and further proved the reliable of the conclusion drawn from this paper this is presumably because dbn under inappropriate data will not achieve convergence to the global optimal solution the conclusion may agree with gao et al 2022 who also insisted that feature extraction of historical data can improve the estimation accuracy of electric energy consumption based on dbn furthermore we found the dbn performed better than lstm for the external strategy table 3 attributing the success to its ability of feature extraction for complex nonlinear problems on the regional scale driver et al 2021 tao et al 2020 zhong et al 2021 despite the fact that hs exhibited relatively good performance for estimating daily et0 using temperature data only all dl were significantly superior to the empirical models in this study presumably because of their black box structure that can effectively reduce the cognitive uncertainty due to the complex nonlinear relationships between et0 and other meteorological features the conclusion drawn from this study was not only similar to the research on the comparison between ml and empirical models feng et al 2016 shan et al 2020 but also consistent with the comparison between dl and empirical models in the other research chen et al 2020a dong et al 2022 yin et al 2020 to summarize all dl performed better than empirical models despite that hs outperformed the dbn3 for local strategy and was superior to lstm3 for the external strategy simultaneity moreover lstm was more applicable for the local strategy and dbn was more applicable for the external strategy among the all proposed estimated models in this study d lstm performed better for the local and external strategies on the loess plateau 4 2 accuracy discrepancies of the et0 models using different input combinations as the most essential energy source of the earth s atmosphere system solar radiation is the main driving factor of plant transpiration and soil evaporation and is the most basic and main agroclimatic resource many researchers have reported that rn based model performed better than other empirical models yang et al 2021 evaluated four aerodynamic methods five t based methods six rn based methods and three combination methods using meteorological data from 789 stations in four climatic zones of china and they concluded that radiation based methods manifested the best accuracy among models using limited meteorological data fan et al 2018 evaluated the potential of random forest rf m5 model tree m5tree gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and extreme gradient boosting xgboost for estimating daily et0 using limited meteorological data and the result showed that the global solar radiation was the most important meteorological feature for daily et0 estimation zhu et al 2020 proposed the pso elm model for estimating daily et0 in the arid region of northwest china with limited meteorological data and they drew a conclusion that ml models provided a reasonable et0 estimation with air temperature and solar radiation as inputs and introducing relative humidity improved the model accuracy consistent with the conclusions this study found that rn based empirical model manifested the best accuracy of et0 estimation among three categories of the empirical models generally and dl models performed better using sunshine duration as input data for both two k fold cross validation strategies tables 2 3 despite rn based models being considered as the most accurate et0 estimating models rn data are not readily accessible in many regions around the world notably ta and rh are the most widely measured meteorological variables and great efforts have been made to estimate et0 by ta based or rh based models because air temperature and humidity are also prominent factors that directly affect et0 inoue et al 2021 feng et al 2017a calibrated the hargreaves model using bayesian theory at 19 meteorological stations in the sichuan basin of southwest china and they found the calibrated temperature based hargreaves provided closer average values with pm et0 which could confirm the good estimation performances of the calibrated hargreaves model feng et al 2017b compared the elm grnn and hargreaves with penman monteith et0 and they insisted that the grnn and elm models are appropriate alternatives for accurate et0 estimation for the sichuan basin of southwest china when only temperature data exists in this study we found t based empirical model performed better than rh based empirical model tables 2 3 despite rh based empirical model including temperature as the independent variable which implied model structure is the most critical factor for empirical models moreover the accuracy performance of empirical et0 estimating models using the same input variables in this study exerts a significant accuracy discrepancy further confirming the conclusion for two k fold cross validation strategies this study found rh based dl models were superior to t based dl models tables 2 3 which implied more meteorological data and more valid mapping information for dl models this conclusion was much consistent with fan et al 2018 who found the ml models using t and rh obtained more satisfactory et0 estimates than t based input combinations across four climatic zones of china abdullah et al 2015 also insisted rh play a vital role in the prediction accuracy obtained by the feed forward back propagation ffbp model when they investigate the efficiency of the empirical p m ffbp model and elm at predicting et0 for iraq hence despite the fact that rn based models were the best et0 estimating models using limited meteorological data t based and rh based can be a valid alternative to the et0 estimation with easy accessibility moreover rh improved the accuracy of dl based et0 estimating models to some extent 4 3 spatial accuracy discrepancies of the et0 models this study further found that the accuracy performance of et0 estimating models exerts a significant spatial variability on the loess plateau the conclusion is consistent with celestin et al 2020 who concluded that the objectivity of meteorological elements of the empirical equations often used can be highly variable from region to region yang et al 2021 also comparatively assessed 18 empirical models in four climatic zones in china and they found that the area averaged annual et0 showed significant disparities between models both within the four climatic zones in this study we found the mak and p t performed better in the relatively humid area fig 5g h because the p t and mak methods were originally developed for a humid climate celestin et al 2020 gao et al 2017 also recommended the p t model to be the best substitute for the pm fao56 in the humid region of northwest china which was inconsistent with this study according to yang et al 2021 roh and rom were the only recommended rh based methods for calculating pet in china s four climatic zones however roh and rom achieved a poor performance of r2 nse mape and rmse on the loess plateau fig 5b c which reveals that the rom model is not feasible in this region among rh based empirical equations mbr performed significantly better than roh and rom and the statistical accuracy indicators showed a consistent trend with rh that the statistical accuracy indicators decreased from southwest to northeast in terms of t based empirical models feng et al 2017a and droogers and allen 2002 concluded that the hs model might underestimate et0 in arid regions while overestimating et0 in humid regions which further insisted that the t based hs model were influenced by humidity consistently this study also found that the hs and b r performed better in the humid region of the loess plateau fig 5m n the dl models exhibited a significant spatial accuracy discrepancy in the et0 estimation on the loess plateau was consistent with dou and yang 2018 who investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of both elm and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis to estimate the daily et with flux tower observations in four main types of ecosystems the result shows a significant difference regarding the modeling performance existed among the four major ecosystems types abdullah et al 2015 also noticed that the sensitivity of the elm model to missing data changes from one location to another as well as along the year for certain study locations notably the conclusions very agree with the result in this study that rn based dl models achieved better performance for estimating et0 fig 5 which further reveals that the deep learning based et0 model was more inclined to be affected by radiation besides the spatial difference in the accuracy of the dl models on the loess plateau is consistent with the spatial variation patterns of meteorological features which further confirms the previous conclusions drawn from this study specifically the accuracy of rh based dl models decreased from the central region to the northwest and southeast fig 5d f consistent with the regular spatial humidity pattern besides rn based dl models performed much better for daily et0 estimated in the southwest of the loess plateau fig 5j l were witnessed the high value of n regarding t based dl models the spatial variability law in lstm3 and d lstm3 is closer to rn based fig 5q r however the accuracy of the dbn model shows a significant north south difference and it seems the dbn model is only effective in the north region of the loess plateau fig 5p to summarize all the above demonstrated that the estimated accuracy of empirical models and dl models were significantly affected by the variation pattern of meteorological data used in the models 4 4 applicability evaluation of et0 models based on two k fold cross validation strategies 839 national meteorological stations have measured daily air temperature sunshine duration relative humidity wind speed and atmospheric pressure across mainland china since 1959 however only 629 stations have complete historical observation data attributed to equipment failure external force interference and human missteps on the loess plateau merely 50 stations can be selected to build et0 estimating models due to data integrity and meteorological data published by the cma has a certain lag therefore evaluating the applicability of et0 estimating models using limited data for inner station k fold cross validation strategy is necessary to supplement missing data or facilitate managers to use less meteorological observation data as a substitute as a standard procedure among the et0 community many researchers have proposed this strategy of k fold cross validation to evaluate the et0 estimating models abdullah et al 2015 dong et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 and demonstrated its merits that can effectively avoid over learning and under learning this study also found that d lstm acquired the highest average value and lowest standard deviation using limited data for the local strategy which demonstrated the model has the best accuracy and stability in the areas without complete on the loess plateau the local strategy explained the applicability evaluation of et0 estimating models at each station backdrop that the meteorological data exhibited significant spatiotemporal discrepancies on the loess plateau during 1961 2020 and the cross station k fold cross validation strategy was required to validate the applicability of et0 estimating models in the areas without complete historical meteorological observation data fakheri fard et al 2015 proposed the spatial external s and the temporal local t to evaluate the performance of neuro fuzzy and neural networks models for estimating reference evapotranspiration and they insisted that the external training might be a valid alternative to the more common local training which presents the decisive advantage of not requiring data series in the test station for the application of the training algorithm feng et al 2017b trained tested using the local scenario and the external scenario respectively and the result showed that the elm performed better than grnn for the local scenario while the grnn was slightly superior to elm for the external scenario similar to the conclusion this study also found that locally calibrated models are always more accurate than externally calibrated ones and d lstm performed better than other models for the external strategy the result demonstrated that d lstm has the best applicability in the areas where there is no historical meteorological observation data on the loess plateau hence d lstm is the most recommended et0 estimated model using limited meteorological observation data for local external k fold cross validation strategies which is very helpful for farmers or irrigation system operators to improve their irrigation scheduling 4 5 analysis of uncertainties shortcomings and applications due to the lack of experimental et0 data this study considered et0 obtained by the p m method as the target to evaluate the empirical and dl models although the p m method has successfully been applied in much research fan et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 maroufpoor et al 2020 the confidence of conclusions maybe limited when only calculated et0 was applied in this study according to martí et al 2015 with the conditions permitted the conclusion drawn by the present study should be further tested using measured et0 by eddy covariance systems or lysimeters as the benchmark which is an essential research direction in the future moreover precise irrigation could more benefit from our research directly however our conclusions still get significant application value of irrigation management in a wide area lacking measured data despite the uncertainty introduced by the selection of benchmark furthermore the dl models belong to the black box model which has obvious advantages and disadvantages fan et al 2018 maroufpoor et al 2020 when dealing with complex nonlinear time series problems we not only hope that the model can give correct prediction results but also hope to understand its internal physical mechanism which is impossible for the black box model moreover dl models were very sensitive to the hyper parameters which may lead to convergence instability and over fitting when running the models chen et al 2022 hu et al 2021 for the model uncertainty caused by hyper parameters we proposed the stochastic gradient descent algorithm sgd to fine tune the parameters in recent years with the rapid rise of dl the sgd algorithm has become a mainstream method for solving large scale machine learning optimization problems fjellström and nyström 2022 liu et al 2019 sharma 2018 in this method the gradient of one or several samples is randomly selected to replace the overall gradient in the iterative process thus greatly reducing the computational complexity and avoiding the non convergence problem 5 conclusions this study comparatively evaluated the accuracy between dbn lstm d lstm and nine empirical models for daily et0 estimation using incomplete meteorological data on the loess plateau the conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 the et0 pm trend analysis shows that 18 meteorological stations exhibited significant upward trends p 0 05 and 12 meteorological stations had significant downward trends p 0 05 on the loess plateau during 1961 2020 2 the d lstm best estimates et0 using limited meteorological data for the local and external strategies the deep learning models performed better than the empirical models using rh based and rn based input combinations hs outperformed the dbn3 for the local strategy and was superior to lstm3 for the external strategy 3 the rn based et0 estimating models were superior to rh based and t based models for et0 estimation rh based achieved better accuracy than t based for deep learning models but vice versa for empirical models 4 there are significant spatial discrepancies in the estimation accuracy obtained by daily et0 models and dl based et0 models were more inclined to be affected by radiation and humidity the dbn model is only effective in the

2791,reference evapotranspiration et0 is usually employed for estimating actual crop et together with crop coefficients kc however it is necessary to explore an alternative model to estimate et0 concisely because of numerous limitations in the penman monteith method to improve the et0 estimation accuracy using limited meteorological data this study developed a novel hybrid deep learning model d lstm based on the meteorological data during 1961 2020 observed at fifty stations on the loess plateau which used the deep belief network dbn module to extract features from meteorological data and the long short term memory lstm module to expand time features and process data information with sequential features respectively based on the comparative evaluation of et0 estimation accuracy between the d lstm dbn lstm and nine empirical models the results drawn from this study demonstrated that the d lstm model manifested the best performance as rh based rn based and t based et0 estimating models for local strategy the value of r2 nse rmse mape and gpi ranging 0 941 0 020 0 940 0 032 0 436 0 457 mm d 1 0 150 0 016 and 1 611 0 180 for d lstm1 rh based 0 944 0 030 0 943 0 037 0 423 0 313

lstm performed better than dbn for local strategy but vice versa for external strategy despite dl models outperforming rh based and rn based empirical models hs outperformed the dbn3 for local strategy and was superior to lstm3 for external strategy under limited meteorological data the rn based et0 estimating models are superior to rh based and t based models and rh based achieved better accuracy than t based for dl models but vice versa for empirical models there is significant spatial variability in the accuracy of daily et0 models but the high precision of the d lstm was stable on the loess plateau overall the d lstm model which combines the advantages of dbn and lstm is the most recommended et0 model using incomplete meteorological data on the loess plateau which is very

validation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as an essential component in eco hydrological processes evapotranspiration et plays a crucial role in agricultural water meticulous management in general direct measurement of et is less practicability high commission and time consuming consequently reference evapotranspiration et0 is introduced for estimating actual crop et combined with crop coefficients kc et0 is defined as the rate of et from a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 the fao 56 penman monteith equation p m represents the most widely accepted standard method for estimating et0 chen et al 2020b fan et al 2021a hadria et al 2021 martí et al 2015 however the p m method requires many meteorological data which limit its more comprehensive application especially in developing countries feng et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to develop an alternative simple model for accurately estimating et0 with reasonable precision and high stability using fewer meteorological data previous empirical et0 models can be classified as radiation based humidity based temperature based and combination methods according to the development philosophy and meteorological features humidity based radiation based and temperature based models have been widely studied for estimating et0 using incomplete meteorological data however empirical models can vary significantly in terms of performance because of the model assumptions and data requirements xu and singh 2000 evaluated eight radiation based equations for estimating et0 in switzerland and the results showed that the makkink mak and modified priestley taylor p t agreed most closely with pan evaporation valipour 2014 compared eleven temperature based models to detect the best model in iran and the results showed that the modified hargreaves hs models estimate the et0 better than other models the humidity based models mainly include the romanenko rom romanenko 1961 dalton celestin et al 2020 and schendel sch djaman et al 2015 models which are also commonly used to calculate et0 however empirical based et0 models generally include multivariate nonlinear relations based on numerous assumptions and principles the performance of these mathematical models is seriously influenced by model uncertainty associated with model structure model parameters and measurement noise consequently it is challenging to establish accurate empirical models representing the underlying et0 processes with the rapid development of computer computing power cp and artificial intelligence ai theory empirical models have been improved or replaced by artificial intelligence methods despite the original version of the empirical models optimized by swarm intelligence algorithms chia et al 2021 valle júnior et al 2020 machine learning models ml have achieved success at estimating et0 using incomplete meteorological data compared to various empirical models due to its black box characteristics gocic et al 2016 employed the adjusted hs p t turc and extreme learning machine elm for modeling et0 in serbia and the result revealed that the elm could be an alternative for the et0 estimation feng et al 2017b developed two ai models for daily et0 estimation only with temperature data in southwest china and the result shows that the temperature based grnn generalized regression neural network and elm models are appropriate alternatives for accurate et0 estimation as a cutting edge technology of ml recent years have witnessed a booming development of deep learning models dl in many domains ben yahia et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 attribute to its efficient ability for big data mining starting from the basic multi layer perceptron mlp researchers have proposed various dl models which can be generally subdivided into recurrent neural networks rnn deep neural network dnn and convolutional neural networks cnn sporadic reports hitherto have begun to focus on rnn models applied for et0 estimation the rnn which mainly includes the long short term memory lstm improved the processing ability of time series data by connecting the hidden layer nodes and proposing the output of the last time hidden layer as the input of the hidden layer cagcag yolcu et al 2021 sattari et al 2021 used lstm models to estimate et0 in different combinations and the results showed that the lstm model predicted et0 amounts with acceptable accuracy granata and di nunno 2021 selected lstm to predict the short term ahead et in america and the result showed that the model provided accurate predictions but the performance can be affected by local climatic conditions however rnn sacrifices a large amount of computing power to avoid long term dependence which can be effectively remedied by dbn models although many dl models have been successfully applied to et0 estimation chen et al 2020b elbeltagi et al 2020 fan et al 2021b saggi and jain 2019 little research has been reported on the application of dbn as most mainstream dnn models the classic dbn model is composed of feature extractors formed by stacking multiple restricted boltzmann machines rbms and a single layer of bp neural network which effectively solves the problem of the slow training speed of large artificial neural networks hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 chen et al 2012 proposed the dbn model to predict the drought event in the huaihe river basin of china and the dbn based drought prediction model has shown better predictive skills than the back propagation neural network bp for the different time scale standardized precipitation index spi moreover dbn models are usually applied as a feature extractor combined with other models which can effectively reduce the dimension and remove the noise of the original input data shuaishuai et al 2018 combined the dbn with least squares support vector regression lssvm to establish a prediction model for the transpiration rate of strawberry leaves in a solar greenhouse and the dbn was used to eliminate the correlation of environmental variables dimension reduction the results showed that the prediction accuracy and regression fitting degree of dbn lssvm was significantly superior to the original version of lssvm chen et al 2022 coupled the p m formula into the dbn and subsequently they insisted that the hybrid dbn model could be adopted to generate continuous et datasets wang et al 2022 proposed the dbn to predict atmospheric visibility in short and long term sequences and the results showed the dbn was significantly superior to the bp and cnn although the performance of the dbn model is proven to be better than the other models in most cases it is inclined to fall into the trap of local optimal solution and gradient disappearance when dealing with long time series problems because of the deepening of neural network layers which is regarded as the main constraint in its applications çakıroğlu et al 2021 shang et al 2021 as mentioned above the distinct advantages and disadvantages of the dbn and lstm are complementary in solving the complex nonlinear system problem with time series characteristics however few reports hitherto make an effort to coupled dbn with lstm for et0 estimation using limited meteorological data therefore it is of great significance to apply the hybrid dl model which consists of dbn and lstm for et0 estimation in consideration of its characteristic of multivariate nonlinear and time series and the objectives of the present study were to 1 reveal the spatiotemporal variation patterns of meteorological variables and et0 2 establish the hybrid deep learning model i e d lstm by composing dbn and lstm to improve the estimating accuracy of et0 3 comparative evaluate the accuracy performance between empirical models dl models and hybrid dl model in et0 simulation

description the loess plateau is located in the northwest of china 100 54 114 33e 33 43 41 16 n and covers approximately 640 000 km2 fig 1 as a transition zone from semi humid area to arid area the region is a water limited landscape and annual precipitation varied from 142 mm in the southeast to 809 mm in the northwest with an average value of 420 mm the et accounts for 85 of the precipitation with an average value of 1094 mm and this percentage increases along the precipitation gradient wang et al 2020 despite providing excellent photo thermal conditions regional agricultural production potential is seriously limited by insufficient water resources therefore it is crucial to estimate the reference evapotranspiration accurately and efficiently on the loess plateau table s1 in the

simulation of the water and heat transfer process for evapotranspiration which is one of the most widely used models to estimate et0 the common humidity based model are modified baier robertson model baier 1971 rohwer model rohwer 1931 and romanenko model romanenko 1961 which were described as follows baier 1971 modified the b r model by introducing saturated water vapor pressure and actual water

as a typical humidity based empirical et0 model 4 e t 0 4 5 1 t mean 25 2 1 e a e s 2 3 2 radiation based about 80 of et0 might be explained by temperature and solar radiation priestley and taylor 1972 samani 2000 and many radiation based et0 models which used radiation and temperature data could estimate et0 accurately tabari et al 2013 feng et al 2016 in the current study the makkink model makkink 1957 priestley taylor model priestley and taylor 1972 and irmak model irmak et al 2003 were selected to represent radiation based empirical et0 models as follows the makkink equation eq 5 has been applied worldwide to estimate et0 based on radiation which was commonly considered to be the closest to the p m method 5 e t 0 a δ δ λ r s 2 45 b where rs is the total ground radiation mj mm 2 d

2 3 3 temperature based air temperature is the most accessible meteorological data which was measured by more than 2400 national stations in china currently temperature based empirical models had proven their potential for estimating et0 using the least data in the current study the hargreaves samani model hargreaves and samani 1985 the baier robertson model baier and robertson 1965 and the oudin model oudin et al 2005 were selected to represent temperature based empirical et0 models as follows hargreaves and samani 1985 firstly put forward an equation eq 8 that estimates et0 from

3 2 4 deep learning models the long short term memory network improved with multiple restricted boltzmann machines d lstm developed in this study is a hybrid deep learning model comprising deep belief network dbn and long short term memory network lstm in the d lstm model the dbn module is used to extract features from meteorological data and the lstm module is applied to expand time features and process data information with sequential features progressive by time series the d lstm model produces time series of dependent meteorological input data variables in the complex nonlinear system the mathematical process of the d lstm model refers to the dbn module and lstm module as follows and their structures are shown in fig 2 a dbn module dbn is a probability model proposed by hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 which is generally composed of multiple restricted boltzmann machines rbms to extract features and of the bp model to do regression analysis as shown in fig 2b each rbm contains a hidden layer h and a visible layer v for an m layer dbn model the hidden layer of the previous rbm is the visible layer of the next rbm and the first visible layer v0 and the last hidden layer hm is the input and output layer of the dbn model respectively the energy function for the joint distribution of the visible layer unit and the hidden layer unit is as follows 11 e v h i 1 n j 1 m w ij v i

schmidhuber 1997 comprises a set of recurrently connected memory blocks to solve the gradient explosion and disappearance problem when rnn processes long time series data as shown in fig 2c each memory block is composed of input gate forget gate update gate and output gate which control the information accumulation speed by judging whether the information meets the requirements so as to avoid long term dependence the mathematical framework of the lstm model is shown as follows input gate it input gate is responsible for determining whether the input value h m t i e the features extracted by dbn should be used to update the state st of the current memory block on the one hand the sigmoid activation function is responsible for determining the output value yt of the current memory block on the other hand the tanh activation function is responsible for creating a candidate vector ut of the current memory block and the updated gate determines whether it should be added to the state st of the current memory block the calculation principle of the update gate is shown in the following formula 16 i t σ w i y t 1 h m t b i 17 u t tanh w c y t 1 h m t b c forget gate ft the sigmoid activation function reads the output value yt 1 of the old memory block and the input value h m t of the current memory block combined with the paranoid vector and the corresponding weight to determine whether the state st of the current memory block should be retained the calculation principle of the forget gate is shown as follows 18 f t σ w f y t 1 h m t b f update gate ut update gate determines whether the current memory block should update the state of the old cell from st 1 to st by multiplying the forget gate and the input gate the principle of the update gate is as follows 19 s t f t s t 1 i t u i output gate ot output gate is responsible for calculating the output value yt of the current memory block the output gate runs the sigmoid activation function to determine whether to output the current memory block state by judging the output value of the old cell and the input value of the current memory block then the current memory block state st is processed by the tanh activation function and multiplied by the output ot of the sigmoid activation function to finally determine the output value yt in the current memory block the principle of the output gate is shown as follows 20 o t σ w o y t 1 h m t b o 21 y t o t tanh s t where w represents the corresponding weight b represents the corresponding paranoid vector σ represents the sigmoid activation function tanh represents the hyperbolic tangent activation function training process and hyper parameters the number of hidden neurons in the d lstm model was determined by the sequence length of the time series lstm module and each hidden neuron with three hidden rbn layers dbn module the pre training stage and fine tuning stage were included in the training process of the d lstm model rbms can efficiently pre train the initial weights of the networks and then the fine tuning stage was carried out to slightly adjust the weights of the whole d lstm model the learning algorithm and fine tuning procedure enable d lstm to achieve high performance and avoid over fitting kuremoto et al 2014 in the pre training stage the learning rate and max training epoch of rbns are initialized at 0 01 and 100 and then the layer by layer network training methods are used one layer of rbm is used to train each time and the output result is used as the input layer to the next rbm when fine tuning the full d lstm model the initial training rate was set at 0 01 and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm sgd was used to fine tune the parameters i e the learning rate decayed by half when the error at the lstm output layer in this epoch was larger than that in last epoch the training halted when the learning rate was smaller than 10 6 2 5 model implementation in this study the empirical models were calibrated by the least square method kovoor and nandagiri 2007 under local external k fold cross validation strategies shiri et al 2014a shiri et al 2014b and the special value of parameters at fifty meteorological stations were listed in table s2 then we established rh based rn based and t based dl models according to the limited meteorological features used in the empirical models and the dl models were tested under two k fold cross validation strategies equally table 1 summarizes the input variables input combinations and model abbreviation of the dl models the procedures of the two k fold cross validation strategies were 1 local k fold cross validation strategy for division ratio between the training dataset and test dataset of dl models is 8 2 generally jiang et al 2022 the local meteorological data 60 years of each meteorological station were separated into five equal periods chronologically where one period 12 years was used for testing and the other four periods 48 years for training calibrating zhang et al 2019 2 external k fold cross validation strategy the models were tested in each meteorological station and trained calibrated using the external meteorological data from all other stations on the loess plateau shiri et al 2019 finally the average of estimation accuracy results is taken as the evaluation basis of et0 estimating models for two k fold cross

indicators achieved by rn based et0 estimating models for local strategy over the 50 meteorological stations on the loess plateau it can be seen from fig 5g h that the values of r2 and nse obtained by mak and p t showed significant gradient descent from southwest to northeast and the higher values of rmse occurred in the northwest region in terms of mape values of the mak and p t the spatial variations showed a trend of simultaneous decline from the middle of the region to the east and west notably the r2 nse mape and rmse values of the i a exhibited poor performance across the region which implied the model was unsuitable on the loess plateau fig 5i as shown in fig 5j l the excellent performance of r2 nse mape and rmse obtained by rn based dl models showed the high applicability across the region despite the consistent variation pattern of r2 values with empirical ones the worst rmse values obtained by rn based dl models occurred on the eastern and western boundaries notably nse and mape performed almost perfectly in the whole region with only a few low value regions concentrated in the western boundaries fig 5l showed that the d lstm2 performed stalely with better accuracy in the whole region and the corresponding values of r2 and nse were higher than 0 91 and 0 90 and the value of rmse and mape was lower than 0 8 mm d 1 and 0 10 in short the performance of rn based dl models was significantly superior to the empirical models across the region and the d lstm1 was the most recommended rn based model for et0 estimation according to its excellent regional performance it is exhibited that the lower dispersion degree of the mak was considerably higher than other empirical models in fig 6g i which indicated the high precision estimation performance for external strategy for a clearly articulated evaluation of the estimation performance of deep learning models in this study the accuracy comparison between rn based empirical models was only conducted among mak dbn2 lstm2 and d lstm2 for external strategy despite et0 values estimated by the d lstm2 being the closest to the et0 pm values shown in fig 6l the gpi index of d lstm2 ranked first consistently indicated that d lstm1 achieved the best accuracy of daily et0 among rh based models for external strategy table 3 with corresponding r2 nse rmse mape and gpi were 0 894 0 892 0 591 mm d 1 0 138 and 2 000 in terms of r2 mak dbn2 and lstm2 models decreased by 8 95 4 36 and 5 37 compared to d lstm2 the same results can be gained from nse that values of mbr dbn2 and lstm2 decreased by 10 43 4 71 and 5 38 moreover the improvement of rmse for mak dbn2 and lstm2 were 47 21 16 41 and 22 84 respectively similarly the mape that the d lstm2 decreased by 37 62 13 15 and 19 75 compared to mak dbn2 and lstm2 these the accuracy of rn based et0 models for external strategy can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as follows d lstm2 dbn2 lstm2 mak p t and i a see table 3 for specific values of the statistical accuracy indicators to summarize d lstm2 achieved the best performance among the rn based et0 estimating models for the local and external strategy on the loess plateau besides all dl models superior to the empirical models lstm2 performed better than dbn2 for the local strategy but vice versa for the external strategy 3 4 estimation accuracy of temperature based models it can be seen from fig 4k 4o that hs achieved the best performance among empirical t based empirical models with corresponding r2 nse rmse mape and gpi values were 0 824 0 083 0 803 0 058 0 722 0 513 mm d 1 0 246 0 043 and 0 882 0 488 compared to b r and oud the improvement value of the r2 nse rmse mape and gpi obtained by hs were 3 39 1 77 9 41 18 54 and 31 05 and were 6 87 6 78 43 10 5 02 and 17 13 respectively to further explore the accuracy discrepancies between the dl and empirical models the statistical accuracy indicators of hs dbn3 lstm3 and d lstm3 were compared in this study as shown in table 2 d lstm3 performed best with values of r2 nse rmse and gpi were 0 902 0 091 0 891 0 094 0 558 0 319 mm d 1 0 181 0 058 and 1 440 0 550 however dbn3 was significantly inferior to hs for the local strategy compared to dbn3 the excess r2 nse rmse and gpi values of hs were 33 12 31 00 46 64 and 161 72 while the difference in average values of mape between hs and dbn 3 was almost negligible regarding lstm3 the accuracy performance of et0 estimation was superior to hs with improvement values of r2 nse rmse mape and gpi was 2 79 3 11 3 60 23 98 and 46 15 these the accuracy of t based et0 models for local strategy can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as follows d lstm3 lstm3 hs b r oud and dbn3 table 2 fig 5m r plotted the spatial variation of statistical accuracy indicators achieved by t based et0 estimating models for local strategy over the 50 meteorological stations on the loess plateau fig 5m n showed a consistent variation pattern of r2 nse and mape obtained by hs and b r that the values significant gradient descent from southwest to northeast and the values of rmse performed relatively unacceptable in the middle region notably dbn3 performed an enormous north south difference which strongly implied the inapplicability in the south region fig 5p in terms of lstm3 and d lstm3 the r2 and nse showed an obvious decreasing trend from southwest to northeast however the high values of rmse concentrated in the northwest fig 5q r in terms of mape the spatial variations of mape obtained by d lstm3 showed the same trend as rmse but the values of lstm3 present several obvious extremely high value areas in the north south and east of the region fig 5r showed that the d lstm3 performed better in the southwest and the areas with poor estimation occurred in the northwest region with the values of r2 and nse ranging 0 81 0 99 and 0 80 0 98 and the value of rmse and mape ranging 0 24 0 9 mm d 1 and 0 12 0 30 in short the performance of t based lstm and d lstm were significantly superior to the empirical models across the region but the dbn was applicable in the northern region among three t based dl models the d lstm3 was the most recommended t based model for et0 estimation according to its excellent regional performance fig 6m o illustrated that the lower dispersion degree of the hs was considerably higher than other empirical models which further indicates the high precision estimation performance for a clearly articulated evaluation of the estimation performance of dl models in this study the accuracy comparison between t based empirical models only was conducted among hs dbn3 lstm3 and d lstm3 for external strategy as shown in table 3 d lstm3 achieved the best performance among t based models with corresponding r2 nse rmse mape and gpi were 0 839 0 827 0 768 mm d 1 0 212 and 1 482 similar to local strategy hs performed quite well and gpi ranked third among t based models for external strategy and slightly superior to lstm3 with corresponding r2 nse rmse mape and gpi were 0 695 0 681 1 050 mm d 1 0 256 and 0 666 compared with lstm3 the value of the r2 nse rmse and gpi of hs were improved by 7 09 6 74 11 17 and 43 89 respectively while the mape was increased by 6 13 regarding dbn3 its gpi ranked second to d lstm3 with corresponding r2 nse rmse mape and gpi were 0 738 0 707 0 927 mm d 1 0 229 and 0 937 these the accuracy of t based et0 models for external strategy can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as follows d lstm3 dbn3 hs lstm3 b r and oud see table 3 for specific values of the statistical accuracy indicators to summarize d lstm3 still achieved the best performance among the t based et0 estimating models for the local and external strategy on the loess plateau however hs outperformed the dbn3 for local strategy and was superior to lstm3 for external strategy 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy discrepancies among different et0 models consistent with the conclusion drawn by ferreira and da cunha 2020 who established cnn lstm to forecast seven days ahead of daily et0 and concluded that the hybrid dl performed better than the original version for the regional and local scenarios this study also found the d lstm achieved the best performance for estimating daily et0 using incomplete data for local and external strategy based on the coupling of dbn and lstm tables 2 3 therefore the d lstm model proposed in this study as a reformative deep learning model can better simulate et0 using incomplete meteorological data as the most mainstream dl models dbn and lstm performed better than the other rh based and rn based empirical models in this study which was similar to other research yin et al 2020 developed the bi directional long short term memory bi lstm model to forecast short term daily et0 in the semi arid region of northwest china and the results showed that rh based rn based and t based lstm both excel empirical models in estimating et0 for local strategy chen et al 2020b also conclude that lstm performed markedly better than rh based rn based and t based empirical models which is consistent with this study that lstm was recommended as a substitution for empirical models such excellent accuracy performance proved the high potential of the lstm applied in modeling et0 and attributes the success to its model structure which vested the excellent ability to mine the information in the history data the lstm model represents a deep network structure that has been proven to accommodate different types and representations of data recognize sequential patterns over long periods and capture complex nonlinear relationships cui et al 2020 khadem and rey 2021 tian et al 2021 however we found lstm slightly inferior to hs for the external strategy in a departure from chen et al 2020b it is presumably because the historical data learned at train stations cannot provide adequate information for test stations on the loess plateau similar to this conclusion we found that the dbn was not suitable for estimating et0 when only temperature data were available for the local strategy table 2 which was consistent with chen et al 2020b who insisted that dbn was not superior to hs significantly and further proved the reliable of the conclusion drawn from this paper this is presumably because dbn under inappropriate data will not achieve convergence to the global optimal solution the conclusion may agree with gao et al 2022 who also insisted that feature extraction of historical data can improve the estimation accuracy of electric energy consumption based on dbn furthermore we found the dbn performed better than lstm for the external strategy table 3 attributing the success to its ability of feature extraction for complex nonlinear problems on the regional scale driver et al 2021 tao et al 2020 zhong et al 2021 despite the fact that hs exhibited relatively good performance for estimating daily et0 using temperature data only all dl were significantly superior to the empirical models in this study presumably because of their black box structure that can effectively reduce the cognitive uncertainty due to the complex nonlinear relationships between et0 and other meteorological features the conclusion drawn from this study was not only similar to the research on the comparison between ml and empirical models feng et al 2016 shan et al 2020 but also consistent with the comparison between dl and empirical models in the other research chen et al 2020a dong et al 2022 yin et al 2020 to summarize all dl performed better than empirical models despite that hs outperformed the dbn3 for local strategy and was superior to lstm3 for the external strategy simultaneity moreover lstm was more applicable for the local strategy and dbn was more applicable for the external strategy among the all proposed estimated models in this study d lstm performed better for the local and external strategies on the loess plateau 4 2 accuracy discrepancies of the et0 models using different input combinations as the most essential energy source of the earth s atmosphere system solar radiation is the main driving factor of plant transpiration and soil evaporation and is the most basic and main agroclimatic resource many researchers have reported that rn based model performed better than other empirical models yang et al 2021 evaluated four aerodynamic methods five t based methods six rn based methods and three combination methods using meteorological data from 789 stations in four climatic zones of china and they concluded that radiation based methods manifested the best accuracy among models using limited meteorological data fan et al 2018 evaluated the potential of random forest rf m5 model tree m5tree gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and extreme gradient boosting xgboost for estimating daily et0 using limited meteorological data and the result showed that the global solar radiation was the most important meteorological feature for daily et0 estimation zhu et al 2020 proposed the pso elm model for estimating daily et0 in the arid region of northwest china with limited meteorological data and they drew a conclusion that ml models provided a reasonable et0 estimation with air temperature and solar radiation as inputs and introducing relative humidity improved the model accuracy consistent with the conclusions this study found that rn based empirical model manifested the best accuracy of et0 estimation among three categories of the empirical models generally and dl models performed better using sunshine duration as input data for both two k fold cross validation strategies tables 2 3 despite rn based models being considered as the most accurate et0 estimating models rn data are not readily accessible in many regions around the world notably ta and rh are the most widely measured meteorological variables and great efforts have been made to estimate et0 by ta based or rh based models because air temperature and humidity are also prominent factors that directly affect et0 inoue et al 2021 feng et al 2017a calibrated the hargreaves model using bayesian theory at 19 meteorological stations in the sichuan basin of southwest china and they found the calibrated temperature based hargreaves provided closer average values with pm et0 which could confirm the good estimation performances of the calibrated hargreaves model feng et al 2017b compared the elm grnn and hargreaves with penman monteith et0 and they insisted that the grnn and elm models are appropriate alternatives for accurate et0 estimation for the sichuan basin of southwest china when only temperature data exists in this study we found t based empirical model performed better than rh based empirical model tables 2 3 despite rh based empirical model including temperature as the independent variable which implied model structure is the most critical factor for empirical models moreover the accuracy performance of empirical et0 estimating models using the same input variables in this study exerts a significant accuracy discrepancy further confirming the conclusion for two k fold cross validation strategies this study found rh based dl models were superior to t based dl models tables 2 3 which implied more meteorological data and more valid mapping information for dl models this conclusion was much consistent with fan et al 2018 who found the ml models using t and rh obtained more satisfactory et0 estimates than t based input combinations across four climatic zones of china abdullah et al 2015 also insisted rh play a vital role in the prediction accuracy obtained by the feed forward back propagation ffbp model when they investigate the efficiency of the empirical p m ffbp model and elm at predicting et0 for iraq hence despite the fact that rn based models were the best et0 estimating models using limited meteorological data t based and rh based can be a valid alternative to the et0 estimation with easy accessibility moreover rh improved the accuracy of dl based et0 estimating models to some extent 4 3 spatial accuracy discrepancies of the et0 models this study further found that the accuracy performance of et0 estimating models exerts a significant spatial variability on the loess plateau the conclusion is consistent with celestin et al 2020 who concluded that the objectivity of meteorological elements of the empirical equations often used can be highly variable from region to region yang et al 2021 also comparatively assessed 18 empirical models in four climatic zones in china and they found that the area averaged annual et0 showed significant disparities between models both within the four climatic zones in this study we found the mak and p t performed better in the relatively humid area fig 5g h because the p t and mak methods were originally developed for a humid climate celestin et al 2020 gao et al 2017 also recommended the p t model to be the best substitute for the pm fao56 in the humid region of northwest china which was inconsistent with this study according to yang et al 2021 roh and rom were the only recommended rh based methods for calculating pet in china s four climatic zones however roh and rom achieved a poor performance of r2 nse mape and rmse on the loess plateau fig 5b c which reveals that the rom model is not feasible in this region among rh based empirical equations mbr performed significantly better than roh and rom and the statistical accuracy indicators showed a consistent trend with rh that the statistical accuracy indicators decreased from southwest to northeast in terms of t based empirical models feng et al 2017a and droogers and allen 2002 concluded that the hs model might underestimate et0 in arid regions while overestimating et0 in humid regions which further insisted that the t based hs model were influenced by humidity consistently this study also found that the hs and b r performed better in the humid region of the loess plateau fig 5m n the dl models exhibited a significant spatial accuracy discrepancy in the et0 estimation on the loess plateau was consistent with dou and yang 2018 who investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of both elm and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis to estimate the daily et with flux tower observations in four main types of ecosystems the result shows a significant difference regarding the modeling performance existed among the four major ecosystems types abdullah et al 2015 also noticed that the sensitivity of the elm model to missing data changes from one location to another as well as along the year for certain study locations notably the conclusions very agree with the result in this study that rn based dl models achieved better performance for estimating et0 fig 5 which further reveals that the deep learning based et0 model was more inclined to be affected by radiation besides the spatial difference in the accuracy of the dl models on the loess plateau is consistent with the spatial variation patterns of meteorological features which further confirms the previous conclusions drawn from this study specifically the accuracy of rh based dl models decreased from the central region to the northwest and southeast fig 5d f consistent with the regular spatial humidity pattern besides rn based dl models performed much better for daily et0 estimated in the southwest of the loess plateau fig 5j l were witnessed the high value of n regarding t based dl models the spatial variability law in lstm3 and d lstm3 is closer to rn based fig 5q r however the accuracy of the dbn model shows a significant north south difference and it seems the dbn model is only effective in the north region of the loess plateau fig 5p to summarize all the above demonstrated that the estimated accuracy of empirical models and dl models were significantly affected by the variation pattern of meteorological data used in the models 4 4 applicability evaluation of et0 models based on two k fold cross validation strategies 839 national meteorological stations have measured daily air temperature sunshine duration relative humidity wind speed and atmospheric pressure across mainland china since 1959 however only 629 stations have complete historical observation data attributed to equipment failure external force interference and human missteps on the loess plateau merely 50 stations can be selected to build et0 estimating models due to data integrity and meteorological data published by the cma has a certain lag therefore evaluating the applicability of et0 estimating models using limited data for inner station k fold cross validation strategy is necessary to supplement missing data or facilitate managers to use less meteorological observation data as a substitute as a standard procedure among the et0 community many researchers have proposed this strategy of k fold cross validation to evaluate the et0 estimating models abdullah et al 2015 dong et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 and demonstrated its merits that can effectively avoid over learning and under learning this study also found that d lstm acquired the highest average value and lowest standard deviation using limited data for the local strategy which demonstrated the model has the best accuracy and stability in the areas without complete on the loess plateau the local strategy explained the applicability evaluation of et0 estimating models at each station backdrop that the meteorological data exhibited significant spatiotemporal discrepancies on the loess plateau during 1961 2020 and the cross station k fold cross validation strategy was required to validate the applicability of et0 estimating models in the areas without complete historical meteorological observation data fakheri fard et al 2015 proposed the spatial external s and the temporal local t to evaluate the performance of neuro fuzzy and neural networks models for estimating reference evapotranspiration and they insisted that the external training might be a valid alternative to the more common local training which presents the decisive advantage of not requiring data series in the test station for the application of the training algorithm feng et al 2017b trained tested using the local scenario and the external scenario respectively and the result showed that the elm performed better than grnn for the local scenario while the grnn was slightly superior to elm for the external scenario similar to the conclusion this study also found that locally calibrated models are always more accurate than externally calibrated ones and d lstm performed better than other models for the external strategy the result demonstrated that d lstm has the best applicability in the areas where there is no historical meteorological observation data on the loess plateau hence d lstm is the most recommended et0 estimated model using limited meteorological observation data for local external k fold cross validation strategies which is very helpful for farmers or irrigation system operators to improve their irrigation scheduling 4 5 analysis of uncertainties shortcomings and applications due to the lack of experimental et0 data this study considered et0 obtained by the p m method as the target to evaluate the empirical and dl models although the p m method has successfully been applied in much research fan et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 maroufpoor et al 2020 the confidence of conclusions maybe limited when only calculated et0 was applied in this study according to martí et al 2015 with the conditions permitted the conclusion drawn by the present study should be further tested using measured et0 by eddy covariance systems or lysimeters as the benchmark which is an essential research direction in the future moreover precise irrigation could more benefit from our research directly however our conclusions still get significant application value of irrigation management in a wide area lacking measured data despite the uncertainty introduced by the selection of benchmark furthermore the dl models belong to the black box model which has obvious advantages and disadvantages fan et al 2018 maroufpoor et al 2020 when dealing with complex nonlinear time series problems we not only hope that the model can give correct prediction results but also hope to understand its internal physical mechanism which is impossible for the black box model moreover dl models were very sensitive to the hyper parameters which may lead to convergence instability and over fitting when running the models chen et al 2022 hu et al 2021 for the model uncertainty caused by hyper parameters we proposed the stochastic gradient descent algorithm sgd to fine tune the parameters in recent years with the rapid rise of dl the sgd algorithm has become a mainstream method for solving large scale machine learning optimization problems fjellström and nyström 2022 liu et al 2019 sharma 2018 in this method the gradient of one or several samples is randomly selected to replace the overall gradient in the iterative process thus greatly reducing the computational complexity and avoiding the non convergence problem 5 conclusions this study comparatively evaluated the accuracy between dbn lstm d lstm and nine empirical models for daily et0 estimation using incomplete meteorological data on the loess plateau the conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 the et0 pm trend analysis shows that 18 meteorological stations exhibited significant upward trends p 0 05 and 12 meteorological stations had significant downward trends p 0 05 on the loess plateau during 1961 2020 2 the d lstm best estimates et0 using limited meteorological data for the local and external strategies the deep learning models performed better than the empirical models using rh based and rn based input combinations hs outperformed the dbn3 for the local strategy and was superior to lstm3 for the external strategy 3 the rn based et0 estimating models were superior to rh based and t based models for et0 estimation rh based achieved better accuracy than t based for deep learning models but vice versa for empirical models 4 there are significant spatial discrepancies in the estimation accuracy obtained by daily et0 models and dl based et0 models were more inclined to be affected by radiation and humidity the dbn model is only effective in the

2792,the classic ga model assumes a constant head ponded water and with a saturated water content above the wetting zone which limits its application this study investigated a semi analytical method for predicting rainwater infiltration into an inclined soil interlayer considering time varying head and stratified water content an evolving wetting profile and a half parabolic wetting profile of transient zone were observed during infiltration process based on numerical simulations the water head in the fissure showed a linearly increasing characteristic before the soil interlayer was fully saturated while showed an exponentially increasing feature after the soil interlayer was fully saturated a semi analytical model was subsequently established for predicting the variables time dependent water head and the length of the stratified wetting zone based on the classical ga equation darcy s law and mass conversation law as well as the numerical simulation calibration this semi analytical model describes three specific infiltration scenarios scenarios i ii and iii involving two infiltration modes i e rainfall infiltration and constant head infiltration which were comprehensively shaped by fissure height rain intensity and duration this model has a concise expression satisfying dimensional consistency and can be successfully reduced to the classic ga model the validity of this semi empirical model was further confirmed by numerical simulations which showed good performance by capturing the evolving trends of the water head saturated transitional and wetting zones in the inclined soil interlayer the results and findings deepen the understanding of transient infiltration in rock slopes with inclined soil interlayer and are helpfully for assessing the evolving slope stability during rainfall keywords infiltration model inclined soil interlayer rock slope varying water head stratified water content data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rainfall is one of the most significant triggering factors inducing landslides worldwide as more than 90 of landslides are associated with rain nilsen 1975 yu et al 2014 rainfall is thus of great importance to slope stability gasmo et al 2000 huang et al 2008 muntohar and jiao 2010 ali et al 2014 oh and lu 2015 tang et al 2015a 2015b 2019 cho 2016 li et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 li et al 2019 shen et al 2020 liu et al 2021 among the rainfall induced landslides the bedding rock slope with tensile fissure and soil interlayer widely exist in nature zheng et al 2016 yu et al 2020 such as the dabao mountain landslide yu et al 2020 shown in fig 1 a during the rainfall infiltration process there will be an increase in the soil water content which will result in a reduction of matric suction thereby reduces the anti sliding of the slope baum et al 2010 saito et al 2010 on the other hand continuous high intensity rainfall would rapidly raise the water head in the tension fissure resulting in an increase of the sliding force of the slope yu et al 2022 therefore accurately estimating rainfall infiltration into the inclined soil interlayer is essential for analyzing the evolving slope stability to date substantial efforts have been devoted to tackling infiltration problem a variety of studies focused on a horizontal surface green and ampt 1911 holtan 1961 mein and farrell 1974 philip 1993 corradini et al 1994 ma et al 2010 alastal and ababou 2019 or one with sloping surfaces de ploey et al 1976 mah et al 1992 gasmo et al 2000 chen and young 2006 khan et al 2016 fox et al 2018 capparelli et al 2020 wu et al 2021 among this mentioned infiltration models the green ampt model is the most widely accepted model to estimate the infiltration process of water infiltration into soils liu et al 2008 ma et al 2011 jia et al 2015 because of its simplicity and adaptability for a variety of applications in soil and watershed hydrology the model was initially proposed for analyzing the infiltration process of thin layer ponded water into a homogeneous soil with uniform initial water content assuming a rectangular saturated piston flow which is inconsistent with the actual stratified water content bodman and colman 1944 wang et al 2003 chae and kim 2012 peng et al 2012 mao et al 2016 yu and douglas 2015 as shown in fig 1b after the original model was presented by green and ampt 1911 it was modified by most researches to solve various hydrological problems for example mein and larson 1973 considered constant rainfall intensity alastal and ababou 2019 proposed a generalized green ampt approach for vertical unsaturated flows but they did not consider variable water head and inclined infiltration philip 1992 1993 explored the falling head green ampt equation and variable head ponded infiltration under constant or variable rainfall but he did not consider inclined infiltration and stratified water content chen and young 2006 also explored it for sloping surfaces but they did not consider variable water head and stratified water content in addition loáiciga and johnson 2018 researched the sloping terrain and its role on runoff generation and slope stability yao et al 2019 proposed an infiltration runoff model for a homogeneous slope considering transient zone length equals saturation zone length liu et al 2021 derived a new green ampt model based on fractional derivative and applied it to three dimensional slope stability analysis however they did not consider variable water head infiltration reconnaissance of literature revealed that the infiltration behavior of inclined soil interlayer considering variable water head infiltration and evolving stratified water content has received little attention none of these modifications could deal with the cases of variable water head infiltration of inclined soil interlayer with an outlet and a tensile fissure under rainfall infiltration as shown in fig 1b consequently it is urgent and essential to develop an infiltration model to predict the time varying water head and evolving stratified wetting zone which is valuable in the fields of hydrology and geotechnical engineering in this paper the time varying characteristic of water head and wetting profiles were first obtained based on numerical simulations the water head and stratified wetting zone length including saturated and transient zones were then quantitatively characterized subsequently we analyzed the influence of fissure height rain intensity and duration on infiltration modes based on these quantitative analyses we established a semi analytical model for predicting rainwater into the inclined soil interlayer considering time varying water head and stratified water content finally the validity and applicability of the proposed model were discussed 2 methodology 2 1 classic green ampt model based on darcy s law and the assumption of piston type saturated soil water movement a classic theoretical formula for water infiltration into a homogeneous soil with a uniform water content was proposed by green and ampt 1911 1 q in θ s θ m t l m k s 1 ψ f h f l m where q in m s denotes infiltration rate k s m s denotes saturated hydraulic conductivity h f m denotes the constant water head on the infiltration surface ψ f m denotes the suction head at sharp wetting front l m m denotes equivalent depth of saturated wetting front θ s θ m denotes the initial moisture deficit integrating eq 1 and substituting l m 0 at t 0 an implicit function for the wetting front depth l m corresponds to the time t can be expressed as follow 2 t θ s θ m k s l m ψ f h f ln l m ψ f h f 1 as depicted in fig 1c the ga model assumes that a constant water head h f covers the soil surface continuously a sharp wetting front is considered to separate the wetting and initial zone during water infiltration these assumptions limit the applications of this model 2 2 conceptual model for rainwater infiltration into the slope the conceptual model for rainwater infiltration into the slope is shown in fig 1b as the suction can substantially affect the distribution of water content the stratified water content was widely observed bodman and colman 1944 wang et al 2003 chae and kim 2012 peng et al 2012 yu and douglas 2015 mao et al 2016 this study divides the stratified wetting zone above the wetting front into two zones a saturated zone and a transient zone as shown in fig 1b considering that the hydraulic conductivity of rock mass is minimal we simplify the conceptual model the inclined soil interlayer cut by a vertical tensile fissure hereafter referred to simply as the soil interlayer as shown in fig 1b in the actual slope the thickness of soil interlayer is usually as thin as centimeters the fissure height is several meters to tens of meters and the ratio of fissure height to the soil interlayer length set as l 0 10 m in this study is usually much less than 0 5 zheng et al 2016 yu et al 2020 note that other lengths in this study are calibrated by the soil interlayer length l 0 based on the consideration of model scale and numerical calculation efficiency a

researchers e g rawls et al 1983 chen et al 2006 infiltration boundary condition was set as unit flux boundary i e rain intensity q ra before the tensile fissure is filled with rainwater as shown in fig 2a besides we set a surface layer i e influent surface to tell the solver that it should track seepage face flows and infiltration events for any unit flux boundary condition as a result rainwater that does not immediately infiltrate the ground is not considered to be lost from the analysis but it is assumed to pond and form a positive pressure head applied to the influent surface this is a general method of setting infiltration boundary when rainfall rate is greater than the infiltration capacity of soil in addition infiltration boundary changes from unit flux boundary to constant head boundary after the tensile fissure with the height set as h f 0 5l 0 is full of rainwater i e water head h f h f 0 5l 0 as shown in fig 2b besides a free drainage bottom boundary condition i e outlet

head h s corresponding to the characteristic time t s 28 h s b 1 t s t c fig 4 shows the characteristic height and characteristic time versus rain intensity curves of sand which is an example illustrating the general changing law of common soils the infiltration mode of the soil interlayer can be judged based on the relation h f and h s as well as rainfall duration as shown in table 2 and fig 4 the relation between h f and h s is h f h s when h f 0 217 l 0 i e th f t s as shown in fig 4b which indicates the soil will undergo the infiltration mode from rainfall to constant head infiltration in contrast the soil interlayer is always in the rain infiltration mode when h f 1 38l 0 i e h f h s th f t s as shown in fig 4c when the fissure height h f is between 0 217l 0 1 38l 0 and rain intensity qra ranges from 1 0 10 4 m s to 2 3 10 4 m s i e h f h s thf t s the soil interlayer is always in the rainfall infiltration mode when the rain intensity ranges from 2 3 10 4 to 10 10 4 m s the soil interlayer will undergo infiltration mode from rainfall to constant head infiltration as shown in fig 4d since the infiltration process of soil interlayer is the most complicated and common situation when the fissure height h f is in the range of 0 217l 0 1 38l 0 we take h f 0 5l 0 as an example to establish the semi analytical model for rainwater infiltration into the inclined soil interlayer under different rain intensities and durations as presented below 3 4 model establishment as described in section 3 3 the infiltration mode of the inclined soil interlayer can be divided into two modes i e rainfall infiltration and constant head infiltration the soil interlayer with a fissure height of 0 5l 0 has three infiltration scenarios named as scenarios i ii and iii scenario i happens when the water reaches the fissure height after the soil interlayer is fully saturated scenario ii happens when the water reaches the fissure height between the transient zone reaching the outlet and the complete saturation of the interlayer lastly scenario iii happens when the water reaches the fissure height even before the transient zone reaches the outlet the semi analytical equations for the three scenarios are shown in tables 3 4 and 5 respectively infiltration details are shown in fig 5 3 4 1 infiltration model for scenario i scenario i stage 1 stage 1

variables and characteristics time a series of simulations under different rainfall intensities were conducted to verify the proposed semi analytical model fig 6 also shows that the semi analytical model solid lines performs well by capturing changing trends of the variables i e h t l s l t and l m based on numerical simulation solid points in the three infiltration scenarios these variable curves of the three soils exhibit similar variation trends a noticeable difference is that the length of transition zone is the shortest for sand followed by silt and the longest for clay it means that the wetting front of sand a smaller value of β is more inclined to the saturated piston type movement assumed by the ga model while the wetting front of clay a bigger value of β is more deviated from the saturated piston type movement here the sand is taken as an example to illustrate the general changing law of the variables for the three infiltration scenarios scenario i it can be seen from fig 6a that the inclined soil interlayer is always in the mode of rainfall infiltration for the rain duration between t c and t s the water head h t increases linearly with the slope equal to b 1 in eq 9 the water head shows a nonlinear increasing trend when t s t t hf the length of the wetting zone l m increases linearly under the condition of t c t t ex reaches the maximum value when t t ex and then remains constant the length of saturated zone l s increases linearly when t c t t s while for the condition of t t s the soil interlayer is entirely saturated and l s keeps equal to the length of the soil interlayer i e l m l s l 0 when it comes to the length of the transient zone l t it can be found to be relatively stable when t c t t ex and decreases rapidly until it decreases to zero after the wetting front in the transient zone reaches the outlet in the case of t t ex this result is attributed to the constant value of l m l m l s l t l 0 10 m when t ex t t s scenario ii as shown in fig 6b the rainfall infiltration stage accounts for most of the rain duration i e t c th f while the constant head infiltration stage only occurs during a small interval of rain duration i e th f t s the stage of rainfall infiltration of the soil interlayer occurs when t c t th f the water head shows a linear increase with the slope of b 1 in this stage while the constant head infiltration stage happens only when th f t t s and the water head remains constant that is h t h f 0 5l 0 in addition l m in fig 6b shows a similar changing law under t c t t s during the time interval of t c t t hf the saturation zone length l s shows a parallel linear increase trend with l m and l t changes in the same way as l t in fig 6a scenario iii contrary to the results in fig 6a and b the results in fig 6c are characterized by the rainfall infiltration stage with a small proportion of period t c th f and the constant head infiltration stage with a large proportion t hf t s when t c t t hf the water head h t keeps increasing linearly with the slope equal to b 1 and then remains a constant value same as that of h f after the fissure is full of water when th f t t s the wetting zone length l m increases approximately linearly in the rainfall infiltration stage while increases nonlinearly in the constant water head infiltration stage and reaches its maximum value at t t ex that is l m l 0 after which l m shows a flat trend as for the saturated zone length l s it also presents a parallel linear increase trend with l m in the case of t c t t hf while it shows a nonlinear increasing trend and reaches the maximum value same as that of l 0 when t t s during the period of th f t s fig 7 shows the characteristic time versus time curves of sand which is taken as an example to illustrate the general changing law of common soils the lowest navy line standing for the time t c is close to zero indicating that the boundary surface for infiltration of the inclined soil interlayer soon reaches the critical saturation state i e the water head just starts to rise it can be seen that when the rain intensity q ra is between 1 and 2 3 10 4 m s the time t h f required for the soil interlayer to be saturated and with fissure filling decreases rapidly meanwhile under the condition of rain intensity between 2 3 and 2 41 10 4 m s the time interval is short between the fissure filled with water and the soil interlayer reaching a saturated state the relation t ex t hf t s between characteristic time can be observed lastly for the rain intensity varies from 2 41 10 4 m s to 10 10 4 m s the total time t s required for the soil interlayer to be completely saturated and fissure to be filled with water shows a gentle decreasing trend under different rain intensity the decreasing trend is mainly attributed to the change from rainfall infiltration mode to constant head infiltration mode after the fissure is filled with water and the rain intensity slightly influences the amount of water infiltration under this condition 4 2 verification of the semi analytical model 4 2 1 predicted values versus numerical results the fitted slopes of the water head saturated zone length transient zone length and wetting zone length are close to 1 as shown in fig 8 a detail shown in fig a3 besides the absolute differences δs calculated by eq 40 are less than 0 06 fig 8b these indexes indicate a good prediction performance of the proposed model in addition slope curves change relatively gently when β is in the range from 10 to 2 and change rapidly when β is from 2 to 0 5 fig 8b this indicates that the β has a slight influence on the predicted accuracy of the proposed model when it is between 10 and 2 while it has a relatively obvious influence on the predicted accuracy when β is between 2 and 0 5 40 δ s s 1 where the s denotes the fitted slope of the variables i e h t l s l t l m δs denotes the absolute difference of slope 4 2 2 error sensitivity analysis for wetting zone length as presented in section 4 1 the saturated zone length based on the semi analytical model is basically consistent with the numerical simulation the variables of the three representative soils have the same infiltration evolution trend and the difference is that a larger β value has a longer transition zone in the same infiltration scenario which means that the more the wetting front deviates from piston type saturation motion assumed by the ga model in this section the absolute difference δl m δl t and relative difference δ are adopted to study the error sensitivity of variables of the semi analytical model and ga model to wetting zone length which are given as follows 41 δ l m l m l m l t l t δ l t 42 δ l m l m l m l t l t l m where l m and l t denote the length of wetting zone and transient zone based on numerical simulation the variables of rq and r t are defined for the convenience of comparative studies 43 r q q ra k s r t t t sum where the characteristic time t sum corresponds to the moment the soil interlayer is fully saturated and the fissure is filled with rainwater as depicted in fig 9 a c and e soil type i e factor β rainfall duration and r q affect the absolute difference δl m δl t the δl m δl t versus r t curves show oscillatory characteristics with r t which is determined by the difference between the semi analytical predicted values and the numerical results under different infiltration stages of three infiltration scenarios refer to fig 6 for details most notably the δl m δl t for the sand appears to be among the smallest the absolute differences of sand are generally less than 0 2 m the differences of silt are generally less than 0 5 m and the clay has a wide range of differences within 0 3 m besides the absolute difference δl m δl t versus r t curves shows a tendency to increase with the decrease of β the absolute difference δl m δl t and relative difference δ in the initial infiltration stage increase with the increase of rainfall intensity in addition the relative differences at the early infiltration stage are relatively significant accounting for 0 4 0 6 of wetting zone length fig 9b d and f in contrast the relative differences of the three soils are generally below 0 1 in most rainfall periods i e r t range from 0 2 to 1 0 which indicates that the semi analytical model has a high accuracy for predicting of the wetting zone length for most rainfall periods 5 discussion the theoretical part of the semi analytical model originates from the classic ga equation darcy s law and mass conservation law while the empirical parts result from the finite element numerical simulation unlike water infiltration into the soil by assuming a constant head with saturated soil water content the time varying water head makes the formula manipulations complicated or impossible which obstructs the derivation of exact explicit and theoretical analytical formulas for rainwater inflow into the inclined soil interlayer nevertheless from a practical perspective the semi analytical model proposed in this study is accurate enough to predict the rainwater infiltration into the inclined soil interlayer considering the variable head with evolving wetting profile some assumptions are used in the derivation of the semi analytical model specifically the soil is assumed to be homogenous and its initial water content is also homogenous however these two assumptions are not always true especially in heterogeneous soil in addition another simplification that needs to be concerned with is that the rainfall intensity is assumed to be a constant value however steady rainfall rarely occurs during most natural rainfall events therefore a more sophisticated analytical model that considers the time varying rain might need to be developed for further study nonetheless the newly developed semi analytical model with the theoretical analysis results put an important set toward describing rainfall infiltration under more complex situations 5 1 semi analytical model versus ga model the index of absolute difference δl m and relative difference δ ga in the three infiltration scenarios i e scenarios ⅰ ⅱ iii were used to evaluate our model performance which is given as 44 δ l m l m l m δ ga l m l m l m as depicted in fig 10 the soil type i e factor β rainfall duration and r q significantly affect the δl t and δ ga the curves of δl m show a tendency to increase with the decrease of β fig 10a c and e most notably the δl t for the sand appears to be among the smallest another distinguishing feature is that δl m tends to decrease with the increase of rainfall intensities q ra fig 10a c and e besides the absolute difference δl m of sand is less than 0 7 m silt is less than 4 m and clay is less than 6 m it can be seen that the soil water motion of sand is closest to the saturated piston type motion assumption of the ga model and the higher the rain intensity the closer it is to the saturated piston type motion assumption the absolute difference and relative difference are not so significant when ga is applied to sand but it will lead to a significant difference when applied to predict the wetting zone length of silt and clay especially clay hence it is essential to divide the wetting zone into stratified wetting zone otherwise the prediction of wetting zone length will cause a significant difference especially for silt and clay 5 2 water pressure distribution along the soil interlayer rainfall infiltration on the one hand will reduces the matric suction within wetting zone and on the other hand generate hydrostatic pressure in the saturated zone this change will decrease the anti sliding force and increase the sliding force of slope thereby reducing slope stability consequently when evaluating the stability of slope under rainfall infiltration it is essential to investigate the evolving characteristics of stratified wetting zone i e saturated zone and transient zone the positive water pressure and negative water pressure opposite to the matric suction sign on the soil interlayer of the semi analytical model and ga model can be yielded by eq 45 and eq 46 respectively

are shown in fig 11 for the semi analytical model the positive water pressure is only distributed within the saturated zone however the ga model increases the distribution range of positive pressure and changes the distribution range of unsaturated zone transient zone and initial zone fig 12 shows the distribution of positive and negative water pressure at a specific time as the transient zone is not considered the positive and negative water pressure based on the ga model is obviously different from the real distribution obtained by numerical simulation the positive water pressure based on the semi analytical model is basically consistent with the numerical simulation but the negative water pressure in the transition zone is not consistent with the actual situation better this is because the negative water pressure is very sensitive to water content especially a tiny change in water content will lead to larger negative water changes when water content is close to the residual water content fig 3 however the semi analytical model has the distribution characteristic of stratified water pressure which is slight close to the real situation it still has apparent advantages for calculating the dynamic slope stability coefficient during rainfall 6 conclusions this paper investigated the prediction of rainwater infiltration into the inclined soil considering time varying water head and stratified water content the infiltration variables were first derived based on the ga equation classic law and simulation calibration then the influences of rain intensity duration and fissure height on the infiltration modes were analyzed and finally a semi analytical infiltration model was established this model describes three infiltration scenarios scenarios i ii and iii at different levels of rainfall intensity involving two infiltration modes i e rainfall infiltration and constant head infiltration which were comprehensively shaped by fissure height rain intensity and duration in this model the water head the saturated zone s length the unsaturated zone s length and the wetting zone s length were represented as a function of measurable soil properties initial moisture content saturated moisture content suction head rainfall intensity etc this model has a concise expression satisfying the dimensional consistency and can be successfully reduced to the classic ga model the validity of this semi empirical model was confirmed by numerical simulations this model was better than the classic ga model in predicting slope stability using the pressure as the metric the results and findings enrich the understanding of transient infiltration in rock slope with inclined soil interlayer and are helpfully for assessing the evolving slope stability during

2792,the classic ga model assumes a constant head ponded water and with a saturated water content above the wetting zone which limits its application this study investigated a semi analytical method for predicting rainwater infiltration into an inclined soil interlayer considering time varying head and stratified water content an evolving wetting profile and a half parabolic wetting profile of transient zone were observed during infiltration process based on numerical simulations the water head in the fissure showed a linearly increasing characteristic before the soil interlayer was fully saturated while showed an exponentially increasing feature after the soil interlayer was fully saturated a semi analytical model was subsequently established for predicting the variables time dependent water head and the length of the stratified wetting zone based on the classical ga equation darcy s law and mass conversation law as well as the numerical simulation calibration this semi analytical model describes three specific infiltration scenarios scenarios i ii and iii involving two infiltration modes i e rainfall infiltration and constant head infiltration which were comprehensively shaped by fissure height rain intensity and duration this model has a concise expression satisfying dimensional consistency and can be successfully reduced to the classic ga model the

et al 2020 such as the dabao mountain landslide yu et al 2020 shown in fig 1 a during the rainfall infiltration process there will be an increase in the soil water content which will result in a reduction of matric suction thereby reduces the anti sliding of the slope baum et al 2010 saito et al 2010 on the other hand continuous high intensity rainfall would rapidly raise the water head in the tension fissure resulting in an increase of the sliding force of the slope yu et al 2022 therefore accurately estimating rainfall infiltration into the inclined soil interlayer is essential for

initially proposed for analyzing the infiltration process of thin layer ponded water into a homogeneous soil with uniform initial water content assuming a rectangular saturated piston flow which is inconsistent with the actual stratified water content bodman and colman 1944 wang et al 2003 chae and kim 2012 peng et al 2012 mao et al 2016 yu and douglas 2015 as shown in fig 1b after the original model was presented by green and ampt 1911 it was modified by most researches to solve various hydrological problems for example mein and larson 1973 considered constant rainfall intensity alastal and ababou 2019 proposed a generalized green ampt approach for vertical unsaturated flows but they did not consider variable water head and inclined infiltration philip 1992 1993 explored the falling head green ampt equation and variable head ponded infiltration under constant or variable rainfall but he did not consider inclined infiltration and stratified water content chen and young 2006 also explored it for sloping surfaces but they did not consider variable water head and stratified water content in addition loáiciga and johnson 2018 researched the sloping terrain and its role on runoff generation and slope stability yao et al 2019 proposed an infiltration runoff model for a homogeneous slope considering transient zone length equals saturation zone length liu et al 2021 derived a new green ampt model based on fractional derivative and applied it to three dimensional slope stability analysis however they did not consider variable water head infiltration reconnaissance of literature revealed that the infiltration behavior of inclined soil interlayer considering variable water head infiltration and evolving stratified water content has received little attention none of these modifications could deal with the cases of variable water head infiltration of inclined soil interlayer with an outlet and a tensile fissure under rainfall infiltration as shown in fig 1b consequently it is urgent and essential to develop an infiltration model to predict the time varying water head and evolving stratified wetting zone which is valuable in the fields of hydrology and geotechnical engineering in this paper the time varying characteristic of water head and wetting profiles were first obtained based on numerical simulations the water head and stratified wetting zone length including saturated and transient zones were then quantitatively characterized subsequently we analyzed the influence of fissure height rain intensity and duration on infiltration modes based on these quantitative analyses we established a semi analytical model for predicting rainwater into the inclined soil interlayer considering time varying water head and stratified water content finally the validity and applicability of the proposed model were discussed 2 methodology 2 1 classic green ampt model based on darcy s law and the assumption of piston type saturated soil water movement a classic theoretical formula for water infiltration into a homogeneous soil with a uniform water content was proposed by green and ampt 1911 1 q in θ s θ m t l m k s 1 ψ f h f l m where q in m s

continuously a sharp wetting front is considered to separate the wetting and initial zone during water infiltration these assumptions limit the applications of this model 2 2 conceptual model for rainwater infiltration into the slope the conceptual model for rainwater infiltration into the slope is shown in fig 1b as the suction can substantially affect the distribution of water content the stratified water content was widely observed bodman and colman 1944 wang et al 2003 chae and kim 2012 peng et al 2012 yu and douglas 2015 mao et al 2016 this study divides the stratified wetting zone above the wetting front into two zones a saturated zone and a transient zone as shown in fig 1b considering that the hydraulic conductivity of rock mass is minimal we simplify the conceptual model the inclined soil interlayer cut by a vertical tensile fissure hereafter referred to simply as the soil interlayer as shown in fig 1b in the actual slope the thickness of soil interlayer is usually as thin as centimeters the fissure height is several meters to tens of meters and the ratio of fissure height to the soil interlayer length set as l 0 10 m in this study is usually much less than 0 5 zheng et al 2016 yu et al 2020 note that other lengths in this study are calibrated by the soil interlayer length l 0 based on the consideration of model scale and numerical calculation efficiency a representative numerical model was established in this study as shown in fig 2 the simulated results were used to investigate the quantitative relationships of the variables time dependent water head and the length of the stratified wetting zone and verify the reliability of the derived analytical solutions simulations were carried out with three representative soils i e sand silt and clay rainfall intensities were set at 1 10 times of the saturated conductivity k s table 1 of the soil materials in the numerical simulations to ensure that rainwater could be stored in the fissure during rainfall the gardner model has been widely used to obtain many analytical solutions to unsaturated infiltration problems philip 1987 srivastava and yeh 1991 and is written in terms of matric suction

researchers e g rawls et al 1983 chen et al 2006 infiltration boundary condition was set as unit flux boundary i e rain intensity q ra before the tensile fissure is filled with rainwater as shown in fig 2a besides we set a surface layer i e influent surface to tell the solver that it should track seepage face flows and infiltration events for any unit flux boundary condition as a result rainwater that does not immediately infiltrate the ground is not considered to be lost from the analysis but it is assumed to pond and form a positive pressure head applied to the influent surface this is a general method of setting infiltration boundary when rainfall rate is greater than the infiltration capacity of soil in addition infiltration boundary changes from unit flux boundary to constant head boundary after the tensile fissure with the height set as h f 0 5l 0 is full of rainwater i e water head h f h f 0 5l 0 as shown in fig 2b besides a free drainage bottom boundary condition i e outlet is considered at the lowest of the inclined soil interlayer the infiltration process in the two dimensional homogeneous soil interlayer under rainfall was simulated by the seep w module in geostudio

head h s corresponding to the characteristic time t s 28 h s b 1 t s t c fig 4 shows the characteristic height and characteristic time versus rain intensity curves of sand which is an example illustrating the general changing law of common soils the infiltration mode of the soil interlayer can be judged based on the relation h f and h s as well as rainfall duration as shown in table 2 and fig 4 the relation between h f and h s is h f h s when h f 0 217 l 0 i e th f t s as shown in fig 4b which indicates the soil will undergo the infiltration mode from rainfall to constant head infiltration in contrast the soil interlayer is always in the rain infiltration mode when h f 1 38l 0 i e h f h s th f t s as shown in fig 4c when the fissure height h f is between 0 217l 0 1 38l 0 and rain intensity qra ranges from 1 0 10 4 m s to 2 3 10 4 m s i e h f h s thf t s the soil interlayer is always in the rainfall infiltration mode when the rain intensity ranges from 2 3 10 4 to 10 10 4 m s the soil interlayer will undergo infiltration mode from rainfall to constant head infiltration as shown in fig 4d since the infiltration process of soil interlayer is the most complicated and common situation when the fissure height h f is in the range of 0 217l 0 1 38l 0 we take h f 0 5l 0 as an example to establish the semi analytical model for rainwater infiltration into the inclined soil interlayer under different rain intensities and durations as presented below 3 4 model establishment as described in section 3 3 the infiltration mode of the inclined soil interlayer can be divided into two modes i e rainfall infiltration and constant head infiltration the soil interlayer with a fissure height of 0 5l 0 has three infiltration scenarios named as scenarios i ii and iii scenario i happens when the water reaches the fissure height after the soil interlayer is fully saturated scenario ii happens when the water reaches the fissure height between the transient zone reaching the outlet and the complete saturation of the interlayer lastly scenario iii happens when the water reaches the fissure height even before the transient zone reaches the outlet the semi analytical equations for the three scenarios are shown in tables 3 4 and 5 respectively infiltration details are shown in fig 5 3 4 1 infiltration model for scenario i scenario i stage 1 stage 1

variables and characteristics time a series of simulations under different rainfall intensities were conducted to verify the proposed semi analytical model fig 6 also shows that the semi analytical model solid lines performs well by capturing changing trends of the variables i e h t l s l t and l m based on numerical simulation solid points in the three infiltration scenarios these variable curves of the three soils exhibit similar variation trends a noticeable difference is that the length of transition zone is the shortest for sand followed by silt and the longest for clay it means that the wetting front of sand a smaller value of β is more inclined to the saturated piston type movement assumed by the ga model while the wetting front of clay a bigger value of β is more deviated from the saturated piston type movement here the sand is taken as an example to illustrate the general changing law of the variables for the three infiltration scenarios scenario i it can be seen from fig 6a that the inclined soil interlayer is always in the mode of rainfall infiltration for the rain duration between t c and t s the water head h t increases linearly with the slope equal to b 1 in eq 9 the water head shows a nonlinear increasing trend when t s t t hf the length of the wetting zone l m increases linearly under the condition of t c t t ex reaches the maximum value when t t ex and then remains constant the length of saturated zone l s increases linearly when t c t t s while for the condition of t t s the soil interlayer is entirely saturated and l s keeps equal to the length of the soil interlayer i e l m l s l 0 when it comes to the length of the transient zone l t it can be found to be relatively stable when t c t t ex and decreases rapidly until it decreases to zero after the wetting front in the transient zone reaches the outlet in the case of t t ex this result is attributed to the constant value of l m l m l s l t l 0 10 m when t ex t t s scenario ii as shown in fig 6b the rainfall infiltration stage accounts for most of the rain duration i e t c th f while the constant head infiltration stage only occurs during a small interval of rain duration i e th f t s the stage of rainfall infiltration of the soil interlayer occurs when t c t th f the water head shows a linear increase with the slope of b 1 in this stage while the constant head infiltration stage happens only when th f t t s and the water head remains constant that is h t h f 0 5l 0 in addition l m in fig 6b shows a similar changing law under t c t t s during the time interval of t c t t hf the saturation zone length l s shows a parallel linear increase trend with l m and l t changes in the same way as l t in fig 6a scenario iii contrary to the results in fig 6a and b the results in fig 6c are characterized by the rainfall infiltration stage with a small proportion of period t c th f and the constant head infiltration stage with a large proportion t hf t s when t c t t hf the water head h t keeps increasing linearly with the slope equal to b 1 and then remains a constant value same as that of h f after the fissure is full of water when th f t t s the wetting zone length l m increases approximately linearly in the rainfall infiltration stage while increases nonlinearly in the constant water head infiltration stage and reaches its maximum value at t t ex that is l m l 0 after which l m shows a flat trend as for the saturated zone length l s it also presents a parallel linear increase trend with l m in the case of t c t t hf while it shows a nonlinear increasing trend and reaches the maximum value same as that of l 0 when t t s during the period of th f t s fig 7 shows the characteristic time versus time curves of sand which is taken as an example to illustrate the general changing law of common soils the lowest navy line standing for the time t c is close to zero indicating that the boundary surface for infiltration of the inclined soil interlayer soon reaches the critical saturation state i e the water head just starts to rise it can be seen that when the rain intensity q ra is between 1 and 2 3 10 4 m s the time t h f required for the soil interlayer to be saturated and with fissure filling decreases rapidly meanwhile under the condition of rain intensity between 2 3 and 2 41 10 4 m s the time interval is short between the fissure filled with water and the soil interlayer reaching a saturated state the relation t ex t hf t s between characteristic time can be observed lastly for the rain intensity varies from 2 41 10 4 m s to 10 10 4 m s the total time t s required for the soil interlayer to be completely saturated and fissure to be filled with water shows a gentle decreasing trend under different rain intensity the decreasing trend is mainly attributed to the change from rainfall infiltration mode to constant head infiltration mode after the fissure is filled with water and the rain intensity slightly influences the amount of water infiltration under this condition 4 2 verification of the semi analytical model 4 2 1 predicted values versus numerical results the fitted slopes of the water head saturated zone length transient zone length and wetting zone length are close to 1 as shown in fig 8 a detail shown in fig a3 besides the absolute differences δs calculated by eq 40 are less than 0 06 fig 8b these indexes indicate a good prediction performance of the proposed model in addition slope curves change relatively gently when β is in the range from 10 to 2 and change rapidly when β is from 2 to 0 5 fig 8b this indicates that the β has a slight influence on the predicted accuracy of the proposed model when it is between 10 and 2 while it has a relatively obvious influence on the predicted accuracy when β is between 2 and 0 5 40 δ s s 1 where the s denotes the fitted slope of the variables i e h t l s l t l m δs denotes the absolute difference of slope 4 2 2 error sensitivity analysis for wetting zone length as presented in section 4 1 the saturated zone length based on the semi analytical model is basically consistent with the numerical simulation the variables of the three representative soils have the same infiltration evolution trend and the difference is that a larger β value has a longer transition zone in the same infiltration scenario which means that the more the wetting front deviates from piston type saturation motion assumed by the ga model in this section the absolute difference δl m δl t and relative difference δ are adopted to study the error sensitivity of variables of the semi analytical model and ga model to wetting zone length which are given as follows 41 δ l m l m l m l t l t δ l t 42 δ l m l m l m l t l t l m where l m and l t denote the length of wetting zone and transient zone based on numerical simulation the variables of rq and r t are defined for the convenience of comparative studies 43 r q q ra k s r t t t sum where the characteristic time t sum corresponds to the moment the soil interlayer is fully saturated and the fissure is filled with rainwater as depicted in fig 9 a c and e soil type i e factor β rainfall duration and r q affect the absolute difference δl m δl t the δl m δl t versus r t curves show oscillatory characteristics with r t which is determined by the difference between the semi analytical predicted values and the numerical results under different infiltration stages of three infiltration scenarios refer to fig 6 for details most notably the δl m δl t for the sand appears to be among the smallest the absolute differences of sand are generally less than 0 2 m the differences of silt are generally less than 0 5 m and the clay has a wide range of differences within 0 3 m besides the absolute difference δl m δl t versus r t curves shows a tendency to increase with the decrease of β the absolute difference δl m δl t and relative difference δ in the initial infiltration stage increase with the increase of rainfall intensity in addition the relative differences at the early infiltration stage are relatively significant accounting for 0 4 0 6 of wetting zone length fig 9b d and f in contrast the relative differences of the three soils are generally below 0 1 in most rainfall periods i e r t range from 0 2 to 1 0 which indicates that the semi analytical model has a high accuracy for predicting of the wetting zone length for most rainfall periods 5 discussion the theoretical part of the semi analytical model originates from the classic ga equation darcy s law and mass conservation law while the empirical parts result from the finite element numerical simulation unlike water infiltration into the soil by assuming a constant head with saturated soil water content the time varying water head makes the formula manipulations complicated or impossible which obstructs the derivation of exact explicit and theoretical analytical formulas for rainwater inflow into the inclined soil interlayer nevertheless from a practical perspective the semi analytical model proposed in this study is accurate enough to predict the rainwater infiltration into the inclined soil interlayer considering the variable head with evolving wetting profile some assumptions are used in the derivation of the semi analytical model specifically the soil is assumed to be homogenous and its initial water content is also homogenous however these two assumptions are not always true especially in heterogeneous soil in addition another simplification that needs to be concerned with is that the rainfall intensity is assumed to be a constant value however steady rainfall rarely occurs during most natural rainfall events therefore a more sophisticated analytical model that considers the time varying rain might need to be developed for further study nonetheless the newly developed semi analytical model with the theoretical analysis results put an important set toward describing rainfall infiltration under more complex situations 5 1 semi analytical model versus ga model the index of absolute difference δl m and relative difference δ ga in the three infiltration scenarios i e scenarios ⅰ ⅱ iii were used to evaluate our model performance which is given as 44 δ l m l m l m δ ga l m l m l m as depicted in fig 10 the soil type i e factor β rainfall duration and r q significantly affect the δl t and δ ga the curves of δl m show a tendency to increase with the decrease of β fig 10a c and e most notably the δl t for the sand appears to be among the smallest another distinguishing feature is that δl m tends to decrease with the increase of rainfall intensities q ra fig 10a c and e besides the absolute difference δl m of sand is less than 0 7 m silt is less than 4 m and clay is less than 6 m it can be seen that the soil water motion of sand is closest to the saturated piston type motion assumption of the ga model and the higher the rain intensity the closer it is to the saturated piston type motion assumption the absolute difference and relative difference are not so significant when ga is applied to sand but it will lead to a significant difference when applied to predict the wetting zone length of silt and clay especially clay hence it is essential to divide the wetting zone into stratified wetting zone otherwise the prediction of wetting zone length will cause a significant difference especially for silt and clay 5 2 water pressure distribution along the soil interlayer rainfall infiltration on the one hand will reduces the matric suction within wetting zone and on the other hand generate hydrostatic pressure in the saturated zone this change will decrease the anti sliding force and increase the sliding force of slope thereby reducing slope stability consequently when evaluating the stability of slope under rainfall infiltration it is essential to investigate the evolving characteristics of stratified wetting zone i e saturated zone and transient zone the positive water pressure and negative water pressure opposite to the matric suction sign on the soil interlayer of the semi analytical model and ga model can be yielded by eq 45 and eq 46 respectively

are shown in fig 11 for the semi analytical model the positive water pressure is only distributed within the saturated zone however the ga model increases the distribution range of positive pressure and changes the distribution range of unsaturated zone transient zone and initial zone fig 12 shows the distribution of positive and negative water pressure at a specific time as the transient zone is not considered the positive and negative water pressure based on the ga model is obviously different from the real distribution obtained by numerical simulation the positive water pressure based on the semi analytical model is basically consistent with the numerical simulation but the negative water pressure in the transition zone is not consistent with the actual situation better this is because the negative water pressure is very sensitive to water content especially a tiny change in water content will lead to larger negative water changes when water content is close to the residual water content fig 3 however the semi analytical model has the distribution characteristic of stratified water pressure which is slight close to the real situation it still has apparent advantages for calculating the dynamic slope stability coefficient during rainfall 6 conclusions this paper investigated the prediction of rainwater infiltration into the inclined soil considering time varying water head and stratified water content the infiltration variables were first derived based on the ga equation classic law and simulation calibration then the influences of rain intensity duration and fissure height on the infiltration modes were analyzed and finally a semi analytical infiltration model was established this model describes three infiltration scenarios scenarios i ii and iii at different levels of rainfall intensity involving two infiltration modes i e rainfall infiltration and constant head infiltration which were comprehensively shaped by fissure height rain intensity and duration in this model the water head the saturated zone s length the unsaturated zone s length and the wetting zone s length were represented as a function of measurable soil properties initial moisture content saturated moisture content suction head rainfall intensity etc this model has a concise expression satisfying the dimensional consistency and can be successfully reduced to the classic ga model the validity of this semi empirical model was confirmed by numerical simulations this model was better than the classic ga model in predicting slope stability using the pressure as the metric the results and findings enrich the understanding of transient infiltration in rock slope with inclined soil interlayer and are helpfully for assessing the evolving slope stability during

2793,space geodetic techniques are rapidly emerging as powerful tools for drought monitoring including the global navigation satellite system gnss positioning data and the gravimetric data from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on grace fo satellite missions however while gnss based 3d displacements have high temporal resolution they are impacted by diverse local effects especially for tectonically active regions satellite gravimetry derived terrestrial water storage changes δtws are continuous in temporal sampling however at much coarser spatial resolutions and there are systematic noise and a large 11 month data gap between grace and grace fo observations here for the first time we developed an optimized gnss grace grace fo hydrological drought index oghdi by optimally combining two drought indices derived from gnss vertical displacements vds and grace grace fo δtws to better characterize decadal evolution of droughts over southwest china 2011 2020 the optimal relative weights of the two drought indices are determined through maximizing the correlations with the composite index ci commonly used in the study region then oghdi is compared to the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi the results show that vds agree well with δtws at most of the 30 analyzed gnss sites with a mean correlation of 0 44 compared to the drought index developed using only gnss data the optimized technique improved the oghdi scpdsi correlations at 90 27 sites of the sites with the highest correlation reaches 0 73 further more significant improvement is found at the regional scale than at individual sites and the regional mean oghdi ci and oghdi scpdsi correlations increase from 0 37 to 0 57 and from 0 42 to 0 68 respectively all drought indices show that southwest china experienced two sustained and excessive drought periods from 2011 to mid 2013 and after 2019 we conclude that the novel integration of two distinct contemporary and complemenatry geodetic datasets gnss and grace grace fo improved the ability of drought monitoring in southwest china keywords gnss vertical displacement grace grace follow on drought index data availability i have shared my link to the data in the manuscript 1 introduction droughts inflict regional and even global water and food shortages and economy crisis a precise drought index is crucial to monitor the evolutions of drought episodes and for timely response towards the potential mitigation of the associated economic and other losses hydrological drought is defined as a deficit of accessible surface and subsurface water storage with respect to normal conditions various hydrological drought indices have been developed based on ground based observations loon 2015 such as the surface water supply index shafer and dezman 1982 and the streamflow drought index nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 these indices have been proven to be valuable tools for drought assessment however in situ measurements are unavailable to assess deep soil moisture and groundwater in many areas of the globe gerdener et al 2020 causing a difficulty of comprehensive hydrological drought characterization at large scales hydrological models with long term data from decades to a hundred year can be used to monitor droughts from the basin scale to the global scale sheffield and wood 2008 moravec et al 2019 unfortunately the potential large uncertainty among models resulting from the diversity of global aquifers and modeling strategies remains a challenging issue in hydrological drought simulations loon 2015 compared to ground data and model simulation satellite observations have the advantages of global and uniform coverage near real time observations and consistent data records and they have been widely used to develop multi indicator and composite drought indices heumann 2011 aghakouchak et al 2015 jiao et al 2021 from the climatological perspective satellite data are used to monitor drought related variables such as precipitation wang et al 2019 suliman et al 2020 soil moisture nicolai shaw et al 2017 ford and quiring 2019 evapotranspiration anderson et al 2011 and surface water martins et al 2019 zhao and gao 2019 the drought indices based on the mentioned remote sensing data have been widely used to large scale drought monitoring but these data cannot fully reflect comprehensive components governing the water cycle since april 2002 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on grace fo twin satellite missions measuring time variable gravity fields have been widely used to measure or constrain the global terrestrial water storage changes δtws component at uniform quality and resolutions within the regime of the water cycle which includes soil moisture surface and groundwater storage snow and ice and runoff morishita and heki 2008 as well as data robustness gu et al 2017 with decadal or longer records this makes it suitable to monitor large scale hydrological droughts long et al 2014 yao et al 2016 huang et al 2021 and to develop drought indices from regional to global scales thomas et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 forootan et al 2019 nie et al 2017 gerdener et al 2020 liu et al 2020b however the spatial resolution 666 km full wavength of grace and grace fo gravimetry data is coarse and the noise level varies with mission phases chen et al 2021 for instance due to failure of one accelerometer onboard one of two satellites there are substantially larger systematic noise and potential biases from the 11 month data gap between grace and grace fo mission data time series chen et al 2020 2021 approaches to alleviate the coarse scale problem for global or regional drought studies include grace data model assimilation li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 merging gravimetry and precipitation data sinha et al 2019 wang et al 2020 and a data driven via independent component analysis approach to effectively bridge the 11 month grace and grace fo data gap forootan et al 2020 these studies illustrate improved hydrologic characterization including droughts using grace grace fo and swarm gravimetry data but the spatial resolution is not expected to be better than a few hundred km due to the orbit configurations of grace grace fo satellites chen et al 2021 we postulate that combining satellite gravimetry data with another geodetic technique which measures total δtws with complementary spatio temporal resolutions would enable the improvement of drought characterization global navigation satellite system gnss crustal displacement is such a space geodetic observation type which can be used to accurately estimate hydrologic induced surface mass changes at high temporal resolutions via farrell s elastic loading modelling van dam and wahr 1998 the land upward motion caused by drought induced water deficits can be recorded in the vertical component of gnss site continuous coordinates at mm level accuracy after removing the contributions of non hydrological effects such as atmosphere tides and tectonic motion the residual gnss vertical displacements vds can be used to retrieve regional δtws argus et al 2014 han 2017 zhong et al 2020 and to well capture drought onset and evolution jiang et al 2017 ferreira et al 2018 2019 yao et al 2020b furthermore chew and small 2014 showed that the 2012 drought in the high plains usa can be well detected by gps while grace cannot be used during the drought episode due to the missing data for a crucial month previous study in southwestern china has proved that a continuously operating gnss network is a complementary tool to remotely measure δtws jiang et al 2021 however accuracy in gnss vds can be significantly adversely impacted by data processing strategies gu et al 2017 and various factors around the sites such as local environments mao et al 1999 king et al 2007 davis et al 2012 and human activities karegar and kusche 2020 yao et al 2020a especially for tectonically active regions due to the diverse local effects gnss time series of vds at adjacent sites which would be affected by similar factors e g loading effect induced by atmosphere ocean and hydrology may show inconsistency and other distinct features as a result these may lead to disagreements between gnss and grace results at the regional scale or at adjacent gnss sites king et al 2006 van dam et al 2007 gu et al 2017 han 2017 ferreira et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 concerning data inconsistency in gnss vds at adjacent sites and the large noise and potential biases between grace and grace fo observations a combination of these two data sets potentially enable better drought monitoring through overcoming their respective shortcomings and complementing each other s advantages to test this hypothesis gnss vds were used to establish a gnss based hydrological drought index hereinafter denoted as ghdi in this study then and for the first time a combination with grace grace fo observations was conducted to overcome data inconsistency in gnss vds at adjacent sites and to develop an optimized gnss grace grace fo based hydrological drought index hereinafter denoted as oghdi which integrates grace drought severity index grace dsi proposed by zhao et al 2017 and ghdi the constrained optimization method was adopted to construct the optimal relative weights for ghdi and grace dsi oghdi was finally tested by the composite index ci used in china and commonly used self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi the objectives of this study are to i compare the gnss vertical displacements with grace grace fo derived δtws in a tectonically active region ii develop a combined drought index based on the constrained optimization method and iii verify the efficiency of the combined drought index by comparing with other drought indices 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area 99 104 e 22 30 n covers parts of the yunnan and sichuan provinces fig 1 this area has complex terrain with elevation increasing from east to west that varies from 200 to 7000 m with high gradients in topography the climate of the study region affecting by indian monsoon is warm and wet with a large amount of annual precipitation ranging from 1 000 mm to 2 000 mm and an annual mean temperature of about 15 20 c although this region is endowed with abundant water resources recent climate extremes have posed significant water security concerns such as severe droughts and the related disasters like wildfires e g yao et al 2020b du et al 2021 cui et al 2022 resulting in enormous social and economic losses therefore characterizing evolutions of δtws in this area is important for water resources management and mitigating the associated hydrometeorological disasters effects in addition the study area located in southestern tibetan plateau is a tectonically active region due to the ongoing collision of the indian and asian continents resulting in complex crustal deformations bai et al 2010 pan et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 su and zhan 2021 2 2 data 2 2 1 gnss data and surface loading products 10 year time series of daily vds at 30 gnss sites fig 1 from january 2011 to december 2020 available at ftp ftp cgps ac cn products position gamit over southwest china were used for the analysis the minimum distance between two sites is 20 km and the average distance is 100 km the potential relatively large gaps within the respective sites series would limit the full capability of gnss for drought monitoring at high spatial scales through inverse modeling of δtws which would require a dense site network jiang et al 2022 in this study we used gnss vds to monitor drought directly without the need for inverse modeling this approach has been proven to be efficient in the regions with less gnss sites such as in the high plains region of the united states chew and small 2014 and in brazil ferreira et al 2018 the gamit globk 10 4 software was used to estimate the gnss coordinates time series more details of data processing strategies can be found from the manual of the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc sites ftp ftp cgps ac cn doc processing manual pdf and jiang et al 2021 due to the complex local geophysical signals in the study region it would be difficult to extract hydrological load signals in gnss vds precisely and it may cause possible data inconsistency in reflecting hydrologic induced vds at adjacent sites because load deformations caused by solid earth tides pole tides and ocean tides have been corrected from the gnss vertical displacement products of cmonoc the gnss vertical displacements mainly reflect deformations induced by δtws non tidal atmosphere loading ntal and non tidal ocean loading ntol zhong et al 2020 the ntal and ntol products at 0 5 0 5 grids used to extract hydrological load signals are provided by the german geoforschungszentrum potsdam https rz vm115 gfz potsdam de 8080 repository 2 2 2 grace grace fo data since the grace grace fo mascon solutions do not require de striping spatial filtering leakage corrections here we used the latest release of jpl s mascon solution rl06m v02 https grace jpl nasa gov data get data jpl global mascons to integrate with gnss coordinate time series of vds induced by hydrological loading to generate the improved drought index the mascon solutions used in this study span from january 2011 to december 2020 with grace data span for 01 2011 07 2017 and grace fo data span for 06 2018 12 2020 the monthly δtws data at 3 3 600 km grids re sampled at 0 5 0 5 50 km grids are scaled by the respective mascon gain factors provided by jpl note that the number of short 1 2 months and long term 11 months missing data in the grace grace fo data accounts for 25 of the study period which would seriously impact the accuracy of drought characterization using this discontinuous data in this study grace grace fo derived δtws are also used to test data consistency of vds spatially at adjacent gnss sites given that the long wavelengths of seasonal hydrological loading signals are well measured by grace gravimetry in southwestern china hao et al 2016 2 2 3 precipitation precipitation is an important indicator to study droughts in this area hao et al 2016 the rainfall is unevenly distributed temporally long et al 2014 shi et al 2015 resulting wet season floods and dry season droughts monthly gridded precipitation data with the spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 from 1980 to 2020 were used to calculate the standardized precipitation index spi of 1 month spi 1 3 month spi 3 6 month spi 6 and 12 month spi 12 as well as to investigate the relationship between meteorological variations and vertical land displacements δtws the precipitation data are provided by the china meteorological administration and available at http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode surf cli chn pre mon grid 0 5 html 2 2 4 drought indices monthly global grace drought severity index grace dsi gridded dataset zhao et al 2017 developed from grace grace fo observed δtws is used to calculate the oghdi the grace dsi record spans from 2011 to 2020 zhao et al 2017 have demonstrated that a combination between the grace dsi and other satellite environmental data improves the drought indices or characterization in order to verify the effectiveness of oghdi we compare them with two drought indices namely ci and scpdsi daily ci data provided by china meteorological administration s national climate center are calculated from the meteorological data at 137 sites fig 1 they were converted to monthly time series ci which has been used for real time meteorological drought monitoring across china is an integration of spi 1 spi 3 and monthly relative humidity index it can be computed as following zou and zhang 2008 1 ci a spi 1 b spi 3 c m where m is relative humidity index of recent 1 month which represents water deficit m p pe pe pe is potential evapotranspiration p is precipitation the parameters a b and c are assigned as 0 4 0 4 and 0 8 respectively zou and zhang 2008 the scpdsi is a widely used meteorological drought index by using surface air temperature and a physical water balance model based on pdsi it is re calibrated to local conditions and appears to be a superior drought index dai 2011 gridded scpdsi data at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 van der schrier et al 2013 covering the period from january 2011 to december 2019 were employed for the comparison with ghdi and oghdi the data are available at https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought scpdsi was used to evaluate the performance of the new estimated drought index in this study based on the consideration that i it involved eight hydrological variables for soil moisture ii with streamflow observations in our study region including changjiang and mekong rivers dai et al 2009 and iii it has been used for the evaluation of grace dsi zhao et al 2017 and gnss based drought index jiang et al 2022 3 methods 3 1 extraction of hydrological load deformations first a second order butterworth filter with the normalized cut off frequency of 0 087 was applied to reduce the stochastic noise and the outliers fig 2 in the daily time series of gnss vds yao et al 2020 to reduce the impacts of systematic errors e g the data before 2012 shown in fig 2a we further removed the data with absolute values of vds larger than the triple standard deviation at each site then load deformations induced by ntal and ntol at each gnss site were interpolated and they were removed from gnss vds to obtain deformations caused by hydrological loading annual ntal and ntol amplitudes in the study region are 3 mm and 0 5 mm respectively the linear trends contain plate motion and glacial isostatic adjustment signals hao et al 2016 and these signals were removed for each gnss site time series to make it comparable to grace grace fo data daily gnss data were averaged into monthly interval 3 2 optimized hydrological drought index first gnss vd anomalies were obtained by removing the monthly climatology from hydrological load deformations then the ghdi is defined as the standardized anomalies of gnss vd at each site as follows ferreira et al 2018 2 ghdi i j vd i j vd j σ j where vd i j is the value of hydrological load induced vd in year i ranging from 2011 to 2020 and month j ranging from january and december vd j and σ j are the mean the climatological term and standard deviation of vds note that the definition of ghdi is similar to that of grace dsi proposed by zhao et al 2017 which makes it suitable for a combination hydrological load induced vds are linearly related to δ tws bevis et al 2005 3 vd α δ tws where the coefficient α is connected to crust and mantle properties the intention behind the combination of gnss and grace grace fo data is based on this relationship since these two space geodetic techniques measure total δtws at different spatio temporal resolutions and thus are highly complementary observations the constrained optimization method powell 1978 was used to determine the optimal relative weights of ghdi and grace dsi and obtain oghdi 4 oghdi β ghdi 1 β grace dsi where the coefficient β 0 β 1 is the optimization weight for ghdi and grace dsi since ghdi and grace dsi time series have different characteristics such as noise features and spatial consistency different value of β would help to overcome the respective shortcomings and complement each other s advantages for instance grace dsi with more spatial consistency would help to overcome ghdi at those sites with less data consistency due to complex local effects while ghdi time series at each sites with more consistent noise characteristic would help to improve data consistency in late stage grace and grace fo data affecting by large noise to bring the data comparison to the same reference period of 2011 2020 a standardization process mu et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 which is similar to the ghdi is applied to the ci and scpdsi using eq 2 at first hereinafter denoted as ci z and scpdsi z it should be noted that scpdsi z is from 2011 to 2019 and oghdi is calculated by merging ghdi and grace dsi where both data are available and oghdi values in the months with grace grace fo or gnss missing data are equal to ghdi or grace dsi as shown in fig 3 ci z calculated from spi 1 spi 3 and a relative humidity index in eq 1 is more sensitive than scpdsi z related to soil moisture in characterizing precipitation changes in southwest china this could be contributed to soil moisture memory since scpdsi z is more consistent with spi 12 fig 3c although both ci z and scpdsi z indicate a long term dry period before mid 2014 scpdsi z overestimated drought severity in mid 2012 and early 2014 fig 3c since precipitation are normal in general and scpdsi z are larger than most of the spi values at the four time scales during these episodes precipitation below normal climatology in the episodes of early 2012 from december 2012 to february 2013 from march to june 2019 were well captured by ci z in addition there is a year of data missing in 2020 in scpdsi z therefore we used ci z to determine β in eq 4 when the highest correlation between oghdi and ci z is obtained at each gnss sites spearman correlation coefficient cc s and root mean square error rmse between ghdi oghdi and the standardized ci scpdsi were calculated as metrics to assess the improvement of oghdi at regional scale and as a point source 4 results 4 1 variations in gnss vds and grace grace fo δtws we computed correlation coefficients of vds and δtws at two arbitrary points and the corresponding distance fig 4 a to investigate the spatial consistency of gnss vds and grace grace fo derived δtws respectively as shown in fig 4a wide ranges of ccs ranging from 0 21 0 33 to 0 98 1 00 were found between gnss vds grace grace fo derived δtws at two arbitrary points with distances ranging from 20 km to 824 km differently ccs between grace grace fo derived δtws at two arbitrary points decreased when distances increased in general for instance ccs between grace grace fo derived δtws at two arbitrary points with distances less than 100 km ccs greater than 0 8 are higher than those of larger than 600 km ccs less than 0 8 while high low ccs between gnss vds at two arbitrary points were found at all ranges of distances this implies that grace grace fo derived δtws shows a better spatial consistency than that of gnss vds in particular for the distance within 300 km which is close to the spatial resolution of grace grace fo mission ccs between grace grace fo derived δtws at two arbitrary points the mean cc value is 0 90 are in general higher than those of ccs between gnss vds with a mean cc value of 0 83 this suggests that a combination with grace grace fo data could help to improve the spatial consistency of gnss vds in reflecting hydrological mass variations in the study region an anti correlation between gnss vds and grace grace fo δtws was found at all sites illustrating consistency the ccs range from 0 69 to 0 18 and with a mean value of 0 44 fig 4b although there is a substantial 11 month data gap between the grace and grace fo missions we find that the two highest correlations occurred at the ynyl cc 0 69 and ynys cc 0 66 gnss sites fig 5 indicating high consistency between gnss displacements and gravimetry derived δtws this suggests that continuous gnss vds data are capable to fill the missing data in the grace era and the data gap between the grace and grace fo missions however low correlations were found at some sites e g sites yngm cc 0 18 and scyx cc 0 25 indicating considerable differences between displacements and δtws in general relatively high correlations were identified at those sites with strong seasonality of δtws corresponding to large root mean squares rmss of vds such as stations sclt ynlj ynys scpy ynyl ynya and ynym fig 4b the mean rms 10 3 mm at those sites with correlations less than 0 4 is 12 larger than the rest of the sites but there are also low correlations occurring at some sites with large rmss e g stations scjl cc 0 34 and scyx cc 0 25 from the spatial variations of ccs between vds and δtws fig 4b we found obvious differences at some pairs of adjacent sites such as yngm cc 0 18 ynlc cc 0 52 and yndc cc 0 30 ynhz cc 0 48 since satellite gravimetry data have higher spatial consistency fig 4a large differences in correlations at adjacent gnss sites suggest considerable data inconsistency in gnss vds as shown in fig 6 time series of vds at yngm with a relatively low correlation with δtws differ from those of the other two adjacent sites ynla and ynlc fig 6a a similar case was also found at yndc fig 6c as a result compared to the high cc values between time series of vds at stations ynlc ynla cc 0 94 and ynhz scnn cc 0 93 relatively low correlations were found at yngm ynlc cc 0 59 yngm ynla cc 0 59 yndc scnn cc 0 86 and yndc ynhz cc 0 85 fig 6b and 6d these inconsistencies at the adjacent gnss sites could be attributed to the offsets and local transient deformations induced by frequent seismic activities and other geological hazards in southwestern china gan et al 2007 and crustal upward and downward motion occurs simultaneously in the study region hao et al 2016 pan et al 2018 vds recorded at adjacent sites with considerable discrepancies may compromise unreasonable drought characterization in terms of regional variations gnss vds are well anti correlated with grace grace fo estimated δtws fig 7 a with a cc value of 0 54 after removing the secular and seasonal variations the timing of precipitation deficits fig 7c generally correspond to both of vds and tws anomalies shown in fig 7b for instance severe precipitation reductions during the periods from mid 2011 to early 2012 and the entire year of 2019 are well captured by gnss and grace grace fo but differences also exist in reflecting the effects of precipitation deficits in terms of the response time vd anomalies responded instantaneously to negative precipitation anomalies in early 2019 while δtws anomalies lagged this precipitation depletion by three months the delayed response of δtws to precipitation could be caused by the influences of crustal structure and hydrological pattern ferreira et al 2018 from the perspective of severity negative vd anomalies in 2019 and 2020 imply that precipitation reductions during this period are more severe than those in 2011 and 2012 while tws anomalies showed opposite results furthermore three comparative displacements occurring in november 2014 may 2015 and february 2016 fig 7b corresponded to obvious different absences of precipitation fig 7c which could be unreasonable the effects of precipitation absences in late 2014 and early 2016 may be overestimated by gnss grace shows more reasonable than gnss in characterizing precipitation reductions from 2013 to early 2014 with negative precipitation anomalies corresponding to tws deficits while gnss vds were mostly positive during this relatively dry period therefore a combination with grace grace fo data potentially allows for an improvement of the ability of gnss vds in drought monitoring 4 2 comparisons between hdi ohdi and ci scpdsi after merging grace dsi and ghdi derived from gnss vds significant improvement in correlations was found between oghdi and ci z scpdsi z at most of the gnss sites compared to those of ghdi based on gnss vds fig 8 c and 8f for ci z index the maximum cc value increased by 0 28 at yncx site and the mean cc value of all sites increased by 0 15 for scpdsi z index more apparent cc increases are found at 90 of the sites 27 sites with the maximum increase value of 0 41 at ynsd site and a mean cc value of all sites increased by 0 20 however cc decreases slightly at sites yngm ynsm and sclt with the minimum absolute decreased value of 0 13 for all gnss sites the mean cc values between oghdi and ci z scpdsi z increase from 0 19 0 32 to 0 32 0 52 when compared to those with ghdi during the study period all drought indices show southwest china experienced two dry periods from 2011 to about mid 2013 and after 2019 as well as a wet period from mid 2015 to 2019 fig 8 although the ccs between ghdi oghdi and scpdsi z are generally higher than those of ci z the temporal patterns of ghdi and oghdi are more consistent with those of ci z among the three patterns ci z fig 8b and oghdi fig 8d at a point scale show similar patterns with larger variability while the variability of scpdsi z at 0 5 0 5 grids is smoother from fig 8c some interesting results were identified when integrating gnss displacement and satellite gravimetry based drought indices significant improvement of ccs between oghdi and other two indices ci z and scpdsi z can be attributed to the uniform quality of grace dsi since oghdi ci correlations are lower than those of grace dsi and ci z at 20 gnss sites whereas improvement at some gnss sites e g sites yngm ynzd scnn and scpz can be explained as the complementation of the advantages in gnss and satellite gravimetry data since increased correlations were found after fusion of the two data compared to the correlations between ghdi grace dsi and ci z respectively slight improvement at few gnss sites such as sites ynmj and ynsm resulted from the good ability of gnss data in detecting local hydrological variations in the circumstances of correlations between grace dsi and ci z lower than those of between ghdi and ci z similar results were found in the case of scpdsi z shown in fig 8f for instance for those gnss sites with improvement after fusion of gnss and grace grace fo derived drought indices oghdi at ynsd site is closer to grace dsi than ghdi fig 9 a indicating grace dsi played a major role in the improvement of oghdi after merging the continuous ghdi oghdi at sclt site is more consistent with scpdsi z fig 9b with a slightly increased correlation fig 8f for the ynlc site increased correlations were found in both ghdi and grace dsi after integrating the two data sets fig 8f and oghdi is closer to the ghdi implying that ghdi is the main component of oghdi index from the perspective of regional mean variation shown in fig 10 similar improvements are found that oghdi shows better agreement with ci z and scpdsi z than ghdi for instance oghdi indicated a long term relatively wet period from mid 2015 to 2018 coinciding with ci z scpdsi z and precipitation anomalies shown in fig 7c in contrast ghdi indicated an unreasonable dry period in early 2016 corresponding to just a slight precipitation deficit fig 7c furthermore oghdi can well reflect water deficit in early 2014 while ghdi failed to capture this phenomenon although cc values between scpdsi z and ghdi oghdi are higher than those between ci z and ghdi oghdi scpdsi z apparently overestimates the drought severity from mid 2013 to mid 2014 during this period the amount of precipitation deficits is less than those before mid 2013 fig 7c but scpdsi z shows a comparative drought severity different from the point scale the correlations between regional oghdi and ci z scpdsi z increase more significantly from 0 37 to 0 57 fig 11 a and from 0 42 to 0 68 fig 11b as compared to those with ghdi respectively in addition rmses between oghdi and ci z scpdsi z decrease from 0 86 1 09 to 0 64 0 89 as compared to those of the ghdi demonstrating an improvement in oghdi as well 5 summary and discussion good agreement between grace derived δtws and gnss vds in southwestern china have shown in previous studies due to abundant spring and summer rainfall e g hao et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 yao et al 2020 in this study improvement in correlations between oghdi and ci z scpdsi z indicates that combing grace grace fo data with the advantages of uniform quality enables a better application of continuous gnss vds in drought characterization this improvement can be attributed to different reasons at different gnss sites although declined correlations between grace dsi and ci z scpdsi z were found at most of the study sites after merging the gnss vd based drought index gnss helped to mitigate the problems of substantially larger systematic error and an 11 month data gap betweem grace and grace fo mission data chen et al 2020 2021 and collectively improve drought monitoring capability more significant improvement is found in ccs between oghdi and scpdsi z than that of between oghdi and ci z this can be attributed to that the grace dsi and scpdsi z are both gridded data with closer spatial resolution than ci z at a point source scale resulting in higher correlations when integrating grace dsi and ghdi in addition higher correlations obtained from the regional scale suggest that the fusion of gnss and grace grace fo data performs better for regional drought characterization than for individual sites this also confirms the ability of grace grace fo in quantifying large scale water storage changes the data used as the criterion for determining the optimal weights play a crucial role in the performance of the combined drought index hao et al 2015 guo et al 2019 liu et al 2020a due to a lack of in situ hydrological observations in the study region we used a meteorological index of ci which has been used for real time drought monitoring across china as a criterion although significant improvements are found at most gnss sites decreased correlations with scpdsi occurring at three gnss sites suggest that a drought indicator established from in situ hydrological components including surface and subsurface water would be ideal to achieve the best performance of oghdi in addition in our data fusion approach we used the parameter β eq 4 covering the entire gnss and grace grace fo data period at each gnss site and the corresponding displacement time series we then derive the overall optimal result based on this integration strategy we note that an improved strategy would be needed to generate the optimal integrated drought index covering all the climate episodes for example fig 6 shows that our result in the current strategy for oghdi in early 2019 is less consistent with ci z and scpdsi z with a 3 month time lag than that of ghdi this suggests an appropriate follow up study topic gnss and grace grace fo are two distinct and complementary space geodetic techniques which can be used to accurately measure and model earth s terrestrial water storage at different spatio temporal resolutions this study demonstrates that the novel integration of these two contemporary geodetic techniques can improve drought monitoring in southwest china the results suggest the improved performance of gnss vertical displacement based drought index in southwestern china after merging grace grace fo gravimetry data although combining different grace grace fo solutions may reduce uncertainties in different data products xiao et al 2015 yin et al 2022 the performance of the optimal combined drought index may be different in other areas since the ability of grace grace fo data in monitoring δtws varies with climatic settings hydrological and geological regimes of the study regions scanlon et al 2016 yao et al 2019 which warrants individual regional future investigations since true uncertainties for the grace grace fo derived δtws are unknown chen et al 2021 it causes difficulties in accurately quantifying the uncertainty of the proposed combined drought index the underlying uncertainty mainly includes i errors in gnss vertical displacements ii the uncertainty in modeled ntal and ntol used to extract hydrological load induced deformations for constructing gnss based drought index and iii the uncertainty in grace grace fo derived δtws in addition the gnss data length 2011 2020 is short for calculating the monthly climatology because a climatology of at least 30 years is preferable thomas et al 2014 with the increasing gnss data records gnss data in turn can effectively fill the temporal gaps as well as improving the spatio temporal resolution of grace grace fo data in study regions with adequately dense spatial coverage which could be also a subject for future research the integrated drought index from two different space geodetic techniques with long records in the future would provide more information about the underlying physical mechanism about drought onset and evolution particularly under climate change credit authorship contribution statement chaolong yao conceptualization methodology formal

2793,space geodetic techniques are rapidly emerging as powerful tools for drought monitoring including the global navigation satellite system gnss positioning data and the gravimetric data from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on grace fo satellite missions however while gnss based 3d displacements have high temporal resolution they are impacted by diverse local effects especially for tectonically active regions satellite gravimetry derived terrestrial water storage changes δtws are continuous in temporal sampling however at much coarser spatial resolutions and there are systematic noise and a large 11 month data gap between grace and grace fo observations here for the first time we developed an optimized gnss grace grace fo hydrological drought index oghdi by optimally combining two drought indices derived from gnss vertical displacements vds and grace grace fo δtws to better characterize decadal evolution of droughts over southwest china 2011 2020 the optimal relative weights of the two drought indices are determined through maximizing the correlations with the composite index ci commonly used in the study region then oghdi is compared to the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi the results show that vds agree well with δtws at most of the 30 analyzed gnss sites with a mean correlation of 0 44 compared to the drought index developed using only gnss data the optimized technique improved the oghdi scpdsi correlations at 90 27 sites of the sites with the highest correlation reaches 0 73 further more significant improvement is found at the regional scale than at individual sites and the regional mean oghdi ci and oghdi scpdsi correlations increase from 0 37 to 0 57 and from 0 42 to 0 68 respectively all drought indices show that southwest china experienced two sustained and excessive drought periods from 2011 to mid 2013 and after 2019 we conclude that the novel integration of two distinct contemporary and complemenatry geodetic datasets gnss and grace grace fo improved the ability of drought monitoring in southwest china keywords gnss vertical displacement grace grace follow on drought index data availability i have shared my link to the data in the manuscript 1 introduction droughts inflict regional and even global water and food shortages and economy crisis a precise drought index is crucial to monitor the evolutions of drought episodes and for timely response towards the potential mitigation of the associated economic and other losses hydrological drought is defined as a deficit of accessible surface and subsurface water storage with respect to normal conditions various hydrological drought indices have been developed based on ground based observations loon 2015 such as the surface water supply index shafer and dezman 1982 and the streamflow drought index nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 these indices have been proven to be valuable tools for drought assessment however in situ measurements are unavailable to assess deep soil moisture and groundwater in many areas of the globe gerdener et al 2020 causing a difficulty of comprehensive hydrological drought characterization at large scales hydrological models with long term data from decades to a hundred year can be used to monitor droughts from the basin scale to the global scale sheffield and wood 2008 moravec et al 2019 unfortunately the potential large uncertainty among models resulting from the diversity of global aquifers and modeling strategies remains a challenging issue in hydrological drought simulations loon 2015 compared to ground data and model simulation satellite observations have the advantages of global and uniform coverage near real time observations and consistent data records and they have been widely used to develop multi indicator and composite drought indices heumann 2011 aghakouchak et al 2015 jiao et al 2021 from the climatological perspective satellite data are used to monitor drought related variables such as precipitation wang et al 2019 suliman et al 2020 soil moisture nicolai shaw et al 2017 ford and quiring 2019 evapotranspiration anderson et al 2011 and surface water martins et al 2019 zhao and gao 2019 the drought indices based on the mentioned remote sensing data have been widely used to large scale drought monitoring but these data cannot fully reflect comprehensive components governing the water cycle since april 2002 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on grace fo twin satellite missions measuring time variable gravity fields have been widely used to measure or constrain the global terrestrial water storage changes δtws component at uniform quality and resolutions within the regime of the water cycle which includes soil moisture surface and groundwater storage snow and ice and runoff morishita and heki 2008 as well as data robustness gu et al 2017 with decadal or longer records this makes it suitable to monitor large scale hydrological droughts long et al 2014 yao et al 2016 huang et al 2021 and to develop drought indices from regional to global scales thomas et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 forootan et al 2019 nie et al 2017 gerdener et al 2020 liu et al 2020b however the spatial resolution 666 km full wavength of grace and grace fo gravimetry data is coarse and the noise level varies with mission phases chen et al 2021 for instance due to failure of one accelerometer onboard one of two satellites there are substantially larger systematic noise and potential biases from the 11 month data gap between grace and grace fo mission data time series chen et al 2020 2021 approaches to alleviate the coarse scale problem for global or regional drought studies include grace data model assimilation li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 merging gravimetry and precipitation data sinha et al 2019 wang et al 2020 and a data driven via independent component analysis approach to effectively bridge the 11 month grace and grace fo data gap forootan et al 2020 these studies illustrate improved hydrologic characterization including droughts using grace grace fo and swarm gravimetry data but the spatial resolution is not expected to be better than a few hundred km due to the orbit configurations of grace grace fo satellites chen et al 2021 we postulate that combining satellite gravimetry data with another geodetic technique which measures total δtws with complementary spatio temporal resolutions would enable the improvement of drought characterization global navigation satellite system gnss crustal displacement is such a space geodetic observation type which can be used to accurately estimate hydrologic induced surface mass changes at high temporal resolutions via farrell s elastic loading modelling van dam and wahr 1998 the land upward motion caused by drought induced water deficits can be recorded in the vertical component of gnss site continuous coordinates at mm level accuracy after removing the contributions of non hydrological effects such as atmosphere tides and tectonic motion the residual gnss vertical displacements vds can be used to retrieve regional δtws argus et al 2014 han 2017 zhong et al 2020 and to well capture drought onset and evolution jiang et al 2017 ferreira et al 2018 2019 yao et al 2020b furthermore chew and small 2014 showed that the 2012 drought in the high plains usa can be well detected by gps while grace cannot be used during the drought episode due to the missing data for a crucial month previous study in southwestern china has proved that a continuously operating gnss network is a complementary tool to remotely measure δtws jiang et al 2021 however accuracy in gnss vds can be significantly adversely impacted by data processing strategies gu et al 2017 and various factors around the sites such as local environments mao et al 1999 king et al 2007 davis et al 2012 and human activities karegar and kusche 2020 yao et al 2020a especially for tectonically active regions due to the diverse local effects gnss time series of vds at adjacent sites which would be affected by similar factors e g loading effect induced by atmosphere ocean and hydrology may show inconsistency and other distinct features as a result these may lead to disagreements between gnss and grace results at the regional scale or at adjacent gnss sites king et al 2006 van dam et al 2007 gu et al 2017 han 2017 ferreira et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 concerning data inconsistency in gnss vds at adjacent sites and the large noise and potential biases between grace and grace fo observations a combination of these two data sets potentially enable better drought monitoring through overcoming their respective shortcomings and complementing each other s advantages to test this hypothesis gnss vds were used to establish a gnss based hydrological drought index hereinafter denoted as ghdi in this study then and for the first time a combination with grace grace fo observations was conducted to overcome data inconsistency in gnss vds at adjacent sites and to develop an optimized gnss grace grace fo based hydrological drought index hereinafter denoted as oghdi which integrates grace drought severity index grace dsi proposed by zhao et al 2017 and ghdi the constrained optimization method was adopted to construct the optimal relative weights for ghdi and grace dsi oghdi was finally tested by the composite index ci used in china and commonly used self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi the objectives of this study are to i compare the gnss vertical displacements with grace grace fo derived δtws in a tectonically active region ii develop a combined drought index based on the constrained optimization method and iii verify the efficiency of the combined drought index by comparing with other drought indices 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area 99 104 e 22 30 n covers parts of the yunnan and sichuan provinces fig 1 this area has complex terrain with elevation increasing from east to west that varies from 200 to 7000 m with high gradients in topography the climate of the study region affecting by indian monsoon is warm and wet with a large amount of annual precipitation ranging from 1 000 mm to 2 000 mm and an annual mean temperature of about 15 20 c although this region is endowed with abundant water resources recent climate extremes have posed significant water security concerns such as severe droughts and the related disasters like wildfires e g yao et al 2020b du et al 2021 cui et al 2022 resulting in enormous social and economic losses therefore characterizing evolutions of δtws in this area is important for water resources management and mitigating the associated hydrometeorological disasters effects in addition the study area located in southestern tibetan plateau is a tectonically active region due to the ongoing collision of the indian and asian continents resulting in complex crustal deformations bai et al 2010 pan et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 su and zhan 2021 2 2 data 2 2 1 gnss data and surface loading products 10 year time series of daily vds at 30 gnss sites fig 1 from january 2011 to december 2020 available at ftp ftp cgps ac cn products position gamit over southwest china were used for the analysis the minimum distance between two sites is 20 km and the average distance is 100 km the potential relatively large gaps within the respective sites series would limit the full capability of gnss for drought monitoring at high spatial scales through inverse modeling of δtws which would require a dense site network jiang et al 2022 in this study we used gnss vds to monitor drought directly without the need for inverse modeling this approach has been proven to be efficient in the regions with less gnss sites such as in the high plains region of the united states chew and small 2014 and in brazil ferreira et al 2018 the gamit globk 10 4 software was used to estimate the gnss coordinates time series more details of data processing strategies can be found from the manual of the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc sites ftp ftp cgps ac cn doc processing manual pdf and jiang et al 2021 due to the complex local geophysical signals in the study region it would be difficult to extract hydrological load signals in gnss vds precisely and it may cause possible data inconsistency in reflecting hydrologic induced vds at adjacent sites because load deformations caused by solid earth tides pole tides and ocean tides have been corrected from the gnss vertical displacement products of cmonoc the gnss vertical displacements mainly reflect deformations induced by δtws non tidal atmosphere loading ntal and non tidal ocean loading ntol zhong et al 2020 the ntal and ntol products at 0 5 0 5 grids used to extract hydrological load signals are provided by the german geoforschungszentrum potsdam https rz vm115 gfz potsdam de 8080 repository 2 2 2 grace grace fo data since the grace grace fo mascon solutions do not require de striping spatial filtering leakage corrections here we used the latest release of jpl s mascon solution rl06m v02 https grace jpl nasa gov data get data jpl global mascons to integrate with gnss coordinate time series of vds induced by hydrological loading to generate the improved drought index the mascon solutions used in this study span from january 2011 to december 2020 with grace data span for 01 2011 07 2017 and grace fo data span for 06 2018 12 2020 the monthly δtws data at 3 3 600 km grids re sampled at 0 5 0 5 50 km grids are scaled by the respective mascon gain factors provided by jpl note that the number of short 1 2 months and long term 11 months missing data in the grace grace fo data accounts for 25 of the study period which would seriously impact the accuracy of drought characterization using this discontinuous data in this study grace grace fo derived δtws are also used to test data consistency of vds spatially at adjacent gnss sites given that the long wavelengths of seasonal hydrological loading signals are well measured by grace gravimetry in southwestern china hao et al 2016 2 2 3 precipitation precipitation is an important indicator to study droughts in this area hao et al 2016 the rainfall is unevenly distributed temporally long et al 2014 shi et al 2015 resulting wet season floods and dry season droughts monthly gridded precipitation data with the spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 from 1980 to 2020 were used to calculate the standardized precipitation index spi of 1 month spi 1 3 month spi 3 6 month spi 6 and 12 month spi 12 as well as to investigate the relationship between meteorological variations and vertical land displacements δtws the precipitation data are provided by the china meteorological administration and available at http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode surf cli chn pre mon grid 0 5 html 2 2 4 drought indices monthly global grace drought severity index grace dsi gridded dataset zhao et al 2017 developed from grace grace fo observed δtws is used to calculate the oghdi the grace dsi record spans from 2011 to 2020 zhao et al 2017 have demonstrated that a combination between the grace dsi and other satellite environmental data improves the drought indices or characterization in order to verify the effectiveness of oghdi we compare them with two drought indices namely ci and scpdsi daily ci data provided by china meteorological administration s national climate center are calculated from the meteorological data at 137 sites fig 1 they were converted to monthly time series ci which has been used for real time meteorological drought monitoring across china is an integration of spi 1 spi 3 and monthly relative humidity index it can be computed as following zou and zhang 2008 1 ci a spi 1 b spi 3 c m where m is relative humidity index of recent 1 month which represents water deficit m p pe pe pe is potential evapotranspiration p is precipitation the parameters a b and c are assigned as 0 4 0 4 and 0 8 respectively zou and zhang 2008 the scpdsi is a widely used meteorological drought index by using surface air temperature and a physical water balance model based on pdsi it is re calibrated to local conditions and appears to be a superior drought index dai 2011 gridded scpdsi data at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 van der schrier et al 2013 covering the period from january 2011 to december 2019 were employed for the comparison with ghdi and oghdi the data are available at https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought scpdsi was used to evaluate the performance of the new estimated drought index in this study based on the consideration that i it involved eight hydrological variables for soil moisture ii with streamflow observations in our study region including changjiang and mekong rivers dai et al 2009 and iii it has been used for the evaluation of grace dsi zhao et al 2017 and gnss based drought index jiang et al 2022 3 methods 3 1 extraction of hydrological load deformations first a second order butterworth filter with the normalized cut off frequency of 0 087 was applied to reduce the stochastic noise and the outliers fig 2 in the daily time series of gnss vds yao et al 2020 to reduce the impacts of systematic errors e g the data before 2012 shown in fig 2a we further removed the data with absolute values of vds larger than the triple standard deviation at each site then load deformations induced by ntal and ntol at each gnss site were interpolated and they were removed from gnss vds to obtain deformations caused by hydrological loading annual ntal and ntol amplitudes in the study region are 3 mm and 0 5 mm respectively the linear trends contain plate motion and glacial isostatic adjustment signals hao et al 2016 and these signals were removed for each gnss site time series to make it comparable to grace grace fo data daily gnss data were averaged into monthly interval 3 2 optimized hydrological drought index first gnss vd anomalies were obtained by removing the monthly climatology from hydrological load deformations then the ghdi is defined as the standardized anomalies of gnss vd at each site as follows ferreira et al 2018 2 ghdi i j vd i j vd j σ j where vd i j is the value of hydrological load induced vd in year i ranging from 2011 to 2020 and month j ranging from january and december vd j and σ j are the mean the climatological term and standard deviation of vds note that the definition of ghdi is similar to that of grace dsi proposed by zhao et al 2017 which makes it suitable for a combination hydrological load induced vds are linearly related to δ tws bevis et al 2005 3 vd α δ tws where the coefficient α is connected to crust and mantle properties the intention behind the combination of gnss and grace grace fo data is based on this relationship since these two space geodetic techniques measure total δtws at different spatio temporal resolutions and thus are highly complementary observations the constrained optimization method powell 1978 was used to determine the optimal relative weights of ghdi and grace dsi and obtain oghdi 4 oghdi β ghdi 1 β grace dsi where the coefficient β 0 β 1 is the optimization weight for ghdi and grace dsi since ghdi and grace dsi time series have different characteristics such as noise features and spatial consistency different value of β would help to overcome the respective shortcomings and complement each other s advantages for instance grace dsi with more spatial consistency would help to overcome ghdi at those sites with less data consistency due to complex local effects while ghdi time series at each sites with more consistent noise characteristic would help to improve data consistency in late stage grace and grace fo data affecting by large noise to bring the data comparison to the same reference period of 2011 2020 a standardization process mu et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 which is similar to the ghdi is applied to the ci and scpdsi using eq 2 at first hereinafter denoted as ci z and scpdsi z it should be noted that scpdsi z is from 2011 to 2019 and oghdi is calculated by merging ghdi and grace dsi where both data are available and oghdi values in the months with grace grace fo or gnss missing data are equal to ghdi or grace dsi as shown in fig 3 ci z calculated from spi 1 spi 3 and a relative humidity index in eq 1 is more sensitive than scpdsi z related to soil moisture in characterizing precipitation changes in southwest china this could be contributed to soil moisture memory since scpdsi z is more consistent with spi 12 fig 3c although both ci z and scpdsi z indicate a long term dry period before mid 2014 scpdsi z overestimated drought severity in mid 2012 and early 2014 fig 3c since precipitation are normal in general and scpdsi z are larger than most of the spi values at the four time scales during these episodes precipitation below normal climatology in the episodes of early 2012 from december 2012 to february 2013 from march to june 2019 were well captured by ci z in addition there is a year of data missing in 2020 in scpdsi z therefore we used ci z to determine β in eq 4 when the highest correlation between oghdi and ci z is obtained at each gnss sites spearman correlation coefficient cc s and root mean square error rmse between ghdi oghdi and the standardized ci scpdsi were calculated as metrics to assess the improvement of oghdi at regional scale and as a point source 4 results 4 1 variations in gnss vds and grace grace fo δtws we computed correlation coefficients of vds and δtws at two arbitrary points and the corresponding distance fig 4 a to investigate the spatial consistency of gnss vds and grace grace fo derived δtws respectively as shown in fig 4a wide ranges of ccs ranging from 0 21 0 33 to 0 98 1 00 were found between gnss vds grace grace fo derived δtws at two arbitrary points with distances ranging from 20 km to 824 km differently ccs between grace grace fo derived δtws at two arbitrary points decreased when distances increased in general for instance ccs between grace grace fo derived δtws at two arbitrary points with distances less than 100 km ccs greater than 0 8 are higher than those of larger than 600 km ccs less than 0 8 while high low ccs between gnss vds at two arbitrary points were found at all ranges of distances this implies that grace grace fo derived δtws shows a better spatial consistency than that of gnss vds in particular for the distance within 300 km which is close to the spatial resolution of grace grace fo mission ccs between grace grace fo derived δtws at two arbitrary points the mean cc value is 0 90 are in general higher than those of ccs between gnss vds with a mean cc value of 0 83 this suggests that a combination with grace grace fo data could help to improve the spatial consistency of gnss vds in reflecting hydrological mass variations in the study region an anti correlation between gnss vds and grace grace fo δtws was found at all sites illustrating consistency the ccs range from 0 69 to 0 18 and with a mean value of 0 44 fig 4b although there is a substantial 11 month data gap between the grace and grace fo missions we find that the two highest correlations occurred at the ynyl cc 0 69 and ynys cc 0 66 gnss sites fig 5 indicating high consistency between gnss displacements and gravimetry derived δtws this suggests that continuous gnss vds data are capable to fill the missing data in the grace era and the data gap between the grace and grace fo missions however low correlations were found at some sites e g sites yngm cc 0 18 and scyx cc 0 25 indicating considerable differences between displacements and δtws in general relatively high correlations were identified at those sites with strong seasonality of δtws corresponding to large root mean squares rmss of vds such as stations sclt ynlj ynys scpy ynyl ynya and ynym fig 4b the mean rms 10 3 mm at those sites with correlations less than 0 4 is 12 larger than the rest of the sites but there are also low correlations occurring at some sites with large rmss e g stations scjl cc 0 34 and scyx cc 0 25 from the spatial variations of ccs between vds and δtws fig 4b we found obvious differences at some pairs of adjacent sites such as yngm cc 0 18 ynlc cc 0 52 and yndc cc 0 30 ynhz cc 0 48 since satellite gravimetry data have higher spatial consistency fig 4a large differences in correlations at adjacent gnss sites suggest considerable data inconsistency in gnss vds as shown in fig 6 time series of vds at yngm with a relatively low correlation with δtws differ from those of the other two adjacent sites ynla and ynlc fig 6a a similar case was also found at yndc fig 6c as a result compared to the high cc values between time series of vds at stations ynlc ynla cc 0 94 and ynhz scnn cc 0 93 relatively low correlations were found at yngm ynlc cc 0 59 yngm ynla cc 0 59 yndc scnn cc 0 86 and yndc ynhz cc 0 85 fig 6b and 6d these inconsistencies at the adjacent gnss sites could be attributed to the offsets and local transient deformations induced by frequent seismic activities and other geological hazards in southwestern china gan et al 2007 and crustal upward and downward motion occurs simultaneously in the study region hao et al 2016 pan et al 2018 vds recorded at adjacent sites with considerable discrepancies may compromise unreasonable drought characterization in terms of regional variations gnss vds are well anti correlated with grace grace fo estimated δtws fig 7 a with a cc value of 0 54 after removing the secular and seasonal variations the timing of precipitation deficits fig 7c generally correspond to both of vds and tws anomalies shown in fig 7b for instance severe precipitation reductions during the periods from mid 2011 to early 2012 and the entire year of 2019 are well captured by gnss and grace grace fo but differences also exist in reflecting the effects of precipitation deficits in terms of the response time vd anomalies responded instantaneously to negative precipitation anomalies in early 2019 while δtws anomalies lagged this precipitation depletion by three months the delayed response of δtws to precipitation could be caused by the influences of crustal structure and hydrological pattern ferreira et al 2018 from the perspective of severity negative vd anomalies in 2019 and 2020 imply that precipitation reductions during this period are more severe than those in 2011 and 2012 while tws anomalies showed opposite results furthermore three comparative displacements occurring in november 2014 may 2015 and february 2016 fig 7b corresponded to obvious different absences of precipitation fig 7c which could be unreasonable the effects of precipitation absences in late 2014 and early 2016 may be overestimated by gnss grace shows more reasonable than gnss in characterizing precipitation reductions from 2013 to early 2014 with negative precipitation anomalies corresponding to tws deficits while gnss vds were mostly positive during this relatively dry period therefore a combination with grace grace fo data potentially allows for an improvement of the ability of gnss vds in drought monitoring 4 2 comparisons between hdi ohdi and ci scpdsi after merging grace dsi and ghdi derived from gnss vds significant improvement in correlations was found between oghdi and ci z scpdsi z at most of the gnss sites compared to those of ghdi based on gnss vds fig 8 c and 8f for ci z index the maximum cc value increased by 0 28 at yncx site and the mean cc value of all sites increased by 0 15 for scpdsi z index more apparent cc increases are found at 90 of the sites 27 sites with the maximum increase value of 0 41 at ynsd site and a mean cc value of all sites increased by 0 20 however cc decreases slightly at sites yngm ynsm and sclt with the minimum absolute decreased value of 0 13 for all gnss sites the mean cc values between oghdi and ci z scpdsi z increase from 0 19 0 32 to 0 32 0 52 when compared to those with ghdi during the study period all drought indices show southwest china experienced two dry periods from 2011 to about mid 2013 and after 2019 as well as a wet period from mid 2015 to 2019 fig 8 although the ccs between ghdi oghdi and scpdsi z are generally higher than those of ci z the temporal patterns of ghdi and oghdi are more consistent with those of ci z among the three patterns ci z fig 8b and oghdi fig 8d at a point scale show similar patterns with larger variability while the variability of scpdsi z at 0 5 0 5 grids is smoother from fig 8c some interesting results were identified when integrating gnss displacement and satellite gravimetry based drought indices significant improvement of ccs between oghdi and other two indices ci z and scpdsi z can be attributed to the uniform quality of grace dsi since oghdi ci correlations are lower than those of grace dsi and ci z at 20 gnss sites whereas improvement at some gnss sites e g sites yngm ynzd scnn and scpz can be explained as the complementation of the advantages in gnss and satellite gravimetry data since increased correlations were found after fusion of the two data compared to the correlations between ghdi grace dsi and ci z respectively slight improvement at few gnss sites such as sites ynmj and ynsm resulted from the good ability of gnss data in detecting local hydrological variations in the circumstances of correlations between grace dsi and ci z lower than those of between ghdi and ci z similar results were found in the case of scpdsi z shown in fig 8f for instance for those gnss sites with improvement after fusion of gnss and grace grace fo derived drought indices oghdi at ynsd site is closer to grace dsi than ghdi fig 9 a indicating grace dsi played a major role in the improvement of oghdi after merging the continuous ghdi oghdi at sclt site is more consistent with scpdsi z fig 9b with a slightly increased correlation fig 8f for the ynlc site increased correlations were found in both ghdi and grace dsi after integrating the two data sets fig 8f and oghdi is closer to the ghdi implying that ghdi is the main component of oghdi index from the perspective of regional mean variation shown in fig 10 similar improvements are found that oghdi shows better agreement with ci z and scpdsi z than ghdi for instance oghdi indicated a long term relatively wet period from mid 2015 to 2018 coinciding with ci z scpdsi z and precipitation anomalies shown in fig 7c in contrast ghdi indicated an unreasonable dry period in early 2016 corresponding to just a slight precipitation deficit fig 7c furthermore oghdi can well reflect water deficit in early 2014 while ghdi failed to capture this phenomenon although cc values between scpdsi z and ghdi oghdi are higher than those between ci z and ghdi oghdi scpdsi z apparently overestimates the drought severity from mid 2013 to mid 2014 during this period the amount of precipitation deficits is less than those before mid 2013 fig 7c but scpdsi z shows a comparative drought severity different from the point scale the correlations between regional oghdi and ci z scpdsi z increase more significantly from 0 37 to 0 57 fig 11 a and from 0 42 to 0 68 fig 11b as compared to those with ghdi respectively in addition rmses between oghdi and ci z scpdsi z decrease from 0 86 1 09 to 0 64 0 89 as compared to those of the ghdi demonstrating an improvement in oghdi as well 5 summary and discussion good agreement between grace derived δtws and gnss vds in southwestern china have shown in previous studies due to abundant spring and summer rainfall e g hao et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 yao et al 2020 in this study improvement in correlations between oghdi and ci z scpdsi z indicates that combing grace grace fo data with the advantages of uniform quality enables a better application of continuous gnss vds in drought characterization this improvement can be attributed to different reasons at different gnss sites although declined correlations between grace dsi and ci z scpdsi z were found at most of the study sites after merging the gnss vd based drought index gnss helped to mitigate the problems of substantially larger systematic error and an 11 month data gap betweem grace and grace fo mission data chen et al 2020 2021 and collectively improve drought monitoring capability more significant improvement is found in ccs between oghdi and scpdsi z than that of between oghdi and ci z this can be attributed to that the grace dsi and scpdsi z are both gridded data with closer spatial resolution than ci z at a point source scale resulting in higher correlations when integrating grace dsi and ghdi in addition higher correlations obtained from the regional scale suggest that the fusion of gnss and grace grace fo data performs better for regional drought characterization than for individual sites this also confirms the ability of grace grace fo in quantifying large scale water storage changes the data used as the criterion for determining the optimal weights play a crucial role in the performance of the combined drought index hao et al 2015 guo et al 2019 liu et al 2020a due to a lack of in situ hydrological observations in the study region we used a meteorological index of ci which has been used for real time drought monitoring across china as a criterion although significant improvements are found at most gnss sites decreased correlations with scpdsi occurring at three gnss sites suggest that a drought indicator established from in situ hydrological components including surface and subsurface water would be ideal to achieve the best performance of oghdi in addition in our data fusion approach we used the parameter β eq 4 covering the entire gnss and grace grace fo data period at each gnss site and the corresponding displacement time series we then derive the overall optimal result based on this integration strategy we note that an improved strategy would be needed to generate the optimal integrated drought index covering all the climate episodes for example fig 6 shows that our result in the current strategy for oghdi in early 2019 is less consistent with ci z and scpdsi z with a 3 month time lag than that of ghdi this suggests an appropriate follow up study topic gnss and grace grace fo are two distinct and complementary space geodetic techniques which can be used to accurately measure and model earth s terrestrial water storage at different spatio temporal resolutions this study demonstrates that the novel integration of these two contemporary geodetic techniques can improve drought monitoring in southwest china the results suggest the improved performance of gnss vertical displacement based drought index in southwestern china after merging grace grace fo gravimetry data although combining different grace grace fo solutions may reduce uncertainties in different data products xiao et al 2015 yin et al 2022 the performance of the optimal combined drought index may be different in other areas since the ability of grace grace fo data in monitoring δtws varies with climatic settings hydrological and geological regimes of the study regions scanlon et al 2016 yao et al 2019 which warrants individual regional future investigations since true uncertainties for the grace grace fo derived δtws are unknown chen et al 2021 it causes difficulties in accurately quantifying the uncertainty of the proposed combined drought index the underlying uncertainty mainly includes i errors in gnss vertical displacements ii the uncertainty in modeled ntal and ntol used to extract hydrological load induced deformations for constructing gnss based drought index and iii the uncertainty in grace grace fo derived δtws in addition the gnss data length 2011 2020 is short for calculating the monthly climatology because a climatology of at least 30 years is preferable thomas et al 2014 with the increasing gnss data records gnss data in turn can effectively fill the temporal gaps as well as improving the spatio temporal resolution of grace grace fo data in study regions with adequately dense spatial coverage which could be also a subject for future research the integrated drought index from two different space geodetic techniques with long records in the future would provide more information about the underlying physical mechanism about drought onset and evolution particularly under climate change credit authorship contribution statement chaolong yao conceptualization methodology formal

2794,planning of best management practices bmps is increasingly dependent on process based watershed models pwms and suffers from large uncertainties the large complexity and long runtimes of such models make prudential watershed management a difficult undertaking in this study we aimed to bridge the gaps between pwms and uncertainty based bmp planning with bayesian belief network bbns a new modeling framework of process guided hybrid bbns ph bbns was developed to represent the probabilistic cascade of critical modules in soil water assessment tool swat a widely used pwm across external stressors e g weather and various bmps parametric uncertainties and watershed predictors the ph bbn modeling framework was used for decision support of nonpoint source nps pollution mitigation in an intensively cultivated area adjacent to lake dianchi one of the three most eutrophic lakes in china our findings suggest that ph bbns can capture the critical pathways of water sediment and total phosphorus tp loss watershed projections are subject to large uncertainties to varying degrees in different landscapes according to variance based sensitivity analysis precipitation accounts for 80 of the projection variability which underlines watershed vulnerability to climate change as the effectiveness of parallel terraces filter strips and fertilization management would degrade with increasing rainfall intensity they should be conservatively designed for bmp sustainability implementation of parallel terraces and filter strips is recommended as they are projected to reduce 80 of tp loads with 90 compliance confidence ph bbns can render effective decision support for bmp risk assessment and adaptive watershed management under climate change keywords uncertainty best management practices diffuse pollution climate change bayesian belief network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excess diffuse nutrients caused by agricultural activities have been widely recognized as a critical contributor to water quality deterioration tong et al 2017 best management practices bmps are promising technologies to mitigate non point source nps pollution and restore impaired aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2017 as field investigations and monitoring for watershed scale bmp evaluation can be costly and site specific process based watershed models pwms which provide mechanistic spatio temporal representations of the interplays among meteorology topography conservation practices and watershed processes e g surface runoff soil erosion and nutrient transport have been widely used for watershed simulation and evaluation of bmp effectiveness chen et al 2018 arhonditsis et al 2019 in the majority of previous studies bmp effectiveness in reducing nps pollution was generally deterministically evaluated using a calibrated watershed model with the best fit parameter set molina navarro et al 2017 todeschini et al 2018 dong et al 2019 nevertheless models are merely an abstraction of the complicated real world which inevitably makes them subject to uncertainties white 2018 nerantzaki et al 2020 accurate and reliable forecasts of bmp effectiveness have remained a great challenge attributed to underlying uncertainties associated with climate change model parameters monitoring natural variability of the ecosystem and inefficient bmp adoption etc decisions are inadequate and in many cases misleading when overlooking uncertainty propagation from various sources into watershed projections in recent years uncertainties in bmp effectiveness have triggered considerable attention while decision makers are increasingly interested in all possible outcomes and associated risks of watershed management strategies zou et al 2014 tasdighi et al 2018 raei et al 2019 a deep understanding of the integrative effects of various stressors on uncertain watershed responses is thus required for uncertainty based bmp planning while many studies have investigated the uncertainties in projections of target pollutants e g instream nutrient fluxes uncertainties propagations across the relevant influential watershed processes have received little attention lloyd et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 there is a need for a bridge between pwms and bmp planning under uncertainty which entails an approach incorporating uncertain external stressors internal interactions among watershed processes and evaluation of bmp effectiveness a major challenge in an integrative bmp modeling effort is the large computational expense to quantify uncertainties in watershed projections uncertainty assessment requires long runtimes by testing pwm responses to various stressors whereas modeling for bmp decision support is intended to be efficient and accessible zou et al 2015 dong et al 2020 a prevailing solution is the pursuit of a simplification strategy to reduce the computational budget incurred by process based watershed modeling computationally inexpensive surrogate models based on data driven emulation have been widely used for model simplification examples of the emulation approaches include multivariate regression chen et al 2020 artificial neural network shaw et al 2017 support vector machine yan et al 2018 and response surface yin tsai 2018 nevertheless the prevailing approaches are mostly black box representations of quantitative correlations between input drivers and predictors without insights into the internal structure and physical laws of watershed systems thus there is a lack of transparency and comprehensibility for decision support systems based on such conventional models bohanec et al 2017 bayesian belief networks bbns are probabilistic rather than deterministic representations of the stochastic links among variables based on conditional probability distributions in pwms multiple submodels are assembled to represent the watershed processes fatichi et al 2016 saxe et al 2019 the graphical nature of bbn models can explicitly display connections among various submodel components which facilitate the development of a conceptual model capturing the causalities between external stressors bmps and uncertain watershed responses the visualization of multiple watershed processes and variables with bbns can improve model interpretation and encourage interdisciplinary discussion for stakeholders from a broad variety of backgrounds bbns are beneficial to examine uncertainty propagation across submodels and deal with the issues of very large uncertainties data limitations and knowledge gaps there has been an increasing interest in bbns as a modeling and decision support tool in a watershed context including flood risk analysis chen et al 2019 stormwater pollution management park stenstrom 2006 total maximum daily loads tmdl regulation ames lall 2008 and ecological risk assessment mcdonald et al 2016 bbns are generally constructed with discrete nodes represented with categories or intervals aguilera et al 2011 continuous variables should be discretized into several states for their representations in discrete bbns which could lead to considerable information loss ropero et al 2018 in this regard continuous bbns which represent variables with statistical distributions instead of discretization have triggered broad interest maldonado et al 2016 hradsky et al 2017 nevertheless qualitative information e g environmental policies and decision preferences cannot be represented in continuous bbns most recently hybrid bbns have emerged as an increasingly promising approach as they avoid information loss suffering from the discretization of continuous evidence and in the meantime retain the capability of dealing with qualitative information ropero et al 2014 while the diversity of information in a watershed management context entails the usage of hybrid bbns they have been barely used for bmp decision support and even less are the studies on the development of data driven pwm surrogates with hybrid bbns to facilitate bmp planning under uncertainty for the sake of overcoming the limitations of pwms and black box data driven models while allowing access to their strengths herein we exploit a new modeling framework of process guided hybrid bbns ph bbns which were constructed based on the critical causal mechanisms among watershed processes the overarching goal of this study is to develop a computational procedure for a probabilistic bmp planning tool the specific objectives are to i examine uncertainties in projections of critical watershed variables ii evaluate the impacts of weather variability and parametric uncertainty on bmp effectiveness and iii determine the compliance confidence of different bmp scenarios reaching environmental targets while previous studies have investigated the bmp effectiveness via deterministic watershed modeling a probabilistic bmp decision support tool embedding watershed subsystems into hybrid bbns is novel the ph bbn modeling framework presented in this study can provide a bridge between deterministic watershed models and uncertainty based bmp planning 2 methodology 2 1 study area lake dianchi fig 1 is the largest lake in yunnan province china it is located in the yunnan guizhou plateau with a capacity of 15 8 108 m3 and an average water depth of 5 m the surrounding watershed of lake dianchi which covers a drainage area of 2920 km2 encompasses multiple tributaries such as the panlong river baoxiang river and the chai river the prevailing climate is mild with a 15 c mean air temperature forest cropland and built up areas occupy 55 20 and 17 of the watershed respectively while the remaining 8 is covered with water and pasture lake dianchi is confronting the serious threat of eutrophication among china s eutrophic lakes lake dianchi is suffering from the most severe harmful algal blooms with an estimated magnitude of 208 6 km2 i e 67 5 of the surface area in 2018 huang et al 2020 diffuse phosphorus loading has been identified as the primary culprit resulting in the eutrophication of lake dianchi liu et al 2006 the previous study has reported the chai river catchment as the largest contributor to diffuse tp loads dong et al 2018 specifically the subbasin surrounding the estuary of the chai river 1 in fig 1c contributing the largest annual unit area tp loads 2 1 kg ha in contrast with 0 04 1 7 kg ha in other subbasins has been identified as the high level priority management areas pmas fig 1b with the priority for nps pollution control dong et al 2018 hence we explore bmp planning in this pma with particular attention to tp load mitigation in this study the study area covers an area of 9 6 km2 where the dominant land use type is cropland 35 approximately 45 of the area has a fairly steep slope of 25 the paddy soil 64 and red soil 36 are the dominant soil types which are prone to weathering and hydrolyzing as a result the study area is significantly vulnerable to soil erosion and nutrient loss which entails measures to mitigate sediment and tp inputs into lake dianchi 2 2 description of the modeling framework a ph bbn modeling framework integrating the pwm and hybrid bbns fig 2 was proposed to render decision support for bmp planning under uncertainty which comprises the following steps step1 watershed simulation and bmp prescreening a pwm is established to simulate the water sediment and nutrient cycling processes at the watershed scale the pwm is subsequently calibrated and validated against the historical streamflow and water quality records bmps are prescreened based on the characteristics of watershed landscapes and pollution sources an early stage evaluation of bmp feasibility and the anticipated benefits in reducing water sediment and nutrient loss is made based on the pwm step 2 specification of the ph bbn structure the probability distributions of uncertain stressors e g pwm parameterization and meteorological states affecting bmp effectiveness are identified for ph bbn construction the network structure of ph bbns is specified and visualized dependent on the causal linkage among the critical watershed processes the associated stressors and candidate bmps step 3 ph bbn training and validation the parameters of ph bbns are learned based on data samples of pwm inputs i e bmps and uncertain stressors and the corresponding pwm outputs i e projections of watershed responses validation is subsequently performed for affirming the emulation accuracy of ph bbns step 4 scenario and risk analysis for bmp planning probabilistic inference is conducted with the ph bbn models the probability distributions of water sediment and nutrient loss are projected under different weather conditions and bmp scenarios the risks of the designed bmp strategies in compliance with pollutant mitigation targets are evaluated and the bmp implementation guidance is accordingly provided the detailed approaches of the ph bbn modeling framework are presented in the following sub sections 2 3 watershed modeling and bmp representation with swat soil and water assessment tool swat one of the most popular pwms was embedded in the ph bbn modeling framework for our case study swat is a semi distributed watershed simulation tool developed by the united states department of agriculture usda which consists of modules simulating the hydrological cycle soil erosion nutrient transport and agricultural conservation practices etc swat watershed simulation is based on input information such as the digital elevation model dem land uses soil types and properties meteorological data and farming practices swat model setup begins with watershed delineation and identification of hydrologic response units hrus for characterization of spatial heterogeneity hrus the basic computational units for swat simulation are generated by overlapping land use slope and soil layers additional details of swat model setup modules and theories were documented by neitsch et al 2011 swat was used for simulation of watershed processes in the lake dianchi watershed which was delineated into 64 subbasins based on the 30 m resolution dem and further partitioned into 319 hrus daily instream flows and tp loads were simulated from 2001 to 2010 and the first two years were taken as the warm up period to phase out the impacts of initial watershed conditions the hydrologic submodel of swat was calibrated against discharge observations from 2003 to 2006 and validated from 2007 to 2010 subsequently the parameters relevant to sediment and tp were calibrated from 2004 to 2007 and validated from 2008 to 2010 on the monthly time step swat calibration and validation were conducted with the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 abbaspour et al 1997 the calibrated swat parameters for lake dianchi watershed can be found in table s1 the details on the swat application to the lake dianchi watershed the data sources employed in the present study and pma identification can be found in dong et al 2018 swat is capable of evaluating the individual or integrative effects of bmps on watershed hydrology and water quality as the chai river catchment is an intensively farmed area with steep slopes the practices of parallel terraces edge of field filter strips and fertilizer management were selected as the candidate bmps for nps pollution mitigation parallel terraces are effective erosion control practices by decreasing the length of the slope exposed to sheet and rill erosion baryla pierzgalski 2008 parallel terraces were represented in swat by altering the values of the initial curve number for antecedent runoff condition ii cn2 support practice factor usle p and average slope length slsubbsn at the hru scale bracmort et al 2006 as parallel terraces were usually adopted as conservation practices for moderate and steep slope landscapes usda 2001 they were exclusively designed in the hrus with an average slope 10 in this study following recommendations of the previous studies and swat manual arabi et al 2007 neitsch et al 2011 cn2 was reduced by 0 2 and usle p was set to 0 1 for the implementation of parallel terraces in the meantime the average slope length of each hru was calculated with an empirical linear function between slsubbsn and the adverse of slopes that is slsubbsn a b s 100 where a and b are empirical parameters of the linear function with a 0 21 and b 0 9 and s is the average slope arabi et al 2007 edge of field filter strips also known as field borders are densely vegetated areas at the edges of cropland fields filter strips offer an opportunity for sediment and nutrients moving off the cropland to interact with the vegetation and soil which are represented by empirical functions of the filter width filterw in swat reducing fertilizer application is a straightforward way to mitigate nutrient loss from the source which may also increase short term profitability as soils have already accumulated sufficient amounts of nutrients darras et al 2019 the amount of fertilizer application kg ha was represented with the swat parameter frt kg the candidate bmps and the corresponding parameters for their representation in swat were summarized in table 1 2 4 construction of process guided hybrid bbns 2 4 1 network structural specification ph bbns were established to represent the probabilistic interactions among weather swat parameters bmps and watershed predictors based on the inputs and outputs of the calibrated swat model for the lake dianchi watershed while swat attempts to convey the complicated nature of the watershed as a semi distributed process based model hybrid bbns were used to provide simpler approximations of swat for uncertainty based bmp planning as surface runoff picks up and carries away pollutants and deposits them into the receiving water bodies it is recognized as the dominant pathway for soil and nutrient loss bashagaluke et al 2018 which especially holds true for high plateau watersheds e g the lake dianchi watershed with extremely steep slopes the swat application in the lake dianchi watershed revealed that almost all tp yields 90 were driven by surface runoff dong et al 2018 and thus we specifically focused on the overland processes of water sediment and tp loss in this study the watershed predictors i e surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads are affected by multiple driving factors such as precipitation swat parameters and bmps based on the frequency analysis of the historical 1951 2010 precipitation records the annual precipitation follows a normal distribution with a mean of 871 mm and a standard deviation of 30 mm which was denoted as n 871 30 the swat simulation results of watershed predictors are dominated by a variety of parameters neitsch et al 2011 based on the sensitivity analysis exercise dong et al 2018 cn2 which relates surface runoff to precipitation dependent on land cover and soil properties is the most sensitive swat parameter for discharge simulation besides usle p and the soil erodibility factor usle k were identified as the sensitive parameters for the soil erosion process while estimation of tp loads was found sensitive to the phosphorus enrichment ratio erorgp swat calibration with the sequential uncertainty fitting ii sufi ii algorithm limited cn2 usle p usle k and erorgp to the ranges of 0 018 0 021 0 02 0 15 0 01 0 07 1 45 1 6 respectively no explicit distribution forms of the calibrated parameters were indicated and any values within the given ranges are possible for the convenience of representation in ph bbns we assume normal distributions for the swat parameters the same assumption has been used in many other watershed modeling studies freni mannina 2010 wellen et al 2014 the calibrated parameters were transformed to normal distributions table 2 following the three sigma 3σ rule jeong et al 2017 ensuring at least 99 7 of parameter values fall within the intervals of three standard deviations denoted by σ the ph bbn structure was specified by visualizing the interplays among the rainfall runoff soil erosion and nutrient transport processes with directed edges fig 3 a the probabilistic causal relationships between watershed predictors and relevant stressors are represented

2 4 2 ph bbn training and validation the cpds of ph bbns were estimated based on the input drivers and watershed projections of swat simulation different hrus respond distinctly to the external stressors attributed to different topographic and landscape characteristics therefore ph bbns should be trained separately for each specific hru the ph bbn training and validation procedure fig 3b comprises the following steps step1 design of experiments the latin hypercube sampling lhs method sheikholeslami razavi 2017 was used to generate samples of the swat input variables ip x n 1 x n 5 x d 1 x d 2 x d 3 table 2 with a sample size ns 20 000 the variables were segmented into ns intervals and subsequently one value was randomly selected from each interval in doing this all areas of the value domain were considered in the input samples by performing swat simulation with the input sample ip k k 1 2 n s the corresponding output sample op k y 1 k y 2 k y 3 k was generated which represents swat projection ensemble of surface runoff depths y 1 sediment loads y 2 and tp loads y 3 step 2 box cox transformation the continuous variables of bbns are required to follow normal distributions however many studies found that the hydrological and water quality predictors i e discharge and sediment tp loads preferably fit skewed normal distributions van buren et al 1997 bowers et al 2012 hence the box cox transformation method thyer et al 2002 was used to transform the swat output sample op k into a normal shape as follows 7 t y j k y j k λ j s k 1 λ j s k i f λ j s k 0 ln y j k i f λ j s k 0 j 1 2 3 k 1 2 n s where y j is the j th watershed predictor t y j k is the box cox transformed y j of the k th sample let s denotes the total number of state combinations for discrete nodes i e bmp scenarios the total number of possible bmp scenarios is s 2 3 6 3 6 as x d 1 x d 2 and x d 3 have two three and six possible values respectively table 2 each input sample ip k is consistent with a specific bmp scenario which is labeled with s k 1 2 s λ j s k is the box cox transformation parameter for y j under the s k th bmp scenario the optimum value of λ j s k is determined with the maximum likelihood estimation mle method myung 2003 the input samples and the normalized swat output samples ot k t y 1 k t y 2 k t y 3 k make up the normalized sample set d d k k 1 2 n s for ph bbn training where d k ip k ot k step 3 network training the sample set d was used to train ph bbns the posterior probability of t y j can be represented as follows 8 θ j h j v j p t y j pd t y j h j pc t y j v j where pd t y j and pc t y j represent the discrete and continuous parents of t y j respectively in our study case continuous parents include precipitation and swat parameters while discrete parents refer to bmp scenarios h j ω pd t y j and v j ω pc t y j are the states of pd t y j and pc t y j respectively since only t y j have parents the network structure of ph bbns can be represented with θ θ j h j v j j 1 2 3 indicating the ensemble of posterior probabilities θ was calculated with the mle method the log likelihood function of θ was used as the performance criterion which is formulated as 9 l θ d ln k 1 ns p d k θ the optimum estimate of θ was denoted as θ which was formulated as 10 θ arg max θ l θ d arg max θ ln k 1 ns p d k θ where p d k θ can be computed as follows based on eq 3 considering the fact that only t y j has parent nodes 11 p d k θ j 1 3 p t y j k pd t y j h j k pc t y j v j k θ j 1 3 n α j s k β j s k v j k σ j s k j 1 3 1

linear regression coefficients for pd t y j under the s k th bmp scenario the parameters associated with θ including α j s k β j s k and σ j s k can be estimated as follows based on eq 10 11 12 θ arg

variables of ph bbns which follow normal distributions should be transformed into the original skewed normal distributions to make them comparable with the swat projections a reverse box cox transformation was thus performed 13 y j k λ j s k b y j k 1 1 λ j s k if λ j s k 0 exp b y j k if λ j s k 0 j 1 2 3 k 1 2 n s where b y j k represents the mean ph bbn estimate of the j th watershed predictor corresponding to the swat predictand y j k y j k represents the reversely box cox transformed value of b y j k which follows the same skewed normal distribution as y j the performance of ph bbns in imitating swat was assessed against their capability to reproduce the swat projections the root mean squared error rmse which represents the discrepancy between y j k and y j k was used to evaluate the goodness of fit for ph bbns 14 rms e j 1 ns k 1 ns y j k y j k 2 the simulation accuracy of ph bbns should be examined via validation to confirm model reliability in this study the sample set d was divided into two datasets randomly i 75 of the samples were used to train ph bbns by estimating the optimum values of ph bbn parameters and ii the remaining 25 were used for ph bbn validation 2 4 3 variance based sensitivity analysis variance based sensitivity analysis was conducted for uncertainty decomposition to determine the degree to which variation in watershed projections is explained by the uncertain stressors the variance reduction ratio vrr calculated as the expected reduction in the variation of predictors glasserman et al 2000 was used to evaluate sensitivity for ph bbns for a specific bmp scenario the vrr of ph bbns can be calculated as follows 15 vr r j x n m 1 e v b y j x n m v b y j j 1 2 3 m 1 2 5 where vr r j x n m represents the sensitivity rate of the j th watershed predictor to the m th uncertain stressor x n m b y j represents the ph bbn output of the j th watershed predictor which follows the normal distribution v b y j and v b y j x n m are the variance of b y j prior to and after updating with evidence of x n m respectively e v b y j x n m is the expected value of v b y j x n m v b y j x n m can be estimated with the stratified strategy li mahadevan 2018 as follows 16 e v b y j x n m x n m p x n m v b y j x n m t 1 t p c x n m t v b y j x n m t where p x n m represents the probability density of x n m the cumulative distribution function cdf of x n m was divided into t intervals such that they have the same length of the probability bounds the median value of the t th interval for x n m was denoted as x n m t p c x n m t is the possibility of x n m falling into the t th interval which is equal to 1 t attributed to the equally probable intervals in this study the number of intervals was set to t 5 as shown in fig s1 3 results 3 1 swat simulation results the calibration and validation results of the swat model for the lake dianchi watershed were shown in fig s2 the average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficients for flow and tp validation were 0 83 and 0 74 respectively as watershed models were usually regarded as satisfactory with nse 0 5 good with nse 0 65 and very good with nse 0 75 moriasi et al 2007 the original swat application was proven a reliable representation of the lake dianchi watershed the annual average surface runoff depth sediment yields and tp loads of the target pma fig 1c in a typical wet year 2007 with 894 mm annual precipitation are 57 35 mm 0 87 tonnes ha and 2 11 kg ha respectively noticeably the surface runoff depth is much lower in cropland and forest which occupy about 70 of the total area than that in built up areas with high imperviousness table 3 the pma is comprised of 14 hrus which represent various combinations of land use soil types and slope intervals with area size varying between 0 34 and 1 53 km2 table 3 the swat simulation results suggest that the predictors varied spatially affected by the diversity of hru landscapes the hrus with steeper slopes and red soil are projected to have a larger potential for water sediment and tp loss the disparity is especially evident for hrus with distinct slopes for instance hrus 3 5 with identical soil and land use types are projected to annually export 7 03 kg ha 1 41 kg ha and 0 68 kg ha tp loads respectively corresponding to the 25 10 25 and 10 average slope the built up areas tend to export distinctly more surface runoff and sediment than cropland and forest as cropland contributes 80 of tp loads of the study area agricultural bmps were specifically designed to mitigate tp loss from cropland i e hrus 1 5 3 2 ph bbn calibration and validation the ph bbn was established calibrated and validated for each agricultural hru i e hrus 1 5 the sample set d was randomly split into two subsets with 75 samples as the training dataset and the remaining 25 as the validation dataset the performance of the ph bbns in emulating swat characterization of the lake dianchi watershed was evaluated with rmse in terms of reproducing surface runoff depth sediment loads and tp loads at the hru scale the magnitude of rmse can vary between zero and infinity it indicates a perfect match between ph bbn and swat when rmse 0 and an increasingly poor match with larger rmse values the calibration and validation results fig 4 demonstrate a good match between ph bbn projections and swat simulation in surface runoff depths mm sediment loads tonnes ha and tp loads kg ha the rmse values for all hrus vary from 0 02 to 0 36 mm for surface runoff depth 0 01 to 0 19 tonnes ha for sediment loads and 0 02 to 0 62 kg ha for tp loads respectively model calibration and validation display similar rmse values both of which approximate zero the results indicate that the model performance for calibration and validation is consistently good suggestive of the ph bbns as reliable surrogates for swat simulation at the agricultural hrus 3 3 uncertainties in watershed projections watershed projections with ph bbns are subject to great uncertainty which derives from uncertain swat parameters and weather variability fig 5 shows the pdf curves of ph bbn projections under the baseline scenario which is defined as the initial condition with no bmp implementation the data on the right side of the curves taper differently from those on the left side in other words the curves exhibit right skewness i e flatter tails on the right to varying degrees which indicates skewed distributions are more preferable than normal distributions to represent the watershed predictors we use the median and inter quartile range iqr to quantify the central and dispersion tendencies of the abnormal frequency distributions respectively the iqr also called middle fifty is equal to the difference between the upper and lower quartiles fig 5b there are noticeable disparities among pdfs in the five agricultural hrus as shown in fig 5a distinctly deeper annual average surface runoff was observed in hru 2 and hru 5 with a mild slope 10 where the medians of the corresponding frequency distributions 10 1 mm and 6 3 mm respectively are much larger than other hrus 3 mm in return the distribution spread of surface runoff depths suggests large uncertainty associated with projections in hru 2 and hru 5 where the iqrs are 6 0 mm and 4 5 mm respectively in contrast to all the other hrus with iqrs 1 0 mm for each hru the dispersion of sediment and tp loads is in close proximity to each other fig 5b c the results indicate the tight binding between tp and sediment loss as phosphorus is largely bound to sediment in the form of particulate phosphorus pp sandström et al 2020 hru 1 and hru 3 yield relatively more sediment and tp loads with larger variability compared to other hrus which cover narrower ranges and present smaller iqrs 0 2 tonnes ha and 1 2 kg ha for sediment and tp loads respectively the discrepancies among frequency distributions of different hrus fig 5 suggest distinct degrees of forecast uncertainty in different landscapes which is particularly evident for slopes our findings suggest that the uncertainty in quantifying sediment and tp loss is relatively larger in areas with steep slopes 25 with the average iqrs of 1 74 tonnes ha and 6 26 kg ha respectively in contrast the areas with mild slopes 10 display much lower uncertainty with the average iqrs for sediment and tp equal to 0 12 tonnes ha and 0 83 kg ha respectively to understand how uncertainties in precipitation and swat parameters affect the forecasts of watershed predictors vrrs were computed to measure the sensitivity of surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads to the uncertain stressors under the baseline scenario fig 6 precipitation is the most influential factor for all watershed predictors with an average vrr of 85 84 83 86 and 83 53 for surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads respectively representing the large partial variance of precipitation to the total ph bnn forecast variability the additive contribution of swat model parameters gave 14 16 16 11 and 16 47 for surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads on average respectively among which cn2 explaining 14 16 9 48 and 11 74 of the total ph bnn forecast variability is the most sensitive swat parameter the findings suggest that over 90 of the forecast variability was captured by precipitation and cn2 while the other swat parameters i e usle p usle k and erorgp have slight impacts on sediment and tp load projections it is worth noting that distinct vrrs were observed in different hrus despite the sensitivity ranking of the stressors remaining identical cn2 tends to be more sensitive in hru 1 and hru 3 where the average slope is 25 indicating cn2 has more significant impacts on areas with steep slopes attributed to their higher potential to generate surface runoff the high sensitivity of watershed projections to precipitation highlights the importance of assessing watershed responses to climate change three typical weather conditions were examined to examine the influence of precipitation on watershed predictors the precipitation exceedance percentiles of q25 891 mm q50 871 mm and q75 851 mm were used as the indicators for the wet normal and dry weather conditions respectively q25 refers to the 25 probability of the occurrence of the annual precipitation 891 mm and likewise for q50 and q75 the frequency distributions of surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads demonstrate remarkable disparities among the different weather conditions as the curves disperse distinctly to each other with small overlapping areas fig 7 for instance the medians of tp loading projections in hru 1 are 16 3 19 9 and 24 4 kg ha under the dry normal and wet weather conditions associated with gradually increased iqrs of 2 6 3 2 and 4 0 kg ha respectively fig 7c the large disparities in watershed projections under different weather conditions in the hrus suggest their great vulnerability to climate change 3 4 uncertainties in bmp effectiveness the effectiveness of candidate bmps was evaluated by triggering the corresponding discrete nodes table 2 of ph bbns the values of all discrete nodes are set to zero for the baseline scenario with no bmp implementation the pdf curves of the projected annual average surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads with the parallel terrace filter strip and fertilization management practices for hru 1 were shown against the baseline scenario in fig 8 the results for the other hrus were illustrated in fig s3 which display similar patterns to hru 1 as shown in fig 8 parallel terraces are capable of slightly reducing surface runoff with the median of annual average depths declining from 2 5 to 2 1 mm and significantly decreasing sediment and tp loads with 3 6 tonnes ha and 13 5 kg ha reduction in medians respectively filter strips are beneficial to mitigate the overland sediment and tp loss whereas do not affect surface runoff depths fig 8d f the effectiveness is greater with a larger strip width since the reduction in the median of annual sediment and tp loss increases from 2 6 and 10 1 kg ha to 3 3 and 12 4 kg ha respectively the overlapping lines in fig 8h i indicate that fertilization management is of no effect on surface runoff and sediment loss the pdfs of tp loads shift gently from the baseline pdf with increases in fertilizer reduction fig 8g the medians of tp load reduction are 1 3 2 5 3 7 4 8 and 5 8 kg ha corresponding to 10 20 30 40 and 50 reduction in fertilizer application amounts respectively in contrast the pdf curves under scenarios with terraces and filter strips show relatively distinct discrepancies from the baseline fig 8a f suggesting their greater effectiveness than fertilization management in particular parallel terraces are the most effective practice with the capability of mitigating the most water sediment and tp loss among the candidate bmps it is important to note that affected by the uncertain parameters and weather conditions considerable uncertainties were observed with bmp effectiveness notwithstanding the apparent narrower spread of pdfs in comparison with the baseline condition e g the iqr of the tp load distribution with parallel terraces declines from 8 89 kg ha to 3 21 kg ha fig 8c the significant decline in forecast uncertainties holds true with filter strips fig 8e f as well in contrast to the gently narrowed pdf curves with increasing fertilizer reduction ratios 4 discussion 4 1 potential impacts of future climate change on bmp effectiveness global warming tends to amplify the hydrological cycle in the form of intense precipitation events and flooding trenberth 2011 as surface runoff is the major driver of overland sediment and tp loss bmp effectiveness can be significantly affected by future climate change we took hru 1 as an example to examine the interaction effects of climate change and bmps on tp load inputs into lake dianchi the ph bbn modeling results fig 9 a c suggest bmps would become less effective in wetter weather conditions the tp load reduction ratios of parallel terraces fig 9a and filter strips fig 9b are projected with comparable decreasing tendencies varying from 74 and 70 in dry weather to 50 and 54 in wet weather with a 50 exceedance probability respectively the decline in bmp effectiveness is particularly pronounced for the fertilizer reduction practice with the tp load reduction ratio dramatically decreasing from 42 in dry weather to 14 in wet weather the results illustrated in fig 9c suggest that fertilization management is likely to be less effective attributed to future weather variability in particular there are chances that tp loads would increase with the fertilizer reduction practice under the normal and wet weather conditions fig 9c suggesting that bmp effectiveness could be masked by climate change since the annual precipitation in the lake dianchi watershed demonstrates an increasing trend in recent years fig s4 we suggest revising fertilization management accordingly with more reduction in fertilizers nevertheless reduction of fertilizer is still vital when nutrients are excess as this practice is capable to reduce tp loads given all other conditions being equal we should note that the reduction in fertilizers may sacrifice crop production which is limited by the amount of available nutrients a balanced reduction of fertilizer should make tradeoffs among the reduced cost with few fertilizers application declined crop yields and the environmental benefit in reducing tp loads considering the potential adverse impacts on crop production by reducing fertilizer application the implementation of parallel terraces and filter strips are comparatively recommended for aquatic restoration of lake dianchi in the long term our findings are on par with other studies on the impacts of climate change on bmp effectiveness bosch et al 2014 found that enhanced bmp implementation rates would be necessary to compensate for the climate driven increases in tp yields as climate change might mitigate bmp effectiveness chaubey et al 2010 demonstrated the increase in nutrient losses driven by weather variability might be even larger than the loading reduction attributed to bmps renkenberger et al 2017 concluded that more bmps were required to meet the tmdl target resulting from elevated annual rainfall intensity based on their swat modeling study in the chesapeake bay watershed notably long time efforts are expected for water quality restoration in eutrophic lakes liu et al 2020 our findings suggest bmps should be conservatively designed to cope with the potential climate driven contraction to bmp efficiency in the long term as tp load reduction with bmps can be offset by increases in precipitation quantities fig 9a c evaluating the impacts of climate change on bmps can help designers understand the changes in bmp performance and modification requirements in the future therefore further research could be performed by incorporating long term projections of climate change into pwms and ph bbns to get a deeper insight into the sustainability and flexibility of bmps 4 2 risk assessment of bmp scenarios and management implications recognizing that most bmps are usually applied in combination with others as a single practice is usually not sufficient a comparison of variability in tp mitigation efficiency was made under six different bmp implementation scenarios as shown in fig 10 the cdf curves illustrate the probability of exceeding specific tp reduction amounts which are indicators of the associated bmp decision risks the right tails of the cdf curves under the baseline scenario exhibit positive tp load changes suggestive of considerable chances 50 of exceeding the present tp loads table 2 without any future implementation of bmps which is attributed to the uncertain shifts of watershed states a similar phenomenon was also observed under the fourth scenario with a 15 chance of exceeding the present tp loads when performing fertilizer management the probability of achieving the 60 tp load reduction target is 74 60 and 4 under scenarios 2 3 and 4 respectively which suggests distinctly less non attainment risks with parallel terraces 26 and filter strips 40 compared to fertilizer management 96 notwithstanding the great effectiveness of parallel terraces and filter strips it is barely possible to achieve the 80 tp load reduction target by solely utilizing either of them since the exceedance probability is 1 a mixture of bmps rather than any individual practice is thus required to be put into effect for complying with tougher water quality criteria in this regard scenarios 5 and 6 both display considerable great compliance confidence with the exceedance probability of 92 and 99 for the 80 mitigation target respectively the subtle discrepancy between scenario 5 and scenario 6 with all bmps reinforces the relatively insignificant impacts of fertilization management on tp mitigation the aforementioned analysis of bmp effectiveness showed that parallel terraces are the most effective practice among the candidate bmps with the capability of mitigating the most water sediment and tp loss based on the risk assessment of bmp scenarios we recommend implementing parallel terraces in the first place for early stage aquatic restoration in doing this 60 of the present tp loads can be mitigated with a 74 compliance confidence level filter strips can be used as a follow up supplement measure for a more ambitious environmental target which together with parallel terraces are adequate for reducing the majority of tp loads 80 at a sufficient confidence level 92 our findings suggest that future bmp planning exercises to improve the prevailing water quality conditions will only be insightful if we consider non attainment risks for nutrient loading reduction goals which is helpful to enhance decision robustness a rigorous evaluation of the remediation efforts by jointly taking into account interactions among watershed processes uncertain stressors and bmp effectiveness is essential for prudential bmp planning the bayesian nature of our ph bbn modeling framework explicitly renders answers to the question of the decision reliability under the disturbance of uncertain stressors and as such could effectively guide the implementation of bmps the establishment of compliance rules such as 80 compliance confidence of reaching the nutrient load reduction goals is an essential step for the restoration of aquatic systems the graphical representation of ph bbns offers a new opportunity to facilitate the participation of stakeholders in the modeling and inference process the visualized interactions between watershed processes and the relevant anthropogenic natural stressors allow intuitive insight into complex watershed systems in addition the ph bbn model is a valuable tool to support adaptive watershed management based on learning while doing more empirical evidence supplied with ongoing monitoring could be embedded in the ph bbn framework to update the understanding of watershed responses to the ever changing external stressors our sensitivity analysis of uncertain stressors is helpful to prioritize the activities of monitoring and information collection the ph bbn modeling framework can be easily customized to uncertainty based bmp planning in other regions while network construction may vary among different watersheds for instance parallel terraces are promising bmps for our study area located in yunnan guizhou plateau with steep slopes however they are usually not applicable in plain regions the target contaminant critical watershed processes and candidate bmps should be site specifically re examined further improvement can be performed by engaging various stakeholders incorporating more predictors and external stressors of concern or integrating ph bbns with dynamic programming approaches for long term adaptive bmp optimization under climate change 5 conclusion 1 the calibration and validation results indicate that the ph bbns are capable to reproduce the effects of uncertain parameters weather variability and bmps on watershed projections with swat with rmse values varying between 0 01 and 0 62 the ph bnn modeling framework can thus render decision support as a reliable surrogate of swat for bmp planning with great predictive capacity 2 ph bbn projections of surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads are subject to great uncertainty distinct impacts of uncertain weather conditions and swat parameters on watershed predictors were observed in different landscapes the forecast uncertainties of sediment and tp loads were relatively larger in areas with steep slopes 3 precipitation was found to be the most influencing factor accounting for 80 of the predictive variability which highlights watershed vulnerability to climate change cn2 is the most sensitive swat parameter whereas the other parameters i e usle p usle k and erorgp have slight impacts on watershed projections 4 the effectiveness of candidate bmps is ranked as parallel terraces filter strips fertilization management while the benefit can be masked by climate change the fertilizer reduction practice is still justified which can reduce tp loads given all other conditions being equal these bmps are projected to be less effective in wetter weather conditions bmps should be conservatively designed to cope with the decline in bmp efficiency caused by increases in rainfall intensity 5 parallel terraces reducing 60 of the present tp loads with 74 compliance confidence are recommended with the highest implementation priority implementation of both parallel terraces and filter strips is projected to reduce 80 of tp loads at a considerable confidence level 92 while it is barely possible to achieve this target by solely implementing either one 6 the ph bbn modeling framework can i explicitly reveal the decision reliability of bmps under manifold uncertainties ii visualize the interactions among watershed processes and drivers and iii support adaptive watershed management based on learning while doing the modeling framework can be customized to uncertainty based bmp planning in other regions as well credit

2794,planning of best management practices bmps is increasingly dependent on process based watershed models pwms and suffers from large uncertainties the large complexity and long runtimes of such models make prudential watershed management a difficult undertaking in this study we aimed to bridge the gaps between pwms and uncertainty based bmp planning with bayesian belief network bbns a new modeling framework of process guided hybrid bbns ph bbns was developed to represent the probabilistic cascade of critical modules in soil water assessment tool swat a widely used pwm across external stressors e g weather and various bmps parametric uncertainties and watershed predictors the ph bbn modeling framework was used for decision support of nonpoint source nps pollution mitigation in an intensively cultivated area adjacent to lake dianchi one of the three most eutrophic lakes in china our findings suggest that ph bbns can capture the critical pathways of water sediment and total phosphorus tp loss watershed projections are subject to large uncertainties to varying degrees in different landscapes according to variance based sensitivity analysis precipitation accounts for 80 of the projection variability which underlines watershed vulnerability to climate change as the effectiveness of parallel terraces filter strips and fertilization management would degrade with increasing rainfall intensity they should be conservatively designed for bmp sustainability implementation of parallel terraces and filter strips is recommended as they are projected to reduce 80 of tp loads with 90 compliance confidence ph bbns can render effective decision support for bmp risk assessment and adaptive watershed management under climate change keywords uncertainty best management practices diffuse pollution climate change bayesian belief network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excess diffuse nutrients caused by agricultural activities have been widely recognized as a critical contributor to water quality deterioration tong et al 2017 best management practices bmps are promising technologies to mitigate non point source nps pollution and restore impaired aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2017 as field investigations and monitoring for watershed scale bmp evaluation can be costly and site specific process based watershed models pwms which provide mechanistic spatio temporal representations of the interplays among meteorology topography conservation practices and watershed processes e g surface runoff soil erosion and nutrient transport have been widely used for watershed simulation and evaluation of bmp effectiveness chen et al 2018 arhonditsis et al 2019 in the majority of previous studies bmp effectiveness in reducing nps pollution was generally deterministically evaluated using a calibrated watershed model with the best fit parameter set molina navarro et al 2017 todeschini et al 2018 dong et al 2019 nevertheless models are merely an abstraction of the complicated real world which inevitably makes them subject to uncertainties white 2018 nerantzaki et al 2020 accurate and reliable forecasts of bmp effectiveness have remained a great challenge attributed to underlying uncertainties associated with climate change model parameters monitoring natural variability of the ecosystem and inefficient bmp adoption etc decisions are inadequate and in many cases misleading when overlooking uncertainty propagation from various sources into watershed projections in recent years uncertainties in bmp effectiveness have triggered considerable attention while decision makers are increasingly interested in all possible outcomes and associated risks of watershed management strategies zou et al 2014 tasdighi et al 2018 raei et al 2019 a deep understanding of the integrative effects of various stressors on uncertain watershed responses is thus required for uncertainty based bmp planning while many studies have investigated the uncertainties in projections of target pollutants e g instream nutrient fluxes uncertainties propagations across the relevant influential watershed processes have received little attention lloyd et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 there is a need for a bridge between pwms and bmp planning under uncertainty which entails an approach incorporating uncertain external stressors internal interactions among watershed processes and evaluation of bmp effectiveness a major challenge in an integrative bmp modeling effort is the large computational expense to quantify uncertainties in watershed projections uncertainty assessment requires long runtimes by testing pwm responses to various stressors whereas modeling for bmp decision support is intended to be efficient and accessible zou et al 2015 dong et al 2020 a prevailing solution is the pursuit of a simplification strategy to reduce the computational budget incurred by process based watershed modeling computationally inexpensive surrogate models based on data driven emulation have been widely used for model simplification examples of the emulation approaches include multivariate regression chen et al 2020 artificial neural network shaw et al 2017 support vector machine yan et al 2018 and response surface yin tsai 2018 nevertheless the prevailing approaches are mostly black box representations of quantitative correlations between input drivers and predictors without insights into the internal structure and physical laws of watershed systems thus there is a lack of transparency and comprehensibility for decision support systems based on such conventional models bohanec et al 2017 bayesian belief networks bbns are probabilistic rather than deterministic representations of the stochastic links among variables based on conditional probability distributions in pwms multiple submodels are assembled to represent the watershed processes fatichi et al 2016 saxe et al 2019 the graphical nature of bbn models can explicitly display connections among various submodel components which facilitate the development of a conceptual model capturing the causalities between external stressors bmps and uncertain watershed responses the visualization of multiple watershed processes and variables with bbns can improve model interpretation and encourage interdisciplinary discussion for stakeholders from a broad variety of backgrounds bbns are beneficial to examine uncertainty propagation across submodels and deal with the issues of very large uncertainties data limitations and knowledge gaps there has been an increasing interest in bbns as a modeling and decision support tool in a watershed context including flood risk analysis chen et al 2019 stormwater pollution management park stenstrom 2006 total maximum daily loads tmdl regulation ames lall 2008 and ecological risk assessment mcdonald et al 2016 bbns are generally constructed with discrete nodes represented with categories or intervals aguilera et al 2011 continuous variables should be discretized into several states for their representations in discrete bbns which could lead to considerable information loss ropero et al 2018 in this regard continuous bbns which represent variables with statistical distributions instead of discretization have triggered broad interest maldonado et al 2016 hradsky et al 2017 nevertheless qualitative information e g environmental policies and decision preferences cannot be represented in continuous bbns most recently hybrid bbns have emerged as an increasingly promising approach as they avoid information loss suffering from the discretization of continuous evidence and in the meantime retain the capability of dealing with qualitative information ropero et al 2014 while the diversity of information in a watershed management context entails the usage of hybrid bbns they have been barely used for bmp decision support and even less are the studies on the development of data driven pwm surrogates with hybrid bbns to facilitate bmp planning under uncertainty for the sake of overcoming the limitations of pwms and black box data driven models while allowing access to their strengths herein we exploit a new modeling framework of process guided hybrid bbns ph bbns which were constructed based on the critical causal mechanisms among watershed processes the overarching goal of this study is to develop a computational procedure for a probabilistic bmp planning tool the specific objectives are to i examine uncertainties in projections of critical watershed variables ii evaluate the impacts of weather variability and parametric uncertainty on bmp effectiveness and iii determine the compliance confidence of different bmp scenarios reaching environmental targets while previous studies have investigated the bmp effectiveness via deterministic watershed modeling a probabilistic bmp decision support tool embedding watershed subsystems into hybrid bbns is novel the ph bbn modeling framework presented in this study can provide a bridge between deterministic watershed models and uncertainty based bmp planning 2 methodology 2 1 study area lake dianchi fig 1 is the largest lake in yunnan province china it is located in the yunnan guizhou plateau with a capacity of 15 8 108 m3 and an average water depth of 5 m the surrounding watershed of lake dianchi which covers a drainage area of 2920 km2 encompasses multiple tributaries such as the panlong river baoxiang river and the chai river the prevailing climate is mild with a 15 c mean air temperature forest cropland and built up areas occupy 55 20 and 17 of the watershed respectively while the remaining 8 is covered with water and pasture lake dianchi is confronting the serious threat of eutrophication among china s eutrophic lakes lake dianchi is suffering from the most severe harmful algal blooms with an estimated magnitude of 208 6 km2 i e 67 5 of the surface area in 2018 huang et al 2020 diffuse phosphorus loading has been identified as the primary culprit resulting in the eutrophication of lake dianchi liu et al 2006 the previous study has reported the chai river catchment as the largest contributor to diffuse tp loads dong et al 2018 specifically the subbasin surrounding the estuary of the chai river 1 in fig 1c contributing the largest annual unit area tp loads 2 1 kg ha in contrast with 0 04 1 7 kg ha in other subbasins has been identified as the high level priority management areas pmas fig 1b with the priority for nps pollution control dong et al 2018 hence we explore bmp planning in this pma with particular attention to tp load mitigation in this study the study area covers an area of 9 6 km2 where the dominant land use type is cropland 35 approximately 45 of the area has a fairly steep slope of 25 the paddy soil 64 and red soil 36 are the dominant soil types which are prone to weathering and hydrolyzing as a result the study area is significantly vulnerable to soil erosion and nutrient loss which entails measures to mitigate sediment and tp inputs into lake dianchi 2 2 description of the modeling framework a ph bbn modeling framework integrating the pwm and hybrid bbns fig 2 was proposed to render decision support for bmp planning under uncertainty which comprises the following steps step1 watershed simulation and bmp prescreening a pwm is established to simulate the water sediment and nutrient cycling processes at the watershed scale the pwm is subsequently calibrated and validated against the historical streamflow and water quality records bmps are prescreened based on the characteristics of watershed landscapes and pollution sources an early stage evaluation of bmp feasibility and the anticipated benefits in reducing water sediment and nutrient loss is made based on the pwm step 2 specification of the ph bbn structure the probability distributions of uncertain stressors e g pwm parameterization and meteorological states affecting bmp effectiveness are identified for ph bbn construction the network structure of ph bbns is specified and visualized dependent on the causal linkage among the critical watershed processes the associated stressors and candidate bmps step 3 ph bbn training and validation the parameters of ph bbns are learned based on data samples of pwm inputs i e bmps and uncertain stressors and the corresponding pwm outputs i e projections of watershed responses validation is subsequently performed for affirming the emulation accuracy of ph bbns step 4 scenario and risk analysis for bmp planning probabilistic inference is conducted with the ph bbn models the probability distributions of water sediment and nutrient loss are projected under different weather conditions and bmp scenarios the risks of the designed bmp strategies in compliance with pollutant mitigation targets are evaluated and the bmp implementation guidance is accordingly provided the detailed approaches of the ph bbn modeling framework are presented in the following sub sections 2 3 watershed modeling and bmp representation with swat soil and water assessment tool swat one of the most popular pwms was embedded in the ph bbn modeling framework for our case study swat is a semi distributed watershed simulation tool developed by the united states department of agriculture usda which consists of modules simulating the hydrological cycle soil erosion nutrient transport and agricultural conservation practices etc swat watershed simulation is based on input information such as the digital elevation model dem land uses soil types and properties meteorological data and farming practices swat model setup begins with watershed delineation and identification of hydrologic response units hrus for characterization of spatial heterogeneity hrus the basic computational units for swat simulation are generated by overlapping land use slope and soil layers additional details of swat model setup modules and theories were documented by neitsch et al 2011 swat was used for simulation of watershed processes in the lake dianchi watershed which was delineated into 64 subbasins based on the 30 m resolution dem and further partitioned into 319 hrus daily instream flows and tp loads were simulated from 2001 to 2010 and the first two years were taken as the warm up period to phase out the impacts of initial watershed conditions the hydrologic submodel of swat was calibrated against discharge observations from 2003 to 2006 and validated from 2007 to 2010 subsequently the parameters relevant to sediment and tp were calibrated from 2004 to 2007 and validated from 2008 to 2010 on the monthly time step swat calibration and validation were conducted with the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 abbaspour et al 1997 the calibrated swat parameters for lake dianchi watershed can be found in table s1 the details on the swat application to the lake dianchi watershed the data sources employed in the present study and pma identification can be found in dong et al 2018 swat is capable of evaluating the individual or integrative effects of bmps on watershed hydrology and water quality as the chai river catchment is an intensively farmed area with steep slopes the practices of parallel terraces edge of field filter strips and fertilizer management were selected as the candidate bmps for nps pollution mitigation parallel terraces are effective erosion control practices by decreasing the length of the slope exposed to sheet and rill erosion baryla pierzgalski 2008 parallel terraces were represented in swat by altering the values of the initial curve number for antecedent runoff condition ii cn2 support practice factor usle p and average slope length slsubbsn at the hru scale bracmort et al 2006 as parallel terraces were usually adopted as conservation practices for moderate and steep slope landscapes usda 2001 they were exclusively designed in the hrus with an average slope 10 in this study following recommendations of the previous studies and swat manual arabi et al 2007 neitsch et al 2011 cn2 was reduced by 0 2 and usle p was set to 0 1 for the implementation of parallel terraces in the meantime the average slope length of each hru was calculated with an empirical linear function between slsubbsn and the adverse of slopes that is slsubbsn a b s 100 where a and b are empirical parameters of the linear function with a 0 21 and b 0 9 and s is the average slope arabi et al 2007 edge of field filter strips also known as field borders are densely vegetated areas at the edges of cropland fields filter strips offer an opportunity for sediment and nutrients moving off the cropland to interact with the vegetation and soil which are represented by empirical functions of the filter width filterw in swat reducing fertilizer application is a straightforward way to mitigate nutrient loss from the source which may also increase short term profitability as soils have already accumulated sufficient amounts of nutrients darras et al 2019 the amount of fertilizer application kg ha was represented with the swat parameter frt kg the candidate bmps and the corresponding parameters for their representation in swat were summarized in table 1 2 4 construction of process guided hybrid bbns 2 4 1 network structural specification ph bbns were established to represent the probabilistic interactions among weather swat parameters bmps and watershed predictors based on the inputs and outputs of the calibrated swat model for the lake dianchi watershed while swat attempts to convey the complicated nature of the watershed as a semi distributed process based model hybrid bbns were used to provide simpler approximations of swat for uncertainty based bmp planning as surface runoff picks up and carries away pollutants and deposits them into the receiving water bodies it is recognized as the dominant pathway for soil and nutrient loss bashagaluke et al 2018 which especially holds true for high plateau watersheds e g the lake dianchi watershed with extremely steep slopes the swat application in the lake dianchi watershed revealed that almost all tp yields 90 were driven by surface runoff dong et al 2018 and thus we specifically focused on the overland processes of water sediment and tp loss in this study the watershed predictors i e surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads are affected by multiple driving factors such as precipitation swat parameters and bmps based on the frequency analysis of the historical 1951 2010 precipitation records the annual precipitation follows a normal distribution with a mean of 871 mm and a standard deviation of 30 mm which was denoted as n 871 30 the swat simulation results of watershed predictors are dominated by a variety of parameters neitsch et al 2011 based on the sensitivity analysis exercise dong et al 2018 cn2 which relates surface runoff to precipitation dependent on land cover and soil properties is the most sensitive swat parameter for discharge simulation besides usle p and the soil erodibility factor usle k were identified

were indicated and any values within the given ranges are possible for the convenience of representation in ph bbns we assume normal distributions for the swat parameters the same assumption has been used in many other watershed modeling studies freni mannina 2010 wellen et al 2014 the calibrated parameters were transformed to normal distributions table 2 following the three sigma 3σ rule jeong et

2 4 2 ph bbn training and validation the cpds of ph bbns were estimated based on the input drivers and watershed projections of swat simulation different hrus respond distinctly to the external stressors attributed to different topographic and landscape characteristics therefore ph bbns should be trained separately for each specific hru the ph bbn training and validation procedure fig 3b comprises the following steps step1 design of experiments the latin hypercube sampling lhs method sheikholeslami razavi 2017 was used to generate samples of the swat input variables ip x n 1 x n 5 x d 1 x d 2 x d 3 table 2 with a sample size ns 20 000 the variables were segmented into ns intervals and subsequently one value was randomly selected from each interval in doing this all areas of the value domain were considered in the input samples by performing swat simulation with the input sample ip k k 1 2 n s the corresponding output sample op k y 1 k y 2 k y 3 k was generated which represents swat projection ensemble of surface runoff depths y 1 sediment loads y 2 and tp loads y 3 step 2 box cox transformation the continuous variables of bbns are required to follow normal distributions however many studies found that the hydrological and water quality predictors i e discharge and sediment tp loads preferably fit skewed normal distributions van buren et al 1997 bowers et al 2012 hence the box cox transformation method thyer et al 2002 was used to transform the swat output sample op k into a normal shape as follows 7 t y j k y j k λ j s k 1 λ j s k i f λ j s k 0 ln y j k i f λ j s k 0 j 1 2 3 k 1 2 n s where y j is the j th watershed predictor t y j k is the box cox transformed y j of the k th sample let s denotes the total number of state combinations for discrete nodes i e bmp scenarios the total number of possible bmp scenarios is s 2 3 6 3 6 as x d 1 x d 2 and x d 3 have two three and six possible values respectively table 2 each input sample ip k is consistent with a specific bmp scenario which is labeled with s k 1 2 s λ j s k is the box cox transformation parameter for y j under the s k th bmp scenario the optimum value of λ j s k is determined with the maximum likelihood estimation mle method myung 2003 the input samples and the normalized swat output samples ot k t y 1 k t y 2 k t y 3 k make up the normalized sample set d d k k 1 2 n s for ph bbn training where d k ip k ot k step 3 network training the sample set d was used to train ph bbns the posterior probability of t y j can be represented as follows 8 θ j h j v j p t y j pd t y j h j pc t y j v j where pd t y j and pc t y j represent the discrete and continuous parents of t y j respectively in our study case continuous parents include precipitation and swat parameters while discrete parents refer to bmp scenarios h j ω pd t y j and v j ω pc t y j are the states of pd t y j and pc t y j respectively since only t y j have parents the network structure of ph bbns can be represented with θ θ j h j v j j 1 2 3 indicating the ensemble of posterior probabilities θ was calculated with the mle method the log likelihood function of θ was used as the performance criterion which is formulated as 9 l θ d ln k 1 ns p d k θ the optimum estimate of θ was denoted as θ which was formulated as 10 θ arg max θ l θ d arg max θ ln k 1 ns p d k θ where p d k θ can be computed as follows based on eq 3 considering the fact that only t y j has parent nodes 11 p d k θ j 1 3 p t y j k pd t y j h j k pc t y j v j k θ j 1 3 n α j s k β j s k v j k σ j s k j 1 3 1

linear regression coefficients for pd t y j under the s k th bmp scenario the parameters associated with θ including α j s k β j s k and σ j s k can be estimated as follows based on eq 10 11 12 θ arg

variables of ph bbns which follow normal distributions should be transformed into the original skewed normal distributions to make them comparable with the swat projections a reverse box cox transformation was thus performed 13 y j k λ j s k b y j k 1 1 λ j s k if λ j s k 0 exp b y j k if λ j s k 0 j 1 2 3 k 1 2 n s where b y j k represents the mean ph bbn estimate of the j th watershed predictor corresponding to the swat predictand y j k y j k represents the reversely box cox transformed value of b y j k which follows the same skewed normal distribution as y j the performance of ph bbns in imitating swat was assessed against their capability to reproduce the swat projections the root mean squared error rmse which represents the discrepancy between y j k and y j k was used to evaluate the goodness of fit for ph bbns 14 rms e j 1 ns k 1 ns y j k y j k 2 the simulation accuracy of ph bbns should be examined via validation to confirm model reliability in this study the sample set d was divided into two datasets randomly i 75 of the samples were used to train ph bbns by estimating the optimum values of ph bbn parameters and ii the remaining 25 were used for ph bbn validation 2 4 3 variance based sensitivity analysis variance based sensitivity analysis was conducted for uncertainty decomposition to determine the degree to which variation in watershed projections is explained by the uncertain stressors the variance reduction ratio vrr calculated as the expected reduction in the variation of predictors glasserman et al 2000 was used to evaluate sensitivity for ph bbns for a specific bmp scenario the vrr of ph bbns can be calculated as follows 15 vr r j x n m 1 e v b y j x n m v b y j j 1 2 3 m 1 2 5 where vr r j x n m represents the sensitivity rate of the j th watershed predictor to the m th uncertain stressor x n m b y j represents the ph bbn output of the j th watershed predictor which follows the normal distribution v b y j and v b y j x n m are the variance of b y j prior to and after updating with evidence of x n m respectively e v b y j x n m is the expected value of v b y j x n m v b y j x n m can be estimated with the stratified strategy li mahadevan 2018 as follows 16 e v b y j x n m x n m p x n m v b y j x n m t 1 t p c x n m t v b y j x n m t where p x n m represents the probability density of x n m the cumulative distribution function cdf of x n m was divided into t intervals such that they have the same length of the probability bounds the median value of the t th interval for x n m was denoted as x n m t p c x n m t is the possibility of x n m falling into the t th interval which is equal to 1 t attributed to the equally probable intervals in this study the number of intervals was set to t 5 as shown in fig s1 3 results 3 1 swat simulation results the calibration and validation results of the swat model for the lake dianchi watershed were shown in fig s2 the average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficients for flow and tp validation were 0 83 and 0 74 respectively as watershed models were usually regarded as satisfactory with nse 0 5 good with nse 0 65 and very good with nse 0 75 moriasi et al 2007 the original swat application was proven a reliable representation of the lake dianchi watershed the annual average surface runoff depth sediment yields and tp loads of the target pma fig 1c in a typical wet year 2007 with 894 mm annual precipitation are 57 35 mm 0 87 tonnes ha and 2 11 kg ha respectively noticeably the surface runoff depth is much lower in cropland and forest which occupy about 70 of the total area than that in built up areas with high imperviousness table 3 the pma is comprised of 14 hrus which represent various combinations of land use soil types and slope intervals with area size varying between 0 34 and 1 53 km2 table 3 the swat simulation results suggest that the predictors varied spatially affected by the diversity of hru landscapes the hrus with steeper slopes and red soil are projected to have a larger potential for water sediment and tp loss the disparity is especially evident for hrus with distinct slopes for instance hrus 3 5 with identical soil and land use types are projected to annually export 7 03 kg ha 1 41 kg ha and 0 68 kg ha tp loads respectively corresponding to the 25 10 25 and 10 average slope the built up areas tend to export distinctly more surface runoff and sediment than cropland and forest as cropland contributes 80 of tp loads of the study area agricultural bmps were specifically designed to mitigate tp loss from cropland i e hrus 1 5 3 2 ph bbn calibration and validation the ph bbn was established calibrated and validated for each agricultural hru i e hrus 1 5 the sample set d was randomly split into two subsets with 75 samples as the training dataset and the remaining 25 as the validation dataset the performance of the ph bbns in emulating swat characterization of the lake dianchi watershed was evaluated with rmse in terms of reproducing surface runoff depth sediment loads and tp loads at the hru scale the magnitude of rmse can vary between zero and infinity it indicates a perfect match between ph bbn and swat when rmse 0 and an increasingly poor match with larger rmse values the calibration and validation results fig 4 demonstrate a good match between ph bbn projections and swat simulation in surface runoff depths mm sediment loads tonnes ha and tp loads kg ha the rmse values for all hrus vary from 0 02 to 0 36 mm for surface runoff depth 0 01 to 0 19 tonnes ha for sediment loads and 0 02 to 0 62 kg ha for tp loads respectively model calibration and validation display similar rmse values both of which approximate zero the results indicate that the model performance for calibration and validation is consistently good suggestive of the ph bbns as reliable surrogates for swat simulation at the agricultural hrus 3 3 uncertainties in watershed projections watershed projections with ph bbns are subject to great uncertainty which derives from uncertain swat parameters and weather variability fig 5 shows the pdf curves of ph bbn projections under the baseline scenario which is defined as the initial condition with no bmp implementation the data on the right side of the curves taper differently from those on the left side in other words the curves exhibit right skewness i e flatter tails on the right to varying degrees which indicates skewed distributions are more preferable than normal distributions to represent the watershed predictors we use the median and inter quartile range iqr to quantify the central and dispersion tendencies of the abnormal frequency distributions respectively the iqr also called middle fifty is equal to the difference between the upper and lower quartiles fig 5b there are noticeable disparities among pdfs in the five agricultural hrus as shown in fig 5a distinctly deeper annual average surface runoff was observed in hru 2 and hru 5 with a mild slope 10 where the medians of the corresponding frequency distributions 10 1 mm and 6 3 mm respectively are much larger than other hrus 3 mm in return the distribution spread of surface runoff depths suggests large uncertainty associated with projections in hru 2 and hru 5 where the iqrs are 6 0 mm and 4 5 mm respectively in contrast to all the other hrus with iqrs 1 0 mm for each hru the dispersion of sediment and tp loads is in close proximity to each other fig 5b c the results indicate the tight binding between tp and sediment loss as phosphorus is largely bound to sediment in the form of particulate phosphorus pp sandström et al 2020 hru 1 and hru 3 yield relatively more sediment and tp loads with larger variability compared to other hrus which cover narrower ranges and present smaller iqrs 0 2 tonnes ha and 1 2 kg ha for sediment and tp loads respectively the discrepancies among frequency distributions of different hrus fig 5 suggest distinct degrees of forecast uncertainty in different landscapes which is particularly evident for slopes our findings suggest that the uncertainty in quantifying sediment and tp loss is relatively larger in areas with steep slopes 25 with the average iqrs of 1 74 tonnes ha and 6 26 kg ha respectively in contrast the areas with mild slopes 10 display much lower uncertainty with the average iqrs for sediment and tp equal to 0 12 tonnes ha and 0 83 kg ha respectively to understand how uncertainties in precipitation and swat parameters affect the forecasts of watershed predictors vrrs were computed to measure the sensitivity of surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads to the uncertain stressors under the baseline scenario fig 6 precipitation is the most influential factor for all watershed predictors with an average vrr of 85 84 83 86 and 83 53 for surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads respectively representing the large partial variance of precipitation to the total ph bnn forecast variability the additive contribution of swat model parameters gave 14 16 16 11 and 16 47 for surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads on average respectively among which cn2 explaining 14 16 9 48 and 11 74 of the total ph bnn forecast variability is the most sensitive swat parameter the findings suggest that over 90 of the forecast variability was captured by precipitation and cn2 while the other swat parameters i e usle p usle k and erorgp have slight impacts on sediment and tp load projections it is worth noting that distinct vrrs were observed in different hrus despite the sensitivity ranking of the stressors remaining identical cn2 tends to be more sensitive in hru 1 and hru 3 where the average slope is 25 indicating cn2 has more significant impacts on areas with steep slopes attributed to their higher potential to generate surface runoff the high sensitivity of watershed projections to precipitation highlights the importance of assessing watershed responses to climate change three typical weather conditions were examined to examine the influence of precipitation on watershed predictors the precipitation exceedance percentiles of q25 891 mm q50 871 mm and q75 851 mm were used as the indicators for the wet normal and dry weather conditions respectively q25 refers to the 25 probability of the occurrence of the annual precipitation 891 mm and likewise for q50 and q75 the frequency distributions of surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads demonstrate remarkable disparities among the different weather conditions as the curves disperse distinctly to each other with small overlapping areas fig 7 for instance the medians of tp loading projections in hru 1 are 16 3 19 9 and 24 4 kg ha under the dry normal and wet weather conditions associated with gradually increased iqrs of 2 6 3 2 and 4 0 kg ha respectively fig 7c the large disparities in watershed projections under different weather conditions in the hrus suggest their great vulnerability to climate change 3 4 uncertainties in bmp effectiveness the effectiveness of candidate bmps was evaluated by triggering the corresponding discrete nodes table 2 of ph bbns the values of all discrete nodes are set to zero for the baseline scenario with no bmp implementation the pdf curves of the projected annual average surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads with the parallel terrace filter strip and fertilization management practices for hru 1 were shown against the baseline scenario in fig 8 the results for the other hrus were illustrated in fig s3 which display similar patterns to hru 1 as shown in fig 8 parallel terraces are capable of slightly reducing surface runoff with the median of annual average depths declining from 2 5 to 2 1 mm and significantly decreasing sediment and tp loads with 3 6 tonnes ha and 13 5 kg ha reduction in medians respectively filter strips are beneficial to mitigate the overland sediment and tp loss whereas do not affect surface runoff depths fig 8d f the effectiveness is greater with a larger strip width since the reduction in the median of annual sediment and tp loss increases from 2 6 and 10 1 kg ha to 3 3 and 12 4 kg ha respectively the overlapping lines in fig 8h i indicate that fertilization management is of no effect on surface runoff and sediment loss the pdfs of tp loads shift gently from the baseline pdf with increases in fertilizer reduction fig 8g the medians of tp load reduction are 1 3 2 5 3 7 4 8 and 5 8 kg ha corresponding to 10 20 30 40 and 50 reduction in fertilizer application amounts respectively in contrast the pdf curves under scenarios with terraces and filter strips show relatively distinct discrepancies from the baseline fig 8a f suggesting their greater effectiveness than fertilization management in particular parallel terraces are the most effective practice with the capability of mitigating the most water sediment and tp loss among the candidate bmps it is important to note that affected by the uncertain parameters and weather conditions considerable uncertainties were observed with bmp effectiveness notwithstanding the apparent narrower spread of pdfs in comparison with the baseline condition e g the iqr of the tp load distribution with parallel terraces declines from 8 89 kg ha to 3 21 kg ha fig 8c the significant decline in forecast uncertainties holds true with filter strips fig 8e f as well in contrast to the gently narrowed pdf curves with increasing fertilizer reduction ratios 4 discussion 4 1 potential impacts of future climate change on bmp effectiveness global warming tends to amplify the hydrological cycle in the form of intense precipitation events and flooding trenberth 2011 as surface runoff is the major driver of overland sediment and tp loss bmp effectiveness can be significantly affected by future climate change we took hru 1 as an example to examine the interaction effects of climate change and bmps on tp load inputs into lake dianchi the ph bbn modeling results fig 9 a c suggest bmps would become less effective in wetter weather conditions the tp load reduction ratios of parallel terraces fig 9a and filter strips fig 9b are projected with comparable decreasing tendencies varying from 74 and 70 in dry weather to 50 and 54 in wet weather with a 50 exceedance probability respectively the decline in bmp effectiveness is particularly pronounced for the fertilizer reduction practice with the tp load reduction ratio dramatically decreasing from 42 in dry weather to 14 in wet weather the results illustrated in fig 9c suggest that fertilization management is likely to be less effective attributed to future weather variability in particular there are chances that tp loads would increase with the fertilizer reduction practice under the normal and wet weather conditions fig 9c suggesting that bmp effectiveness could be masked by climate change since the annual precipitation in the lake dianchi watershed demonstrates an increasing trend in recent years fig s4 we suggest revising fertilization management accordingly with more reduction in fertilizers nevertheless reduction of fertilizer is still vital when nutrients are excess as this practice is capable to reduce tp loads given all other conditions being equal we should note that the reduction in fertilizers may sacrifice crop production which is limited by the amount of available nutrients a balanced reduction of fertilizer should make tradeoffs among the reduced cost with few fertilizers application declined crop yields and the environmental benefit in reducing tp loads considering the potential adverse impacts on crop production by reducing fertilizer application the implementation of parallel terraces and filter strips are comparatively recommended for aquatic restoration of lake dianchi in the long term our findings are on par with other studies on the impacts of climate change on bmp effectiveness bosch et al 2014 found that enhanced bmp implementation rates would be necessary to compensate for the climate driven increases in tp yields as climate change might mitigate bmp effectiveness chaubey et al 2010 demonstrated the increase in nutrient losses driven by weather variability might be even larger than the loading reduction attributed to bmps renkenberger et al 2017 concluded that more bmps were required to meet the tmdl target resulting from elevated annual rainfall intensity based on their swat modeling study in the chesapeake bay watershed notably long time efforts are expected for water quality restoration in eutrophic lakes liu et al 2020 our findings suggest bmps should be conservatively designed to cope with the potential climate driven contraction to bmp efficiency in the long term as tp load reduction with bmps can be offset by increases in precipitation quantities fig 9a c evaluating the impacts of climate change on bmps can help designers understand the changes in bmp performance and modification requirements in the future therefore further research could be performed by incorporating long term projections of climate change into pwms and ph bbns to get a deeper insight into the sustainability and flexibility of bmps 4 2 risk assessment of bmp scenarios and management implications recognizing that most bmps are usually applied in combination with others as a single practice is usually not sufficient a comparison of variability in tp mitigation efficiency was made under six different bmp implementation scenarios as shown in fig 10 the cdf curves illustrate the probability of exceeding specific tp reduction amounts which are indicators of the associated bmp decision risks the right tails of the cdf curves under the baseline scenario exhibit positive tp load changes suggestive of considerable chances 50 of exceeding the present tp loads table 2 without any future implementation of bmps which is attributed to the uncertain shifts of watershed states a similar phenomenon was also observed under the fourth scenario with a 15 chance of exceeding the present tp loads when performing fertilizer management the probability of achieving the 60 tp load reduction target is 74 60 and 4 under scenarios 2 3 and 4 respectively which suggests distinctly less non attainment risks with parallel terraces 26 and filter strips 40 compared to fertilizer management 96 notwithstanding the great effectiveness of parallel terraces and filter strips it is barely possible to achieve the 80 tp load reduction target by solely utilizing either of them since the exceedance probability is 1 a mixture of bmps rather than any individual practice is thus required to be put into effect for complying with tougher water quality criteria in this regard scenarios 5 and 6 both display considerable great compliance confidence with the exceedance probability of 92 and 99 for the 80 mitigation target respectively the subtle discrepancy between scenario 5 and scenario 6 with all bmps reinforces the relatively insignificant impacts of fertilization management on tp mitigation the aforementioned analysis of bmp effectiveness showed that parallel terraces are the most effective practice among the candidate bmps with the capability of mitigating the most water sediment and tp loss based on the risk assessment of bmp scenarios we recommend implementing parallel terraces in the first place for early stage aquatic restoration in doing this 60 of the present tp loads can be mitigated with a 74 compliance confidence level filter strips can be used as a follow up supplement measure for a more ambitious environmental target which together with parallel terraces are adequate for reducing the majority of tp loads 80 at a sufficient confidence level 92 our findings suggest that future bmp planning exercises to improve the prevailing water quality conditions will only be insightful if we consider non attainment risks for nutrient loading reduction goals which is helpful to enhance decision robustness a rigorous evaluation of the remediation efforts by jointly taking into account interactions among watershed processes uncertain stressors and bmp effectiveness is essential for prudential bmp planning the bayesian nature of our ph bbn modeling framework explicitly renders answers to the question of the decision reliability under the disturbance of uncertain stressors and as such could effectively guide the implementation of bmps the establishment of compliance rules such as 80 compliance confidence of reaching the nutrient load reduction goals is an essential step for the restoration of aquatic systems the graphical representation of ph bbns offers a new opportunity to facilitate the participation of stakeholders in the modeling and inference process the visualized interactions between watershed processes and the relevant anthropogenic natural stressors allow intuitive insight into complex watershed systems in addition the ph bbn model is a valuable tool to support adaptive watershed management based on learning while doing more empirical evidence supplied with ongoing monitoring could be embedded in the ph bbn framework to update the understanding of watershed responses to the ever changing external stressors our sensitivity analysis of uncertain stressors is helpful to prioritize the activities of monitoring and information collection the ph bbn modeling framework can be easily customized to uncertainty based bmp planning in other regions while network construction may vary among different watersheds for instance parallel terraces are promising bmps for our study area located in yunnan guizhou plateau with steep slopes however they are usually not applicable in plain regions the target contaminant critical watershed processes and candidate bmps should be site specifically re examined further improvement can be performed by engaging various stakeholders incorporating more predictors and external stressors of concern or integrating ph bbns with dynamic programming approaches for long term adaptive bmp optimization under climate change 5 conclusion 1 the calibration and validation results indicate that the ph bbns are capable to reproduce the effects of uncertain parameters weather variability and bmps on watershed projections with swat with rmse values varying between 0 01 and 0 62 the ph bnn modeling framework can thus render decision support as a reliable surrogate of swat for bmp planning with great predictive capacity 2 ph bbn projections of surface runoff depths sediment loads and tp loads are subject to great uncertainty distinct impacts of uncertain weather conditions and swat parameters on watershed predictors were observed in different landscapes the forecast uncertainties of sediment and tp loads were relatively larger in areas with steep slopes 3 precipitation was found to be the most influencing factor accounting for 80 of the predictive variability which highlights watershed vulnerability to climate change cn2 is the most sensitive swat parameter whereas the other parameters i e usle p usle k and erorgp have slight impacts on watershed projections 4 the effectiveness of candidate bmps is ranked as parallel terraces filter strips fertilization management while the benefit can be masked by climate change the fertilizer reduction practice is still justified which can reduce tp loads given all other conditions being equal these bmps are projected to be less effective in wetter weather conditions bmps should be conservatively designed to cope with the decline in bmp efficiency caused by increases in rainfall intensity 5 parallel terraces reducing 60 of the present tp loads with 74 compliance confidence are recommended with the highest implementation priority implementation of both parallel terraces and filter strips is projected to reduce 80 of tp loads at a considerable confidence level 92 while it is barely possible to achieve this target by solely implementing either one 6 the ph bbn modeling framework can i explicitly reveal the decision reliability of bmps under manifold uncertainties ii visualize the interactions among watershed processes and drivers and iii support adaptive watershed management based on learning while doing the modeling framework can be customized to uncertainty based bmp planning in other regions as well credit
